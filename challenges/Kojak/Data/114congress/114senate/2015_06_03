Mr. President, over the past several years, we have seen a \nvery disturbing practice which is becoming commonplace in the \nRepublican-dominated U.S. Congress. Governing by brinkmanship, \nmanufactured crisis, flirting with deadlines, a game of chicken--we can \ncall it whatever we want, but Republicans are doing it. Governing by \ncrisis is a modus operandi of the modern Republican Party. We saw it in \n2011, as the newly elected Republican majority in the House pushed the \nU.S. Government to the threshold of shutdown and default, and again \nwith the so-called fiscal cliff in 2012--financial brinkmanship for our \nwhole country--and then, of course, the infamous government shutdown \nthat actually did occur in 2013, and it occurred over a period of \nseveral weeks and was devastating to our economy.\n  But since the Republicans assumed control of the Senate earlier this \nyear, the brinkmanship in the Halls of the Capitol has become \nunbearable. Recall what happened this past February. ISIS had just \nburned a man alive in a cage. We saw that. The world saw that. The \ntragic Charlie Hebdo shooting had just occurred a month earlier in \nFrance, and that spilled over into Belgium, where more people were \nkilled. Belgium authorities were making sweeping arrests of terror \ncells, and ISIS was threatening us in our homeland. Three Brooklyn men \nwere arrested for trying to join ISIS here in our homeland. Yet, in \nthis tumultuous environment, Senate Republicans brought the American \nGovernment within hours of a shutdown of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. This is a Cabinet-level office that was created during the \nBush administration, the Agency responsible for the safety of each \nAmerican in our homeland. It was stunning.\n  But even more stunning is the fact that they keep doing it over and \nover again. This past week, it happened with the expiration of the \nimportant PATRIOT Act provisions. A few Senators wanted to offer some \namendments on that legislation. That is all it was--amendments. In \nfact, on the Friday night of the debate, one Senator said: I will take \ntwo amendments. We on this side agreed--two amendments. Nope. Can't do \nthat. And so, again, brinkmanship. The PATRIOT Act is a law that helps \nkeep terrorists from attacking America. Would it have been asking too \nmuch to have a little bit of time to debate this issue? We were not \ngiven that time.\n  The Republican leadership knew for years that these programs were \nscheduled to expire on June 1, 2015. People who didn't like this act--\nand there were a number of them--gave speeches all over the country \ntalking about the act. It was no secret that the act was not that \npopular in some people's minds.\n  Last year, Senator McConnell knew this deadline was looming when he \nprevented the Senate from debating another version of the USA FREEDOM \nAct by conducting one of their hundreds of filibusters stopping \nPresident Obama's efforts. And the majority leader knew a month ago \nthat the deadline was coming and chose to prioritize other legislation \nover these critical programs. So what happened? The authority for these \nsensitive programs expired.\n  Yesterday, we passed the USA FREEDOM Act, reestablishing these \nimportant terror-fighting provisions with some improvements in them. \nBut for 2 days, America had its guard down. Every minute that passed \nfrom that lapse to passage of the USA FREEDOM Act was an unnecessary \ngamble with our national security. And for what? What did the \nRepublicans achieve by letting these provisions lapse?\n  This is no way to govern--using legislative deadlines as some kind of \nransom, staggering from one catastrophe to another.\n  Now on the horizon are two more important deadlines for legislation \nthat is important to the American people--the Export-Import Bank and \nthe Federal highway program. And what are we\n\n[[Page S3636]]\n\ndoing? We are not doing these measures; we are on a bill that the \nPresident said he is going to veto. The Export-Import Bank expires at \nthe end of this month, which is just a few weeks from now.\n  The Bank creates jobs by providing loans and loan guarantees to \nforeign customers who purchase American exports. This year alone, the \nExport-Import Bank supported 165,000 American jobs--165,000 jobs. What \ndoes it cost the American taxpayer? Zero. Nothing. In fact, it makes \nmoney for our country. Over the last 10 years, the Bank has returned \nmore than $7 billion to the Treasury.\n  The majority leader should bring the Bank's reauthorization to the \nSenate floor for a vote before the charter expires at the end of this \nmonth, but it appears that is not going to happen. The senior Senator \nfrom Texas is already saying the Republicans have no intention of \nmeeting that deadline. Instead, the American people will have to endure \nanother manufactured crisis at the hands of Senate Republicans. Should \nwe also assume the majority leader will do the same with the Federal \nhighway program, which expires at the end of July? The Senate also \nfaces a looming deadline for that program. It is critical that we craft \na long-term solution to America's crumbling roads, highways, bridges, \nand rail systems.\n  Just a few miles from here, we have the Memorial Bridge. It is a \nbeautiful bridge. It was built in the 1930s. The Memorial Bridge \nconnects the Arlington National Cemetery to the Lincoln Memorial and \nthe Mall. It is one of the busiest bridges in the whole DC area. Each \nday, 68,000 cars and buses cross that bridge, along with countless \npedestrians and bicyclists.\n  Last week, Federal officials announced they will be shutting down two \nlanes of the bridge to repair the bridge, which is structurally \ndeficient, which was caused by a number of problems, not the least of \nwhich is corrosion due to all of the moisture we have here. That is a \nproblem we have with everything. And the problems, just minutes from \nthe Capitol, are a daily reality for millions of Americans.\n  The Memorial Bridge is just one of the 64,000 structurally deficient \nbridges throughout our country. The people in Minnesota understand what \nthis means. They had a bridge collapse, and 30-some people died as a \nresult of that. That happened recently.\n  How long will we wait to fix these problems? What will it take before \nRepublicans get serious about a solution to our crumbling highways, \nrailroads, and bridges?\n  We understand. Democrats understand the urgency of the crisis facing \nour country, and we are ready to work with Republicans to rebuild our \nbridges, roads, and railway systems. We understand that investing in \nour surface transportation, including rail, can be a job creator and \neconomy booster. For every $1 billion we spend on these roads, bridges, \nand rail systems, we employ 47,500 high-paying jobs and many other \nlesser paying jobs.\n\n  Before we left for recess a couple of weeks ago, we passed a short-\nterm extension for the surface transportation programs. That is the \n33rd time we have done that. Now that we are back in session, there \nappears to be no urgency from the Senate Republicans to schedule \ncommittee hearings, mark up the bill or to make the highway trust fund \nsolvent.\n  Once again it seems the majority leader is content to let another \nvital program lapse, regardless of the harm it does or the American \njobs he puts at risk.\n  How many more of these manufactured crises must the American people \nendure? How many more times would the majority leader let another vital \nprogram lapse regardless of the harm it does? It is imperative that \nRepublicans not continue their assault on job creation in America. We \nshould not let the Export-Import Bank or the Federal highway program \nexpire, losing the millions of American jobs they create and sustain. \nIt is beyond belief that on these two important legislative matters, \nRepublicans will not help the American people with instant job \ncreation. In the past, these two issues were never handled this way. \nThe Export-Import Bank had three of its biggest cheerleaders: Reagan, \nBush, and Bush. That is not the way it is anymore. The highway bill \nused to pass every 5 or 6 years, and it would be extended for 5 or 6 \nyears. Until the Republicans changed the way the Senate operates, we \nused to pass these bills easily--but not now. We are having to address \nmultiple short-term extensions each year and it seems every few months. \nThis will be, as I indicated earlier, the 33rd short-term extension for \nthe Federal highway program. This is not legislating. This is \nRepublican procrastination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/03/senate-section/article/S3636-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know my good friend, the Democratic \nleader, is frustrated that he is no longer setting the schedule in the \nSenate. He seems to differ with the order of priorities that we deal \nwith things here. Yesterday, he said debating the Defense authorization \nbill was ``a waste of time''--a waste of time to debate the Defense \nauthorization bill in a time of high crisis for our country.\n  Nevertheless, a new majority sets the agenda of the schedule these \ndays. Today, the Senate turns to the consideration of the National \nDefense Authorization Act for 2016--in June, not in December, at the \nend of the year, in a situation in which no amendments are allowed.\n  This legislation, which authorizes funds and sets out policy for our \nmilitary annually, is always important, but it is especially important \nnow, given the multitude of threats that challenge us as a nation; for \ninstance, the aggressive rise of ISIL, Iran's ambitions for regional \nhegemony and its accompanying quest for nuclear weapons, and both \nChinese and Russian efforts to erode American influence and assert \ndomination over their neighbors. It is also important, given the need \nto start thinking about preparing our armed services for the many \nglobal threats the next President will confront the day he or she takes \noffice.\n  The reality is we have left behind the era of when Americans could \nwithdraw from conflict overseas and escape to the comfort and security \nprovided by vast oceans and isolation. We have lost the luxury of \nbuilding our forces years after a war has begun. Most important, the \nsimple tradeoff of guns versus butter, drawing down our conventional \nforces, hollowing them out, and standing behind our nuclear arsenal \ndoes not suit the strategic challenges we now face. We can no longer \nignore ungoverned spaces. We have left the Cold War long behind. \nTradeoffs have become more difficult to accomplish, and they require \ngreater strategic thought than the President has provided, and we have \nseen the resilience of the terrorist threat.\n  Senator McCain, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, is a \nman with the depth of experience to understand the need to modernize, \nrefit, and prepare our military for the threats and operations in the \ncoming years. Thankfully, for the Senate, he is also a man with vision \nto craft a bill that could put us on a path to address those \nchallenges--legislation that could help equip the next President with \nadequate capabilities to address threats from adversaries like Russia, \nChina, ISIL, and Al Qaeda, not to mention the unforeseen challenges \nthat inevitably arise. That is just the course this Defense \nauthorization bill proposes to put us on--the correct course. I would \nlike to commend Senator McCain, not just for crafting this bill but for \nworking closely with Members of both parties to steer it through \ncommittee with overwhelming bipartisan support.\n  This legislation proposes to do a lot of things, but fundamentally it \nis premised on a commonsense idea that we should cut waste and redirect \nthat authorized funding to where it is actually needed--such as meeting \nthe needs of the men and women who put everything on the line--\neverything--to keep us safe.\n  In a time when missions are in imbalance with resources for a \nmilitary that has already had to endure too many cuts in recent years, \nit just makes sense to do things such as taking on a growing \nbureaucracy in the Pentagon to make it more efficient and effective,\n\n[[Page S3637]]\n\nworking toward reforming the way our military purchases weapons and \nequipment, and improving and modernizing the military retirement system \nin order to secure greater value and choice for servicemembers.\n  Overall, this bill authorizes about $10 billion in savings for actual \nmilitary needs. These authorities will allow for improvements in the \ntraining and capability of our forces, and they will help us develop \nnew technologies to maintain superiority on the battlefield. Our \nconstituents stand to benefit from many of the provisions in this bill \nas well.\n  For instance, Kentuckians will be glad to know this legislation would \nauthorize a new Special Forces facility at Fort Campbell. They will \nalso be glad to hear it will authorize construction projects and an \nimportant new medical clinic at Fort Knox--an initiative I have \nchampioned literally for years.\n  It is no wonder why so many Democrats joined Republicans to support \nthis bill on the floor of the House of Representatives or why they \njoined Republicans in the Armed Services Committee to pass this bill on \nan overwhelming bipartisan basis, too, which of course is the \ntradition, both of that committee and of the Senate as a whole.\n  Now we need to keep the momentum going because this defense policy \nbill cannot fall hostage to partisan politics. Too much is at stake.\n  We just heard more partisan saber rattling from the White House \nyesterday, which is now threatening to block a pay raise for our troops \nunless Congress first agrees to spend billions more pumping up bloated \nbureaucracies like the IRS. That is despite the fact that the funding \nlevel in this bill is exactly--exactly--the same as what President \nObama requested in his budget. Let me say that again. The funding level \nin this bill is exactly what President Obama requested in his budget--\n$612 billion.\n  As I said earlier, the Democratic leader appeared to go even further, \nessentially saying that voting to support the men and women who protect \nus is now ``just a waste of time.'' It is just a waste of time, \naccording to the Democratic leader, to be debating the bill about the \nmen and women who protect us. The assumption, I guess, is his party \nisn't getting its way on other partisan demands completely unrelated to \nthe bill, so they want to punish the men and women of our military.\n  Look, we understand that some of our Democratic friends might be so \ndetermined to increase spending for Washington's bureaucracies that to \nachieve it they would even risk support for our men and women in \nuniform in the face of so many global threats. I certainly don't love \nevery aspect of the Budget Control Act, especially the effects we have \nseen on the defense side in hindering our ability to modernize the \nforce and meet the demand of current operations. But to deny brave \nservicemembers the benefits they have earned putting everything on the \nline for each one of us, for these partisan reasons, would be \nprofoundly unfair to our troops.\n  Blocking this bill is not in the national interest. So let's skip the \npartisan games and start working toward commonsense reforms, as this \nbill proposes. Let's work together to pass the best Defense \nauthorization bill possible.\n\n  I urge Members of both parties who want to offer amendments to go \nahead and do so and then work with the bill managers to get them \nmoving. We have that opportunity this year because we returned to the \nregular order and because we are considering the NDAA at the \nappropriate time in the session, rather than at the very last minute \nwith little time for thoughtful consideration of amendments, as had \nbecome the unfortunate norm under the previous majority. This positive \nturn is another credit to Senator McCain's leadership.\n  Of course, no Defense authorization bill will ever be perfect, but \nthis legislation reflects a good-faith effort to authorize programs in \nthe political reality in which we live today. It is bipartisan reform \nlegislation that proposes to root out waste, improve our military \ncapabilities, support the brave Americans who protect us, and make \npreparations for challenges, both foreseeable and unforeseeable, in the \nyears ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/03/senate-section/article/S3637-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week, our Nation observed Memorial \nDay. We paid tribute to the sacrifices so many Americans have made to \npreserve our freedom. Also, last week, while Members were back home, \nthe Obama administration snuck out a new rule that takes away freedom \nfrom Americans all across the country.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency released the final version of a \nnew rule that will dramatically increase the agency's power and will \ndevastate Americans' ability to use their own property and their own \nwater. With this rule, President Obama's Environmental Protection \nAgency overreaches and ignores the American public. The rule is an \nattempt to change the definition of what the Clean Water Act calls \nwaters of the United States.\n  There is bipartisan agreement that Washington bureaucrats have gone \nway beyond their authority with this new regulation. They have written \nthis rule so broadly and with so much uncertainty that it is not clear \nif there are any limits on this Agency's power.\n  I agree with what the chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee has to say. He wrote it in an op-ed that appeared yesterday. \nSenator Inhofe, chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nsaid:\n\n       Not only does this final rule break promises EPA has made, \n     but it claims federal powers even beyond what EPA originally \n     proposed a year ago. This will drastically affect--for the \n     worse--the ability of many Americans to use and enjoy their \n     property.\n\n  This rule gives the Agency broad control over things such as any area \nwithin 4,000 feet of a navigable water or a tributary. Then, it defines \ntributaries to include any place where you can see an ``ordinary high \nwater mark'' on what looks like--on what looks like--it was once the \nbank of a creek body of water--what looks like, not what is but what \nlooks like.\n  Under the rule, the Environmental Protection Agency can regulate \nsomething as waters of the United States if it falls in a 100-year \nfloodplain of a navigable water--not a navigable water but anything \nwithin a 100-year floodplain of a navigable water. The rule says the \nAgency has to find a ``significant nexus'' to navigable water.\n  What is a significant nexus to the EPA? Well, the Agency gets to make \nup its own definition. They say it includes something as simple as \nfinding that the water provides--get this--``life cycle dependent \naquatic habitat'' for a species that spends part of its time in a \nnavigable water.\n  All of these terms are things that Washington bureaucrats are \ndefining for themselves. They decide for themselves that they have the \nauthority.\n  Let's say your property is within 4,000 feet of anything the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency decides is a tributary and your \nproperty has a natural pond or some standing water after heavy \nrain, and let's say a bird that spends part of its life on the Colorado \nRiver decides to hang out near that natural pond or some standing water \nafter a heavy rain that occurred on your property, under this new \nregulation, the Environmental Protection Agency now has the power to \nregulate what you do on that land.\n\n  It is bad enough that this administration has taken this \nextraordinary step. It is bad enough that it has tried to sneak out its \nrule, hoping that nobody was paying attention over the Memorial Day \ntime at home. There are now reports that the Obama administration may \nhave broken the law. Here\n\n[[Page S3638]]\n\nis what the New York Times reported on May 18 under the headline on the \nfront page: ``Critics Hear E.P.A.'s Voice in `Public Comments.'''\n  This is an article on the front page of the New York Times about the \npublic comments that government agencies have to collect. They have to \ncollect these comments from the public when they propose new \nregulations such as this one that they have done with the waters of the \nUnited States. The comment period is supposed to be an opportunity for \npeople who might be harmed by the rules to have their say.\n  Well, according to this front-page article in the New York Times, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency has twisted the public comment \nrequirements into its own private government-funded spin machine. The \narticle says: ``In a campaign that tests the limits of federal lobbying \nlaw, the agency has orchestrated a drive to counter political \nopposition from Republicans and enlist public support in concert with \nliberal environmental groups and a grass-roots organization aligned \nwith President Obama.''\n  This tests the limits of Federal lobbying law. This government agency \nignored the negative comments by Americans who were concerned about the \nlaw, who were hurt by the law. Then it used taxpayer dollars to lobby \nliberal groups to flood the Agency with positive comments. That is not \nme; that is what is written in the New York Times. These were the same \nphony, ginned-up comments it used to justify the dramatic overreach of \nits new regulations.\n  It is incredible. It is unacceptable. I believe it is illegal. The \nEnvironmental Protection Agency would rather skew public comments in \nits favor than acknowledge the real concerns that Americans and Members \nof Congress have with this destructive rule. These are the concerns of \nfarmers, of ranchers, of hard-working families, and of small businesses \nall across the country.\n  There was an interesting column in U.S. News & World Report last \nFriday. The headline says: ``Stop Terrorizing Main Street.'' The column \ntalked about the damage that all this redtape can do to small \nbusinesses. It says:\n\n       When the EPA jumps up and yells `boo', entrepreneurs \n     cringe. They withdraw. They feel anxious and reconsider plans \n     to start or expand a business. This is bad for our economy.\n\n  This is hurting our country. Well, I believe they are exactly right. \nThat is what Washington does with the uncertainty and the overreach of \nrules such as this one. It is bad for the economy. It does nothing to \nimprove the quality of our water or the quality of life.\n  There is universal agreement in this country that we should protect \nAmerica's navigable waters. There is also bipartisan agreement on the \nbest ways for Washington to help to do that. This is not just \nRepublicans against President Obama. This is Republicans and Democrats \nworking to protect America's waterways and President Obama working, \ninstead, to expand the power of unelected and unaccountable \nbureaucrats.\n  Here is how the newspaper The Hill reported it last Thursday with an \narticle with this headline: ``Democrats buck Obama on water rule.'' The \narticle says: ``Dozens of Congressional Democrats are joining \nRepublicans to back legislation blocking the Obama administration's new \nrule to redefine its jurisdiction over the nation's waterways.''\n  Now, it is talking about my bill, a bill called the Federal Water \nQuality Protection Act. The bill has 30 cosponsors in the Senate--\nDemocrats and Republicans alike. A similar bill in the House actually \npassed with the support of 24 Democrats and every Republican. So what \ndoes the administration have to say to the dozens of Democrats in \nCongress, to the 24 Democrats who voted against the administration, to \nthe millions of Americans who are concerned about this new regulation?\n  Well, according to the article in The Hill, President Obama's top \nenvironmental adviser said of the Democrats who voted for this: ``The \nonly people with reason to oppose the rule are polluters.'' So the \nPresident believes that the 24 Democrats who voted to support it and \nthe Democrats in the Senate who cosponsored my legislation are \npolluters who want to threaten our clean water. That is what the White \nHouse thinks of these Democrats in Congress. That is what the White \nHouse thinks of anyone who dares to suggest that this rule is \nbureaucratic overreach. That is such arrogance.\n  Well, there are a lot of Americans--Democrats and Republicans--who \nare not going to be intimidated by the Obama administration's power \ngrab or its name-calling. The Obama administration has ignored the \nstrong bipartisan consensus against this rule. It has once again taken \nits own radical approach. Instead of moving forward with a rule that \nfails to represent the interests of many Americans, we should act \nimmediately to pass this bipartisan Federal Water Quality Protection \nAct. This legislation says yes to clean water and no to extreme \nbureaucracy.\n  It will protect America's waterways, while keeping Washington's hands \noff of the things that it really has no business regulating. The \nEnvironmental Protection Agency would have to consult with the States \nto make sure that we have the approach that works best everywhere--not \njust the approach that Washington likes best. They would not be able to \njust listen to the echo chamber of phony comments concocted by their \nown lobbying campaign.\n  Now, this bill gives certainty and clarity to farmers, to hard-\nworking ranchers, to small business owners and their families. It makes \nsure that people can continue to enjoy the beautiful rivers and the \nlakes. They should be preserved and protected. This bipartisan bill \nprotects Americans from runaway bureaucracy--unaccountable, unelected. \nIt restores Washington's attention to the traditional waters that were \nalways the focus before.\n  The American people do not need more bureaucratic overreach. We do \nnot need more redtape. Congress should act immediately to stop this \noutrageous regulation before it goes into effect. The Senate should \ntake up and pass this bipartisan Federal Water Quality Protection Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton).

Mr. President, it was 3 years ago this month in June of \n2012 that President Obama established the Deferred Action for Childhood \nArrivals, known as DACA, that provides temporary--underline the word \n``temporary''--legal status to immigrant students who arrived in the \nUnited States as children.\n  DACA is based on the DREAM Act, a bill I introduced 14 years ago, to \ngive undocumented students who grow up in this country a chance to earn \ntheir citizenship. These young people have come to be known as \nDREAMers, and this has become a term of art that is used now across the \nUnited States to capsulize the immigration dilemma we face.\n  While this DACA Program by President Obama has been an amazing \nsuccess, more than 600,000 of these DREAMers have come forward, paid \nthe filing fee, submitted themselves for background checks, and are now \ntemporarily living in America, going to school and working. DACA has \nallowed these DREAMers to become part of our country as they strive for \neducation in engineering, education in business--just about every \nprofession you can think of.\n  This policy of giving people a chance to be part of America's future \nunfortunately infuriates my Republican colleagues. They have tried over \nand over and over again to stop the DREAMers,\n\n[[Page S3639]]\n\nto deport the DREAMers. I don't understand it.\n  President Obama established this new program called DAPA to build on \nDACA's success, which allows their parents, under certain \ncircumstances, to stay in the United States on a temporary basis. Under \nthe President's second program, DAPA, undocumented immigrants who have \nlived in the United States at least 5 years and have American children \nare required to come forward, pay a filing fee, register with the \ngovernment, pass a criminal and national security background check, and \nthen pay their fair share of taxes. Those are the conditions. If they \nviolate any of them, they are subject to deportation.\n  If the government determines that these parents have not committed \nany serious crimes, do not pose any threat to our safety, this new \nExecutive order says, on a temporary basis, they will not be targeted \nfor deportation.\n  I have seen this in Chicago, and I have seen it around Illinois. Many \npeople think the undocumented live in a household full of undocumented \npeople. That is almost never the case.\n  What I found over and over again is that perhaps one parent, usually \nthe mother, is undocumented--the father, a citizen; kids born in \nAmerica, citizens; the mother, undocumented. Are we really safer as a \nnation to break up that family and deport the mother if she is no \nthreat to this country? I don't think so.\n  DAPA was scheduled to go into effect last month. That is what \nPresident Obama had hoped for--and I joined him--but it didn't. Why? \nBecause some Republican Governors and attorneys general have filed a \nlawsuit to block this new program.\n  The Supreme Court has been clear that Presidents have the authority \nto set Federal immigration enforcement priorities. I am confident all \nof the President's decisions in this matter will be upheld. It is hard \nfor me to understand or explain why the Republicans are so determined \nto stop any reform of our broken immigration system. For years, \nRepublicans in Congress have refused to even consider legislation to \nfix our broken immigration system.\n  I spent a good part of my life, 6 months or more, working in a \nbipartisan group to write an immigration reform bill for Democrats, for \nRepublicans. We brought it to the floor of the Senate. It passed with \n68 votes. Fourteen Republicans, virtually all of the Democrats voted \nfor it. It really addressed every aspect of immigration. Parts of it I \ndidn't like, but overall it was a very good and balanced bill.\n  When it came to the floor, the Republicans said: Wait a minute. No \nimmigration reform until you get tough at the border.\n  Well, the record says and shows we are already pretty tough at the \nborder. Illegal immigration is down dramatically. But in an effort to \nmake this bipartisan, we agreed to even more enforcement at the border. \nThink about this for a second. Today, there are more Federal law \nenforcement agents on our border with Mexico than the combined total of \nall Federal law enforcement agents in every other agency, and we \nincreased it in this comprehensive immigration bill. So the argument \nthat we are not getting tough at the border is kind of hard to make. We \npassed the bill with 68 votes. We sent it to the House 2 years ago. \nWhat did the House do? Absolutely nothing--they refused to call the \nbill. They refused to call any version of the bill. They refused to \ncall their own bill. They refused to even debate the issue of \nimmigration.\n\n  Everyone acknowledges our immigration system needs to be improved and \nchanged. They wouldn't even take up the issue. And now, when the \nPresident tries, on a temporary basis, to say: I am not going to deport \nthe mother in a family where everyone else is an American citizen or I \nam not going to deport children who were brought here at the age of 2, \nwho have grown up in America and simply want to be part of our future, \nthe Republicans have said: We will fight you to the death. We will \nchallenge you in every court in the land. We want to deport these \npeople.\n  What I have found is that it is best for Members of Congress, the \nSenate, and the American public to meet some of the individuals who are \nthe target of these high emotions and negative feelings on the \nRepublican side. I want to introduce one of them today.\n  This is Jean-Yannick Diouf. When he was 8 years old, his father, a \ndiplomat from the African country of Senegal, brought his family to the \nUnited States. Unfortunately, Yannick's parents separated and Yannick's \nfather returned to Senegal, leaving him and the rest of his family \nbehind. Yannick was too young to even realize it at the time--he was \njust a little kid--but when his father left the United States, he lost \nhis legal status to live in this country.\n  Yannick grew up in Montgomery County, MD. In high school, he was a \nmember of the National Honor Society. He volunteered weekly at a \nhomeless shelter. He organized soccer tournaments for 3 years to raise \nmoney for the Red Cross for Haiti earthquake relief.\n  After high school, Yannick wanted to continue his education. But \nremember, if you are undocumented in this country, you don't qualify \nfor a penny when it comes to Federal assistance--no Pell grants, no \nFederal Government loans. So he went to Montgomery College, a junior \ncollege, and earned an associate's degree in business. He was on the \ndean's list.\n  Yannick then transferred to the University of Maryland, College Park. \nAgain, he had to pay for it all. There was no government assistance \nsince he is undocumented. He is working now on a bachelor's degree in \nbusiness management. He runs the Achievers Mentoring Program. It is an \nafter-school program to advise middle and high school students on how \nto get into college.\n  Yannick is also a volunteer for United We Dream, the largest \norganization of undocumented young people such as himself in this \ncountry. He was a leader of the campaign to pass the Maryland DREAM \nAct, which allows Maryland residents who are undocumented to pay in-\nState tuition. That is the only break he can get, and it comes from the \nState.\n  Keep in mind that Yannick is undocumented. So he doesn't qualify for \nany financial aid from the Federal Government. Yet he is trying to make \na life. Here is what he said in a letter:\n\n       DACA means dignity. More than making money, having a job \n     gives you dignity and self-respect. I want to work for what I \n     have. I don't look to anyone for pity. People should judge me \n     based on what I do and what I stand for, not based on status. \n     I want to be given a chance to prove that not only am I a \n     functioning member of society, I am here to serve and share \n     my talents with those in my community.\n\n  Earlier this year, Yannick was one of six DREAMers who met with the \nPresident of the United States in the Oval Office. Here is what the \nPresident said after he met with Yannick and the other five. He said:\n\n       I don't think there's anybody in America who's had a chance \n     to talk to these six young people who wouldn't find it in \n     their heart to say these kids are Americans just like us, and \n     they belong here, and we want to do right by them.\n\n  Well, I think President Obama is right. Yannick and the other \nDREAMers have so much to contribute to our country. But sadly, \nRepublicans in Congress have a different agenda. They want to shut down \nDACA, which allows this young man to go to school in the only country \nhe has ever known, and they want to shut down the DAPA Program, which \nthe President has instituted to try to protect the parents of those who \nhave been here at least 5 years.\n  If they have their way, this young man will be deported to Senegal, a \ncountry where he hasn't lived since he was a little boy. Will America \nbe better, if we get rid of folks such as him? Will it be a better \ncountry if we tear families apart? I don't think so.\n  Instead of trying to deport DREAMers and moms and dads, congressional \nRepublicans should work with us to pass a comprehensive immigration \nreform bill to fix our broken immigration system. The estimates are \nwide-ranging as to how many young people there are in America like \nYannick. Some say 1.5 million. Some say 2.5 million. I have met so many \nof them.\n  It wasn't that long ago that we had a bill on the floor of the \nSenate, and that entire Gallery was filled with young DREAMers. They \ncame wearing caps and gowns--that was their decision--to make the point \nthat they are students--students who are learning and trying to improve \ntheir lives to be better and to be a better part of America.\n\n[[Page S3640]]\n\nThat bill was defeated that day. It broke my heart. I went to meet with \nthem afterwards, and I said to them: Don't give up. Don't give up on \nme, because I am not giving up on you.\n  I got started on this battle 15 years ago--15 years ago--when I met a \nyoung Korean girl in Chicago who was brought here at the age of 2 and \nwho was a musical prodigy. She had been accepted at the Juilliard \nSchool of music, the Manhattan conservatory of music, but she was \nafraid she couldn't go. She was undocumented. Her mom and dad brought \nher here to this country at the age of 2, and they never filed the \npapers.\n  She grew up in a very poor family, but she went into the Merit Music \nProgram in Chicago and became an accomplished musician. It was because \nof her that I started and introduced the DREAM Act.\n  There is good news. She went on to the Manhattan conservatory of \nmusic. A generous family in Chicago paid for it because she couldn't \nget any assistance.\n  She married a young man, became an American citizen, and played in \nCarnegie Hall. She is now pursuing her Ph.D. in music. Is America \nbetter because of that? Yes, it is. I have no doubt that it is.\n  Those who don't see the promise in the eyes of these young people and \ndon't see what they can bring to America have forgotten who we are. We \nare a nation of immigrants. We are a nation that has allowed young \npeople such as these a chance to succeed.\n  One of them happened to be my mother. My mother was brought here at \nthe age of 2 by a mother who didn't speak English. My mother grew up in \nthis country and raised a family, and I was one of the kids. Here I \nstand on the floor of the Senate. That is my story. That is my family's \nstory. It is America's story.\n  The people who show such loathing for these young people and what \nthey mean to us have forgotten that. They have ignored that. Let's \nrekindle our faith in what makes America great--our diversity, the \nambition of young people such as Yannick, and the determination of our \ngeneration to open a door to give them a chance to prove themselves to \nmake us better. That is what we are called on to do.\n  All the petty politics aside, we are talking about human lives and \nabout an opportunity for this young man and so many others to prove to \nus what they can do for the future of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/03/senate-section/article/S3640-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3640-S3641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXPORT-IMPORT BANK REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if you had to characterize the current \nCongress with one symbol, I would tell you what I think it should be: \nan extension cord--you know what I mean?--an extension cord you use at \nhome if the plug doesn't quite reach the outlet.\n  Why would I pick an extension cord? Because this year, under the \nleadership in Congress, all we have been doing is extending things a \nlittle bit--just a little bit--when we have to.\n  The Department of Homeland Security appropriation, one of the most \nimportant when it comes to the security and safety of the United \nStates, had to be extended and extended and extended, sadly because \nmany in the House wanted to fight the battle of immigration over that \nbill. Eventually, we prevailed and passed the appropriation after \nextension and after extension.\n  Then 2 weeks ago, here on the floor of the Senate, we extended the \nFederal highway trust fund. What is that? That is a fund where we \ncollect gas taxes every time a gallon of gas is purchased and put it in \na fund and then build highways and bridges. We count on that. It used \nto be a glorious program.\n  The inspiration for that program was President Dwight David \nEisenhower. In the 1950s, President Eisenhower, who had come back from \nleading America to victory in World War II, remembered what he saw. He \nsaw in Europe, particularly in Germany, an amazing highway system that \ndid not exist in the United States. So President Eisenhower said: We \nneed an interstate highway system in America. It was a bold idea--that \nthe Federal Government would lead in creating an interstate highway \nsystem to link every corner of our Nation.\n  There is not a State that I know of, certainly not in my State, where \nthe interstate highway system hasn't had a dramatic positive impact on \nthe economy. So with the Federal highway trust fund, we built the \ninterstate highway system, we extended the highway system, and now we \nare in the process of making bridges safer, making certain the highways \nare extended where they need to be to keep businesses thriving and to \ncreate new businesses and jobs in America.\n  But along comes a group in Congress, a conservative group, that says \nthis is all wrong. Some of them question whether the Federal Government \nshould even have a role in transportation. For them, I have three \nwords: Dwight David Eisenhower, Republican President, who showed the \nway. Some say it is just impossible to figure out how to fund the \nbuilding of highways. Well, we have done pretty well so far with the \nFederal gas tax that is collected. Clearly, we need to look to other \nforms of revenue. But do we need to give up on the Federal highway \nprogram?\n  Two weeks ago on the floor of the Senate we had the 33rd short-term \nextension of that program. What it means is we extended it this time \nfor 60 days.\n  The Federal highway program used to be a 6-year program. Why was it 6 \nyears? Think about the planning, the engineering, acquiring land and \nbuilding a highway. You can't do it in 60 days, not 6 months, not even \nin a year. You have to have a commitment of funds that are coming back \nto the States. In my State, in Illinois, about 75 percent of all the \nhighway construction comes from Federal funds. So when we do short-term \nextensions, it really says to the States that they can't count on us.\n  This money will run out at the end of July. Maybe we will extend it \nagain, maybe we won't. Is that any way to run a nation? Is that any way \nto run a transportation system--again, using the extension cord \nexample, this time for 60 days?\n  Just a week or so ago, we had another effort on the floor of the \nSenate here to extend the PATRIOT Act--FISA--which keeps America safe \nand gives us the power to ferret out those who threaten us. The \nsuggestion was made by the majority leader that we extend it for a few \ndays--a few days. This has become a pattern, and it is a troubling \npattern.\n  One aspect of this that is particularly troublesome is that at the \nend of June, unless there is a sincere bipartisan effort, we are going \nto lose the Export-Import Bank. I have heard a lot of speeches in the \nSenate about how the United States businesses, especially small \nbusinesses, are really the backbone of our economy. Oh, we all give \nthose speeches. As these businesses grow and expand, they often look to \nforeign exports.\n  We know that every $1 billion in new export sales supports at least \n6,000 new jobs in this country. So every opportunity to export U.S. \nproducts helps communities and families. The primary Federal program \nthat allows most of these very small businesses to export is about to \nexpire. It is about to expire at the end of this month.\n  The Export-Import Bank provides financing insurance so that U.S. \ncompanies, many of them very small, can compete in the global economy. \nHere is how it works. The Export-Import Bank makes loans to firms \nexporting American-made goods. This allows businesses, including 3,340 \nsmall businesses across the United States, to sell their goods and \nservices to businesses all over the world. They support about 164,000 \njobs.\n  More than 100 of these companies are located in Illinois, and more \nthan 80 of them are small. The Export-Import Bank supports $27.4 \nbillion in exports. And guess what. It doesn't cost the taxpayers a \npenny. It actually makes money--money that is returned to the U.S. \nTreasury for other purposes or to reduce our debt. Over the past two \ndecades--20 years--the Export-Import Bank has returned $7 billion to \nthe U.S. Treasury. It is a moneymaker. It goes directly to deficit \nreduction.\n  One of the companies the Bank helped is the NOW Health Group in \nBloomingdale, IL. It is a natural food and supplement manufacturer with \n640 employees, 35 of whom work in exports. According to their chief \noperating officer, Jim Emme, ``the flexibility in the payment terms we \ncan offer through\n\n[[Page S3641]]\n\nour Export Import Bank policy has allowed us to grow our business in \nexisting markets as well as open new ones.''\n  This company has grown its exports from 2 percent of its business to \nmore than 10 percent. They could not have done it without the Export-\nImport Bank.\n  There are thousands of stories just like that all over the United \nStates.\n  I am a cosponsor of Senator Shaheen's bill that would increase the \nlending cap for the Bank to $160 billion and reauthorize it through \n2021--not these short-term, 30-day, 60-day, 6-month extensions we have \nseen under this leadership in Congress.\n  In the past, reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank was a bipartisan measure. \nRepublicans used to support it as much as Democrats. But now there is a \nsmall group of Republicans, inspired by the Heritage Foundation, who \nhave decided: Let's put an end to this Bank. Let's put an end to the \nopportunity for small businesses to hire Americans and export goods \noverseas.\n  Their hatred of government blinds them to the reality of this Bank \nand the thousands of jobs that will be lost if they have their way and \neliminate the Ex-Im Bank.\n  They also refuse to recognize that by failing to reauthorize this \nBank, U.S. businesses can't compete with businesses in other countries \nthat will still have access to their own export financing agencies. Do \nyou think China is going to put its export-import bank out of business? \nNo. They just increased its size. Our major competitor has stepped up. \nIn this case, many of the leaders in Congress are stepping back. So we \nare not only hurting ourselves if we can't find a way to go forward.\n  The Bank is set to expire at the end of the month, which is less than \n4 weeks from now. I hope we can come to an agreement by then to pass a \nbill to reauthorize a program that is critically important to U.S. \nexports. I hope reasonable voices in the Republican Party will not \nallow a vocal minority to prevent us from reauthorizing this important \nprogram.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/03/senate-section/article/S3641-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PATRIOT EMPLOYER TAX CREDIT ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as the number of candidates grows for the \noffice of President, we are hearing a lot of proposals for changes in \nthe Tax Code. Many of them are interesting, and some of them are \ndamaging when it comes to working for middle-income families.\n  Sadly, we are seeing a race to the bottom on who can propose the \nlowest corporate tax rate, giving huge breaks to the very companies \nthat shift jobs overseas. Most Americans don't realize this. If you \nwant to move your production from the United States to another country, \nyou can deduct the moving expenses from the taxes you owe America. We \nare subsidizing your decision to pick up and move jobs overseas. \nAmerican workers--some of them are given the sad responsibility to \ntrain the supervisors at the new overseas companies while American \nworkers are checking out their last paychecks.\n  I have a different idea. Instead of rewarding corporations with lower \ntax bills, we should reward those companies in America that maintain \ntheir commitment to this country and its workers and give fair wages \nand benefits to the American workers. We call it the Patriot Employer \nTax Credit Act. It is very basic.\n  When you look at the Tax Code, it is a huge document full of \nincentives and disincentives for businesses. We will reward certain \nthings; we won't reward other things. Well, this is something we should \nconsider rewarding.\n  Senator Sherrod Brown and I have introduced the Patriot Employer Tax \nCredit Act, which would provide a tax credit to American companies that \ntreat American veterans and workers the best. It puts the Tax Code on \nthe side of these companies. These patriot employers would be eligible \nfor a tax credit equal to 10 percent of the first $15,000 of qualified \nwages for American workers, which is about $1,200 per worker.\n  In order to qualify for this tax credit, these companies would have \nto meet five criteria. See if you think, as I do, that these are good \nideas.\n  First, the company has to invest in American jobs. Businesses must \nremain headquartered here in the United States if they have ever been \nheadquartered here before. The company would also have to maintain or \nincrease the number of workers in the United States compared to the \nnumber of workers overseas, and not decrease the number of workers \nthrough the use of contractors. The company can't pick up and leave, \nmove to a foreign capital to avoid paying its fair share of U.S. taxes.\n  First, invest in American jobs located in America.\n  Second, pay fair wages. A patriot employer under our bill would have \nto pay at least 90 percent of its employees $15 an hour. Why do we pick \n$15 an hour? Do the math: $15 an hour, 40 hours a week, about $30,000 a \nyear. Why? Because if you make that amount of money, you qualify for \nvirtually no Federal subsidies, Federal programs. You are earning a \npaycheck and you are supporting your family. If you make less than \nthat, you qualify for Federal Government assistance. So we are saying \nto employers: If you will pay at least $15 an hour, we will give you \nthis tax credit.\n  Third, provide quality health insurance for your employees consistent \nwith the Affordable Care Act.\n  Fourth, help your employees prepare for retirement. We want to reward \ncompanies that offer at least 90 percent of their employees a defined \nbenefit plan, such as a pension plan or a defined contribution plan \nwith decent employer contributions.\n  Fifth, employ a diverse workforce. We want companies to have a plan \nin place to help veterans and people with disabilities. I don't think \nthat is too much to ask. We grab our flags and march in parades as \npoliticians and thank the veterans over and over. Why don't we thank \nthem with a job? And let's reward the companies that do.\n  That is it, five conditions. And with these five conditions, these \npatriotic American companies would get a tax break. Wouldn't it be \nbetter for us to incentivize American companies to do the right thing \nrather than pay the moving expenses for those that want to leave the \ncountry? That is a choice. I think it is pretty simple.\n  I know it can be done because in Skokie, IL, there is a company doing \nit. It is called Block Steel. The company started 100 years ago and has \ngrown to be the largest distributor of aluminized steel in the Nation. \nIt is a family-run business. It has ensured that 77 employees are \ntreated fairly. Each of their employees is paid more than $15 an hour, \nhas good health care, and a good retirement. Block Steel should be \nrewarded for its efforts. Under the Patriot Employer Tax Credit Act, \nBlock Steel could qualify for a tax credit of up to $100,000. That is \nmoney they can invest in their business and grow it, with even more \npeople working.\n  As this debate about tax reform continues, I hope we focus on \nrewarding companies that really care about America. We shouldn't be \nblindly focused on a race to the bottom to the lowest wages. And, I \nmight add, this is paid for. It is paid for by eliminating the \ndeduction for moving businesses overseas that is currently part of the \nTax Code.\n  So let's reform the Tax Code the right way, with an eye on helping \nthe workers get a decent paycheck, decent benefits, and rewarding the \ncompanies that put American workers first.\n  I thank Senators Sherrod Brown, Elizabeth Warren, Jack Reed, Tammy \nBaldwin, and Bernie Sanders for lending their support to this important \nbill. I look forward to continuing our fight for working families here \nin the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, it is my pleasure to rise with my friend \nand colleague from Rhode Island to speak about the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. For 53 consecutive years, \nCongress has passed this vital piece of legislation, which provides the \nnecessary funding and authorizes--I repeat, authorizes--our military to \ndefend the Nation. The NDAA is one of few bills in Congress that \ncontinues to enjoy bipartisan support year after year. This is a \ntestament to the legislation's critical importance to our national \nsecurity and the high regard with which it is held by the Congress.\n  Last month, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 22 to 4 to \napprove the NDAA, an overwhelming vote that reflects the committee's \nproud tradition of bipartisan support for the brave men and women of \nour armed services.\n  I thank the committee's ranking member, the Senator from Rhode \nIsland. Despite his failure of education at our Nation's military \nacademy, I appreciate the thoughtfulness and bipartisan spirit with \nwhich he approaches our national security. It has been a pleasure to \nwork with Senator Reed over the last few months and years on this \nlegislation and today as we appear on the floor on behalf of this \nlegislation.\n  We have worked through some of the toughest issues facing our \nmilitary today. We have our differences on some aspects of this \nlegislation, but those differences have never interfered with the \nsearch for common ground and consensus. This is a much better bill \nthanks to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  I also thank the majority leader, the Senator from Kentucky, for his \ncommitment to resuming regular order and bringing the NDAA to the floor \nthis week. Under the leadership of the Senator from Kentucky, the \nSenate will be able to take up this critical national security \nlegislation on time, allowing for thoughtful consideration and \namendments and giving our military the certainty they need to plan and \nexecute their missions.\n  That stands in stark contrast to the last 2 years under Democratic \nleadership, when this body failed to take up the NDAA until the very \nend of the year, at the last minute, with no amendments allowed.\n  Just yesterday the Democratic leader said considering this vital \nDefense bill is just a ``waste of time''--waste of time. Those comments \nmust be very disappointing to the servicemembers, retirees, and their \nfamilies in his home State of Nevada who clearly understand the \nimportance of this legislation.\n  The fiscal year 2016 NDAA is a reform bill. It tackles acquisition \nreform, military retirement reform, personnel reform, commissary \nreform, headquarters and management reform. This legislation delivers \nsweeping defense reforms that can enable our military to rise to the \nchallenges of a more dangerous world, both today and in the future. The \nArmed Services Committee identified $10 billion of excess and \nunnecessary spending from the President's defense budget request, and \nwe are reinvesting it in military capabilities for our war fighters and \nreforms that can yield long-term savings for the Department of Defense. \nWe did all of this while upholding our commitments to our \nservicemembers, retirees, and their families.\n  This legislation is a reflection of the growing threats we face in \nthe world. Over the past few months, the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee has received testimony from many of America's most respected \nstatesmen, thinkers, and former military commanders. These leaders had \na common warning: America is facing the most diverse and complex array \nof crises since the Second World War. Just consider some of the \ntroubling events that have transpired over the past year.\n  In Ukraine, Russia has sought to redraw an international border and \nannex the territory of another sovereign country through the use of \nmilitary force. It continues aggressively to destabilize Ukraine, with \ntroubling implications for security in Europe. Yet the President \ncontinues to refuse to provide Ukraine with the defensive weapons they \nneed and have repeatedly requested to defend their sovereign nation \nfrom Russia's onslaught.\n  In the Middle East, a terrorist army, with tens of thousands of \nfighters, many holding Western passports, has taken over a vast swath \nof territory and declared an Islamic State in the heart of one of the \nmost strategically important parts of the world. Nearly 3,000 U.S. \ntroops have returned to Iraq to combat this threat, with U.S. aircraft \nflying hundreds of strike missions a month over Iraq and \nSyria. Unfortunately, as recent reports suggest, nearly 75 percent of \nthose air missions never even dropped weapons, and meanwhile ISIS is \ntaking territory on the ground, most recently in Ramadi and Palmyra.\n\n  At the same time, amid negotiations over its nuclear program, Iran \ncontinues to pursue its ambitions to challenge regional order in the \nMiddle East by increasing its development of ballistic missiles, \nsupport for terrorism, training and arming of pro-Iranian militant \ngroups, and other malign activities in places such as Iraq, Syria, \nLebanon, Gaza, Bahrain, and Yemen.\n  Yemen has collapsed, as a Shia insurgency with ties to the Iranian \nregime has toppled the U.S.-backed government in Sana'a. Al Qaeda \ncontinues to use parts of the country to plan attacks against the West, \nthe U.S. Embassy has been evacuated, and a U.S.-backed coalition of \nArab nations has intervened militarily to reverse the gains of the \nHouthi insurgency and to restore the previous government to power.\n  Libya has become a failed state, beset by civil war and a growing \npresence of transnational terrorist groups, such as Al Qaeda and ISIL, \nsimilar to Afghanistan in 2001.\n  In Asia, North Korea continues to develop its nuclear arsenal and \never-more capable ballistic missiles, and late last year it committed \nthe most destructive cyber attack ever on U.S. territory.\n  China is increasingly taking coercive actions to assert expansive \nterritorial claims that unilaterally change the status quo in the South \nand East China Seas and raise tensions with U.S. allies and partners, \nall while continuing to expand and modernize its military in ways that \nchallenge U.S. access and freedom of movement in the western Pacific. A \nrecent report in the Wall Street Journal described how China has taken \nsteps to militarize the vast land features that it is actively \nreclaiming in the South China Sea.\n  Unfortunately I could go on, but these are just some of the growing \nthreats our Nation faces--threats that are far more serious than they \nwere a year ago and significantly more so than when Congress passed the \nBudget Control Act in 2011. That legislation arbitrarily capped defense \nspending\n\n[[Page S3643]]\n\nand established the mindless mechanism of sequestration, which was \ntriggered in 2013. As a result, with worldwide threats rising, we as a \nnation are on a course to cut nearly $1 trillion of defense spending \nover 10 years.\n  The Committee on Armed Services has conducted wide-ranging bipartisan \noversight on the effects of sequestration-level spending on our \nnational defense, and every single military and national security \nleader who has testified before the committee this year has denounced \nsequestration and urged its repeal as soon as possible. Indeed, each of \nour military service chiefs testified that continued defense spending \nat sequestration levels would put American lives at risk. I want to \nrepeat to my colleagues: Our armed services leaders have told the Armed \nServices Committee that American lives are at risk if we continue \nmindless sequestration. Don't we care about the risks and the lives of \nthe young men and women who have volunteered to serve in our military? \nDon't we care about them?\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate and in the House to come together \nand repeal sequestration, and however that is accomplished, I will be \nglad to discuss, but our first priority has always been and always will \nbe American security, our national security and the lives of the men \nand women who have volunteered to defend it.\n  Unfortunately, this legislation doesn't end sequestration. Believe \nme, our committee would have done so if the NDAA were capable of it, \nbut it is not. The NDAA is a policy bill. It deals only with defense \nand national security issues. It does not spend a dollar. It provides \nthe Department of Defense and our men and women in uniform with the \nauthorities and support they need to defend the Nation.\n  Although the committee could not end sequestration, we did the most \nwe could to authorize necessary levels of funding for the Department of \nDefense and our men and women in uniform. As a result, the NDAA fully \nsupports President Obama's budget request of $612 billion for national \ndefense, which is $38 billion above the spending caps established by \nthe Budget Control Act. Let me repeat that. This legislation gives the \nPresident every dollar of budget authority he requested. The difference \nis our legislation follows the Senate budget resolution and funds that \n$38 billion increase through overseas contingency operations--or OCO--\nfunds.\n  This is not my preferred option. It is not anybody's preferred option \nthat I know of. I recognize that reliance on OCO spending limits the \nability of the Department of Defense to plan and modernize our \nmilitary. For this reason, the committee included a special \ntransfer authority in this legislation that allows the Department of \nDefense to transfer the additional $38 billion from OCO to the base \nbudget in the event that legislation is enacted that increases the \nstatutory limitations on discretionary defense and nondefense spending \nin proportionately equal amounts.\n\n  This was the product of a bipartisan compromise, and it was the most \nwe could do in the NDAA to recognize the need for a broader fiscal \nagreement without denying funding for our military right now. \nNevertheless, the White House threatened yesterday to veto this \nlegislation over its additional OCO spending and because the Congress \nhas not provided for similar increases in nondefense spending. This is \nmisguided and irresponsible. With global threats rising, how does it \nmake any sense to oppose a defense policy bill--legislation that spends \nno money but is full of vital authorities that our troops need--for a \nreason that has nothing to do with national defense spending? The NDAA \nshould not be treated as a hostage in a budget negotiation.\n  The political reality is that the Budget Control Act was signed by \nthe President and remains the law of the land. So faced with a choice \nbetween OCO money and no money, I choose OCO. And multiple senior \nmilitary leaders who testified before the Armed Services Committee this \nyear said they would make the same choice for one simple reason: This \nis $38 billion of real money that our military desperately needs and \nwithout which, our top military leaders have said, they cannot succeed. \nMilitary leader after military leader has testified before our \ncommittee that they cannot carry out their obligations in their various \ncommands to defend the Nation if the Budget Control Act--also known as \nsequestration--continues.\n  My message is simple: Let's have our fights over government spending, \nbut let's keep those fights where they belong--in the appropriations \nprocess, where money is actually spent. The NDAA is not the place for \nit. If the President and some of my colleagues oppose the NDAA due to \nconcerns over nondefense spending, I suspect they will have a very \ndifficult time explaining and justifying that choice to Americans who \nincreasingly cite national security as a top concern.\n  I care about nondefense spending. I really believe we need to fund \nmany of the areas, such as the FBI, Border Patrol, and others. But to \nsomehow equate that with national defense with the world as we see it \ntoday is either out of ignorance or partisanship--I don't know which, \nbut neither is a valid ambition or reason.\n  The NDAA is a policy bill, and this year's version is an incredibly \nambitious one. It advances major reform initiatives that can make more \nefficient use of our precious taxpayer dollars while increasing \nmilitary capability for our warfighters.\n  In recent years, the Defense Department has grown larger but less \ncapable, more complex but less innovative, more proficient at defeating \nlow-tech adversaries but more vulnerable to high-tech ones. No one is \nmore cognizant of this unfortunate fact than those of us whose \nresponsibility it is to oversee our defense budget on the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  It is a top priority for me, my colleague from Rhode Island, as well \nas all of my fellow committee members to ensure that every dollar we \nspend on defense is used wisely, efficiently, and effectively. The \nfiscal year 2016 NDAA makes important contributions to this reform \neffort. This legislation contains sweeping acquisition reform.\n  Many of our military's challenges today are the result of years of \nmistakes and wasted resources. One recent study found that the Defense \nDepartment had spent $46 billion between 2001 and 2011 on at least a \ndozen programs that never became operational. I will repeat that--$46 \nbillion on programs that never became operational. What is worse, I am \nnot sure who, if anyone, was ever held accountable for these failures. \nAt a hearing 2 years ago, I asked the Chief of Naval Operations who was \nresponsible for $2.4 billion in cost overruns on the USS Gerald R. Ford \naircraft carrier. He had no answer.\n  In today's vast acquisition bureaucracy where personnel and project \nmanagers cycle through rapidly, everyone is accountable and no one is \naccountable. We need acquisition reform now because our senior leaders \nmust be held accountable for responsible stewardship of taxpayers' \ndollars.\n  But this is not just about saving money. Acquisition reform is needed \nimmediately to preserve U.S. technological and military dominance and \nis therefore a national security imperative. Over the last decade, our \nadversaries have invested heavily in modernizing their militaries with \na focus on anti-access and area-denial technologies designed \nspecifically to counter American military strengths. Meanwhile, an \nacquisition system that takes too long and costs too much is leading to \nthe erosion of America's defense technological advantage. If we \ncontinue with business as usual, I fear the United States could lose \nthis advantage altogether. In short, our broken defense acquisition \nsystem itself is a clear and present danger to the national security of \nthe United States.\n  The acquisition reforms in this legislation center on five principle \nobjectives.\n  First, the legislation establishes effective accountability for \nresults. We give greater authority to the military services to manage \ntheir own programs, and we enhance the role of the service chiefs in \nthe acquisition process. In exchange for greater authority, the bill \ndemands accountability and creates new mechanisms to deliver it. \nService chiefs, service secretaries, service acquisition executives, \nand program managers would sign up to binding management, requirement, \nand resource commitments.\n  The bill also creates new incentives for the services to deliver \nprograms on\n\n[[Page S3644]]\n\ntime and on budget. If military services fail to manage a program \neffectively, they will lose authority and control over that program, \nand they will be assessed an annual cost penalty on their cost \noverruns, with those funds directed toward acquisition risk reduction \nefforts across the Department.\n  Second, the legislation supports the use of flexible acquisition \nauthorities and the development of alternative acquisition paths to \nacquire critical national security capabilities. The bill establishes a \nnew streamlined acquisition and requirements process for rapid \nprototyping and rapid fielding within 2 to 5 years. It expands rapid \nacquisition authorities for contingency operations and cyber security \nmissions, and the legislation allows the Secretary of Defense to waive \nunnecessary acquisition laws to acquire vital national security \ncapabilities.\n\n  Third, the NDAA improves access to nontraditional and commercial \ncontractors. To give our military the necessary capabilities to defend \nthe Nation, the Department of Defense must be able to access innovation \nin areas such as cyber, robotics, data analytics, miniaturization, and \nautonomy--the innovation that is much more likely to come from Silicon \nValley, Austin or Mesa than Washington. But our broken acquisition \nsystem, with its complex regulation and stifling bureaucracies, is \nleading many commercial firms to choose not to do business with the \nDefense Department or to limit their engagement in ways that prevent \nthe Department from accessing the critical technologies these companies \nhave to offer. The NDAA creates incentives for commercial innovation by \nremoving barriers to new entrants into the defense market. By adopting \ncommercial buying practices for the Defense Department, the legislation \nmakes it easier for nontraditional firms to do business with the \nPentagon. The legislation also ensures that businesses are not forced \nto cede intellectual property developed at their expense to the \ngovernment.\n  Fourth, the NDAA streamlines the process for buying weapons systems, \nservices, and information technology by reducing unnecessary \nrequirements, reports, and certification. The legislation retains \npositive reforms made in the Weapons System Acquisition Reform Act of \n2009, but streamlines processes to support more rapid and efficient \ndevelopment and delivery of new capabilities. It would also establish \nan expert review panel to identify unneeded acquisitions regulations.\n  Fifth, the legislation reinvigorates the acquisition workforce in \nseveral ways, including by establishing several direct-hire authorities \nfor science and technology professionals to join the acquisition \nworkforce. The legislation seeks to improve the attractiveness of \nacquisition functions to skilled military personnel through credits for \nacquisition-related assignments, creation of an enhanced dual-track \ncareer path to include acquisition, and increased business and \ncommercial training opportunities.\n  In a Statement of Administration Policy released yesterday, the White \nHouse asserted that transferring some acquisition authority back to the \nservices is somehow inconsistent with the Secretary of Defense's \nexercise of authority, direction, and control over all of DOD's \nprograms and activities. I could not disagree more with this assertion. \nWhat this legislation does is merely switch who does what in certain \ncircumstances from different people who all directly report and serve \nunder the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary of \nDefense. In this legislation, for a limited number of programs to start \nwith, the Secretary of Defense will look to the service Secretaries \ndirectly for management of these acquisition programs rather than \nlooking to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, \nand Logistics or AT and L. This is not usurpation of the Secretary of \nDefense's power. It is called streamlining of authorities and reducing \nlayers of unnecessary bureaucracy. There is a section in the \nlegislation that would allow the Secretary of Defense to continue to \nrely on more layers of management if he chooses but only if he \ncertifies to Congress that this makes sense. There simply is not any \nundermining of the Secretary of Defense's authority here.\n  Another concern raised has been that the transfer of milestone \ndecision authority to the services would reduce the Secretary of \nDefense's ability through AT and L to guard against unwarranted \noptimism in program planning and budget formulation. Unwarranted \noptimism is indeed a plague on acquisition, and there is not a monopoly \nof that in the services. Yet there is nothing in this bill that \noverrides the requirement to use better cost estimates from the Office \nof Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation. In fact, new incentives and \nreal penalties imposed on the services in the bill are designed to put \nsome of this optimism in check.\n  There is also belief manufactured in parts of the Department that the \ncurrent system is working. They are saying the current system is \nworking. That is laughable. The statistics are improving, first of all, \nbecause Secretary Gates canceled over 25 programs. It is easier to make \nyour numbers when you are unilaterally disarming and buying less. \nStill, all of the programs that are left under the U.S. Defense \nDepartment AT and L management have over $200 billion in cost overruns. \nI want to repeat--$200 billion in cost overruns under the current \nsetup. That is why it is imperative we change it. There are a lot of \nwords to describe this, but success is not one of them. The USD AT and \nL is trying to have it both ways: claiming credit for all the \nimprovements in the acquisition system while blaming the services for \nits long list of failures. This is exactly the problem this legislation \nis trying to address--blurred lines of accountability inside the \nDefense Acquisition System that allow its leaders to evade \nresponsibility for results.\n  Then, there is the issue of process and documentation. Defenders of \nthe current acquisition system say they have it right. They might have \nit right if our adversary were the old Soviet Union and their \ncentralized planned economy. The reality for the modern world is that \nunder USD AT and L management process takes too long and adds costs and \nlooks like it was designed by a Soviet apparatchik. For example, an \nArmy study looked at the time it would take to go through all of the \nU.S. Defense Department AT and L reviews and buy nothing. What was the \nanswer? Ten years to buy nothing.\n  The Government Accountability Office looked at the much wanted \nmilestone reviews that the office of the Secretary of Defense is \ntouting as a success. Just one review takes on average 2 years. A \nsimilar review at the Missile Defense Agency takes about 3 months. Our \nadversaries are not shuffling paper, they are building weapons systems. \nIt is time for us to do the same. The first step is to eliminate \nunnecessary calls for data from those outside the program office, just \nas David Packard recommended 30 years ago. This legislation does that.\n  The acquisition reforms in this bill are sweeping, but there is much \nmore work to do to transition what is in essence a Cold War management \nsystem into one that is more agile and nimble to meet the challenges of \na globalized information age. This legislation marks the beginning of a \nmultiyear process to change the acquisition system to be more open to \nnext-generation technologies that can enable the United States to \noutpace its adversaries.\n  Acquisition reform is part of a larger effort to reform the \nmanagement of the Department of Defense. This bill seeks to ensure that \nthe Department and the military services are using precious defense \ndollars to fulfill their missions and defend the Nation, not to expand \ntheir bloated staffs. While staff at Army headquarters increased 60 \npercent over the past decade, the Army is now cutting brigade combat \nteams. The Air Force avoided mandated cuts to their headquarters \npersonnel by creating two new headquarters entities, even as it \ncomplained it had insufficient personnel to maintain combat aircraft.\n  I want to repeat that. The Air Force mandated cuts of headquarters \npersonnel, not reducing by a single person but by creating new \nheadquarters entities, even as it complained it had insufficient \npersonnel to maintain combat aircraft. From 2001 to 2012, the defense \ncivilian workforce grew at five times the rate of the Active-Duty \nmilitary. I repeat that. From 2001 to 2012, the defense civilian \nworkforce grew at five\n\n[[Page S3645]]\n\ntimes the rate of the Active-Duty military.\n\n  This legislation initiates a reorganization of the Department of \nDefense in order to focus limited resources on operations rather than \nadministration, to ensure military personnel can develop critical \nmilitary skills, and to stabilize organizations and programs. The NDAA \nmandates a 30-percent cut in funding for headquarters and \nadministrative staff over the next 4 years. These reductions generate \n$1.7 billion in savings for fiscal year 2016. As the Department \nimplements these reductions, this bill authorizes the Secretary of \nDefense to retain the best talent available, rather than just the \nlongest serving.\n  Contrary to the Statement of Administration Policy that the White \nHouse issued yesterday, the reductions to Pentagon overhead and \nmanagement staff are neither arbitrary nor across the board. These cuts \nare targeted to administrative functions, but they do not inflict \nunintended harms on functions such as mortuary affairs or sexual \nassault prevention. The legislation does not seek to micromanage the \nDefense Department. It cuts money from broad headquarters and \nadministrative functions, but it defers to the Secretary of Defense on \nhow, what, and where exactly to cut, and it instructs him to devise a \nplan to make these cuts wisely.\n  Beyond management reform, the NDAA also puts forward wide-ranging and \nunprecedented reform to the military retirement system. Under the \ncurrent 70-year-old system, 83 percent of servicemembers leave the \nservice without any retirement assets. This system excludes the vast \nmajority of current servicemembers who will not complete 20 years of \nuniformed service, including many veterans of the wars in Afghanistan \nand Iraq.\n  The legislation creates a modernized retirement system and extends \nretirement benefits to the vast majority of servicemembers through a \nnew plan offering more value and choice. Under the new plan, 75 percent \nof servicemembers would get retirement benefits. In many cases, the \noverall benefit of those serving at least 20 years will be greater than \nthe current system. This new modernized retirement system will apply to \nmembers first joining a uniformed service on or after January 1, 2018. \nCurrent members are grandfathered but may choose to be covered by the \nnew plan. The retirement reforms in this legislation will enable \nservicemembers to save for retirement earlier in their careers, create \na new incentive to recruit millennials, and increase retention across \nthe services. That is why these reforms are supported by the Veterans \nof Foreign Wars, the Reserve Officers Association, the National Guard \nAssociation, the Enlisted Association of the National Guard, and the \nAir Force Association, among others.\n  In addition to retirement reform, the NDAA focuses on sustaining the \nquality of life of our military servicemembers, retirees, and their \nfamilies. The legislation authorizes a 1.3-percent pay raise for \nmembers of the uniformed services in the grade O-6 and below. The bill \nauthorizes $25 million to support local educational agencies that serve \nmilitary dependent children, and $5 million in impact aid for schools \nwith military dependent children with severe disabilities.\n  The NDAA includes many provisions to improve the military health care \nsystem and TRICARE. The legislation allows the TRICARE beneficiary up \nto four urgent care visits without making them get a preauthorization. \nIt requires DOD to establish appointment access standards and wait-time \ngoals, and if a patient can't get an appointment within standards, the \nmilitary hospital must offer an appointment in the TRICARE network. The \nlegislation requires DOD to focus more on health care quality, patient \nsafety, and beneficiary satisfaction by making them publish health \noutcome measures on their Web sites, and it requires a plan to improve \nthe delivery of pediatric health care, especially for children with \nspecial needs. Furthermore, as military families frequently move from \none location to another, their health care coverage must be seamless \nand portable, but too often families have to leap over several hurdles \nto get health care in a new location. This has to stop. We take care of \nthat problem in this legislation.\n  The NDAA also builds on the work of the past few years to prevent and \nrespond to military sexual assault. The legislation contains a number \nof provisions aimed at strengthening the authorities of special \nvictims' counsel to provide services to victims of sexual assault. The \nlegislation also enhances confidential reporting options for victims of \nsexual assault and increases access to timely disclosure of certain \nmaterials and information in connection with the prosecution of \noffenses.\n  This is a fiscally responsible NDAA. I have said that my top priority \nas chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee is to repeal \nsequestration and return to a strategy-driven defense budget. But I \nhave also made clear that repealing sequestration must be accompanied \nby a vigorous effort to root out and eliminate Pentagon waste. Given \nthe fiscal constraints and global challenges confronting our military, \nwe simply cannot afford to waste precious defense dollars.\n  Our committee identified over $10 billion in excessive and \nunnecessary spending in the President's budget request: headquarters \nand administrative overhead, troubled information technology programs, \nweapons systems that are over budget and underperforming, among other \nitems. The NDAA reinvests those savings in providing critical military \ncapabilities for our warfighters and meeting unfunded priorities of our \nservice chiefs and combatant commanders.\n  Even as challenges to maritime security increase in the Middle East \nand the western Pacific, our Navy remains well below its fleet-size \nrequirement of 306 ships. Moreover, our shipbuilding budget will \nexperience even greater pressure at the end of this decade, as the Navy \nprocures the replacement for the Ohio-class ballistic missile \nsubmarine. The NDAA directs savings identified in the budget request to \naccelerate Navy modernization and shipbuilding to mitigate the impacts \nof the Ohio-class replacement and to increase the Navy to meet rising \nthreats.\n  The legislation adds $800 million for additional advanced procurement \nfor Virginia-class submarines, and $200 million for the next amphibious \nassault ship. The bill provides incremental funding authority for one \nadditional Arleigh Burke-class destroyer. The bill accelerates the Navy \nLX(R) Amphibious Ship Program, shipbuilding for the afloat forward \nstaging base, and procurement of the first landing craft utility \nreplacement.\n  The NDAA upgrades an additional guided missile destroyer with \nballistic missile defense capability and funds advanced undersea \npayloads for submarines.\n  Across the services, our military faces dangerous strike fighter \ncapacity shortfalls. For example, we have seen delivery of the F-35 \nJoint Strike Fighter fall well short of projections, even as the Air \nForce has retired hundreds of aircraft.\n  Indeed, the President's budget request proposed cutting the Air Force \ndown to 49 fighter squadrons, of which less than half would be fully \ncombat mission ready. The NDAA addresses these shortfalls, and it is \nall the more urgent in view of the ongoing and anticipated operations \nin Iraq and Syria against ISIL, as well as a potential delay of force \nwithdrawals from Afghanistan.\n  The NDAA fully restores the planned retirement of the A-10 aircraft. \nThe Air Force itself has said in its posture statement this year:\n\n       There was a time when the Air Force could trade some \n     capacity in order to retain capability. But we have reached \n     the point where the two are inextricable; lose any more \n     capacity and the capability will cease to exist.\n\n  The Armed Services Committee agrees. That is why divesting the A-10 \ncapability at this time incurs unacceptable risk in the capacity and \nreadiness of the combat air forces without a suitable replacement \navailable. The NDAA authorized procurement funding for 12 additional F-\n18 Super Hornets for the Navy and 6 additional F-35B Joint Strike \nFighters for the Marine Corps. The legislation also procures an \nadditional 24 MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aircraft for the Air Force to \nsupport increased combatant commander requirements for medium-altitude \nintelligence, surveillance, and reconciliation support.\n  The committee was similarly concerned about munitions capacity\n\n[[Page S3646]]\n\nacross the services. So the NDAA adds funding for additional PAC-3 \nmissiles for ballistic missile defense and additional AMRAAM missiles. \nThe legislation also increases Tomahawk missile production to the \nminimum sustaining rate and procures TOW tube-launched, antitank \nmissiles to mitigate shortfalls for the Marine Corps.\n  The NDAA supports modernization across the services. The legislation \ninvests in lethality by enhancing the firepower of Stryker combat \nvehicles and increasing the survivability of the Apache attack \nhelicopter against new threats. The NDAA fully supports the President's \nrequest for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program and provides all \nexecutable funding for the Long Range Strike Bomber Program.\n  In addition, the legislation authorizes $6.1 billion for Virginia-\nclass submarines, $3.5 billion for Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, and \n$1.4 billion for the Ohio-class replacement program.\n  While the NDAA supports our military commanders' most urgent \npriorities, the bill also contains rigorous oversight measures to \nprevent further cost growth in major acquisition programs, including \nthe F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the Ford-class aircraft carrier, and a \nlittoral combat ship.\n  As adversaries seek to counter and thwart American military power, \nthe NDAA looks to the future and invests in the technologies that will \nmaintain America's military technological superiority. The NDAA \nprovides $400 million in additional funding to support the so-called \nthird offset strategy to outpace our emerging adversaries. The \nlegislation funds a cyber vulnerability assessment, a new initiative to \nenable the services to begin evaluating all major weapons systems for \ncyber vulnerabilities. It also increases investment in six breakthrough \ntechnologies: cyber capabilities; low-cost, high-speed munitions; \nautonomous vehicles; undersea warfare; intelligence data analytics; and \ndirected energy.\n\n  Similarly, our Nation has only begun to realize the potential of \nunmanned combat aircraft, especially in a maritime environment. In the \npast 2 years, the Unmanned Combat Air System Demonstration Program, or \nUCAS-D, has achieved a number of historic firsts: the first carrier-\nbased catapult launch, the first arrested landing on a carrier, the \nfirst cooperative operations with manned aircraft aboard a carrier, and \nthe first autonomous aerial refueling.\n  The NDAA funds the remaining research and development work to be \ncompleted on UCAS-D, while directing the Secretary of Defense to \ndevelop competitive prototypes that move the Department toward a \ncarrier-based, unmanned, long-range, low-observable, penetrating strike \naircraft that can enhance the capability of the carrier air wing to \nmeet future threats.\n  The NDAA supports our allies and partners with robust training and \nassistance initiatives. The legislation authorizes nearly $3.8 billion \nin support for the Afghan National Security Forces as they continue to \ndefend their country and the gains of the last decade against our \ncommon enemies. The legislation also authorizes the provision of \ndefensive lethal assistance to Ukraine to help it build combat \ncapability and defend its sovereign territory.\n  The legislation supports efforts by Lebanon and Jordan to secure \ntheir borders against ISIL, and it creates a new initiative to provide \nequipment, supplies, and training to Southeast Asian nations in order \nto support them in building maritime domain awareness capabilities and \naddressing growing maritime sovereignty challenges in the South China \nSea.\n  Finally, this legislation contains a bipartisan compromise on how to \naddress the challenge of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. \nPresident Obama has said from day one of his Presidency that he wants \nto close Guantanamo Bay. But 6\\1/2\\ years into his administration, the \nPresident of the United States has never provided a plan to do so.\n  The NDAA would require the administration to provide a comprehensive \nplan to the Congress on how it intends to close Guantanamo, which would \nthen have to be approved by both Houses of Congress. That plan would \nhave to include a case-by-case determination on the disposition of each \ndetainee at Guantanamo Bay, including a discussion of the legal \nchallenges of bringing detainees to the United States and any \nadditional authorities that might be needed.\n  The plan would also have to address how the Department would ensure \nthe continued detention and intelligence collection from future \ncombatants captured under the laws of war. If such a plan is approved, \nthe Congress would provide the President the authority to proceed with \nthe closure of the facility. If the Congress does not approve the plan, \nnothing would change. The ban on domestic transfers would stay in \nforce, and the certification standards for foreign transfers included \nin the NDAA would remain.\n  This is an ambitious piece of legislation. It recognizes that in \norder to ensure that the Department of Defense is prepared to meet our \npresent and future national security challenges, we must champion the \ncause of defense reform, rigorously root out Pentagon waste, and invest \nin modernization and next-generation technologies to maintain our \nmilitary technological advantage.\n  America has reached a key inflection point. The liberal world order \nthat has been anchored by U.S. hard power for seven decades is being \nseriously stressed and with it the foundation of our security and \nprosperity. It does not have to be this way. We can choose a better \nfuture for ourselves but only if we make the right decisions now to set \nus on a better course. That is what this legislation is all about--\nliving up to our constitutional duties to provide for the common \ndefense, increasing the effectiveness of our military, restoring \nAmerica's global leadership, and defending a liberal world order.\n  This legislation is a small step toward accomplishing those goals. \nBut it is an important step that the Congress must take now and take \ntogether. For 53 consecutive years, Congress has passed a National \nDefense Authorization Act. This year should be no different. I am \nhopeful that the bipartisan spirit that has carried this legislation \nfor over half a century will prevail once again.\n  Ultimately, we owe the brave men and women in uniform, many of whom \nare still in harm's way around the world today, nothing less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the fiscal year 2016 \nnational defense authorization bill, which was recently reported out of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  I want to begin by commending the chairman, Senator McCain, for his \nextraordinary leadership. I also want to reflect--because both the \nPresiding Officer, the Senator from Alaska, and I had the privilege of \nbeing with Senator McCain in Vietnam last week--that to recognize \nfirsthand the heroic service of CDR John McCain is to recognize an \nextraordinary individual whose service, whose sacrifice, whose valor, \nwhose fidelity to the principles of our military and to our Nation are \nvirtually unique. But more important than that, it is to recognize that \nafter observing the horrors and brutality of war, as few people have, \nhe was able to summon the courage and the capacity to bring two \ncountries together. Without Senator McCain's active participation--not \nalone but absolutely essential and perhaps the most essential part--the \nGovernment of the United States and the Government of Vietnam would not \nhave diplomatic relations today. We would not have been at a university \nin Vietnam listening to young people talking about their future--a \nfuture that is not clouded by war but has the opportunity for peace and \nprosperity, working with us and working with the world community.\n  I can't think of any historical examples of individuals working so \nhard to defeat each other, then so hard to embrace each other, save, of \ncourse, General Grant and General Lee. But I know the Senator would be \noffended by being compared to two West Point graduates, so I will \nsimply say that he has made historic contributions to this country in \nso many ways. It is no surprise that he has taken the leadership of \nthis committee and made a remarkable contribution. His vision to engage \nus in a strategic dialogue with some of the most sophisticated and \nexperienced individuals in the country--Henry Kissinger, Madeleine \nAlbright, and a host\n\n[[Page S3647]]\n\nof others--gave us the perspective to begin to look at the issues we \nface in a much more comprehensive and a much more thoughtful way. I \nhave had the privilege of serving on the committee for many years. No \none has done that. No one has set the stage so well. And then to bring \nour DOD witnesses together in that context of both the strategic vision \nand the operational budgetary requirements was absolutely incredible. \nAll of this has made us better prepared on the committee to write this \nbill which is before us today.\n  (Mr. SASSE assumed the Chair.)\n  Let me also take a moment to thank the professional staff on both \nsides of the aisle. Their willingness to work together to tackle the \nhard issues has been the key to this authorization bill. I thank them \nin advance because their work has just begun. The hours they will spend \nover the next several days to go through the significant number of \namendments--all of that will be unnoticed by many but appreciated \ncertainly by me, the chairman, and all of us on the committee. Thank \nyou.\n  As the Senator from Arizona pointed out, this is basically a good \nbill. It has many provisions that were requested by the Department of \nDefense. It has many necessary reforms. The chairman has highlighted \nmany of them. I think it will further our national security in many \ndimensions, and most importantly it will provide the training, \nequipment, and support our men and women in uniform deserve. I will try \nto focus on some of these important developments.\n  However, there are some provisions in this bill that cause me \nconcern--indeed, grave concern. One problem, I fear, is the familiar, \noft-debated, and very complicated challenge of Guantanamo. While we \nhave had some very carefully crafted compromise language in the bill, \nthere are other provisions that reverse progress, particularly on the \noverseas transfer of detainees.\n  We have a number of individuals who have been vetted for overseas \ntransfer--not to the United States--that is not appropriate at this \nmoment--but overseas. I think we have to continue that effort to \nrepatriate these individuals outside of the United States, in areas in \nwhich their security and their activities can be appropriately \nmonitored. I will spend a few more minutes--and in a few minutes, I \nwill discuss an amendment that I may propose with respect.\n  Despite all of these good provisions, however, I was ultimately \nunable to vote for the bill. After working closely and sincerely, with \nthe leadership of the chairman, I am reluctantly unable to vote for the \nbill because at the heart, the funding mechanism to provide a \nsignificant portion of the resources--$39 billion--is, I think, an \nunsustainable aspect of the legislation.\n  As the Senator pointed out, the legislation before us does not end \nthe Budget Control Act's arbitrary caps on spending, and, as he also \nsaid, every major military official, every major senior defense \nofficial came and told us: We have to end the Budget Control Act caps \nand the prospect of sequestration. We have not done that.\n  What the bill does is adopt a device--some have said a gimmick--that \nuses the overseas spending account to fund base activities of the \nDepartment of Defense. As I have indicated and as the chairman has \nsuggested, the one request consistently received--in fact, just a few \ndays ago, the commander of the Pacific forces indicated the same \nthing--is to end sequestration. We have not been able to do that.\n  What the President's budget did is he sent up a request for $38 \nbillion above the budget cap levels in the base--not overseas defense \nspending but in the base. He requested $50.9 billion for contingency \noperations, overseas operations. We have been funding overseas \noperations since 9/11. This funding was designed to do what it suggests \nin the title. We have forces deployed overseas in combat, in contact \nwith our enemies--Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere--and this funding \nwas to provide for those forces and indirectly for our supporting \nmechanisms, but the key was to support these forces overseas.\n  Now what we have done--and it was done because we were unable to \neliminate the budget caps under the Budget Control Act--is we have \ntaken this OCO account and we have grossed it up dramatically.\n  This approach has several problems. First, it doesn't solve--in fact, \nin some cases it complicates the DOD's budget problems. OCO, as I said, \nwas created and should be used for war costs only. OCO has limits and \nrestrictions. There are very strict rules that have to be followed. It \nis not flexible funds that can be moved around at will.\n  Defense budgeting needs to be based on a long-term military strategy, \nwhich requires the DOD to focus at least 5 years ahead. OCO money is 1-\nyear money. It is just this year. There is no commitment statutorily \nthat it will be available. There is no presumption, because it is in \nthe base, that it will be the starting point of discussions for the \nnext budget. Frankly and obviously, we cannot fight a multigenerational \nwar with 1-year money. And we are in a multigenerational conflict. It \nhas been more than a decade since we started our efforts in the wake of \n9/11, and we have challenges that will not resolve themselves in a \nyear. To adopt a major part of our budget, roughly $39 billion, as one-\ntime--supposedly--funds is not a wise, sensible, and appropriate way to \nfund our security going forward.\n\n  Another aspect is it doesn't reduce the deficit; it adds to the \ndeficit. This is all deficit funding, so this is not a way to avoid \ntough decisions about how we are going to deal with our deficit.\n  It also does not reach other vital aspects of national security that \nare housed in domestic agencies which are also critical for our \nnational defense--the FBI, Homeland Security, the Coast Guard. All of \nthese agencies contribute dramatically to our national defense. In \nfact, particularly with the threat of ``lone wolves''--and that is \nincreasingly more of a concern to all of us--these agencies play an \neven more significant role in our overall national security. When you \nare talking about a national security strategy, it is not just the \nDepartment of Defense; it is the Department of State and it is \nengagement overseas.\n  Again, as we were in Vietnam, we were talking to the Defense \nMinister, and one of his key priorities is a project to eliminate \ntoxins in Bien Hoa airfield, an airfield we used extensively in \nVietnam. To him, that would be a hugely significant indication of our \nsupport for their efforts. That is not funded through the Department of \nDefense; that would be principally funded through the AID. And you \ncould go on and on.\n  The approach we offer in the bill does not go to the heart of the \nproblem that faces the Department of Defense and every other Federal \nagency, and that is the BCA caps and the steep cuts that will come into \neffect if sequestration is invoked. That is the heart of the matter. I \noffered an amendment in committee to address this problem, and \nunfortunately it failed. That was one of the reasons I reluctantly--\nvery reluctantly--chose not to support the bill, because there are so \nmany, as the chairman indicated and as I will indicate, important \nprovisions in this bill.\n  What I tried to do was to say: Let's leave this money on the books, \nbut let's fence it off until we can fix the real problem, which is the \nBudget Control Act and sequestration, which affects defense and \nnondefense alike.\n  In the context of this floor debate, I hope to be able to once again \nrejoin that issue and ask my colleagues to recognize the heart of the \nmatter--not the consequences affecting defense but the heart of the \nmatter, which is the Budget Control Act.\n  As I said, this is a bill with many laudatory provisions reflecting \nin large part bipartisan cooperation. Some of them have been discussed \nby the chairman, but I would also like to mention them.\n  The bill provides key funding and authorities for the two major U.S.-\nled coalition operations: the mission in Afghanistan and the counter-\nISIS coalition in Iraq and Syria. Critical to both of these operations \nare our efforts to build the capacities of our partner nations.\n  With regard to Afghanistan, the bill includes the full $3.8 billion \nrequested by the President to support the Afghan army, police, and \nother security forces fighting to secure the hard-fought gains of the \npast decade and to ensure that Afghanistan does not once again become a \nsafe haven for Al Qaeda or other terrorist groups seeking to attack \nAmerica.\n\n[[Page S3648]]\n\n  The bill would also increase the total number of visas for the Afghan \nSpecial Immigrant Visa Program by 3,000, providing a path to safety for \nAfghans who have put themselves at risk by serving as translators or \notherwise helping our coalition efforts.\n  For coalition efforts against ISIS, the bill provides additional \nfunding for training and equipping the Iraqi security forces and other \nassociated forces in Iraq, including the Kurdish Peshmerga and Sunni \ntribes, who are confronting the threat of ISIS in heavily contested \nAnbar Province and in other parts of Iraq. It includes $80 million for \nthe Office of Security Cooperation in Iraq. It also provides an \nadditional $600 million for the Syria Train and Equip Fund, to build \nthe capabilities of a vetted, moderate opposition to fight ISIS in \nSyria. Additionally, $125 million is authorized to reimburse Lebanon \nand Jordan for operations that help secure their borders against ISIS.\n  The bill includes funding for an initiative to expand the U.S. \nmilitary presence and exercises in Eastern Europe, reassuring allies \nand countering the threat of hybrid warfare tactics like those used by \nRussia in the Crimea and eastern Ukraine. The bill also authorizes \nadditional military assistance for Ukraine--including lethal \nassistance--to build the capabilities of Ukrainian security forces to \ndefend against further aggression and ceasefire violations by Russian-\nbacked separatist forces.\n  With respect to counternarcotics, which is another national security \nthreat, the bill expands an existing authority to permit \ncounternarcotics assistance to the Governments of Kenya, Tanzania, and \nSomalia. This expansion would allow for additional nonlethal assistance \nto those nations as they combat illicit trafficking in the region. In \nLatin America, the bill would provide assistance to support the unified \ncounterdrug and counterterrorism campaign of the Government of \nColombia. This assistance remains a key element of our bilateral \nsecurity operation in Colombia and enables the commander of SOUTHCOM to \nprovide critical enabling support upon request.\n  The bill also provides an additional $50 million to address unfunded \npriorities identified by SOUTHCOM, including intelligence, \nsurveillance, and reconnaissance, as well as maritime interdiction \nsupport operations in Central America.\n  As the chairman indicated, the bill adds over $400 million in \nadditional readiness funding for the military services across all \nbranches, Active, Guard, and Reserve. These increases will provide \nresources for crucial programs aimed at improving our military \nreadiness in many areas, including depot readiness, flying operations, \ncyber training, reducing insider threat attacks, behavioral health \ncounseling, and other important programs.\n\n  With respect to our nuclear deterrence, the committee bill fully \nauthorizes the program for modernizing our triad of sea, ground, and \nairborne platforms. The last B-52 was produced in the 1960s, and by the \ntime the Long-Range Strike Bomber, its replacement, begins to be \nfielded in the mid-2020s, the B-52 will be flown in some cases by the \ngrandchildren of its first pilots.\n  Turning to the undersea deterrent, the current Ohio-class submarine, \nwhich will ultimately carry upward of two-thirds of our strategic \narsenal, is to be replaced by the Ohio replacement submarine. If we are \nto maintain a sea-based deterrent, the current Ohio fleet of 14 subs \nmust be replaced starting in 2027 due to the potential for hull \nfatigue. By then, the first Ohio sub will be 46 years old--the oldest \nsubmarine to have sailed in our Navy in its history.\n  Now, the third aspect of our triad--those of our land-based ICBMs--\nwill not need to be replaced until the 2030 timeframe. We have \nauthorized a concept development for replacement of this most \nresponsive leg of the triad which acts as a counterbalance to Russian \nICBMs.\n  As Secretary Carter noted in his confirmation hearing, our nuclear \ndeterrence forms the bedrock of our defense policy. This is an \nessential mission which must not be neglected.\n  In the area of technology and innovation, I am pleased this bill \ntakes a number of steps to ensure that DOD has access to the most \ninnovative minds in the private sector and to strengthen DOD's in-house \nlaboratories. It significantly increases funding for university \nresearch programs as well as authorizing $400 million to support \nSecretary Carter's efforts to identify and fund new technologies that \nwill help offset the advancing military capabilities of peer nations, \ninvest in technologies such as lasers, unmanned systems, and undersea \nwarfare.\n  The bill also supports the DOD's laboratory enterprise by improving \ntheir ability to attract and hire the world's best and brightest \nscientists and engineers. These labs help DOD act as smart buyers and \nbuilders of the most advanced weapon systems on the planet and are \noften underappreciated for their endeavors.\n  It also improves their ability to build world-class modern research \ninfrastructure, encourages them to hire selected students from friendly \nforeign nations, and strengthens their ability to partner with \nindustry, allowing small businesses to have access to the great \nintellectual property coming from DOD labs, as well as access to their \nresearch and technical equipment. I believe these policy changes and \nfunding increases will continue to strengthen the technological \ndominance of our military forces while reducing the costs to build and \nmaintain weapon systems in the future.\n  There are also specific recommendations on hardware programs that \nwill help the Department to improve management and cope with \nshortfalls, such as providing an additional 12 F-18 Super Hornets for \nthe Navy and an additional 6 F-35B aircraft for the Marine Corps. These \naircraft will help deal with the Department of Navy shortfall in strike \nfighter aircraft.\n  It adds $800 million in Virginia-class advance procurement to provide \nflexibility to begin building Virginia-class boats with the enhanced \npayload module as soon as that version is ready for production and to \nhelp mitigate pressure on shipbuilding funds coming from the Ohio-class \nreplacement program.\n  It accelerates several other ship programs, including amphibious \nassault ships, the dock landing ship replacement, the next afloat \nforward staging base, the new salvage ship/fleet tug replacement, and \nthe landing craft utility replacement.\n  As the chairman indicated, this bill also includes critical \nauthorities for our men and women in uniform. They are the heart and \nsoul of our military. All the equipment in the world, as sophisticated \nas it is, will not make the difference that the young men and women who \nwear the uniform of the United States make each and every day. So this \nbill includes a 1.3-percent pay raise for most servicemembers, the \nreauthorization of over 30 types of bonuses and special pays to \nencourage enlistment and reenlistment in the military, and funds to \nprovide health care to the force, retirees, and their families.\n  Notably, this bill includes important benefit and compensation \nreforms either requested by the Department or recommended by the \nMilitary Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission that \nhelps to ensure the long-term viability of the all-volunteer force.\n  For example, the bill includes a new retirement system for \nservicemembers joining after January 1, 2018, as recommended by the \nCommission, which grandfathers in the current force. For most \nservicemembers, this new system will provide a greater benefit at less \ncost to the government and will address perhaps the grossest inequity \nof the current system, as highlighted by the chairman--the fact that 83 \npercent of all servicemembers leave military service with no retirement \nbenefits at all. This is especially challenging, difficult, and in some \ncases even galling for those who have deployed multiple times and leave \nthe service simply because they cannot endure the strain any longer. We \nessentially ask them to choose between retirement benefits or their \nmental health or the unity of their family. Under the new system \ncontained in our bill, anyone who completes 2 years of service will be \neligible to walk away with something.\n  Notably, the bill does not include the overall TRICARE system \nrecommended by the Commission. We have heard from the President with \nrespect to TRICARE and agree these recommendations require more study. \nThese reforms are vital. In a budget-\n\n[[Page S3649]]\n\nconstrained environment, with hard spending caps, it is critical we \nstrike the right balance between a military compensation package that \nprovides a high quality of life for military families and training and \nmodernization funding that provides a high quality of service and a \nready force.\n  As senior Department officials have testified, if we don't have \nenough money to provide our troops the latest technology and the \ntraining they need, we are doing them a disservice. When we send them \ninto harm's way under these conditions, that disservice quickly \ntranslates into a breach of trust.\n  The Department has assumed approximately $1.7 billion in savings in \nits 2016 budget relating to these benefit proposals and $25.4 billion \nover the entire FYDP. The committee supported these proposals and has \nredirected that funding to readiness and modernization accounts to \nrestore those deficits. Difficult choices need to be made and this bill \nmakes them. We might not yet have it perfectly right, but as we move \nthrough the legislative year, we will continue to work to ensure that \nwe pay our servicemembers a fair wage while delivering the training and \nequipment necessary to succeed.\n  This bill begins a process, long overdue, for reviewing different \noptions, for example, for providing the commissary benefit to our \nservicemembers--another important aspect of quality of life. Included \nin one of these options is at least the consideration of privatization. \nI understand some Members may have some difficulty supporting these \nprovisions, but the bill simply requires a number of studies to \ngenerate and evaluate new ideas, and a pilot program to test them, \nwithout requiring the actual privatization of the system. This is an \nexperiment which I think is worth conducting, and I believe the \nchairman's leadership on this point was extraordinarily valuable.\n  The bill also addresses the Department's management of its civilian \nworkforce in two ways--one of which I agree with and one of which I \nwill raise some questions. We have long heard from the Department that \nit lacks certain authorities to effectively manage its civilian \nworkforce. This bill includes new authorities which will enable \ncivilian managers to more effectively retain their best performing \nemployees while divesting their poorest. These reforms, while painful \nfor some, are sensible and necessary.\n  However, this bill also mandates a management headquarters reduction \nof 7.5 percent in 2016 and 30 percent over 4 years. I am concerned that \nsuch deep, and at this point generalized, cuts to the civilian \nworkforce may create more problems than it will solve. I am hoping we \ncan take a more careful approach to headquarters reform and look \nforward to working with my colleagues on this issue as we move through \nthe floor and through the conference to final passage.\n  Again, as the chairman highlighted, this bill also contains roughly \n50 provisions on acquisition reform, and I commend the chairman for his \nefforts. The provisions will help streamline acquisition processes, \nallow DOD to access commercial and small businesses, and improve the \nacquisition workforce. They build on the successes of the reforms led \nby Chairman McCain and Chairman Levin in the Weapons System Acquisition \nReform Act of 2009.\n  I did have concerns about one provision in this area, and I thank the \nchairman for working with me to address it. I am sure we will be \ncontinuing this discussion of acquisition reform throughout the year \nand in the future. I expect the Department of Defense will have \nconcerns over some of the provisions as well, so I look forward to \nworking with the chairman and soliciting the best advice from \nacquisition experts in the government and industry so we can continue \nto improve our stewardship of taxpayer dollars and deliver the best \ntechnologies to our fighting forces.\n  Now, let me turn to an area of concern which the chairman has \nhighlighted and on which I may be offering an amendment; that is, \nGuantanamo. Over the past few years, the Senate Committee on Armed \nServices has led the way on Guantanamo-related issues, giving careful \nconsideration to our detention policies and finding bipartisan \nsolutions.\n  In certain ways, this bill continues that tradition of bipartisan \nprogress on Guantanamo issues. For example, it includes the authority, \ncarried in our bill over the last 2 years, for the Secretary of Defense \nto approve the temporary transfer of Guantanamo detainees to a military \nmedical facility in the continental United States to provide medical \ntreatment in a life-threatening emergency, when that treatment cannot \nbe provided on-island without unreasonable or excessive cost. The \ndetainee would be required to return to Guantanamo at the conclusion of \nthe medical treatment.\n  Most importantly, the bill contains a provision that would clear a \npath for closing Guantanamo, including the option of bringing detainees \nto the United States for detention, civil trial, and incarceration. \nUnder this approach, the current prohibitions on Guantanamo transfers \nto the United States would remain in place until the President submits \nto Congress a detailed plan on the disposition of these detainees and \nCongress votes, under expedited procedures, to approve that plan. If \nCongress approves the plan, the bans on transfers to the United States \nwould be lifted and the President would have the authority to implement \nthis plan for closing Guantanamo.\n  I particularly want to thank Chairman McCain and Senator Manchin, who \nworked closely to craft this compromise, which was approved by a \nsignificant vote in the committee--19 to 7. This is an example of \nbipartisan work at its best.\n  At the same time, on other Guantanamo policies, I must note they take \nus backward. This is particularly the case with regard to overseas \ntransfers of Guantanamo detainees--not transfers into the United States \nbut to third countries. In the fiscal year 2014 National Defense Act, \nthe committee's bipartisan efforts resulted in real progress on \noverseas transfers, granting the Secretary of Defense more flexible and \nstreamlined authorities for overseas transfers of detainees, consistent \nwith our national security interests and with measures to substantially \nmitigate the risk of Guantanamo detainees reengaging in terrorist \nactivities.\n  Unfortunately, the bill before us today would undo that progress and \nreimpose restrictions which date back to 2013 that include a burdensome \nchecklist of certifications that the Secretary of Defense would be \nrequired to fulfill for any overseas transfers and a prohibition on \ntransfers to any country where there was a prior case of detainee \nrecidivism.\n  These provisions make it nearly impossible to transfer Guantanamo \ndetainees overseas to a third-party country. In fact, during the 3 \nyears these certifications were previously in place, no detainees were \ntransferred under these certification restrictions. During this period, \na total of 11 detainees were transferred out of Guantanamo overseas, 6 \nunder an existing national security waiver and 5 under an exception for \ncourt-ordered transfers. This is a fraction of the over 30 detainees \nwho have been transferred under the more recent 2014 transfer \nauthority.\n  These backward-looking restrictions on overseas transfers create an \nunnecessary roadblock for disposing of the 57 detainees currently at \nGuantanamo who have been approved for overseas transfer, most of whom \nwere approved nearly 5 years ago. My hope is that we can work with our \ncolleagues across the aisle to craft a compromise that brings us more \nin line with present law.\n\n  Finally, I wish to discuss more in-depth the reason I was unable to \nsupport the committee's bill and why I think we need to have a very \nserious debate on the underlying financing of this legislation.\n  Our national defense decisions should be based on actual needs, not \non spending caps and ways around the spending caps that don't change \nthe BCA but simply use a device--some have labeled a gimmick--to get us \nmoney, not to fix the fundamental problem but to get us money.\n  The President's fiscal year budget 2016 requested $38 billion above \nthe Budget Control Act spending caps. Senator McCain and I wrote a \nletter to the Budget Committee that also asked to go above those budget \ncaps because we understand the best approach is to put within the base \nfunding of the Department of Defense those functions which are \nessential, not just to the year-to-year operations but to the long-term\n\n[[Page S3650]]\n\noperations of the Department of Defense and to our long-term national \nsecurity. The President requested this $38 billion be authorized as \npart of the base budget.\n  The request from the President also contained--as Presidential \nrequests have contained since 2001-2002--OCO funding; OCO funding being \nfor those unique, we hope, one-of or at least yearly expenditures that \nwe have to make with respect to current operations overseas. That is \nwhy this is called the Overseas Contingency Operations. For some time \nnow, the President and all of our Secretaries--Secretary Carter, \nSecretary Hagel, Secretary Gates, Secretary Panetta, and Secretary \nHagel--have implored Congress to end the damaging effects of the Budget \nControl Act's sequester and spending caps. However, this bill, \nfollowing the budget resolution, does not clearly address the BCA \nissue. Instead, it turns to this OCO fund. This mark transfers $39 \nbillion from the base budget to the Overseas Contingency Operations \nbudget, leaving the base at, surprisingly, the BCA level, and it raises \nseveral concerns. I mentioned these concerns, but let me mention them \nagain.\n  First, adding funds to OCO does not solve, and actually complicates, \nthe DOD's budgetary problems. Defense budgeting needs to be based on \nour long-term military strategy, which requires DOD to plan at least 5 \nyears ahead. When you are doing technology innovation, when you are \ninvesting in programs that are not going to come off the shelf in 6 \nmonths, you can't rely on 1-year money. It doesn't provide DOD the \ncertainty and stability it needs. It has to have money in the base.\n  This instability can undercut the morale of our troops and their \nfamilies. If vital programs are subject to year-to-year appropriations, \nif they are not considered to be the norm, if they are not where we \nbegin but are sort of put in at the end, that affects the morale and \nconfidence of our military.\n  It also affects our defense industry partners. If their funding is in \nthe category of Overseas Contingency Operations, that is less certain \nto them than money that is in the base and will likely remain in the \nbase for 5 years or beyond that they need.\n  Then, the second aspect of this is that our national security is more \nthan just the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense is \ncritical. Ask Americans: Where does our national defense come from? \nWell, it is those men and women in uniform. That is absolutely true. \nBut we need domestic agencies. We can't defend the homeland without the \nFBI, which is funded through the Department of Justice, which will not \nhave access--direct access--in the way we are proposing, to OCO or the \nTransportation Security Administration that screens individuals coming \nin or Customs that additionally screens people or the Coast Guard. All \nof these are in the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Furthermore, without adequate support for the State Department, then \nwe can't present the kind of comprehensive approach overseas to \nnational security issues that are essential to success. Gen. James \nMattis, whom the chairman and I both know, said: ``If you don't fund \nthe State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition.''\n  There is a symbiotic relationship between our diplomatic activities, \nour national defense activities, our law enforcement activities, and \nour Treasury activities, because if we are truly to interrupt these \nterrorist networks, we have to go after their financing. That is done \nthrough the Department of Treasury. This whole-of-government approach \nto national security has to be recognized, and it is not recognized if \nwe allow the Budget Control Act to continue to be operational on the \nnondefense side but avoid it on the defense side because we have access \nto the overseas contingency fund.\n  Also, I think we are going to see going forward, as we have seen \nbefore--and we are saying this OCO funding is for 1 year. But I think \nwe are doing a little bit of a wink-wink, don't worry; we are not going \nto pull $40 billion out of the Defense bill in the 2017 budget. We \ncouldn't do that. What we are doing, though, is we are sort of inviting \nthe ingenious use of OCO funding in the years ahead, and I think we \nwill see increasingly more esoteric and exotic things in OCO funding \nbecause that is where the money is.\n  If you have a program that you need to get funded and it has a \nconnection to Defense--and in some cases doesn't even need to be \nDefense. Senator McCain and I were chatting at the hearing about the \nsignificant amount of medical research run through the Department of \nDefense. One reason is because there was money available back in the \n1980s for defense spending that wasn't available on the domestic side, \nand that funding found its way into Defense.\n  So I think there are several reasons we have to take a different \napproach. My approach in the committee was, I thought, straightforward. \nThe President recognizes we need these resources for national defense. \nWe recognize we need the resources for national defense, but I believe \nwe should budget honestly and directly, and initially that was our \napproach in the Budget Committee. Let's put it in the base, and let's \ntake the President's $50 billion--which is the best estimate by the \nDepartment of Defense of what we really need for overseas contingency--\nand let's do that.\n  So my proposal is certainly just to fence the additional OCO funds \nuntil we could, in fact, collectively, as a Congress--what we have to \ndo and what so many people on both sides have argued--until we could \nrepeal, reform, modify, extend the Budget Control Act, much as we did \nthrough the great efforts of Senator Murray and Congressman Paul Ryan, \nwhich gave us the head room to actually pass legislation--not just the \nDepartment of Defense but other agencies--that allowed us to continue \nthe work of the government and allowed us to protect the Nation. My \nproposal in committee did not succeed, but I would renew that request.\n  I think we have made great progress in the legislation. I think the \nlast step is to get us to a position where we have essentially \nrecognized that the BCA caps and sequestration have to be eliminated.\n  I would conclude by commending the chairman for all he has done to \nget us here, but, second, to repeat what has been said to us by every \nmilitary leader. What is their first request? It wasn't for more OCO \nmoney. Their first request was to eliminate the BCA caps, eliminate the \nthreat of sequestration. I think we have to do this, and I think we can \nstart this process now. In fact, I would say that if we don't start \nthis process now, if we don't send a strong signal--and my proposal \nwould send that strong signal--then I am afraid we will just be victims \nof the calendar. Before we get to the BCA, we will have tough choices \nto make about this bill that we don't have to.\n  So I urge consideration when the amendment comes up.\n  I yield back to the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island, my \nfriend Senator Reed, for his thoughtful analysis of the legislation \nbefore us. Again, it has been not only a pleasure but an honor for me \nto have the opportunity to work with him on the issues that are so \nimportant to our Nation--none more important.\n  I am told by the majority leader that he would like to have this \nlegislation completed by the end of next week. That means we have a lot \nof work to do. We already have a number of amendments that have been \nfiled. I would ask my colleagues to have their amendments in, \nhopefully, by, say, tomorrow afternoon, when the Senator from Rhode \nIsland and I will ask unanimous consent that no further amendments be \nconsidered. We want to give every Senator an opportunity to have their \namendments thoroughly vetted and debated and voted on, if that is their \ndesire. That means we have a lot of work to do. I think we will be \nconsidering an amendment this afternoon from Senator Portman, and we \nwould like to move forward from there.\n  So I ask the indulgence of my colleagues that if they do want debate \nand a vote on their amendments, that they be prepared to come to the \nfloor to do so. Again, on filing of amendments, we would like to have \nall pending amendments in, in the next 24 hours, so we can have a \nfinite number of amendments for the legislation that is pending today.\n\n[[Page S3651]]\n\n  I thank all of my colleagues for their cooperation. We look forward \nto discussion and debate and, I am sure, will come out with a better \nresult.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, Mr. Reed, the ranking member. There is a lot of good stuff in \nhere, but there is budgetary fakery in here. I want to, in my words, \ndescribe this budgetary fakery. But before I do, I want to commend the \nchairman, Senator McCain, and Senator Reed for how they have conducted \nthe committee. I thank them for their professionalism. They show how \ntwo leaders of opposite parties can get along, and Lord knows we need a \nlot more of that around here.\n  But for this budgetary issue, Senator Reed and I would be voting for \nthis on the final passage coming out of the committee. I, too, will be \nsupporting Senator Reed's amendment to try to straighten out some of \nthis budgetary trickery. Let me say that in front of our committee, we \nhave had general after general and admiral after admiral and the top \nenlisted folks come in and say that sequestration is harming the \nnational security of this country. When we do that, it puts us at a \nrisk that the American people would find intolerable if they knew what \nwas going on. Now, let me see if, in my words, I can describe what this \nis.\n  After Senator Murray and Congressman Ryan put together a bipartisan \nbudget--and for 2 years this artificial ceiling, like a meat-ax \napproach, sequestration, across the board was enacted to be implemented \nover the next several years, not a budgetary strategy of program by \nprogram but a meat-ax approach across the board, regardless of the \nimportance of the program.\n  Their bipartisan budget lifted that for 2 years. We are at the end of \nthat 2-year period, so that sequestration is kicking back in. That is \nwhy we need to get rid of it. We need to get rid of it not only for \ndefense but nondefense as well. I will talk about that in a second. But \nin defense, it now kicks in and limits the overall spending for the \nDepartment of Defense. But we know we have to spend more than that.\n  So this defense bill, which Senator Reed and I voted against, takes \noperational and readiness funds out of the Department of Defense \nrequest, which is a major part of the defense of the country. You want \nyour troops to be operationally ready so that we can fight two wars if \nwe have to simultaneously. But they take that money--that funding--out \nof the defense budget, and they put it over here in this special \naccount that is not counted against the budget caps, which is an \naccount for conducting the war originally in Iraq, then Afghanistan, \nand primarily for purposes of funding Afghanistan now.\n  As Senator Reed has very appropriately and accurately discussed, if \nyou do that, first of all, this is nothing but budgetary fakery to meet \nan arbitrary cap on budgets, because you are spending a lot more than \nthat ceiling. You are just spending it over here on something that is \noff budget, and the total amount that is moved over is about $39 \nbillion. In that account, there is approximately $50 billion already \nfor conducting the war in Afghanistan. But now we are going to take \noperational readiness for the entire Department of Defense and pull it \nover here.\n  If we are going to be straight with what we are spending so that we \nreally know what we are spending, why don't we keep it in the budget \nand let the total budget rise instead of having an artificial ceiling \nso we know what we are spending? Senator Reed is concerned that if you \ndo that and you are spending it over here, then in future years, as \nthis continues to stay there, we are not going to be able to show that \noperational readiness is something that ought to be a normal part of \nthe funding of the Department of Defense, as it has been for years and \nyears.\n  That is basically what is going on. Military strategy is not just \ndependent on defense spending, but it is also dependent upon nondefense \nnational security spending, which at this point is not even being \naddressed. What will the generals and the admirals tell you? They will \ntell you that a strong national economy is one of the most important of \nall the strengths of our country to be able to project American \nmilitary strength. And as a result, if we continue to budget like this, \nnot only in defense but in nondefense as well, in nondefense areas that \ndirectly affect defense--I mean the Coast Guard, the CIA, the FBI, the \nDEA, Customs and Border Protection, air traffic control, TSA--then all \nof these areas in the Federal Government are going to be under this \nartificial meat-ax approach of cutting across the board, and all of \nthose agencies directly affect the national security.\n  So what we have been doing is artificially avoiding what is the \nobvious. It is sequestration. It is this meat-ax cut across the board. \nI want us, as we discuss this budget--now highlighted first by Senator \nReed--to start talking about how we are going to get rid of the \nsequester. We did it in the bipartisan Murray-Ryan budget over 2 years \nago. We need to do it again. Otherwise, we are going to be wasting our \ntime working on bills that at the end of the day may well not get the \n60 votes to proceed to final passage or we will have a veto by the \nPresident. So we need to fix the budget caps for defense and nondefense \nspending. If we have bleeding in an artery, we do not need a Band-Aid.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                            USA Freedom Act\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, yesterday we passed the USA FREEDOM Act, \nand it was quickly signed by our President because it was so important \nto put it into place. It contained two items that I want to draw \nparticular attention to. One is that there should be no secret spying \non U.S. citizens here in the United States of America. The second is \nthat there should be no secret laws here in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  These two items are very closely connected together. Our Nation was \nfounded upon the principles of liberty and freedom. Fundamental to the \nexercise of those principles is the right to privacy, to be free from \nunreasonable intrusions. This right is central to all other rights \nprotected in the Constitution, especially to the freedom of speech, the \nfreedom of assembly, and the freedom to petition our Government.\n  Our sense of privacy and to be secure in our homes and secure with \nour records goes back to common law in England. It was in 1767 that the \nEarl of Chatham, when he was debating the cider tax, said:\n\n       The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all the \n     forces of the Crown. [His cottage] may be frail, its roof may \n     shake; the wind may blow through it; the storms may enter, \n     the rain may enter, but the King of England cannot enter.\n\n  Certainly, that is the spirit that infused the Fourth Amendment of \nour Constitution. That amendment says: ``The right of the people to be \nsecure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against \nunreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated. . .''\n  We need to ensure that our security apparatus, our law enforcement, \nand our intelligence officers have the tools they need to enact the \nefforts to keep America secure. But in the process, we cannot sacrifice \nour constitutional rights as American citizens. There should be no \nsecret spying on Americans and no secret law in a democracy. So how did \nwe end up in that place--the place that I am so glad we took a major \nstride toward remedying yesterday?\n  It goes back to section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. This Act was passed \nafter the attacks on 9/11. I was not here in the Senate, but it said \nthat our government can access business records or tangible things if \nit shows that there is a statement of facts showing that there are \nreasonable grounds to believe that those things are relevant to an \nauthorized investigation.\n  That certainly mimics the second half of the Fourth Amendment, which \ngoes on to say that ``no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, \nsupported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place \nto be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.''\n  The responsibility of the government was to prepare a statement of \nfacts, and those statements of facts had to show reasonable grounds and \nhad to show that the things sought were relevant to an authorized \ninvestigation.\n\n[[Page S3652]]\n\nEach one of those words had a significant influence in constraining the \npotential for the government to collect business records or, \nparticularly, as we came to learn, to collect phone records on American \ncitizens. However, a problem developed, and that is that a secret court \nwas created here in America, a secret court called the FISA Court, or \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. That secret court could \ninterpret the common language of the law, and its interpretations were \nnot disclosed to the U.S. public. So in that process of taking the \nlanguage of the law that has a clear set of standards and then \ninterpreting it, the court created secret law--secret law that was not \ndisclosed to the citizens of the United States.\n  This is an enormous risk to democracy--a court with no scrutiny and, \nquite tragically, no presentation of opposing views from the position \npresented by the government. What kind of court is it that allows no \npresentation of an opposing view to the view of the government? That is \na court that can create tyranny of the government by secretly \nreinterpreting the plain language of the law. That is exactly what \nhappened.\n  Let's think about how this then went forward. Back in December 2012, \nI proposed an amendment, and that amendment said that there can be no \nsecret law in America; that if the FISA Court makes an interpretation \nof terms, that interpretation of those terms has to be made public.\n  Here we have a representation of the importance of shining a light on \nthat secret court, disclosing to the public how it interprets the law \nand thereby changes the meaning of the law. And what did this court do? \nThis court tipped those terms and said ``authorize investigation.'' \nThat can mean anything that happens in the future, which, of course, \nmakes that term meaningless. It means that there is no authorized \ninvestigation. It is just a fictional possibility of the future--\nnothing existing right now. And then it took the term ``relevant to an \nauthorized investigation,'' and it said that relevant is irrelevant. \nYou have to show no connection, one or two places removed, in order to \nsecure the right to access the papers, the business records, the phone \nrecords of U.S. citizens.\n  So this secret court here in America, the FISA Court, created secret \nlaw, wiped out the plain meaning of section 215, put its own \ninterpretation in place, and told no one. This is absolutely \nunacceptable. That is why I put forward the amendment in December of \n2012 that there is no secret law amendment, that this is unacceptable, \nthat we must have disclosure of whatever that court finds so that the \npublic can be informed, so that legislators can be informed, so that we \ncan have a debate on whether that interpretation is consistent with \nwhat the legislature intended--what the Senate and the House intended--\nand consistent with what the President intended when he signed that \nlaw.\n  That amendment did not get a debate at that time in 2012, but the \nchair of the Intelligence Committee pledged to work with me to ask our \ngovernment to declassify those opinions of the FISA Court, and she did. \nI thank very much the senior Senator from California, the former chair \nof the Intelligence Committee, for her help in doing that. And some of \nthose records, some of those opinions, and some summaries of the \ninterpretation of the law were declassified. That was a step forward, \nbut it should not be dependent on the whim of the executive branch as \nto whether secret law exists in our country.\n\n  So I continued to press forward. And then we had a situation occur. \nIn June 2013, Edward Snowden disclosed the existence of the cell phone \nprogram. I could not explain in December of 2012 why it was so \nimportant to end secret law, but after Edward Snowden's disclosures, I \ncould explain it.\n  In fact, when the National Security Agency chief, Keith Alexander, \nwas testifying, which was shortly after that disclosure, I proceeded to \npull out my cell phone and ask the chief: What authorized investigation \ngives you the authority under section 215 to access my, Senator \nMerkley's, cell phone records? He was unable to answer that question \nbut said he would seek legal consultation in order to explain what \ninvestigation showed that there was a relevant connection and what \nstatement of facts would justify it. But I never got an answer because \nthere was no answer because the government was collecting everything \nunder this secret reinterpretation of law.\n  Yesterday, we ended the era of secret law in America. Yesterday, my \nno secret law act was incorporated into the USA FREEDOM Act and was \nsigned by the President of the United States. This law says the \nexecutive branch must declassify opinions of the FISA Court or, if they \nfind that the exact opinion poses a security risk because of details \nenclosed therein, must declassify summaries or at a minimum must \nsummarize the significant constructions and interpretations of law \nfound by the FISA Court. That is the heart of it. We are not asking \nthat classified information about facts of a case that could endanger \nour national security be disclosed. We are asking that interpretations \nand constructions of law be disclosed so that we have no secret law in \nAmerica, and that is what is required by the act we passed yesterday.\n  In conclusion, we must not have secret laws in America. We must not \nhave a secret court that has no opposing point of view presented. And \nwhen it makes interpretations of law, it must be disclosed to American \ncitizens, who have every right as citizens to know what the law means \nand to be able to argue whether they like that interpretation, dislike \nit, think the law should be supported or the law should be changed.\n  May we never again allow a secret court to authorize secret spying on \nU.S. citizens under the cover of secret law.\n  What we did yesterday--incorporating the no secret law act into the \nUSA FREEDOM Act--was important. To paraphrase William Pitt, the \nhumblest American, no matter his wealth or her income or his status \nwithin the community--that no American may be in a situation where he \nmay be unable to say to the U.S. Government: Here in my home, within \nthese walls, however modest, you, the government, may not enter.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nremain in session for at least 5 additional minutes while I speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I couldn't let the statements that were just \nmade go without a degree of fact check. There is no secret court. A \nsecret court means we don't know it exists. Every Member of the U.S. \nSenate and every American knows that the FISA Court exists. The FISA \nCourt exists because when the Senate of the United States takes up \nclassified, top-secret legislation, we shut these doors, we clear the \nGallery, and we cut the TV off because it can't be heard in public. As \na matter of fact, every court in the country operates in secret when \nthey have sensitive information that can't be shared.\n  I wish my colleague would stay.\n  The information can't be shared because it can't be public. There are \nsome things that don't meet that classification.\n  And to get up here and talk about secret courts and secret laws--we \npass the laws. The courts enforce the laws, and they are challenged. We \nhave committees and Members who do oversight. It is unfactual to stand \non this floor and say we have secret courts and secret laws. That is \nwhy the Senate and the House made a mistake this week.\n  If the Senator were really concerned about privacy, my friend would \nbe on the floor arguing that we eliminate the CFPB, a Federal agency \ncreated--not even funded by Congress--that collects every piece of \nfinancial transaction on the American people today. They get every data \npoint from credit card companies and the credit bureau, they search the \nstudent loan information, and they download all of that into metadata \nwithin the CFPB. No Member is down here complaining about that. That is \nthe greatest intrusion of privacy on the American people that could \never happen. It was known upfront, so they made sure it wasn't funded \nby Congress and made sure we didn't have any oversight \nresponsibilities. That is why they put it under the guidance of the \nFederal Reserve.\n  The President of the United States could have ended section 215 at \nany\n\n[[Page S3653]]\n\ntime. He had the power. But the President understands that this program \nworks and that there was public pressure to move this data from the NSA \nto the telecom companies, which is probably a greater concern about \nprivacy than to have this controlled and supervised within the NSA.\n  The Senator mentioned Edward Snowden--a traitor to the United States. \nMy colleague held him up as though he were a prize because he had come \nout with this publicly. What do the American people think when we come \nout here and take some of the most sensitive information and suggest \neverybody ought to know it? The American people look at us and ask us \nto keep them safe and do whatever is within the law to accomplish that.\n  And there is one thing that has never been contested on section 215: \nIt lived within the letter of the law or it lived within the letter of \nthe Presidential directive.\n  We had a debate, and that is behind us. But to come out here and \nsuggest that there is a secret court and that there are secret laws and \nthat yesterday they eliminated all of that--no, they didn't. No \nadministration in their right mind is going to publicly release those \nclassified and top-secret documents that go to the FISA Court because \nit would put Americans and foreigners at risk.\n  I have tried to explain to my colleagues that terrorists are not good \npeople. We can't hug them and all of a sudden change their intent. They \nwant to kill people. And in most cases, we don't find them through \nassociation with Boy Scouts; we find them by actually putting agents \ninto a system where they work sources and collect intelligence. Why \nwould we go out and give terrorists the roadmap of how we do things?\n  I will end on this. As everyone can tell, when somebody gets up and \ntalks about something that just is not true, it can't go without \ncorrection.\n  What we have done in the last 2 months is given every terrorist in \nthe world a roadmap as to exactly how the United States picks up \nindividuals in the United States who might communicate with terrorists \nabroad.\n  I will say for the last time what section 215 did. Section 215 was a \ndatabase that stated the NSA--the only way that any number could ever \nbe queried was if we had a foreign telephone number that we knew was a \nterrorist telephone number, we could go to the FISA Court and say: We \nwould like to test this against telephone numbers--not Americans; \ntelephone numbers. It was a database that only had telephone numbers, \nthe date of the call, and the duration of the call. The court would \ngive us permission when we were looking to see if there was an American \ntelephone number that actually talked to a known terrorist. And if it \ndid, we turned it over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and said: \nYou might want to look at this person. They then went through a normal \ncourt process. If they wanted to find the person's name and get \nadditional information, that is what they did. Some called that an \ninvasion of privacy. I will tell everyone that is not the courts' \ninterpretation. The courts ruled that when my telephone information \ngoes to a telephone company, I have no expectation of privacy. None. \nThat is the law.\n  The reality is that we are collecting telephone numbers. It has no \npersonal identification on it. I don't know how it would be an invasion \nof privacy when we don't know who it is. And that threshold is met when \nthe Bureau goes to the court and says they have a different concern \nabout the individual, and the court will then rule on it.\n  But to believe that the FISA Court does anything different from the \nSenate of the United States or different from any court in the country \nwhen they are faced with classified or secret information--and that is, \nthey shut it down--is wrong. It is just plain wrong. It is important \nfor the American people to understand that there are ramifications to \nstupid decisions, even by Congress.\n  It is my hope that this program will work as it is currently \ndesigned. But there is no mistake that we have given terrorists every \nreason to never use a cell phone or a landline again, especially those \nwho are in our country and intend to carry out some act like the \ngentleman from Boston did yesterday. He pulled a knife on two officers \nwho just wanted to talk to him because he had been under 24/7 \nsurveillance for days. If the news reports were correct, he intended to \nbehead a Boston police officer.\n  I think the American people want our law enforcement folks to be in \nthat position. If we take away their tools, we will not be able to do \nit. What we did yesterday was we took some of the tools away. We didn't \ntake all of them away. My hope is that this body will think clearly in \nthe future about the tools we provide to allow this to happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  For the Senator's information, the Senate has an order to recess \nuntil 2 p.m.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, when colleagues come to the floor and \ncontend that there have been no secret courts in America, that there \nhas been no secret law in America, that the administration of section \n215 matched the plain language of the laws adopted by this body, they \nare wrong on all three counts.\n  Mr. BURR. Will the Senator entertain a question?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. When I have completed my remarks, I will be happy to \ntake a question.\n  And so my colleague comes to the floor and says that there is no \nsecret law. But the fundamental understanding of law is that there is \nthe plain language of the law and there is the interpretation of that \nby the court. It is only through the combination of those two things \nthat you can know what a law means. So if you have the plain language \nbut you don't have the interpretation that has been assigned by the \ncourts and used to adjudicate cases, then in fact you have secret law \nbecause none of us know what the words mean.\n  If you look at the plain language of section 215, it doesn't say: \nHere are restrictions on how the government examines a body of \ninformation, interrogates that body of information, and analyzes that \nbody of information. No. The language is completely about how the \ngovernment collects that information and whether they can collect that \ninformation. It sets a series of clear standards for collecting that \ninformation. It says that information cannot be collected unless there \nis stated analysis, a set of facts that show there is evidence that the \ninformation being sought is relevant to an authorized investigation.\n\n  Now, any common citizen knows, therefore, that the government has to \ndo a statement of facts. They have to state what is the specific \ninvestigation, has that investigation been authorized, and is the \nassorted information relevant that is being requested?\n  Well, ``relevant'' is a very powerful term in the law. It means one \nor two steps removed. And that is exactly what the Second Circuit found \nwhen they looked at this issue just recently.\n  The court's opinion explained that as the program is being \nimplemented, the records demanded are not those of suspects who are \nunder investigation, which would certainly be relevant, or of people or \nbusinesses that have contact with suspects under investigation, which \nis one step removed and certainly would be relevant, or even, the court \nwent on to say, of people or businesses that have contact with others \nwho are in contact with the subjects. That would be two steps removed, \nand that is stretching the boundaries of what is considered relevant \nunder the definition of the law.\n  The court found that the implementation of the program has extended \nto every record that exists. The Court found that the implementation of \nthe law extended to every record that exists.\n  So if the implementation by the administration so diverged from the \nlanguage of the law passed and debated in this Chamber, how did the \ngovernment--the executive branch--justify its gross deviation from the \nplain language of the law? Well, here is how they did it. They went to \na court that had been created, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt, and they\n\n[[Page S3654]]\n\nsaid: We would like to be able to collect all the information, whether \nor not it is relevant, because some day, under some situation, we may \nwant to analyze that information, and we would like to have it right at \nhand.\n  Now, had there been an adversary in this court, the adversary \npresenting an opposite point of view would have said: Well, not so \nquick, because there are standards in the case law for relevance. There \nare standards for what constitutes an authorized investigation. There \nare certainly standards for what are the means to present evidence to \ndocument this. But there was no contrary opinion in this court because \nthe only one arguing the case with no rebuttal and no examination by \nany group was the government. So we have the government and a judge. \nThat is not really the theory behind the courts. The idea is that we \nhave an examination of an issue with both sides presented so there can \nbe full articulation and full examination of the issues, and then a \njudge can decide based on full input. But, in this case, we didn't have \nthat input. The government asked for an interpretation that would allow \nthem to do something far different from the plain language of the law, \nand they got it from this secret court.\n  So, yes, we do have secret courts, operated with no input, and they \ndisclose no opinions. And yes, we did have a secret law, and that ended \nyesterday, as it should have.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BURR. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I will yield.\n  Mr. BURR. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute before the \nSenate adjourns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. My question to the Senator is this: Did he know the FISA \nCourt existed?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. The existence of the court----\n  Mr. BURR. It is a simple yes or no answer. Did the Senator from \nOregon know the FISA Court existed?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. The Senator from North Carolina can ask a question, and \nI get to answer the question.\n  Mr. BURR. Well, no, you don't. I asked the question, but I did not \nyield the Senator from Oregon the time.\n  Mr. President, regular order.\n  I don't want to take any more of the Senate's time, and I certainly \ndon't want to take any more of my colleague's time.\n  The fact is that he knows the court existed. Congress has \nreauthorized section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. The FISA Court has \nreauthorized it. They reauthorized it. They are asked every 90 days, \nand they ruled 41 times to allow section 215 to exist.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. BURR. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Were the opinions of this court, established by law--\nand, yes, it is transparent to the public that the court exists. But \nthe question of secrecy is not one of whether it exists; it is a \nquestion of whether the process is open in any feasible way to debate \nbetween two points of view. Did the Senator from North Carolina know \nthat the opinions of the court, including interpretations of the law, \nwere never disclosed to the American public and were, in fact, kept \nsecret?\n  Mr. BURR. I actually do know that.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Well, thank you, because that does show that in fact \nthere were secret----\n  Mr. BURR. The Senator asked his question, and I answered, and I still \ncontrol the time. Thank you.\n  Now, clearly, it is evident that if we say something wrong enough \ntimes, people start to believe it. It is not a secret court. It is not \na secret law. The President knows about it, and Members of Congress \nknow about it. We have voted on it. We know what goes on. Fifteen \nMembers of this body have oversight responsibility over the program. We \ndo our job, and we do it well.\n  Now, we may disagree with what tools we use to try to defeat \nterrorism in this country, and clearly the Senator and I have a big \ncanyon between us. But I have to tell my colleagues that America \nexpects the Senate and the Congress of the United States and the \nPresident of the United States to defend them. I am going to continue \nto do everything I can to make sure law enforcement and the \nintelligence community have the tools to do their job because their job \nis a big one and the threat is big, and for people to ignore that today \nis irresponsible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, the people of the United States expect \nthe Constitution to be upheld and the principles of the Fourth \nAmendment. They expect that the law that is passed on this floor will \nbe implemented in an appropriate fashion and consistently, and when it \nis not, our liberty is diminished, our freedom is diminished, and our \nprivacy is diminished.\n  Indeed, what we did yesterday with the USA FREEDOM Act was to end a \nsystem in which a court, in secrecy, changes the meaning of the law and \ndoes not expose it to the American public. That is a very important \nimprovement, taking us back to the democracy that we are all a part of \nand that we all love.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/03/senate-section/article/S3654-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Export-Import Bank\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor, and I know we are \ntalking about the Defense bill. I know my colleagues are trying to work \nthings out as it relates to the Defense bill, but I am just as \nconcerned about the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank--a credit \nagency that helps small businesses in the United States of America--\nwhich is expiring at the end of this month, June 30.\n  As we had discussions on the trade promotion authority act, I was \nvery concerned that we were going to be passing trade policy while at \nthe same time allowing very important trade tools to expire. I still \nremain very concerned about the small businesses that are here in the \nCapitol today and that have given much testimony at various hearings--\nyesterday in the Senate Banking Committee and today in the House \nFinancial Services Committee--about the need for this type of credit \nagency that helps small businesses ship their products to other \ncountries that are new market opportunities for them.\n  The reason why this is so important is because other countries have \ncredit agencies--if you will, credit insurance. You are a small \nbusiness. You want to get your products sold in developing markets. You \ncan't find conventional banking or you can find conventional banking \nbut that bank says it is not going to insure these losses. Thus, what \nhas emerged for the United States of America, Europe, China, Asia, many \nparts of the world, is what is called credit insurance.\n  That credit insurance takes the conventional banking and says: We \nwill help secure that conventional banking loan. So that if you are a \nmanufacturer in, say, Columbus, OH, making machinery and you are \nselling that in China, you actually have an opportunity to sell that \nproduct, use commercial banking in Ohio, have that guaranteed\n\n[[Page S3655]]\n\nthrough credit insurance. A lot of business gets done on behalf of the \nUnited States of America.\n  We know this well in the Pacific Northwest because we do a lot of \ninternational trade. There are a lot of companies that have learned \nthat the best way for them to grow small business is to become an \nexporter. So, yes, it may have started with our agricultural economy, \nwhere people started trading our agricultural products, but many of our \nagricultural markets are big export markets. Washington wheat, 90 \npercent of it is exported. Obviously, people know a lot about aerospace \nand the fact that the aerospace market is also an export market.\n  But what people do not realize is a lot of small businesses also \nbecame exporters, and they understood that the big market opportunities \nthat are out there for their products are in growing economies around \nthe globe. In fact, there is going to be a doubling of the middle class \naround the globe in the next several years. There are huge \nopportunities as those economies have higher income individuals to buy \nproducts and services.\n  So it is natural for us to want to increase exports. That is why the \nPresident has had an initiative to double exports over the last several \nyears. I think he has set it for a 5-year period. We made good progress \ntoward that growth in exports. So it really remains one of the biggest \neconomic opportunities for our country, which is to have U.S. companies \ngrow jobs by becoming exporters.\n  The Import-Export Bank costs zero to the U.S. Treasury. In fact, it \nactually generates money to the U.S. Treasury. So the notion that we \nwould let a tool of the American economy expire, which literally helps \nus grow small businesses in the United States and throughout our \ncountry, when it actually generates money to our economy and costs us \nnothing, is something that is pretty hard to believe.\n  In fact, I do not know where my colleagues are going to come up with \nthe money to pay for the $670 million hole that you will have in the \nTreasury if you do not do the Export-Import Bank. It has been a great \ntool for growing that economy. What we have heard from small businesses \nnow is that they are actually seeing their deals affected. They are in \nthe process of trying to negotiate with a country. Maybe it takes \nmonths and months to negotiate a final sale. They are showing up for \nthose negotiations, and the businesses are saying: We are going to buy \nfrom somebody else. We are not going to buy from you, U.S. \nmanufacturer. We are going buy from an Asian manufacturer because it is \nclear their credit insurance company still works and we don't have to \nwait. We don't have to wait for the uncertainty of the U.S. Senate or \nthe House of Representatives, so we are going to go ahead and do that \nbusiness deal with them.\n  In fact, we have U.S. manufacturers on the Hill today saying they are \nlosing business because the U.S. Senate will not vote on the \nreauthorization of the Export-Import Bank. So we worked very hard \nduring the trade discussion to guarantee that we would get a vote on \nthe Export-Import Bank before June 30 on a vehicle mutually agreed upon \nby the supporters here of the Export-Import Bank and Senator McConnell, \nthe Senate leader.\n  I think what we are saying is we do not think the Defense \nauthorization bill is that vehicle. Obviously, the Defense \nauthorization bill, now under criticism by the White House and \nthreatened to be vetoed, is not a vehicle that is going to get done any \ntime soon, certainly not by June 30, and that is when the Bank expires.\n  So I guess to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who \ncontinue to hide behind the Heritage Foundation and will not declare \nwhether they support the Export-Import Bank or don't support the Bank, \nthe attempt to put it on another vehicle that is not going anywhere is \nnot going to help American business and the American economy.\n  The Export-Import Bank in the State of Washington has helped generate \n$102 billion in exports and has helped over 230 exporters in our State. \nThose companies have grown their businesses. We have heard from one. In \nfact, there is a Web site you can go to for Manhasset Specialty \nCompany, which makes music stands. You can hear a lot about them and \nhow they have grown their business around the globe because they have \nused the export credit agency.\n  They do not understand why this Agency is about to collapse. They are \nconcerned about their business. What we hear from a lot of businesses \nis, if this credit agency is curtailed--which is the wish and desire of \nthe Heritage Foundation, an organization that does not even support our \nexport agenda--basically, about 25 percent of their business, on \naverage, is related to the export market. They say that about roughly \n25 percent of their employees will then end up being laid off as those \nbusiness deals are unwound over the next several months. That means \nthey will not be able to keep and retain current workers.\n  So my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, by refusing to bring \nup the Export-Import Bank on a vehicle that could be voted on by the \nHouse of Representatives before the end of June, are literally saying \nto small businesses across America: Go ahead and lay off workers; we \ndon't care.\n  Now, the reason I have been so passionate about this and out here \nfighting is not because I don't think the aerospace industry can take \ncare of itself--there is a lot of discussion that the aerospace economy \ncan be built where there are economies that will support credit agency \nfinancing--but why I am here is because there are a lot of small \nbusinesses that are crafting their products every single day to be the \nbest on the globe. They are working hard to figure out how to stay \nahead of the competition. In fact, we had a hearing when I was the \nchair of the small business committee with one of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle whose constituents said to us: You know, small \nbusiness exporting is not for wimps.\n  I thought that was a great statement. Because what they were saying \nis it is hard enough to be a small business person, take the financial \nrisk, build a company, have employees, but then you have to go to the \npoint of saying: Well, OK. I am going to ship my product to a new or \ndeveloping market. How am I going to make that work? It is not like you \ncan just go down the street and figure it out.\n  So this employer, a big manufacturer--medium-sized, small business \nmanufacturer but big in this small town said: You know, exporting is \nnot for wimps. You are taking risks. One of the things that we have \ndone as a country to help minimize the risk of that small business \nowner who is helping the U.S. economy grow by expanding his market and \nhiring new employees is to have a credit agency that provides the \ninsurance to his local bank so the deal can actually get executed.\n  Well, for some reason, many of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, after years and years and years of supporting the Export-Import \nBank, now all of a sudden do not want to support it anymore because the \nHeritage Foundation is saying it is something they should not support. \nIn fact, they are giving bonus points on a ranking system as a way to \nsay: We will reward you for trying to get rid of what has been a viable \ntool for small businesses in our economy.\n  So we hope our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will soon \nwake up to the fact that the expiration of such an important tool is \nnot in the interests of our economy and not in the interests of small \nbusinesses and will come up with a vehicle for this to get done.\n  Those on the other side of the aisle who think it is OK that the Bank \nlapses are putting about $18 billion of deals at risk that are before \nthe Bank but will not get executed if the Bank closes at the end of \nthis month. So I hope my colleagues will work toward a solution on this \nissue. I hope they understand the export credit agency is a job creator \nfor small business and will come up with a vehicle so that it must pass \nby June 30.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to \nSenator McCain and Senator Jack Reed for their leadership on the Armed \nServices Committee. It is unusual, indeed, and good for the Republic \nthat both of them are Academy graduates--though, the Navy and Army \nAcademies sometimes can be quite competitive. They get along very well \nand respect each\n\n[[Page S3656]]\n\nother, and the committee has done a very good job.\n  I understand there is some concern by some of our Members concerning \nthe desire to spend more on nondefense money and perhaps use this bill \nas a hostage to force the Congress to spend more money on other pieces \nof legislation. I think that would be a very grievous mistake. I have \nserved on the Armed Services Committee now for 18 years, for quite a \nlong time on the Budget Committee. I have spent a lot of time looking \nat the challenges we face.\n  I think the world has changed since the Budget Control Act was passed \nin 2011. In 2011, the President told us: Don't worry. We are pulling \neverybody out of Iraq and there are not going to be any more problems \nin Iraq. He did not mention ISIS. In 2011, we did not have the Russian \ninvasion of Crimea. We did not have the continued vicious, violent \nfight in Syria. We did not have the chaos that is happening in Libya. \nWe did not have the threat to the Iraqi Government's existence--we \nthought it was on the right path. We did not have the problem in Yemen.\n  So this is just a different world. Unfortunately, we are going to \nhave to spend some more money for national defense. That is just the \nway it is. I am a budget hawk. I have looked at the numbers. We are \ngoing to have to spend some more money. However, what kind of argument \ncan be made, that if you have to spend more on national defense--and we \ndo have to make some tough choices on national defense--we have to \nspend more on nondefense? What kind of an argument is that, just for \ncommonsense sake? If you were in a household budget and you had to \nspend more money on one item, you would probably spend less on the \nother items. So I would just say that the nondefense discretionary \nspending that some of my colleagues are insisting need more money \nbefore they would vote for the Defense bill, basically has flat funding \nthis year. There is not a cut in nondefense spending. It grows the next \n4, 5 years at 2.5 percent growth a year, which is faster than the \neconomy has been growing, frankly. Last quarter the economy was \nnegative.\n  So we just have to understand that we cannot hold this bill hostage \nto that kind of argument. I believe we are on the right track with a \ngood armed services bill, with very strong bipartisan support. \nApparently, over this budget issue, we lost a few votes in the \nCommittee, but it was a strong bipartisan vote for the bill. As far as \nI can tell, there are few, if any, big differences on any provisions \nthat are in the bill. So that is good. I think America is going to be \npleased that our committee was able to work effectively. So we will \nspend about $612 billion for Department of Defense and Department of \nEnergy defense issues. That is a large sum of money. It includes a base \nbudget of $497 billion and $89 billion in the Overseas Contingency \nOperations fund. It is an increase in OCO over last year, but it is \nstill well below the peak of OCO's funding that we had in years past.\n  I just have to say, the world is a more dangerous place than it has \nbeen. The legislation authorizes $135 billion for military personnel, \nincluding pay, allowances, bonuses, death benefits, and permanent \nchange of station moves. It authorizes an across-the-board pay increase \nof 1.3 percent for uniformed servicemembers in grades O-6, colonel and \nbelow.\n  The legislation authorizes $32.2 billion for the defense and health \nprograms, authorizes fiscal year 2016 Active-Duty strength for the \nArmy--475,000. Some are saying we are going to have to go to 450,000. \nMaybe we will have to go to 450,000. But right now, we need to slow \nthat reduction based on the world situation. The Navy forces will be \n329,000; Marine Corps, 184,000; Air Force, 317,000. So this is a good \nmarkup. I think it moves us in the right direction.\n  The strategic forces provisions contained in the 2016 authorization \nbill are important. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Strategic \nForces, I am pleased to inform my colleagues that the bill before them \nrepresents a bipartisan consensus in support of the President's plans \nand the Congress's plans to modernize nuclear forces and improve and \nexpand U.S. missile defense capability.\n  I want to express my particular appreciation to the ranking member, \nSenator Donnelly of Indiana, who approaches these sometimes difficult \nand controversial issues in a nonpartisan, constructive manner. He has \nbeen closely involved in every aspect of the work of the subcommittee, \nfrom the hearings we have held to the bill's final markup.\n  This year, the portion of the budget request falling under the \nsubcommittee's jurisdiction for missile defense, nuclear forces, \nmilitary space, and the Department of Energy atomic defense activities \nincluded a total of $70.5 billion, including $22.5 billion for \nprocurement, $27.8 billion for research and development, $1.4 billion \nfor operations and maintenance, and $18.7 billion for the Department of \nEnergy.\n  The Missile Defense Agency. In the area of missile defense, the bill \nfully funds the President's request of $8.2 billion for the Missile \nDefense Agency. I think we agree with that. It recommends an increase \nof $330 million for Israeli cooperative missile programs, including \nU.S. coproduction of the David's Sling and Arrow systems of Israel, and \nrecommends an increase of $50 million to support modernization of the \ninterceptor used for the U.S. ground-based midcourse defense system \nthat would protect the homeland.\n  So this needs to be done. We have to get our interceptor systems at \nthe highest level, and there are some difficulties we face now with \nthat system. I think some of the criticisms or concerns are overstated, \nbut it is not where we want it to be, and we need to be moving in that \ndirection. It can be fixed. We know that. And there are just some \nthings we need to work on there.\n  The bill recommends an increase to facilitate MDA's ongoing \ndevelopment of laser programs, which is a new system. It is different \nfrom what it has been in the past. And I am proud--I believe it has \nreal potential and a lot of other things.\n  The nuclear forces issue is significant. The bill would fully fund \nthe President's budget request to operate, maintain, and modernize the \nnuclear triad and associated systems. This is essential. We must \nmodernize these weapons, many of which are 40 years old and utilize \nvacuum tubes in their systems.\n  The bill includes an additional $1 billion in 2016 to support the \nrecommendations of the nuclear enterprise review completed in 2014. We \nneed to listen to those review systems and respond appropriately. I \nbelieve this mark does.\n  To ensure that the Department is planning for the full range of \nnuclear conflict scenarios, the bill includes a provision that would \ndirect the Department of Defense to conduct a net assessment of the \nglobal nuclear security environment, including the range of \ncontingencies and scenarios where U.S. nuclear forces might have to be \nused.\n  I would just say personally that I think it is time for us, in this \ndangerous world, to quit talking about nuclear zero--people who doubt \nour resolve sometimes doubt that we are willing to follow through. I \nwish zero would happen. It is not going to happen anytime soon, that is \nfor sure, so we are going to have to maintain a nuclear arsenal. We \nneed to talk about maintaining it, modernizing it, making it safer, and \nmaking it more reliable and more accurate. Maybe we can reduce the \nnumbers some more, but we need to be talking less about reducing \nnumbers and more about assuring the world that we have the best nuclear \ncapabilities anywhere on the planet and that they are ready to be \ndeployed and can be deployed, Heaven forbid that would be necessary. \nThat is just why we have these forces.\n  The bill includes a provision that would require the Secretary of \nDefense to develop options to respond to the Russian violation of the \n1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, including \ncountervailing, counterforce, and active defense programs. We have \nviolations going on; those can't just be accepted.\n  The Department of Energy gets funding for its defense nuclear \ncapabilities, and we continue rigorous oversight of the warhead life \nextension and construction program that would support a reliable and \nmodernized nuclear stockpile. I think we are on the right track there \nfor sure.\n  The bill includes a number of provisions to improve congressional \noversight of NNSA activities and track the\n\n[[Page S3657]]\n\nrecommendations of the Congressional Advisory Panel on the Governance \nof NNSA.\n  We need better coordination with the Department of Energy. I think we \nare moving in that direction. Over the last several years, I have \npushed for it aggressively, and I think progress is being made. More \nneeds to be done.\n  Military Space. Our whole Defense Department depends more than most \npeople realize on our ability to maintain space capabilities, and I \nthink this bill funds those programs effectively. The bill would \nrequire the Secretary of Defense, in a new idea, to designate one \nindividual to serve as the principal space control adviser who shall \nact as the principal adviser to the Secretary of Defense on space \ncontrol activities. I think that will help.\n  With respect to program oversight, the bill would prohibit the use of \nfunds for the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program or the launch of \nthe Defense Meteorological Satellite Program satellite number 20 until \nthe Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs provide a \ncertification that nonmaterial or lower cost solutions are \ninsufficient. Senator McCain has challenged us all to maintain \noversight of these programs and to contain costs. I think this can help \ndo that.\n  In conclusion, I restate my belief that our committee has worked in a \npositive way. We have taken the advice of the President and of the \nDefense Department. We have examined it in an appropriate way and \nproduced this bill that I believe will strengthen our national defense, \nwith strong backing to modernize and expand our missile defense \ncapabilities and to strengthen our deployed forces, allies, and \npartners.\n  So I hope we don't have a fuss over demands to increase spending for \nnondefense when we are supposed to be funding the Defense Department. \nIf there are arguments to be made in that regard, they should be made \non another bill when those bills come up and ought to be brought forth \nin that fashion. I think it would be wrong and a big mistake to use the \nDefense appropriations and authorization bills in any way as some sort \nof a hostage to force spending in other areas.\n  The bill is a good bill. It puts us on the right course. It has broad \nbipartisan support. If we can avoid those kinds of political \ngymnastics, I think we will be in a good position to properly take care \nof the people we have deployed to defend our country and to maintain \nthe security of our homeland.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am prepared to debate this. I have talked \nabout it before, but I am prepared to debate it extensively over the \nnext several days, and my colleagues are also.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1522 to Amendment No. 1463\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the National \nDefense Authorization Act and offer a bipartisan amendment with Senator \nPeters that will strengthen this very important underlying legislation \nwe are working on.\n  As you know, the security threats around the world continue to grow. \nA lot of experts believe that ISIS is now the best trained, best \nequipped, and best financed terror organization we have ever seen. Al \nQaeda continues to threaten our own country. If you look at what is \ngoing on around the world, Hamas and Hezbollah are constantly looking \nto wage war on Israel. The regime in Iran remains the world's No. 1 \nstate sponsor of terrorism, and they are pursuing nuclear weapons. \nChina continues to intimidate its neighbors in the South China Sea.\n  We live in a dangerous and volatile world. As a result of these \ninternational events and developments, among others, it is absolutely \nimperative that we maintain a strong national defense to protect our \nhomeland and to defend our allies.\n  With all these crises around the world competing for our attention, \nwe sometimes neglect another crisis, one that Chairman McCain has \nconstantly reminded us about, and that is the situation in Ukraine, \nwhich could easily spin out of control at any time. In fact, news out \nof eastern Ukraine this morning is particularly troubling. It appears \nthat the latest Russian and separatist attacks on Ukrainian positions \nthis morning may be the final blow to what was, in fact, a ceasefire in \nname only.\n\n[[Page S3658]]\n\n  Russia is increasingly aggressive on the European continent. We need \nto be acknowledging that and dealing with that in this underlying \nlegislation.\n  I just returned from a trip to Ukraine in April, a year after I had \nthe privilege to be there leading the congressional delegation to \nmonitor the election of President Poroshenko. I went with my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Ben Cardin. A lot has happened since that last \nelection. I learned about this in my meetings most recently with Prime \nMinister Yatsenyuk, President Poroshenko, and other Ukrainian \nindividuals. They have reached a pivotal moment in Ukraine.\n  The Ukrainian people have sacrificed in hopes of securing a \ndemocratic future for their country. However, they need our help. They \nneed sustained economic, military, and political support from the \nUnited States and from our NATO allies. It is absolutely critical to \nthis vision of a democratic Ukraine, a free Ukraine, coming to \nfruition.\n  In my view, the people of Ukraine have made a very clear and \nunequivocal choice, and we need to stand with them. Their choice is to \npursue a pro-Western, democratic path. Their government has been \nresponsive to that choice by making progress in fighting decades of \nendemic corruption that has left the country weak and, frankly, \nunprepared for the Russian aggression that has occurred. However, none \nof these reforms will mean much if Ukraine is unable to secure its \nborders or defend its sovereignty.\n  The NDAA before us has a lot of important provisions related to this \ncrisis in Crimea and along the eastern border of Ukraine. I applaud \nChairman McCain and Ranking Member Reed for their efforts on it. I hope \nwe will be able to entertain a few other amendments in this process \nthat will even strengthen the U.S. posture and support of Ukraine.\n  I look forward to being on the floor later this week to talk about \nthis situation in Ukraine in more detail. This afternoon, however, I \nhave come to the floor to talk about a related amendment that is of \ngreat importance as this situation in Eastern Europe continues to \ndestabilize.\n  Following my visit to Ukraine this spring, I visited Latvia. I went \nthere because I wanted to spend some time with U.S. soldiers from an \nAbrams tank company who were there on a NATO mission. I am sure most of \nmy colleagues know that recent force structure changes moved our two \nheavy armored brigades out of Europe. This armored unit I saw in Latvia \nand the other two companies in the Baltics today are only there on a \nrotational basis this spring, and they will soon return home to the \nUnited States, in this case to Fort Stewart.\n\n  These units are sending an important message to our allies, such as \nthose in the Baltics--and, believe me, the Latvians are extremely \nappreciative--but they are only temporary. What they are really looking \nfor is a permanent presence. That is what sends the stronger message.\n  The big news when I was over there was that there was a road march \nbeing conducted by the 2nd Calvary Regiment through Central and Eastern \nEurope. The 2nd Calvary Regiment is in Europe, but they were taking \nthis road march through Central and Eastern Europe. This was taking \ntheir Strykers, which is the only permanently stationed U.S. armored \nvehicle in Europe, on roads and through small towns--towns that fear an \nincreasingly aggressive Russia on their doorstep.\n  The unit was doing all it could to help reassure our allies and \ndemonstrate U.S. resolve, but, frankly, they were doing all they could \nwith what they have, and what they have is not enough. They do not have \nwhat they need.\n  This unit has communicated this urgently to us here in the Congress. \nTheir weapons systems are, frankly, inadequate to meet their potential \nmission requirements if they are called upon. They need a more powerful \ngun. They need to replace their .50-caliber machine gun with a 30-\nmillimeter cannon. The soldiers understand that. The Army understands \nthat.\n  The Army has already identified this requirement, and prior to the \ndeteriorating situation in Europe, they slated to field this improved \nweapons systems to these Strykers starting in 2020. So they knew it was \na problem. They knew they had to address it. Then we saw this \ndeteriorating situation in Europe caused by Crimea's being annexed and \nnow the situation on the eastern border of Ukraine.\n  The soldiers manning these Strykers today know that 2020 is just too \nfar in the future, and Army leadership agrees with them. On March 30 of \nthis year, U.S. Army Europe submitted an operational needs statement to \nArmy Headquarters to address this urgent capability gap in the 2nd \nCavalry Regiment. Specifically, according to the needs statement, the \nunit lacks ``the lethality of a direct fire weapons system to engage \nsimilar units or those supported by light-armored vehicles.''\n  On April 22, Army Headquarters validated this high priority need and \nassigned this requirement to the program manager for execution. To \nshave several years off of the fielding timeline, however, the Army \nneeds additional funding in fiscal year 2016. They need it now.\n  That is exactly what this amendment does. The review of these \nrequirements by the Army was occurring while the Defense bill was being \nmarked up in committee. The House appropriators, the first to mark up \nsince the Army communicated its requirement, have fully funded the \nneed.\n  I want to thank Chairman McCain and the ranking member for their \nconsideration and for including this important funding into this bill, \neven though the urgent need was communicated only very recently.\n  By the way, just to be clear, because I have heard discussion about \nthis on the floor today, this turret and gun system--the cannon \nitself--will be competed, and that is appropriate.\n  This increase in funding is fully offset by taking additional \nreductions from the expected surplus from the foreign currency \nfluctuations as identified by GAO. The additional reductions taken by \nthis amendment still won't match the reductions, by the way, that the \nHouse has taken from these accounts.\n  I want to thank the Members of our body here in the Senate for their \nsupport of this amendment. Senator Peters, my colleague from Michigan, \nhas been my partner on the other side of the aisle in this effort. He \nhas been a strong supporter of giving our soldiers what they need in \nEurope and sending that strong message we talked about earlier.\n  Senator Cotton talked about this issue in the Armed Services \nCommittee. He is chairman of the Airland Subcommittee, and he has \nworked hard on this, as well as have other Armed Services committee \nmembers, including Senator Inhofe, Senator Sessions, Senator Wicker, \nSenator Toomey, who is our Presiding Officer, and, of course, Senator \nMcCain.\n  This amendment is of vital importance for our forward-deployed \ntroops. It also sends a critical message at this time of great \nuncertainty in Europe. I urge my colleagues to support this. It is \nbipartisan and it is needed, and I urge its swift adoption.\n  Because of that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending amendment in order to call up amendment No. 1522.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Portman] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1522 to amendment No. 1463.\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide additional amounts for procurement and for \n   research, development, test, and evaluation for Stryker Lethality \n                  Upgrades, and to provide an offset)\n\n       At the end of title I, add the following:\n\n                       Subtitle E--Army Programs\n\n     SEC. 161. STRYKER LETHALITY UPGRADES.\n\n       (a) Additional Amount for Procurement, Army.--\n       (1) In general.--The amount authorized to be appropriated \n     for fiscal year 2016 by section 101 for procurement is hereby \n     increased by $314,000,000, with the amount of the increase to \n     be available for procurement for the Army for Wheeled and \n     Tracked Combat Vehicles for Stryker (mod) Lethality Upgrades.\n       (2) Supplement not supplant.--The amount available under \n     paragraph (1) for\n\n[[Page S3659]]\n\n     procurement for Stryker (mod) Lethality Upgrades is in \n     addition to any other amounts available in this Act for \n     procurement for the Army for Stryker (mod) Lethality \n     Upgrades.\n       (b) Additional Amount for Rdt, Army.--\n       (1) In general.--The amount authorized to be appropriated \n     for fiscal year 2016 by section 201 for research, \n     development, test, and evaluation is hereby increased by \n     $57,000,000, with the amount of the increase to be available \n     for research, development, test, and evaluation for the Army \n     for the Combat Vehicle Improvement Program for Stryker \n     Lethality Upgrades.\n       (2) Supplement not supplant.--The amount available under \n     paragraph (1) for research, development, test, and evaluation \n     for Stryker Lethality Upgrades is in addition to any other \n     amounts available in this Act for research, development, \n     test, and evaluation for the Army for Stryker Lethality \n     Upgrades.\n       (c) Offset.--The aggregate amount authorized to be \n     appropriated for fiscal year 2016 by division A is hereby \n     reduced by $371,000,000, with the amount of the reduction to \n     be achieved through anticipated foreign currency gains in \n     addition to any other anticipated foreign currency gains \n     specified in the funding tables in division D.\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, while the Senator from Ohio is here, I want \nfirst of all to commend him for his interest in the Stryker program. It \nis one of those vehicles that have been extraordinarily effective in \nprotecting our soldiers in their efforts both in Afghanistan and Iraq. \nIt is a critical program.\n  The amendment would add $371 million of funding. We all understand \nthis is a very difficult budget environment, and I would point out that \nthe Army submitted their unfunded requirement list to the committee in \nMarch. This was not on their request. However, it is my understanding \nthat the request for additional funding is driven by a new requirement \nthat actually became evident in April of 2015. So the issue could have \nbeen that they weren't as aware of it as they should have been. But for \nthe record, this is not part of the unfunded requirement list of the \nArmy.\n  We did not have the chance, as a result, to look at this as an \napproach that we would include in our Defense appropriations bill. It \nwas not literally on the radar screen until April, and it didn't come \nup formally with their unfunded request. So I am concerned that these \nlethality improvements have not been fully vetted by the committee, by \nthe Department, and also by the Department of Defense.\n  There is another issue here, too. This is a first step in a multiyear \nprogram, and we are not quite sure at this point, over the next several \nyears, how much more money we would have to commit to production, \ntesting, training, and logistics.\n  The other area of concern--not just in terms of looking closely at \nthe program, the need, and the long-term budgetary effects--is the pay-\nfor, which is an offset for foreign currency accounts. The Department's \nrequest has already been reduced by $550 million. We have literally \ntaken that money from their currency accounts, and now we are going to \ntake another $371 million. So we are really getting very, very close to \nwhat this account can bear in terms of costs added to it.\n  Again, I think since it is O is the basic account we are \ntaking it from to put in a platform--it raises the other issue that is \nso central to everything the chairman and many of us have been doing, \nwhich is how do we keep the Army ready, and there is a trade-off. There \nis a trade-off between new platforms and making sure the soldiers we \nhave are training on the existing platforms and doing their work.\n  So I would express some strong reservations. I would be happy to work \nwith the Senator from Ohio. I understand this is driven by his \ncommitment to making sure our soldiers have the best equipment in the \nworld.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, first, I appreciate the ranking member's \ncomments, and I look forward to working with him on this. We talked \nabout this on the floor a moment ago. This is something the Army has \nrequested. They came late; he is absolutely right. They did make a \nrequest in March, in terms of submitting this operational needs \nstatement, but it wasn't until April 22 that they actually validated \nthis high priority need and assigned it to the program manager. So the \ncommittee didn't have the opportunity to look at it as they have \nothers.\n  I will say it is urgent, and having just been over there and seeing \none of those temporary armored companies about to leave, they need this \nbadly. What they are saying is that the 30-millimeter cannon is \nnecessary to go up against any potential enemy, and the .50-caliber \nmachine gun simply is not. So this is not moving more Abrams tanks into \nthe area. It is taking these Strykers and upgrading them, and they have \nidentified this as an urgent need.\n  So I look forward to working with the ranking member on this. I hope \nwe can work through this, even in the next several days here, to get \nthis done, because it is so important. It will be competed. It is a \nturret and gun system. It is something that does require an offset, and \nthat offset--by the way, the account the GAO has identified as having a \ncertain amount of funding does have that much room left in it and more, \nwe are told. And also the House has already taken more out of this \ncurrency fluctuation account than the committee has.\n  So I again thank the ranking member for working on this. I know he \ntoo has a strong commitment to our soldiers who are there to be sure \nthey have what they need in order to complete their mission in an \nincreasingly volatile environment in Europe.\n  With that, I yield back for my colleague from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1486 to Amendment No. 1463\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as we begin this very important discussion \nabout how we go about the business of defending our country and \npreserving the peace and our national security, I think it is really \nimportant we look at all of the elements of American power. We are very \nfamiliar with the fact that we have the world's best military--best \nequipped, best trained, with the most technologically advanced weapons \nsystems. But we also ought to look at America's other sources of great \npower, and that means things such as soft power.\n  Let me explain. Here is the problem. Many NATO countries--our allies \nin Europe, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries--many of \nwhich are former satellites of the Soviet Union and are now being \nintimidated by the Russian Federation, rely heavily on energy resources \nfrom Russia, creating what I think can euphemistically be called a \nstrategic vulnerability. Many of them are just downright scared about \nwhat it means in terms of their ability to survive a Russian \nintimidation.\n  According to a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed by former National \nSecurity Advisor Steven Hadley and former Secretary of Defense Leon \nPanetta, 14 countries that are a part of NATO buy 15 percent or more of \ntheir oil from Russia.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, who is \nnot on the floor right now, famously said: Russia is a gas station \nmasquerading as a nation. It produces prodigious sources of energy, \nbut, unfortunately, they view energy as one of their weapons.\n  So the fact that 14 of these NATO countries buy 15 percent or more of \ntheir oil from Russia is a real vulnerability for them. Several other \ncountries in Eastern and Central Europe buy more than 50 percent of \ntheir energy supply from Russia. As I said, Russia has huge sources of \noil and gas, but they are using them not only as a source of economic \nstrength and to provide for the Russian people, but they are using them \nas a source of intimidation and coercion.\n  For example, in January of 2009, Russia effectively turned off the \nnatural gas to Ukraine. This affected at least 10 countries in Europe \nthat rely upon natural gas that crosses Ukraine from Russia. According \nto a report released last fall from the European Commission, several \ncountries in Europe could\n\n[[Page S3660]]\n\nlose up to 60 percent of their gas supply if their supply lines from \nRussia are disrupted. That is the problem.\n  Here is what I propose is one of the things we can do about it. The \nUnited States, of course, has experienced an energy renaissance in \nrecent years, thanks to the technology produced by the private sector--\nmost specifically, the use of fracking in conjunction with horizontal \ndrilling--which has turned America into an energy powerhouse. Not that \nmany years ago, people were talking about peak oil. In other words, \nthey basically were making the argument that all the oil that could \nhave been produced was being produced, and we would now then be in a \nperiod of decline. That proved to be wrong.\n  Now, thanks to this huge production of American energy, we know we \ncan use our ample energy resources not only to supply our own needs \nhere at home but to use the surplus to reassure our allies and our \npartners and to reduce their dependence on bad actors, such as Russia \nand Iran.\n  If we think about it, some of the sanctions which we have deployed \nagainst both Iran and Russia for their bad behavior--one of the most \neffective ones is the indirect sanction of lower oil and gas prices \nbecause, frankly, Mr. Putin has calculated that oil prices would remain \nvery high, and when they get low, that means he doesn't have the \nfinancial wherewithal in order to make some of the mischief that he and \nIran are so noted for.\n  The United States, of course, has significantly diversified our \nenergy resources. The United States has consumed the lowest level of \nimported petroleum in the last 30 years. That was this last year. Let \nme repeat that lest it be lost.\n  Last year, the United States consumed the lowest level of imported \npetroleum in the last 30 years. According to the International Energy \nAgency, today the United States is the largest oil and natural gas \nliquids producer in the world, surpassing Saudi Arabia, for example.\n  I have filed a number of amendments, and I intend to call up one of \nthose in a moment, but let me describe briefly the amendments we have \nfiled that I think help provide some progress toward a solution for the \nproblem I have described.\n  In light of this new geopolitical landscape, I have offered several \namendments that would further our strategic position in the world while \nalso strengthening our allies, making them less vulnerable to the \nintimidation and bullying tactics of the Russian Federation under \nVladimir Putin. These amendments aim to help NATO and our other allies \nin Europe diversify their energy resources and lessen their dependency \non energy supplies of some of our major adversaries such as Russia and \nIran.\n  The first amendment would point out the existing authorities the \nPresident already has under current law related to energy exports if he \ndetermines it is in our national interests. Of course, this is an \nauthority under current law that applies not only to the present \noccupant of the White House but would also apply to his successor.\n  This amendment expresses the sense of the Congress that the President \nshould exercise these current authorities to aid our allies and \npartners in Europe and elsewhere. To help the United States get smart \non how Russia currently uses its energy program as a weapon against our \nallies and partners, this amendment would mandate also an intelligence \nassessment to better understand the vulnerabilities of NATO and our \nother allies and partners in Europe. Then, it would also expand the \nrequirements of the Pentagon's annual Russia military power report to \nmandate analysis of Russia's ability to use energy supplies as a tool \nof coercion or intimidation against our allies and partners in Europe.\n  So this would restate the present authorities the President of the \nUnited States currently has to produce and sell oil and gas to our \nallies in Europe, such as Ukraine and other NATO allies. It would \nrequire an additional intelligence assessment to make sure we \nunderstand fully the implications of this vulnerability that Europe and \nour NATO allies have to Russia and its intimidation tactics. Third, it \nwould expand the requirements of a current report that the Pentagon \nmakes on an annual basis called the Russian military power report to \nmandate an analysis of Russia's ability to use energy supplies as a \ntool of coercion or intimidation.\n  Two other amendments which we filed--which I will not call up at this \ntime--would help reduce the need for U.S. allies to purchase energy \nfrom Russia and Iran. It would do this by adding a specific exception \nto the law that would allow crude and natural gas exports to allies and \npartners when their energy security is compromised.\n  For example, if a NATO ally or partner--such as Ukraine or Japan--\nrequests additional energy exports from the United States, the \nPresident must approve it in a timely fashion if he finds it to be in \nthe national interests of the United States. This would provide our \nallies and our partners with an additional source of fuel and a little \nadditional reassurance that if they are subjected to the kind of \nintimidation and coercion I mentioned a moment ago, that we, as their \nfriend and their ally, would supply them with an alternative source of \nenergy they need in order to keep the lights on and keep their economy \nrunning.\n  Finally, we filed an amendment that would amend the Natural Gas Act \nto require the Secretary of Energy to approve liquefied natural gas \nexports to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries and other \nnamed partners and allies. This uses the same preferential treatment \nthat is already given to our free-trade agreement partners, which are \nautomatically deemed to be in the public interest.\n  In conclusion, these amendments are designed to address a very \nspecific problem and a very specific vulnerability of some of our \nclosest allies in Europe and to relieve them from some of the pressure \nof Russian intimidation and coercion when Russia attempts to use energy \nas a weapon. We can use this as an important element of our soft power \nto help our allies relieve this coercion and intimidation.\n  These amendments would strengthen the strategic hand of the United \nStates in a world that grows more complicated by the day, not to \nmention more dangerous.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support them and, by doing so, take a \nlong-term view of our own national security as well as the peace and \nstability of some of our most trusted allies and partners.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment in order to call up amendment No. 1486.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott).

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Nuclear Agreement With Iran\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, once again, the truth proves elusive \nwhen we are dealing with Iran's unpredictable regime. I refer to a New \nYork Times article that is entitled ``Iran's Nuclear Stockpile Grows, \nComplicating Negotiations.'' Among elements of the article--and I know \nthe article is being disparaged by the State Department; I will talk \nabout that in a moment--but among the elements of the article is the \nfact that Iran's stockpile of nuclear fuel has increased about 20 \npercent over the last 18 months of negotiations--increased--increased \n20 percent in the last 18 months of negotiations.\n  In essence, we are to be convinced ``that Iran will have to shrink \nits stockpile by 96 percent in a matter of months after a deal is \nsigned, even while it continues to produce new material and has \ndemonstrated little success in reducing its current stockpile.''\n  I am reading from the Times article.\n  It goes on to say, in part, ``That means Iran . . . would have to rid \nitself of more than nine tons of its stockpile in a matter of months.''\n  In a matter of months.\n  Now, this is a continuing challenge that we have as we look at these \nnegotiations. We are supposedly in the final months. The end of this \nmonth is when we are hopefully going to come to some type of an \nagreement. We see what has been a challenge from the very beginning. It \nis a challenge I have cited time and time again.\n  How much of these numbers are done because of Iran's desire to push \nthe numbers upward? Is that for a political purpose? Is it for a \nnegotiating purpose? Is it for a technological inability? Whatever it \nis, the numbers published Friday by the International Atomic Energy \nAgency, the independent agency for which so much of the Joint Plan of \nAction and any future agreement that might be consummated--this is the \nentity we are depending upon. Well, this entity has said that Iran has \ncontinued to enrich uranium aggressively, even though it knew it was \nnot meeting its goals of converting its stockpile into reactor rods. \nThis is a real question that I have.\n  Another independent group, the Bipartisan Policy Center, said in \nFebruary that Iran has failed to do the conversion.\n  We knew from the beginning it was going to be difficult for the \nIranians to blend down rather than ship out because they have this \naversion to shipping out. This was all possible if they would ship out, \nbut they have consistently said they will not ship out their fuel. We \nknew it would be a concern if they weren't able to do what they pledged \nto do and, frankly, I am concerned.\n  I am concerned this is just another diplomatic sleight of hand by an \nuntrustworthy negotiating partner. I am concerned Iran is still saying \nit will not ship out excess low-enriched uranium but rather blend it \ndown and\n\n[[Page S3662]]\n\nstore it. I am concerned this is more of an issue than the \nadministration is willing to concede, particularly if there is no deal, \nand we, in essence, with sanctions relief have paid them to convert, \nand then they walk away with massive amounts of low-enriched uranium \nthat can be fed into their centrifuges and converted to highly enriched \nuranium.\n  Let's be clear. The tracking and verification of uranium mines and \nmills--which were often talked about as part of why we will have a \nsafeguard if there is a deal--to centrifuges only works if Iran gets \nrid of its stockpiles. It doesn't work any other way. It does not work \nany other way. The New York Times has identified a real problem with \nthe mechanisms being used to control Iran's nuclear stockpile. The \nsimplest solution would be to ship Iran's stockpile out of the country. \nThis would prevent any question of a buildup of material. However, Iran \nhas refused to do this--at least to this date publicly--and opened the \npotential for Iranian manipulation about what is going on.\n\n  There may be technical reasons for the 20-percent increase in low-\nenriched uranium, but one certainly has to wonder: Are they delaying? \nAre they really having problems building a conversion facility--\nsomething I specifically expressed concerns about early in the \nprocess--or is this simply another attempt to play fast and loose with \nthe truth, cover it up, and buy time? Is it a negotiating posture? So \nas they come closer and closer to the deadline, they have all of this \nenriched uranium, and there is this compulsion to strike a deal--not a \ngood deal but a deal at any cost.\n  While this may not be a technical violation of the Joint Plan of \nAction, the Iranians were supposed to have reached the agreed-upon \ngoal. The fact is, midway through the process, we are told there could \nbe a delay. But clearly the timetable has slipped even further away.\n  I know the State Department has gone after the article, which, in \npart, is based on facts from the International Atomic Energy \nAdministration. The administration has gone out of their way to attack \nthe premise of the article because I guess anything that would upset \nthe fundamental belief that we have to have a deal at any cost is \nproblematic for the State Department.\n  But I have to be honest with you. As I read the State Department's \nresponse, it means to me that their main response appears to be that \nIran is not in technical violation of the Joint Plan of Action because \nit still has a month left to transform all of the extra low-enriched \nuranium that it has created in recent months into oxide.\n  This pushback is pretty much something we should have expected \nbecause it is the only argument the administration actually has \navailable to it to explain this, and it is the same argument they used \nwhen many of us were raising the concerns that Iran was busting through \ntheir oil export caps set under the Joint Plan of Action every month. \nWe were consistently told: Well, next month the Iranians will ship even \nless, and therefore it will all even out. Well, the fact is that when \ntime ran out, the exports of Iran remained way above what was allowed, \nand then the administration shifted to an explanation only to suggest \nthat certain types of oil just do not count. There is always a reach \nhere to try to get a justification for Iran.\n  I think the State Department's response totally misses the point of \nthe New York Times article. The upshot of the piece is not that there \nis no way for Iran to meet its Joint Plan of Action obligations in \ntheory--in theory; it is that Iranians have stockpiled so much low-\nenriched uranium that it is all but impossible for them to meet those \nobjectives in practice. The Iranians may have calculated that they do \nnot have to do so and that the administration is not about to blow up \nan impending nuclear deal over a violation of past agreements if those \nviolations bear directly on Iranian intentions and capabilities to \nimplement the agreement.\n  There is another group who has been before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee. When I was the chairman, we called them several \ntimes, and I think Senator Corker, the new chair, has a deep respect \nfor them as well--the Institute for Science and International Security. \nThey have posted their analysis of this specific question: Will Iran be \nable to meet its obligation regarding its 5 percent low-enriched \nuranium?\n  In the response to that question, the Institute for Science and \nInternational Security, David Albright, who is arguably one of the most \nrespected voices on Iran's nuclear program, comes to this conclusion: \nIran has fallen behind in its pledge to convert its newly produced low \nenriched uranium hexafluoride into oxide form. There are legitimate \nquestions about whether Iran can produce all of the requisite LEU \noxide.\n  Iran has fed a total of 2,720 kilograms of 3.5 percent low-enriched \nuranium hexafluoride into the EUPP--the vehicle by which they \nultimately have the conversion--but it has not fed any 3.5 percent low-\nenriched uranium hexafluoride into the plant since November of 2014--\nNovember of last year.\n  By the end of June--they go on to say--in order to meet its \ncommitment under the Joint Plan of Action, Iran must finish converting \nthe 2,720 kilograms of low-enriched uranium into oxide, introduce it \ninto that vehicle and convert it into oxide.\n  They go on to say: Thus, Iran has clearly fallen behind in its pledge \nunder the Joint Plan of Action.\n  On a policy level, the institute's analysis emphasizes that Iran's \nrefusal to meet its obligation ``show the risk posed by relying on \ntechnical solutions that have not yet been demonstrated by Iran''--so \ntechnical solutions that we say: If, in fact, they can do this, this \nmay be part of our way in which we can strike a deal, but Iran has not \ndemonstrated meeting those technical solutions. Iran is under sanctions \nand in the middle of negotiations. Yet, we still cannot rely upon them.\n  I think this is a serious concern not to be minimized. This is at the \nsame time that Iran is boarding commercial ships in the Strait of \nHormuz, firing at some of them. This is the same Iran that is in the \nmidst, as a country, of going ahead and is engaged as the largest state \nsponsor of terrorism in the world, in Lebanon, in Syria, in Iraq, in \nYemen. Yet, even as we are in the midst of the negotiation, all of \nthese things are taking place, and even if we want to wall off all of \nthe nonnuclear acts of Tehran that have to worry us and concern us in \nterms of our national security and international order, as it relates \nto the nuclear portfolio, they do not seem to be headed in the \ndirection of what is clearly necessary in order to meet their \nobligations under the Joint Plan of Action. They do not seem, at least \nin this point in time, to be technically capable of doing that even \nthough these are the fixes we are looking for.\n  At the end of the day, you have to really wonder why we continue to \nfind a way to excuse Iran in every element. We had something that was \nfound independently and reported to the United Nations Security Council \ncommission that deals with questions. They were ultimately fueling one \nof their rods. This was raised and, again, it was responded to. It was \ndeemed de minimis. We had oil exports greater than what they were \nallowed. We explained it away, saying: Well, certain types of oil were \nnot counted. We have a set of circumstances where they have raised \ntheir fuel capacity, not lowered it, even as they are headed toward an \nagreement in which they have to dramatically reduce it.\n  So I have a real problem in consistently seeing the willingness to \nstretch to allow Iran to get where it is today. It is that view which \nlet the world, unfortunately, allow Iran to get to the point of a \nprecipice of having nuclear power that it can convert to a nuclear \nweapon. That is not in the national interests and security of the \nUnited States.\n  I have the intention in this period of time to consistently come to \nthe floor and raise these issues as they evolve and rear their heads at \na critical moment. I think we have to be very committed to knowing the \ntruth here.\n  While all of us aspire to have an agreement that can truly stop \nIran's path toward a nuclear weapon and that that be something which is \nnot just limited in time because the Persians have for 5,000 years been \ntrying to have the power in the hegemonic interests they have--they are \ncloser to it, from my perspective, than at any other\n\n[[Page S3663]]\n\ntime. If they already have their people suffering under sanctions as a \nresult of their actions and they are using the resources they have not \nto help their people but to continue to spread terrorism throughout the \nregion, then we can only wonder, when a deal is struck and large flows \nof money begin to return to Iran, what they will do with that money. It \nseems to me that you would have a strategy set up to think about that \nbefore you even get to a deal, assuming you can achieve a good deal.\n  But when I see them taking actions that, in my view, may not be a \ntechnical violation but are contrary to everything they are supposed to \ndo, when you have independent groups such as the Institute for Science \nand David Albright and when you have the IAEA making these \nobservations, for me, it has alarm bells and those alarm bells are \nworrying.\n  I think it is incredibly important, on what I believe is one of the \nmost significant national security and international security order \nquestions that will come before the Senate, that we not just look the \nother way but that we challenge, when these facts continue to come \nforward, about what is the truth behind them and what does it mean for \nany potential agreement and how we continue to judge Iran's actions in \nlight of any potential agreement.\n  I know we are told constantly: This is not on hope, and that it is \nall going to be verified. It is not on trust, but it is all going to be \nverified. But I have to be honest with you--it depends when you keep \ndefining what is or is not permissible. From my perspective, where we \nare headed is not what I think is in the national interest and security \nof the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I know that we have a lineup of speakers. \nWe have a speaker from Hawaii who is going to be here shortly, at which \ntime I would be very pleased to yield, but I wish to make a couple of \ncomments.\n  First, the fact that we are getting to this bill is great, because if \nyou look at the last few years, we have not had a chance to do this \nuntil late in the year. The last 2 years it was December before we \nactually got around to it. It could have been a real crisis, because I \nthink most of us in the Senate know that if we had gone to December 31, \nall kinds of things would have stopped--funding for a lot of our \nreenlistment bonuses and other things.\n  I applaud the chairman for using his influence to get this bill on \nfloor so we could go ahead and get it passed. It is something that we \nneed to make sure the people who are out there risking their lives on a \nday-to-day basis know and that they know we are having this as our top \npriority.\n  I want to make one comment about sequestration. People are talking \nabout putting equal amounts of increases--not just in the military or \nin the defense portion but also in the other portions of government, \nsuch as the IRS and the EPA--without recognition that as we went \nthrough the funding mechanism, we were taking money out of military on \na 50-50 basis with nondefense moneys, while the military is only 16 \npercent of the budget. So we have already started at a great \ndisadvantage.\n  As far as the OCO is concerned, that is kind of a desperate effort. \nIt is not the way we should be doing it, but we must have the support \nand keep the readiness up with our troops.\n  We do have some good things that are in this bill, such as funding \nfor the KC-46, the Paladin Integrated Management Program, the Long-\nRange Strike Bomber, and the F-35. So we are at least treading water \nhere.\n  I wish to say one thing, though, that I didn't approve of in this \nbill, and we may try to make some changes on the floor. It is the BRAC \nprocess. I think we all know that the base realignment and closing \nprocess has been going on since 1987. This is no time to be doing \nsomething with that. I am very pleased that we are able to continue \nthat and not see one for a period of time.\n  One thing that is consistent about BRAC rounds is that they all cost \na lot of money in the first 5 years. People, if there is ever a time in \nthe history of this body and of the military when we can't afford to \ntake money out, it is now.\n  We have addressed a couple of things. There are some things that need \nto be fixed as we move on to the floor. I know that our chairman, \nSenator McCain, has been asking people to bring down their amendments. \nI think we should be doing that, and I anticipate a lot of amendments \nwill be coming down.\n  I wish to say one thing about Gitmo. There is this myth out there \nthat somehow the terrorists think that we hurt people at Gitmo. Somehow \nthey think it is something that should be altered and should be \nchanged, but I don't believe that is the case.\n  I see the Senator from Hawaii is on the floor. I am cutting into his \ntime right now. So I am going to continue comments throughout the rest \nof the afternoon, tomorrow, and yield back the time to him, which I \nhave taken away from him for a few minutes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee for his gentlemanliness and for our ability \nto work together in spaces where we agree and when we have to disagree, \nto be agreeable about it. I really appreciate that relationship.\n  Mr. President, I wish to talk about climate change, and I ask \nunanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, climate change is real, it is caused by \nhumans, it is urgent, and it is solvable. Climate change is real, it is \ncaused by humans, it is urgent, and it is solvable. This year we have \nhad some debates about climate change on the Senate floor and a \nmajority of Members, including more than a few Republicans, have \nadmitted that climate change is real and caused by humans. We have \npassed bipartisan amendments calling for the United States to reduce \ncarbon pollution and to fight human-induced climate change. That is a \nnecessary step in the right direction, but it is not enough.\n  We need to take real action. We need to focus on real solutions, and \nhere is the exciting part. There are plenty of real-world cost-\neffective solutions to climate change. A lot of them empower every day \nAmericans, giving them more control in terms of how they get their \nenergy.\n  One of these solutions is distributed energy generation, or DG. DG is \ncreating a real revolution in the energy sector by putting individuals \nand homeowners in control. The ability to own carbon-free power \ngeneration is helping everyday Americans realize that even though \nWashington is slow in the extreme on these questions, they can be part \nof the solution.\n  DG systems are small, but they provide major benefits. They can be \nmore efficient, help promote national security, reduce electricity and \nfuel bills, and provide power during blackouts. Most important for \nfighting climate change, distributed generation lets us take advantage \nof major advances in clean energy. Through the use of renewable DG, \nsuch as small-scale wind, solar, and geothermal, Americans can take \nsimple steps to reduce their carbon footprint.\n  This is the important thing about distributed generation, and we are \nseeing it across the country in red States and blue States, among \nconservatives and liberals. You don't have to be as passionate as I am \nabout climate change to be enthusiastic about distributed generation, \nbecause nobody wants to pay more than is necessary on their electricity \nbill. The idea of generating your own electricity is very attractive to \nindividuals--regardless of their ideology, regardless of their partisan \naffiliation. This has tremendous potential to save individuals, \nbusiness, and institutions real money.\n  DG is changing the nature of the U.S. energy system. It is especially \ntrue in Hawaii, where more than 12 percent of our residents have \nrooftop solar, which is by far the highest rate in the United\n\n[[Page S3664]]\n\nStates. Rooftop solar is the most well-known renewable DG resource--and \nfor good reason. The price of solar panels has come down 80 percent \nsince 2008, and the cost to install residential systems has dropped by \nabout half since 2010--80 percent cheaper since 2008 for the panels and \nabout half as expensive just to get them on a roof since 2010. The \nprices are going down and down, and the economics are changing. What we \nthought was possible with respect to distributed generation a couple of \nyears ago is changing everything we know about the U.S. energy system.\n  In 2006, about 30,000 homes in the United States had rooftop solar. \nBy 2013, that number had risen to over 400,000 homes. According to the \nEnergy Information Administration and the Department of Energy, as many \nas 4 million homes could have solar panels within 5 years. But DG is \nfar more than just rooftop solar. Small wind systems sized for homes, \nschools, farms, and remote communities are taking off, with over 74,000 \nturbines installed in all 50 States.\n  One family in upstate New York installed a small wind turbine on its \nfarm in 2012. Rated at 50 kilowatts, it will actually run at 60 or 70 \nwhen the wind is strong. They liked it so much, three branches of the \nfamily decided to lease three 10-kilowatt turbines for their homes, \nexpecting to make back their initial investment within 5 years and to \nmake a profit after that.\n  Ed Doody, one of those farmers, says:\n\n       My wife says it's like change in your pocket. When it's \n     running, you make a little money.\n\n  Small-scale biogas systems offer farmers and ranchers opportunities \nto save money on energy and reduce methane emissions. Over 250 farms in \nthe United States have made this investment, and the economics work for \nmany more.\n  One dairy farm in California has installed a system that uses manure \nto create and capture gas to run a 700-kilowatt generator. The farm \nsaves $800,000 per year in electricity and propane expenses and will \nearn back the money from its initial investment in just 4 years.\n  As you know, I am passionate about climate change, but you don't have \nto care about climate change to be excited about distributed \ngeneration. This is going to save people money, and that is the \nexciting thing about it.\n  There are many factors that are adding to the dramatic growth of \ndistributed energy, including evolving State-level incentives and \ninterconnection standards. But the most important reason has been the \nreduction in cost, especially when it comes to solar. It is simply \ngetting cheaper for a homeowner or a farmer to see real savings by \ninvesting in clean energy.\n  A major reason for these cost reductions has been consistent, \npredictable, Federal and State support. From about 2005 until recently, \nCongress has done a fairly good job of providing consistent support for \nclean energy and distributed generation. We provided long-term tax \ncredits that helped industries scale up and appropriated funds for the \nDOE necessary to spur real innovation and bring down the costs.\n  But that consistent support has tapered off in recent years with the \nexpiration of a number of important credits. The clean energy industry \nwill suffer further when the business and homeowner tax credits for \nrenewable energy expire at the end of next year. That is why I plan to \nintroduce, in the coming weeks, a bill that would extend the homeowner \ntax credit for solar, wind, and geothermal. This credit allows \nAmericans to take control of their own energy futures, and Congress \nshould extend it.\n  The explosion in DG does pose real challenges. Electric utilities \nmust adjust to a world where power flows in all directions, and the \nlines between ratepayers and generators become blurred. This challenges \nthe traditional utility business model, and there is nowhere that is \nfacing this challenge more seriously than the State of Hawaii, where we \nhave a series of island grids and we have unprecedented penetration of \nrenewable energy into the grid. The old standard used to be a maximum \nof 15 percent of intermittent energy onto the grid, but we have parts \nof our grid that are in the 25 to 35 percent intermittent energy. So \nthere are real challenges in upgrading our grid system, upgrading our \nelectricity system, and creating a smart grid that can accommodate all \nof this distributed generation.\n\n  But it also provides opportunities for innovation and the development \nof new American markets. This is not in the distant future, this is \nhappening now. Each home, each business, each farm is now within reach \nof controlling its own energy future, often with carbon-free clean \nenergy.\n  Distributed energy is a real solution to climate change, both in the \nUnited States and around the world. It has created a revolution in \nenergy production that we must harness and accelerate for the challenge \nof climate change, but it is a challenge we meet.\n  What excites me so much about distributed generation is that as much \nas we were fighting about Keystone several months ago, as much as we \nare likely to have a fight over the Congressional Review Act, having to \ndo with the President's Clean Power Plan, as much as I am, with Senator \nWhitehouse's leadership, going to introduce a carbon fee, there are \nlots of things where we are, frankly, not going to be able to find \nagreement any time soon, there are spaces where we can work together. \nAllowing individuals to generate their own electricity and reduce their \npower bills seems to be a good place to start in terms of bipartisan \nenergy legislation.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the time to speak about this \nexciting new possibility, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Remembering Elder L. Tom Perry\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Elder L. Tom Perry, \na member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in the Church of Jesus \nChrist of Latter-day Saints. Elder Perry passed away on Saturday, May \n30, 2015, at the age of 92.\n  L. Tom Perry was a giant of a man with an even larger soul. His \nenthusiasm for life energized and inspired all who came under his \nextraordinary influence. It has been said that ideas go booming through \nthe world like cannons, thoughts are mightier than armies, and \nprinciples have achieved more victories than horsemen or chariots. \nInspiring ideas, transformational thoughts, and powerful principles--\nthese were the driving forces in Elder Perry's life and ministry and \nwhat made him such a positive force for good throughout the world.\n  It is true Elder Perry's booming voice carried his words far and \nwide, but it was his spiritual strength and positive perspective that \nset his cherished ideas on faith, family, and freedom booming to the \nfour corners of the world and into the hearts of millions.\n  As a marine, as a businessman, and as an ecclesiastical leader, Elder \nL. Tom Perry was committed to helping people elevate their thoughts and \nlives. He was a man who knew what it meant to dream big, to be bold, \nand to never accept anything less than your best. His passion for life, \npeople, and service was contagious. He was among the wave of marines to \narrive in Japan as World War II drew to a close. Though he entered as a \nmember of the occupation forces, his thoughts were focused on elevating \nthose around him. He convinced a number of his fellow servicemen to \nspend their free time rebuilding a decimated Protestant chapel. Later, \nwhile in Saipan, he similarly lifted others by repairing a Catholic \norphanage. Throughout his service as an LDS apostle, he was known for \npraising positive performance. Yet he also made sure that thoughts and \nsights were forever lifted up so individuals, families, and entire \ncommunities would strive to do, be, and become better. Elder Perry \nproved that thoughts are indeed mightier than armies.\n  L. Tom Perry was a man of principle and a man who recognized that \nbelieving in, living by, and teaching true principles was the key to \nsuccess in every area of life. He taught that the family is the bulwark \nof society and central to the strength and vitality of\n\n[[Page S3665]]\n\ncommunities and nations. He believed the principle of freedom was \nuniversal and that all people should have the privilege to live in \nliberty. He declared that freedom was not a spectator sport and that we \nall have a sacred duty to defend and protect it. His faith carried him \nthrough difficult days and trying times. The principle of faith helped \nhim help others. Elder Perry simply believed. He believed simply and \nshowed that positively and enthusiastically believing was simply a \nbetter way to live. He believed in people, even--no, especially when \nthey didn't have the faith to believe in themselves. His life \ndemonstrated that true principles have achieved more victories than \nhorsemen or chariots.\n  Elder Perry often claimed he was just an ordinary man. Yet his ideas, \nthoughts, and principles enabled him to live an extraordinary life. As \nan apostle in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, he \ntraveled the world sharing his profound testimony of Jesus Christ and \nhis love for people from every walk of life. Elder Perry reminded us \nthat we are to live our lives not by days but by deed, not by seasons \nbut by service.\n  I am thankful for the life and ministry of Elder L. Tom Perry. He \nmade a difference for his family, his community, his church, and our \nNation.\n  Mr. President, I would like to finish where I began: Ideas go booming \nthrough the world like cannons, thoughts are mightier than armies, and \nprinciples have achieved more victories than horsemen or chariots. The \nbooming legacy of Elder L. Tom Perry will echo in the hearts, \nreverberate in the minds, and warm the souls of many for generations to \ncome.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. LEE. I will.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am going to seek recognition.\n  Mr. TILLIS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, we do have Senator Alexander scheduled \nbriefly. Could I have a moment before the Senator seeks recognition?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be seeking about 5 minutes, no more. So if Senator \nAlexander comes to the floor, he will not have to wait long.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the ranking member of this important \ncommittee, the Armed Services Committee, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode \nIsland, will be offering an amendment to the National Defense \nAuthorization Act, which I support. I hold the title of vice chairman \nof the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense and have served as \nchairman of that subcommittee as well.\n  This is an awesome responsibility--to handle the authorization bill \nfor the greatest military in the world, and I salute both my friend \nSenator Reed and my friend Senator McCain for the hard work they have \nput into this bill, but there is a fatal flaw in this bill. Senator \nJack Reed addresses it, and I want to speak to it for a minute.\n  Senator McCain has stated publicly, with others on the Republican \nside, a sentiment that is shared on the Democratic side. We have to do \naway with sequestration once and for all. Sequestration is a bad idea. \nIt was supposed to be so bad that we would never see it. It was \nsupposed to be such an extreme, outrageous idea that it would never \nhappen, but it did--because when we fail to hit the budget numbers, we \nautomatically go into sequestration, which leads to across-the-board \ncuts, mindless across-the-board cuts. Those cuts hurt every agency of \ngovernment when we did it, but most of all it hurt the Department of \nDefense.\n  If there is one agency that needs to be thinking and planning ahead, \nit is the Department of Defense, and sequestration, sadly, made cuts \nmaking it impossible for the planners at the Department of Defense to \nthink ahead, to plan ahead.\n  So Senator McCain has said--Senator Reed has joined him and others \nhave been in the chorus, me included. Senator McCain has said: Once and \nfor all, we need to get rid of sequestration. We need to have a budget \nprocess here that befits a great nation, and we don't.\n  Unfortunately, this authorization bill perpetuates some of the \nfundamental flaws of sequestration instead of solving the problem.\n  I am cosponsoring the amendment of Senator Jack Reed. I believe we \nhave to eliminate the budget gimmicks that are cooked into this Defense \nauthorization bill. It doesn't do our servicemembers any service or our \ncountry any good for us to perpetuate this.\n  For the entire Federal Government to still face ultimately the threat \nof sequestration, across-the-board cuts--as vice chairman of the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee, I have heard testimony from the \nleadership of the Army, the Navy, Air Force, Marines, our Guard and \nReserve that sequester-level budgets really harm our national security, \nand it makes sense.\n  How can you plan acquisition of important equipment? How can you be \nsure you can train our courageous young men and women if there is so \nmuch uncertainty with the budget? We know these cuts are going to have \na dramatic negative impact on training for our servicemembers, grounded \nplanes, wasted wrongheaded impacts to acquisition programs and more.\n  The National Defense Authorization Act includes the same budget \ngimmick that was offered in the Republican budget resolutions. It \nincreases spending on something called overseas contingency operations \nby the same amount as sequestration would cut from the budget of the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  Let me explain. We fought two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and we \ndidn't pay for them. We added the cost of those wars to the national \ndebt.\n  So this President came in and said we have to put an end to that. So \nwe have to have actual appropriations, and we have to accept the \nreality that we may face future wars. They created an account called \nthe overseas contingency operations account anticipating that wars \nmight come along. Well, thankfully we have brought our troops home from \nIraq and Afghanistan but for the limited commitment of troops to fight \nISIS in Iraq at this moment.\n  What we have seen in this budget is the attempt to take these \noverseas contingency funds and take what was an emergency expenditure \nand build it into this budget, which is the problem. It was the wrong \nway to fix the problem earlier this year. It is the wrong way to try to \nfix sequestration now. Cranking up OCO spending on a 1-year basis just \nto get us through in the Department of Defense does nothing but add to \nour deficit and create a bigger problem next year. What are we going to \ndo next year? No answer. That is why this is a gimmick. It is not \nfixing the sequestration challenge.\n  What do the Department of Defense leaders say? Are they celebrating \nbecause they are going to get this emergency money to come ride to the \nrescue this year? No. Secretary Ash Carter testified last month to the \nAppropriations Defense Subcommittee. He criticized this approach which \nis part of the bill before us. He called it ``managerially unsound'' \nand ``unfairly dispiriting to our force.'' He then went on to say:\n\n       Our military personnel and their families deserve to know \n     their future, more than just [one budget] one year at a time. \n     . . . [O]ur defense industry partners--\n\n  Think about the contractors, for example, who are building the \nplanes, the tanks, and the ships of the future--\n\n       [O]ur defense industry partners, too, need stability and \n     longer-term plans, not end-of-year crises or short-term \n     fixes, if they're to be efficient and cutting edge as we need \n     them to be.\n\n  That is what the Secretary of Defense said.\n  Then General Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, came in \nuniform. What did he say about the budgetary approach we have before us \nin this bill? He emphasized that it, too, created problems because of \nthe lack of predictability in defense budgets.\n  In testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Admiral Gortney \nof Northern Command and General Kelly of Southern Command pointed out \nthat numerous domestic agencies also contribute to our national \nsecurity, and they noted the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, \nand other law enforcement agencies that are all subject to these \nacross-the-board cuts. So if we say that in the name of America's \nnational security defense and security, we are going to take care of \nthe\n\n[[Page S3666]]\n\nDepartment of Defense and then subject all these other agencies to \nacross-the-board cuts, we will diminish protection for America. These \nagencies are important, too, not just the Army, Navy, Air Force, \nMarines, Coast Guard, but also the FBI. For goodness' sake, they fight \nterrorism every day. The Department of Homeland Security has the same \nresponsibility, the same type of mission. As we go through the list on \nthe so-called nondefense side, we find a lot of agencies that are \ncritically important to keeping America safe, and this approach in this \nbill does nothing for them.\n  This gimmick will also come at the expense of other programs not \ndirected exclusively at homeland security and national defense.\n  So if the Department of Defense gets relief from sequestration by \nusing this overseas contingency operations maneuver, what are the odds \nthat we are going to do the same for the FBI, the Department of \nHomeland Security, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Veterans' \nAdministration, the National Institutes of Health, or America's \ninfrastructure?\n  Let me say a word about that. The last time we did sequestration, I \nam embarrassed to say that we did an across-the-board cut at the \nNational Institutes of Health. It was so damaging to NIH--which is the \npremier medical research agency in the world--it was so damaging that \nthey are still trying to recover today. Before we went into \nsequestration--consider this--if you had an application for a medical \ngrant at NIH, your chances before sequestration were one out of three. \nOne out of three. After sequestration and the cuts that took place--one \nout of six.\n  There was recently a Fortune magazine which had a cover story about \nthe Alzheimer's crisis facing America. I have done a little work in \nthis area, and it is frightening to think about what we face. One \nAmerican is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease every 67 seconds in our \nNation. I didn't believe that number and challenged my staff. They are \nright. Once every 67 seconds.\n  Last year, we spent $200 billion in Medicare and Medicaid when it \ncame to the Alzheimer's patients across America. That didn't even touch \nthe amount of money families put into the care of their loved ones who \nare suffering from this disease. The projection of the rate of growth \nof Alzheimer's in America says that in just a few years, we will be \nspending more than $1 trillion a year on that disease alone--the \ngovernment, over $1 trillion a year.\n  The Fortune magazine article--and the reason I rushed to buy it--says \nthat at least two major pharmaceutical companies are starting to \ndevelop research that is promising to treat the onset of Alzheimer's, \nthe early stages, and perhaps to alleviation some of the suffering. We \nhave new imaging devices that are coming through that really can show \nAlzheimer's in living human beings at the earliest stages when it can \nbe treated or at least ultimately should be treated--let me make \ncertain I say that correctly.\n  But if you look at these breakthroughs, as promising as they are, you \nwill find that in every single instance, the National Institutes of \nHealth was there before, doing the basic research leading to the new \ndrugs that are being developed, leading to the new technology. What \nhappens when you go through sequestration and cut the National \nInstitutes of Health? You stop the research. You slow it down, at \nleast, and in some areas actually stop it. Is that really in the best \ninterests of this country?\n  So when we come to the rescue of the Department of Defense, as we \nshould, and we say that the Budget Act--sequestration--has to come to \nan end when it comes to the Department of Defense, we can't ignore what \nsequestration's across-the-board cuts will do to so many other \ncritically important agencies, such as the National Institutes of \nHealth. Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking member of the \nArmed Services Committee, is going to offer an amendment to try to \naddress this honestly and directly, and I am going to support him.\n  Let's talk about infrastructure for a minute. Two weeks ago on the \nfloor of the Senate, we gave the 33rd short-term extension of the \nFederal highway program, a short-term, 60-day extension. Let me ask, if \nyou are planning to build an interstate highway, is 60 days enough? \nHardly. Most of our Transportation bills have been long-term bills, 5- \nand 6-year bills, as they should be.\n  There are some Members of the Senate who question whether there \nshould be a Federal program, but most of us believe there should be. \nAnd if there is going to be one, we can't limp along every 60 days or 6 \nmonths in funding it. Keeping this Budget Control Act and sequestration \nguarantees we are going to face this over and over again until Congress \nfaces its responsibility.\n  The unfortunate reality is, if Congress cannot tackle the issue of \nsequestration honestly, directly, and head-on, our domestic agencies \nwill likely be stuck with these artificial caps for years. America will \npay a heavy price for our inability and unwillingness to tackle this \nchallenging issue.\n  The Senate should be providing real sequestration relief not only to \nthe Department of Defense but to all of the agencies of our government \nthat do such important work. That should be our focus--not a budget \ngimmick using overseas contingency funds to get through 1 year with the \nDepartment of Defense but something more befitting of a nation like \nours that deserves real leadership.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Ranking Member Jack Reed's critical \namendment so that we can begin to get serious about the challenges that \nface us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TILLIS.

It has to do with whether 22 million undergraduate students in \nAmerica can afford to go to college and whether millions more high \nschool students can look forward to going to college, and then we have \nmillions more in graduate school who are continuing their education.\n  This affects our country as vitally as any subject, and I thought I \nwould report to the full Senate and to the American people on the \nexcellent, bipartisan hearing we had. This was the fourth hearing we \nhave had in Congress on the reauthorization of the Higher Education \nAct. Our committee has already come to an agreement on a bill to fix No \nChild Left Behind that includes continuing important measurements of \nhow we measure the progress of students in schools in America and then \nrestore to States the responsibility for figuring out what to do about \nthat.\n  We have 22 members on our committee, and we represent as much \ndiversity of opinion in the Senate as exists, which is a lot of \ndiversity of opinion. Yet, our work on fixing No Child Left Behind was \nunanimous.\n  Our next step will be to reauthorize the Higher Education Act that \naffects more than 6,000 colleges and universities in America. I am \nworking with Senator Murray, the Senator from Washington, who is the \nranking Democrat on the committee, and we hope to have that bill ready \nfor the committee's consideration in early September.\n  The question before us this morning was, Can you afford to pay for \ncollege? I believe the answer for most Americans is yes, and for \nmillions of Americans 2 years of college is free. It is never easy to \npay for college, but it is easier than many think, and it is unfair and \nuntrue to make students think they can't afford college. We should stop \ntelling students they can't afford college.\n  Four weeks ago, I spoke at the graduation of 800 students from \nWalters State Community College in Morristown, TN. Half of those \nstudents were low income. Their 2 years of college was free or mostly \nfree because taxpayers provided them a Federal Pell grant of up to \n$5,700 for low-income students and the average community college \ntuition in the country is about $3,300. So for the nearly 4 out of 10 \nundergraduate students in our country who attend roughly 1,000 2-year \ninstitutions, college is affordable. That is especially true in \nTennessee, where our State has made community college free for every \nstudent who graduates from high school.\n  In addition to that 40 percent of students who attend the 2-year \ncolleges, another 38 percent of undergraduate students go to public 4-\nyear colleges and universities where the average tuition is about \n$9,000. For example, at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville,\n\n[[Page S3668]]\n\none-third of the students have a Federal Pell grant to help pay for \ntheir tuition, and 98 percent--virtually all--of the instate freshmen \nhave a State HOPE Scholarship, which provides up to $3,500 annually for \nfreshmen and sophomores and up to $4,500 for juniors and seniors. So \nfor most students, 4 years at a public university is affordable, and \nthese include some of the best colleges and universities in the world.\n  What about the 15 percent of students who go to private universities \nwhere the average tuition is $31,000? Well, I will give an example of \none of those universities. I had dinner this week with Jack DeGioia, \nthe president of Georgetown University. He told me that the cost at \nGeorgetown is about $60,000 annually. Here is how they deal with that.\n  He said: First, we determine what a family can afford to pay. Then we \nask students to borrow $17,000 over 4 years from the Federal \nGovernment, to which they are entitled. Then we ask the student to work \nfor 10 to 15 hours under our work-study program.\n  President DeGioia said: Then we pay the rest of the $60,000, which \ncosts Georgetown University about $100 million a year.\n  He said that 21 other private universities that work together on \nfinancial aid policies have about a similar policy. He also said that \nHarvard, Yale, Stanford, and Princeton are even more generous. So even \nthese so-called elite universities may be affordable for students in \nAmerica.\n  Finally, another 9 percent of students will go to for-profit colleges \nwhere tuition averages about $15,000 a year.\n  Despite all of this, let's say your family is still short on money to \npay for college. Well, taxpayers will loan you money on generous terms. \nWe hear a lot about student loans. These are some of the questions \nbeing asked: Are taxpayers being generous enough? Some Senators say we \nneed to be more generous. Is borrowing for college a good investment? \nAre students borrowing too much? One way to answer these questions is \nto compare student loans to automobile loans.\n  When I was 25 years old, I bought my first car. It was a Ford \nMustang. The bank made my father cosign the loan because I had no \nassets and no credit rating. It made me mad, but I had to do it. I had \nto put up the car's collateral and I had to pay off the loan in 3 \nyears.\n  Compare that to your opportunity if you are an undergraduate student \ntoday. You are entitled to borrow $5,000 or $6,000 from the taxpayers \neach year. It doesn't matter what your credit rating is, you don't need \ncollateral, and the fixed interest rate for your loan is 4.29 percent \nthis year.\n  It gets better. When you pay your loan back, you don't have to pay \nmore than 10 percent of your disposable income each year, and if that \nrate of payoff doesn't pay it off in 20 years, the loan is forgiven.\n  The next question I hear is, Is your student loan a better investment \nthan your car loan? Well, cars depreciate the minute you drive them off \nthe lot. The College Board estimates that a 4-year degree will increase \nyour earnings by $1 million on average over your lifetime.\n  A third question I hear is, Is there too much student borrowing? The \naverage debt of a graduate from a 4-year institution is about $27,000 \nor about the same amount as the average new car loan. About 8 million \nundergraduate students will borrow about $100 billion in Federal loans \nnext year. The total amount of outstanding student loans is $1.2 \ntrillion. That is a lot of money, but the total amount of outstanding \nauto loan debt in the United States is $950 billion. I don't hear \nanyone complaining that the economy is about to crash because we have \nnearly $1 trillion worth of auto loans, nor do I hear that taxpayers \nshould do more to help borrowers pay off their auto loans.\n  You might ask: What about all of those students with over $100,000 in \nstudent loan debt we hear about? The answer is that student loan debt \nof over $100,000 make up only 4 percent of student loans, and 90 \npercent of those are doctors, lawyers, business men and women, and \nothers who have earned graduate degrees.\n  Nevertheless, it is true that college costs have been rising and that \na growing number of students are having trouble paying back their \ndebts. According to the U.S. Department of Education, about 7 million \nor 17 percent of Federal student loan borrowers are in default, meaning \nthey have not made a payment in at least 9 months. The total amount of \nloans currently in default is $106 billion or about 9 percent of the \ntotal outstanding balance of Federal student loans. The Department says \nthat most of these loans get paid back to the taxpayer one way or \nanother.\n  The purpose of our hearing this morning was to find ways to keep the \ncost of college affordable and to discourage students from borrowing \nmore than they can pay back. Here are five steps the Federal Government \ncan take to accomplish that:\n  No. 1, stop discouraging colleges from counseling students about how \nmuch they should borrow. The Federal law and regulations actually \nprevent colleges from requiring financial counseling for students, even \nthose clearly at risk for default who may be overborrowing.\n  At a March 2014 hearing before our committee, we heard from two \nfinancial aid directors who said that there was no good reason for \nthis. One said:\n\n       Institutions are not allowed to require additional \n     counseling for disbursement. We can offer it, but we're not \n     allowed to require it. And without the ability to require it, \n     there's no teeth in it.\n\n  No. 2, help students save money by graduating sooner--for example, \nour bipartisan FAST Act that Senators Isakson, Burr, and I on this side \nof the aisle and Senators Bennet, Cory Booker, and Angus King on that \nside of the aisle have sponsored, would make Pell grants available \nyear-round to students so they can complete their degrees more quickly \nand start earning money more rapidly with their increased knowledge and \nskills.\n  No. 3, make it simpler to pay off student loans. There are nine \ndifferent ways to pay off student loans. The Federal Government offers \nvery generous repayment options. One allows you to pay 10 percent of \nyour disposable income every year, and if that doesn't pay it off after \n20 years, the loan is forgiven. Last week, I met a college president \nfrom Tennessee who said he spent 9 months trying to help his daughter \npay off her student loan, and he needed the help of a financial aid \nofficer.\n  We have legislation introduced by Senator Burr and Senator King and \nsponsored by others, as well as those of us I just mentioned, to \nsimplify the application and the repayment options for Federal student \nloans.\n  No. 4, allow colleges to share in the risk of lending to students. If \ncolleges have skin in the game--a concept that Senator Reed of Rhode \nIsland and I with others have suggested should be seriously explored--\nit could provide an incentive to colleges to keep costs down and ensure \nstudents borrow no more than they can pay back. Senator Durbin and \nSenator Warren have also worked with Senator Reed on introducing \nlegislation on this subject.\n  No. 5, point the finger at ourselves. Congress is the culprit for the \nhigh cost of tuition across this country more than many Members of \nCongress would like to admit. The main reason State aid to public \nuniversities is down is the imposition of Washington Medicaid mandates \nand a requirement that States maintain their level of spending on \nMedicaid.\n  For example, in the 1980s when I was the Governor of Tennessee, \nMedicaid was 8 percent of our State budget and the State was paying 70 \npercent of the cost to go to the University of Tennessee. Today, \nMedicaid is 30 percent of Tennessee's State budget and the State is \npaying roughly 30 percent of the cost to go to the University of \nTennessee.\n  It is pretty simple. Lower State support has caused higher tuitions, \nand the decrease in State support, in my opinion, is mainly because the \nFederal Government's Medicaid mandates have made the Medicaid Program \nso expensive while tying the hands of States so much that Governors \nhave to take money from higher education and direct it toward Medicaid; \ntherefore, tuition is up.\n  That isn't the only thing the Federal Government does to cause the \ncost of college to go up. A couple of years ago, four of us on the \neducation committee--Senators Mikulski and Bennet, Democrats; and \nSenator Burr and I, Republicans--invited a group of distinguished \neducators to do a study of\n\n[[Page S3669]]\n\nthe cost of Federal regulations on the over 6,000 higher education \ninstitutions. The group did an excellent job and came back with 59 \nspecific recommendations about how to simplify the Federal regulation \nof colleges and universities, saving money, saving time. Time and money \nthat would be better spent on education.\n  Chancellor Zeppos of Vanderbilt University and Chancellor Kirwan of \nthe University System of Maryland were the two leading this project. \nChancellor Zeppos described the Federal regulation of higher education \nas having ensnared colleges in a jungle of red tape.\n  Chancellor Zeppos took another step: He hired the Boston Consulting \nGroup to tell Vanderbilt University how much Federal regulation of \ncolleges and universities cost Vanderbilt during the year 2014. The \nanswer was $150 million in order to comply with well-intentioned rules \nand regulations from the Federal Government.\n  What does that have to do with tuition? Well, spread that out among \nVanderbilt students, and it equates to $11,000 in additional tuition \nfor each of Vanderbilt's students. Mr. President, $11,000 per student \nis $2,000 more than the average tuition at State universities across \nthis country. That is the average tuition for institutions like the \nUniversity of Georgia, the University of Tennessee, and the University \nof Florida. So the Federal Government, through its Medicaid mandates \nand excessive regulation of colleges and universities, is driving up \ntuition and increasing college costs and discouraging students from \ngoing to college.\n  We should take steps to make college more affordable, but we should \nalso cancel the rhetoric that is misleading and causes many students \nand families to believe they cannot afford college. It is untrue and \nunfair to say this. It is untrue because if you are a low-income \ncommunity college student, your education may be free or nearly free \nthanks to a Federal Pell grant. And 38 percent of our college students \nattend those 2-year schools.\n  If you are an in-state low-income student at the University of \nTennessee, Knoxville, between a Pell grant and a HOPE Scholarship, you \nhave already covered 75 percent of your tuition and fees. That is the \nopportunity for another 40 percent of our students who attend public \nuniversities.\n  Even at elite, private universities, if you are willing to borrow \n$4,500 a year and work 10 to 15 hours a week, many of these \nuniversities will help pay the amount your family isn't able to pay, so \nyou can afford what would appear to be an insurmountable sticker price \nof $50,000 or $60,000.\n  If you still need to borrow money in order to help pay for a 4-year \ndegree, your average debt is going to be roughly equal to an average, \nnew car loan, and your college loan is a better investment than your \ncar loan. Student loans are also a better investment for our country. \nAs Dr. Anthony Carnevale of Georgetown University says, without major \nchanges, the American economy will fall short of 5 million workers with \npostsecondary degrees by 2020.\n\n  So I urge my colleagues to follow the Senate education committee. The \nCommittee is well on our way to preparing legislation that we hope to \nhave ready for the full Senate early in the fall to reauthorize the \nhigher education system in America.\n  We hope to simplify college regulations. We hope to make it simpler \nto apply for a Federal grant or loan to pay for college. We hope to \nmake it simpler for students to pay off their loans. We hope to instill \nyear-round Pell grants so students can go through college more rapidly \nand get into the workforce. We hope to allow students to be able to \napply for student aid in their junior year of high school rather than \ntheir senior year, which will permit them to shop around and make it \neasier to obtain the information they need. We will also take a look at \naccrediting, and we will try to understand better ways to accommodate \nthe tremendous amount of innovation that is coming our way because of \nthe Internet in terms of new ways of learning.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na 1-page summary of the FAST Act, which was introduced by Senator \nBennet and myself, along with Senators Booker, King, Burr, and Isakson, \nto simplify and reform the Federal student aid process.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Financial Aid Simplification and Transparency (FAST) Act\n\n       Eliminates the Free Application for Financial Student Aid, \n     or FAFSA by reducing the 10-page form to a postcard that \n     would ask just two questions: 1--What is your family size? \n     And, 2--What was your household income two years ago?\n       Tells families early in the process what the federal \n     government will provide them in a grant and loan by using \n     earlier tax data and creating a simple look-up table to allow \n     students in their junior year of high school to see how much \n     in federal aid they are eligible for as they start to look at \n     colleges.\n       Streamlines the federal grant and loan programs by \n     combining two federal grant programs into one Pell grant \n     program and reducing the six different federal loan programs \n     into three: one undergraduate loan program, one graduate loan \n     program, and one parent loan program, resulting in more \n     access to college for more students.\n       Enable students to use Pell grants in a manner that works \n     for them by restoring year-round Pell grant availability and \n     providing flexibility so students can study at their own \n     pace. Both provisions would enable them to complete college \n     sooner.\n       Discourages over-borrowing by limiting the amount a student \n     is able to borrow based on enrollment. For example, a part-\n     time student would be able to take out a part time loan only.\n       Simplifies repayment options by streamlining complicated \n     repayment programs and creating two simple plans, an income \n     based plan and a 10-year repayment plan.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the middle of the last century, our \nMichigan automakers were selling thousands of cars and trucks to an \noutstanding and expanding American middle class. We are proud to build \nthose automobiles in Michigan.\n  Unfortunately, the roads of that day were too narrow, and it took \ndrivers and truckers much too long to get to their destinations. Our \nNation's leaders recognized that these delays were hurting our workers' \nproductivity and stifling the American economy.\n  In October of 1964, President Dwight D. Eisenhower made a trip to \nDetroit and speaking in Cadillac Square he declared: ``We are pushing \nahead with a great road program that will take this Nation out of its \nantiquated shackles of secondary roads and give us the types of \nhighways we need for this great mass of automobiles.''\n  Of course, this vision gave rise to the interstate highway system \nwhich ignited the American economy, and by the late 1950s, our new \ninterstate highways were responsible for 31 percent of the annual \nincrease in the American economy. That is quite amazing, when we think \nabout that. Our highways were the envy of the world, which is why other \nnations that aspire to be like us, now as economic superpowers, are \ninvesting in their infrastructure--from China to Brazil and everywhere \nin between--in roads and bridges and airports and seaports and all of \nthe other infrastructure they know supports a robust, growing economy.\n  President Eisenhower, the architect of our interstate highway system \nwas, of course, a Republican. So it is ironic that 60 years later my \nRepublican colleagues are the ones blocking us from building on \nPresident Eisenhower's legacy for growing the economy by investing in \nlong-term infrastructure--not 60 days, not 30 days, not 6 months, but \nlong-term infrastructure investment.\n  Over the last 6 years, Congress has passed short-term extensions over \nand over again, repeatedly patching over the shortfall in the highway \ntrust fund. Today, we are actually at a point where we are 57 days away \nfrom the highway trust fund actually going empty--shutting down--57 \ndays before the highway trust fund is empty.\n  This is no way to invest in our country and jobs and the roads and \nbridges and other infrastructure we need to support a thriving economy. \nIt makes it hard for States and for local transportation agencies to \nplan. The uncertainty drives up costs, as we all know.\n\n[[Page S3670]]\n\n  The World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report from 2014 to \n2015 ranked America 16th in the quality of our roads--16th in the \nquality of our roads in the world--one spot below Luxembourg and just a \nlittle bit ahead of Croatia. Now, if that isn't something that \nmotivates all of us to come together around a long-term plan for \ninvesting in our roads and bridges and other infrastructure, I don't \nknow what should. America, the world's superpower, is 16th in the world \ntoday in terms of investing in the future of our economy and what we \nneed for fixing roads and bridges and other infrastructure investments.\n  The American Society of Civil Engineers' most recent report card for \nAmerica's roads and bridges gave our roads a D--a failing grade. We \ntalk about the importance of education and striving for excellence for \nour children in schools, yet we have been given--the Congress--a \nfailing grade of D for lack of action and vision and investment in \nlong-term infrastructure spending in our country. It said that 42 \npercent of the major urban highways are congested, that this costs $101 \nbillion in wasted time and fuel every year--$101 billion every year, \nyear after year that we don't address this--and countless jobs. And on \nthe other side, we all know that investing in long-term infrastructure \ncreates good, middle class jobs. Why in the world we are not coming \ntogether and making this a top priority is beyond me.\n  Since we can't afford to effectively repair and replace our bridges, \nengineers have to add plywood and nets--if you are driving along and \nlook up and see the plywood and nets--to the bottom of bridges so they \ndon't crumble and fall on to cars. We have had pieces fall down on to \nthe road over the last number of years. In fact, that is what happened \nto a motorist in Maryland back in February.\n  Just a few miles from here, the Arlington Memorial Bridge, a historic \nbridge, has corroded support beams and columns and big signs on it now \nwith lane closures in both directions for the next year because of \nemergency repairs. This is the Capital of the United States of America \nwe are talking about and the Arlington Memorial Bridge.\n  Across the country, potholes are getting bigger, freeways are getting \nmore congested, and our workers, our schoolchildren, our products--\nagricultural products, manufacturing products--and small businesses and \nlarge businesses trying to get to market are caught in gridlock.\n  In my home State of Michigan, the average person pays $154 a year to \npay for improvements to roads and bridges. That is actually the lowest \nin the Nation, not nearly enough for what we ought to be doing to \ninvest in improvements. Because of the poor road conditions in Michigan \nand the damage to cars, the average person spends $357 a year to fix \ntheir car--more than a lot of the efforts we have talked about in terms \nof looking for a long-term solution to be able to fund the highway \ntrust fund when it runs empty in 57 days.\n  I have heard from workers in Michigan who hit potholes on their way \nto work and had to stop on the way to work to go to a repair shop. Some \ntell me they have to swerve around major potholes. I drive, of course, \nMichigan roads all of the time, going home almost every weekend, and I \nam constantly doing that. I have had to take my car in as well to get \nmajor repairs--realignments, new tires--because of what is happening on \nthe roads.\n  This is a case where we know what the cure is for the disease, but \ninstead we are treating the symptoms. Instead of fixing the roads, we \nare fixing our cars. That makes no sense. It is shortsighted. Our \neconomy depends upon having roads and bridges and rail that is safe and \neffective across the country--short rail, by the way, for our farmers \nand agriculture and the passenger rail that is so critical. We have \nseen what happens when there are not safety provisions and when \ntragedies occur.\n  Our infrastructure is crumbling in the United States of America. Who \nwould ever have thought we would have gotten to this point, 57 days \nuntil the highway trust fund is empty--57 days?\n  A previous generation of Americans responded to this challenge to \ninvest and to build America by making bold investments that powered our \neconomy into the 20th century, that made us an economic powerhouse, \nthat created the greatest middle class in the world. Now, the question \nis how our generation will respond to the challenges of putting in \nplace the investments, the plans, the commitments to not only fix our \nroads and bridges but to be able to create the infrastructure that will \ntake us to the next level in terms of spurring jobs in the economy.\n  There is talk that once we get to the end of 57 days, we will just \nkick the can down the road again. How about this time until December? \nThat is a good time for finding some patch of putting together $10 \nbillion or $11 billion to be able to get us to the end of the year. And \nof course what do we say to communities, to cities, to States? What do \nwe say to the county road commissions in Michigan? What do we say to \nthose who are trying to negotiate contracts and are spending more money \nbecause of the stop-start short-term efforts? What do we say to those \nspending hundreds of dollars a year trying to fix their cars and \nwondering what in the world is going on with something so basic--so \nbasic--as roads and bridges and other infrastructure? And yet every \ntime we get to a place where a decision needs to be made, the decision \ngets kicked down the road.\n\n  If there is one thing we have learned, it is that short-term patches \ndon't fix long-term potholes. It is time to step up now. We are tired \nof seeing this happen over and over. Where are the hearings? Where are \nthe bills on the floor? We have 57 days. That is enough time to get a \nlong-term plan together, to find a bipartisan plan. There are a number \nof different alternatives. Colleagues on both sides of the aisle have \nproposed solutions, and 57 days is enough time for us to be able to \ncome together.\n  First, we need to have hearings, and we need to see bills reported to \nthe floor. Where is the activity going on, the sense of urgency about \nthe fact that in 57 days the highway trust fund will be empty?\n  We are committed to working with colleagues in a bipartisan way to \nfind solutions. Every time we see a short-term patch, a short-term \nextension happen, we are letting down our businesses, our workers, our \nfarmers, and the next generation of Americans. It is time--it is \npastime--to have a long-term fix.\n  Frankly, I know what difference it makes when we can put in several \nyears of policy in funding in an area of the economy. We came together \nto do that last year, and I am very proud of the work that we all did \ntogether on a bipartisan basis for rural America--for farmers, for \nranchers--when we put together the farm bill, a 5-year bill of economic \npolicy, funding, and investments that allowed people to plan, allowed \ncommunities to grow, allowed rural development to happen, and \nbusinesses to be able to invest, providing the economic certainty that \nthey needed for looking longer than 2 months or 6 months. We need to do \nthat as it relates to the highway trust fund. We are long past doing \nthat.\n  The time has come for a long-term fix. It is time for our generation, \nand it is time for our Republican colleagues who have traditionally \nworked with us on a bipartisan basis to emulate the bold action of the \nprevious generation. President Eisenhower said in 1952: ``A network of \nmodern roads is as necessary to defense as it is to our national \neconomy and personal safety.'' Fixing roads and bridges, expanding the \nability for business to move and for agriculture to move and to create \njobs should not be a partisan issue. We should not be at an impasse \nhere. We should not be coming to the floor every day--which we will be \ndoing--to count this down. What we ought to be doing is sitting \ntogether in committee, sitting together and working on a solution to \nget it done in the next 57 days. That is what we need to be doing.\n  I think it is important for each of us to answer this question: Are \nyou happy with the D on America's report card on the roads? Is D \nenough? We would certainly not say that to our kids. Are you willing to \nlet Croatia pass America in the Global Competitiveness Report? Croatia \nwith better roads and better bridges than the United States of \nAmerica--really?\n  Are we willing to spend the resources that we need to work together \nto find\n\n[[Page S3671]]\n\na bipartisan solution to fix our roads and bridges, to invest in safe \nrail and in opportunities for us to have the infrastructure and \ntransportation we need? Are we going to force American drivers to pay \neven more on repairs year after year after year? Are we going to be \nlike Ike or are our Republican colleagues in the majority going to just \nkick the can down the road one more time?\n  In Eisenhower's time there was a bipartisan agreement for investing \nin America's infrastructure. We can do that again. There is absolutely \nno reason why we should not be able to do that. We have to come \ntogether. Republican colleagues who chair the committees need to be \nsending us a signal. We need to be holding hearings and working \ntogether to develop bills and bringing bills to the floor and debating \nthem and making clear that now is the time to get it done.\n  Don't kick the can down the road again. Step up. Let's fix our roads \nand bridges. Let's invest in rebuilding America for the future. Let's \ncreate jobs and send a signal that we can work together to get that \ndone in the 57 days until the highway trust fund is empty--57 days. It \nis enough time to do it if people think this is important. I hope they \nwill.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have come to the floor this evening to \njoin my colleague Senator Heitkamp from North Dakota and to follow \nSenator Cantwell from Washington, who spoke earlier this afternoon to \ntalk about the importance of taking action to reauthorize the Export-\nImport Bank before that Bank expires at the end of this month.\n  At the end of June, the charter for the Export-Import Bank will \nexpire, and that means billions of dollars of lending by the Bank to \nsupport American manufacturing and exports will come to a halt. I am \nsad to say that what we face right now is a completely unnecessary \ncrisis. There is bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate \nfor the Export-Import Bank, but we have just days until the charter \nexpires. We need to begin now the process of reauthorizing this \ncritical job-creating program.\n  I know there may be some different ideas in this Chamber about what \nthe reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank should look like. I have \nintroduced a bill that would reauthorize the bank for 7 years instead \nof 4, which has been one of the proposals. My bill would raise the cap \non the lending for the Export-Import Bank instead of keeping it flat, \nand I know there are other discussions around language that addresses \nthe financing of coal-fired powerplants abroad. But regardless of our \ndifferent views on the specifics of the reauthorization bill, Democrats \nand Republicans should all be able to agree that letting the Bank \nexpire would be bad for America's businesses, bad for the employees of \nthose businesses, and bad for our economy. That is because the Export-\nImport Bank supports American jobs at zero cost to taxpayers.\n  Let me just say that again, because I think there is this perception \nin some quarters that because we don't have an agreement on \nreauthorization, there must be some huge cost involved to the Export-\nImport Bank. In fact, it is just the opposite. The Export-Import Bank \nputs money into the Treasury of the Federal Government. It doesn't take \nmoney out.\n  In New Hampshire the Bank has supported $314 million in export sales \nfor our businesses since 2009. That support translates into more \nexports, into more manufacturing, and ultimately into more jobs.\n  Just this morning we had a number of businesses that rely on the \nExport-Import Bank come in to speak to some of the Senators. One person \nwho was very eloquent with his comments was Michael Boyle from Boyle \nEnergy in New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nMichael Boyle's statement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Examining the Export-Import Bank's Reauthorization Request and the \n                 Government's Role in Export Financing\n\n       BES is an exporter of U.S. Patented Commissioning \n     Technology know as SigmaCommissioning. The most advanced \n     equipment and engineered process available in the world \n     today. BES and Sigma significantly helps its clients \n     (global energy companies) start (commission) their energy \n     infrastructure projects for far less cost, fuel, water and \n     time.\n       In short, we convert the largest power plants and \n     refineries from a construction environment into an operating \n     environment faster, less costly and with a higher degree of \n     quality than is available anywhere else in the world.\n       In the first 10 years of BES's history we did 90% of our \n     work in the US.\n       We then spent 4 years inventing and perfecting our new \n     commissioning technology before declaring our services, \n     equipment, and engineering to be out of the R stage and \n     therefore commercially viable.\n       We began exporting the work. Foreign companies had very \n     limited technical support for our work and the competition \n     for technical services was very weak. This meant that our \n     clients would most likely be first adopters of this new \n     technology. We were right. We also wanted to be tested, to \n     apply our services in remote locations, in extraordinary \n     terms on the toughest projects.\n       To be certain we could pay our people and vendors should \n     clients not pay in far off lands, we insured our work with \n     the EXIM bank. We sought to protect against major cash-flow \n     disruption as we had little knowledge of collection, legal \n     recovery, or any other understanding of the commercial codes \n     of the countries where we were deploying our services. We \n     could do the work but did not know what we would do if a \n     foreign buyer did not pay us.\n       As our service became accepted and our abilities grew, so \n     did our receivables. We solicited a National US Bank to \n     provide us with the needed credit to support our working \n     capital. They were agreeable to it domestically but we were \n     informed that they had no means of securing our collateral to \n     perfect full collection from foreign countries if we were to \n     default. Even though those receivables were insured. So we \n     worked with them to apply for a working capital guarantee \n     package with EXIM much as we had done when we bought our \n     first building using 504 support through the SBA. We were \n     approved and fees were required and paid. Since the time we \n     began with the credit insurance and the working capital LOC \n     we have had neither claims nor losses that required EXIM \n     support to the bank.\n       Here are some of the results. In the 7 years since we began \n     exporting and working with EXIM we have:\n       Become known as the most advanced technical commissioning \n     service company in power in 22 countries\n       Spent $71 million on the cost of producing our work:\n       Trucking, Pipe and materials, Valves, Pumps, Filters, \n     Manpower, Airfare, Fabrication, Chemicals, Hoses, Fittings, \n     Ocean Freight, Air Freight\n       Spent $25 million on back office or SGA support.\n       Paid 25% of our profits in federal taxes to the Treasury \n     Department\n       Repatriated all of our profits.\n       Increased our revenue 4x\n       Increased our employment 6x\n       Paid 100% health insurance for all our workers.\n       Paid Christmas and Profit sharing bonuses\n       Provided an average wage of $100K USD over our entire \n     employment force\n       Increased benefits by adding dental, 401k, Life insurance, \n     PTO, Family Leave etc.\n       Worked in 22 countries\n       Filed for and received further US Patents\n       Received an Audit by the IRS with received a notice of no \n     changes or faults.\n       Donated $218,000 to local charities and non-profits in New \n     Hampshire\n       Successfully completed 60 projects\n       Completed 5x the revenue in the second 10 years of the \n     company as was completed in the first 10 years\n       Eliminated 80,000,000 gallons of hazardous chemical waste \n     in foreign countries.\n       Opened new markets in Oil and Gas production to augment \n     power plant work.\n       Commissioned more than 27,351 megawatts of power and \n     200,000 barrels of oil per year from natural gas.\n       I personally have so enjoyed, and our company has benefited \n     so much from the experience of and value derived from the \n     EXIM bank that I was honored to be asked to volunteer my time \n     to serve on the Advisory Committee of the bank, and have \n     cosigned the 2013 and 2014 Competitiveness Report to the \n     Congress of the United States. During that time I was chosen \n     to serve as Chairman of the Sub-Committee on Public \n     Engagement to the Advisory committee. I have also worked and \n     consulted directly with Chairman Fred Hochberg on the issues \n     impacting small business. I have also been asked to consult \n     on the operational content and usability of the website \n     offered by the bank. I have given voice to my experience to \n     members of Congress, regional resource and economic \n     development offices in New Hampshire, to local businesses \n     thinking of working with EXIM. I have even been so honored as \n     to join Chairman Hochberg in a discussion of the EXIM bank in \n     the Roosevelt Room of the Whitehouse. To date my finest hour.\n       I can therefore state that I have been witness to positive \n     changes in the bank's operating approach since my colleagues \n     and I\n\n[[Page S3672]]\n\n     volunteered to serve on the advisory committee. We, and the \n     information we have imparted, have had a direct impact on the \n     bank because the bank's leadership was fully intent on \n     providing the best support not just to small business, but to \n     all businesses using the bank's services. The bank and each \n     and every employee of the EXIM bank I met and worked with \n     cared greatly about our concerns and took action to make the \n     experience and value greater.\n       I have very good knowledge of the value of this bank to \n     both the US exporter companies using the bank and the \n     taxpayers in the US.\n       While I wish that there were no ECA global competition for \n     credit support, there is. In as much as I have read and been \n     required to review and make comment on the OECD and Non-OECD \n     research of the activities of the global competitors to US \n     exporting I am fully aware that both good and bad actors are \n     in abundance across the world, and that their supporting ECAs \n     are outspending in both percentage and real dollars the EXIM \n     bank of the US. These actions are deliberate and these \n     organizations will go to great lengths to create the \n     unbalanced competition that we would like to have eradicated.\n       Until such time as there is no further need for global ECA \n     competition, I would therefore ask the House and Senate of \n     the United States to consider the following actions.\n       1. Re-authorize the EXIM bank for 7 years.\n       2. Add an additional 20 billion USD authority to the Bank\n       3. Allow the bank greater flexibility to advertise its \n     existence and benefits.\n       4. Allow the bank greater budget flexibility to conduct \n     regional training and recruitment of customers.\n       5. Establish treaties with Non-OECD countries to severely \n     restrict and penalize unfair ECA support or non-competitive \n     actions related to exports\n       6. Ensure 100% compliance with the law of the United States \n     and all foreign Borrower nations.\n       7. Ensure that US policy support by the bank is fair and \n     equally balanced.\n       8. Promote the establishment of a global Uniform Commercial \n     Code or similar instrument for the security of international \n     assets derived from commercial transactions.\n       9. Empower domestic banks to further support export credit \n     of viable receivables and exported collateral under some \n     strict country limitation schedule.\n       10. Negotiate ECA interest rates worldwide to stabilize \n     differentials.\n       11. Vigorously promote the bank to small businesses.\n       In conclusion, we, as American business people value our \n     support from our government. I personally have benefited from \n     being a citizen of the United States. When I was young my \n     mother reached out for food stamps and welfare to assist us \n     till we could get on our feet. I had school lunch programs in \n     the public schools I attended. Not being able to afford \n     college I joined the United States Navy. I was trained to be \n     a boiler technician over a 6 year period. I traveled the \n     world on 3 destroyers and a tender and earned a great \n     education in life, leadership, steam, and boilers. I was \n     honorably discharged and have gone on to build a family and a \n     company. My company has 60 families employed and we all still \n     travel the world and we still work on boilers. I have been \n     blessed to have the people and government of these United \n     States beside me then and beside me now. I have estimated \n     that my work in this regard has returned many times over the \n     money given to my mother for my benefit and the salary I \n     earned in the Navy. I have visited the White House, and am \n     now here in the Capitol speaking to our Congress. Beyond all \n     that I have accomplished, my mother and father are proud, my \n     wife and sons too.\n       So I will make you a promise. When I don't need to use the \n     EXIM bank any longer, when we have grown our business and \n     employed hundreds more people, I will stop using the bank. \n     But even then, I will volunteer my time to defend this \n     organization and its people, and to help each and every small \n     business that asks me to help them learn to export and how to \n     do so with EXIM.\n       I love my country, am grateful to have its help, and wish \n     to thank the Congress for making this valuable tool \n     available.\n       Thank you for the honor of participating in this \n     discussion.\n       God Bless the United States of America.\n                                                 Michael P. Boyle,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Michael Boyle is the CEO of Boyle Energy Services and \nTechnology. They have a facility in Concord, NH, which I have had the \ngood fortune to visit. They do great work. This testimony is what \nMichael gave before the House Committee on Financial Services this \nmorning at a hearing that examined the Export-Import Bank's \nreauthorization request and the government's role in export financing.\n  As I said, Boyle Energy does impressive work. They optimize energy \nperformance in power and energy infrastructure construction projects. \nTheir services have reduced greenhouse gas emissions and eliminated \nmillions of gallons of hazardous waste at facilities around the world. \nIt is a great American small business story. Boyle Energy got connected \nwith the Export-Import Bank a number of years ago at a forum in New \nHampshire where the Ex-Im Bank announced its Global Access for Small \nBusiness Program to help small businesses export.\n  Right now, about 40 percent of large businesses export, but only 1 \npercent of small and medium-sized businesses export in the United \nStates. Yet 95 percent of markets are outside of America. We need to \nhelp businesses such as Boyle Energy get into those international \nmarkets. That is exactly what the Ex-Im Bank has done. With the Export-\nImport Bank's support, Boyle Energy has grown its international sales \n75 percent over the last 3 years.\n  Before using the Export-Import Bank's credit insurance, the company \nshipped just to Mexico and Canada. But now Boyle has customers in over \na dozen countries. Their exports comprise 60 percent of the company's \n$15 million in sales, and 10 of its 50 employees support their increase \nin international sales. Without the Bank, Boyle Energy's success just \nwouldn't be possible.\n  Last year the Ex-Im Bank supported $10.7 billion worth of exports by \nAmerican small businesses. So this is not just the big guys. It is not \njust the General Electrics and the Boeings. It is small businesses such \nas we have in New Hampshire where 96 percent of our employers are small \nbusinesses. We should not take this important tool--this financing tool \nfor our small businesses--away from America's job creators.\n  I think it is important to note that it is not just the direct users \nof the Bank's products that will suffer. It will also hurt those \nsmaller companies that sell to larger companies who use Ex-Im Bank \nfinancing, for example, manufacturers such as Albany Engineering in \nRochester, NH, which makes parts for airplane engines. Timken in Keene \nand Lebanon sell their products to Boeing. When we cut off financing \nfor those products, it is going to have a real impact on American \nmanufacturing. It is going to have an impact on jobs in New Hampshire \nand across this country.\n  Now is the time for us to come together. We can do this. We can get \nthis authorization done. We have support in this Chamber to reauthorize \nthe Ex-Im Bank, to help our small businesses so we can get them into \nthe international markets. We need to do this reauthorization before \nthe Bank charter expires at the end of this month, and I urge my \ncolleagues to join us in taking action.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank Senator Heitkamp for her leadership on \nthis issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, this is a story and a movie we see all \ntoo frequently in this Chamber and in the Congress--manufactured crisis \nafter manufactured crisis after manufactured crisis. Here we are a few \nshort days away from actually seeing the charter of the Export-Import \nBank expire.\n  Think about that--a 70-year institution, a critical piece of trade \ninfrastructure. We spent the better part of the last work period \ntalking about trade promotion authority, and for very many of us this \nwas a very difficult vote. It was a conflicting vote. At the end of the \nday, the one argument that sells the day is that 95 percent of all \nconsumers in the world live outside the United States.\n  If we are not participating in trade, if we are not working to make \nsure our exports are competitive, if we are not making a difference for \nAmerican manufacturers, we are going to lose the competition for the \ncustomer. We are going to lose the opportunity to grow our \nmanufacturing base.\n  So the Export-Import Bank--not a lot of people know what it is, but \nthe people who do and the businesses that do know this is a critical \npiece of trade infrastructure. The irony perhaps of this whole issue is \nthere is no one--there is no group outside of conservative think tanks \nthat does not agree the Export-Import Bank needs to be reauthorized.\n  We have the U.S. Chamber of Commerce begging us in the Banking \nCommittee to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank. We have the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers that tells us overwhelmingly--the people \nwho support that trade association, who are represented by that trade \nassociation, want reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank. We know \nthe unions that\n\n[[Page S3673]]\n\nrepresent the workers who work in these industries have been asking us \nto do the right thing.\n  So here we are, once again, at the eleventh hour. Last year, we \nagreed to a short-term extension, 6 months, believing we would not be \nin this spot today, believing we would not be at the last minute \nthreatening the charter of the Export-Import Bank. So guess what. We \nhave over $15 billion of credit in the pipeline. Think about 15 billion \ndollars' worth of manufacturing exports in this country. I want you to \nthink not about the manufacturing exports, I want you to think about \nwhat that means, what that means for the American worker who works in \nthose manufacturing facilities. They look at this and they say that you \nare all about the economy. You all run saying that we are all about \njobs, we are all about improving the economy, creating opportunity by \ngetting American manufacturing back on its feet. Yet we cannot do \nsomething that has been done for 70 years and frequently by unanimous \nconsent in this body.\n  So where is the opposition? The opposition is nothing more than \nideology. The opposition comes from conservative think tanks that score \nthis, that scare Members and say that if you agree to reauthorize the \nExport-Import Bank, that will be a black mark on your record. You will \nnot be with us. You know what. It is time we were with the American \nworkers. It is time we were with the small businesses. It is time we \ndispel the myth of this institution, the Export-Import Bank, and start \ntalking about this as a job-creating entity.\n  I have a chart here. It is a theme that Senator Kirk and I are \nsounding. Senator Kirk and I have the bipartisan bill that we would \nlike to see advanced in this body to reauthorize the Export-Import \nBank. We have tried very hard to balance the concerns people have for \nreform with a reauthorization that gives some level of certainty to \nAmerican manufacturing, to the institutions that finance them. Make no \nmistake, it is not that this is public money. Simply what we are saying \nis, if a bank gives a loan to an American manufacturer, if a smalltown \nbank gives a loan to an American manufacturer, we will help guarantee \nthat loan. It is like an SBA--it is like an SBA for manufacturing \nexports.\n  What is next? We are going to take on the SBA because they are doing \ntoo much good to help American businesses? So I want you to think about \nthis: 164,000 American jobs. Those are direct American jobs, not the \nsecondary jobs that we know come from this primary sector, development. \nWhen you look at economics, you think about those jobs that are \nsecondary and those jobs that are primary sector.\n  Every manufacturing job that deals with exports is a primary sector \njob. It is new wealth creation for our State. Economically, that is \nmanna from Heaven because that new wealth comes here in the payments \nfor exports. It circulates around our economy, allows our retail \nbusinesses to thrive, allows our restaurants and our secondary \nbusinesses, whether they are dry cleaners, whether they are people in \nthe service industry, to support those primary sector jobs.\n  So 164,000 primary jobs, exports of $27.5 billion--$27.5 billion--\nthose are all U.S. exports supported by the Ex-Im Bank. When we look at \nit, guess what. People say: Well, it must cost us something to do this. \nIt must cost the American taxpayers something to fund the Export-Import \nBank if we are seeing those kinds of results. Guess what. Not only does \nit not cost us, it returned $7 billion to the Treasury.\n  Think about that. What is wrong with this? What is bad about this? \nWhere is this failing the taxpayers of this country? Where is this \nfailing the American worker? The simple answer is it is not. What is \nfailing the American worker is this institution, the United States \nCongress, because we are failing to hand the tools to those businesses \nthat can, in fact, create jobs, create economic wealth, and move our \ncountry forward. People will say: Oh, my goodness. It is all of those \nbig companies. It is GE, it is Boeing, and that is really whom we are \ntalking for.\n  Well, I want to kind of look behind the curtain of that a little bit, \nnot just talk about small businesses in my State that are going to \nbenefit and the agricultural producers that benefit from this \ninstitution. Think about the literally thousands of small businesses \nthat support Boeing, the thousands of small businesses that support the \nfolks at GE. Think about the businesses that actually are the \ncontractors with these large institutions that make parts, that make \nthe sandwiches that feed the employees. This is primary sector growth. \nWe know that adds to the benefit of the entire economy.\n  So let's talk a little bit about why someone from North Dakota cares \nabout the Export-Import Bank. If you look at more than 58,000 small \nbusinesses around the country depending on the Export-Import Bank to \nfinance the export deals, they will all lose if we do nothing. There is \n$15.9 billion, as I said, in the pipeline.\n  The Export-Import Bank has supported $139 billion in sales in North \nDakota alone, since 2007, and $102 million in exports from our State. \nThink about that--the little State of North Dakota, how significant \nthis institution is.\n  I want to tell the story of a small business. We heard just heart-\nwrenching stories, one from California, an entrepreneur who gave his \nall in Vietnam, 100-percent disabled. He has a small business, had a \ndream, living the American dream, serving his country. Guess what. He \nlost. Because of the uncertainty here, he lost a $57 million contract \nputting over 100 people out of work. Right now, he is challenged \nbecause he has a $200 million contract on the line waiting for \nreauthorization of the Export-Import Bank. Because--guess what--the \npeople he is selling to are not going to wait to find out if he has \nfinancing. They are going to turn to the next manufacturer. Do you know \nwho that next manufacturer is? That next manufacturer is China.\n\n  Do you think our competitors across the world, whether it is India or \nChina, who are not looking at reforming their export credit \norganization--guess what they are doing. They are pumping billions of \ndollars more. They are taking advantage of this. They are taking \nadvantage of this opportunity. This is a sign in the Beijing airport: \n``The Export Import Bank of China. Want to be the best in a better \nworld?''\n  They are not hiding this. They are not saying that is inappropriate. \nThey are bragging about it. They are bragging where they think those \nbusinessmen are coming in and taking a look at where that financing \nopportunity is. You might say: Well, the private sector can do it. That \nis not true. That is absolutely not true. We have had representation \nfrom almost every financial organization in this town saying we need \nthe Export-Import Bank to support our customers who need to have that \ncredit for their exports.\n  So I want to close talking about a great business in Wahpeton, ND, a \ntown I grew up very close to. WCCO Belting in Wahpeton, ND, is a great \nexample. It is a 60-year-old, family-owned rubber supply company, which \nstarted out as a shoe repair business and diversified into repairing \nparts for farm trucks and then into new seats for tractors, canvass \nbelting, and wooden slats.\n  Today, the company provides rubber products used in farm equipment, \nsuch as belts for harvesting grain or producing round bailers or tube \nconveyers to move seeds and grain. Those are supplied to major farm \nequipment companies around the world. You know what. The simple fact \nis--and they will tell you if they were standing right here--that \ncompany could not have done it without the Export-Import Bank 12 years \nago, which allowed WCCO Belting to pursue export opportunities it had \nbeen ignoring. The Bank has supported more than $830,000 in exports \nfrom WCCO since 2007. The Export-Import Bank helps make sure small \nbusinesses get paid in a timely fashion for what they sell. Not getting \npaid in a timely manner from foreign entities very quickly can put a \nsmall business out of work.\n  The company now has 200 employees who generate more than 60 percent \nof their annual sales from revenues from customers who are located \noutside of the United States, all possible because of the Export-Import \nBank. Without the Bank, they would be unable to compete in this global \nmarketplace. This is one of those stories in Washington, DC, that makes \nthe rest of the world believe Washington does not get it, that the \nUnited States Congress\n\n[[Page S3674]]\n\ndoes not get it. Because they do not live in their world, they live in \nthe real world, where you have to finance what you have, where those \nchallenges get harder and harder every day, and where you are competing \nin a market where people do this.\n  There are 70 export credit agencies in the world, all competing for \nthe same business, all helping their homegrown businesses compete for \nthe same business we are competing for. Unilateral disarmament. So it \nwas not for any other purpose than the passion we have for this \ninstitution that Senator Cantwell and I started talking about this \nduring the TPA discussion, started saying: We need a path forward so \nthe charter of the Bank does not expire, so that we actually \nreauthorize the Bank before the end of this month.\n  I would like to tell you that the prospects are great, that the \noverwhelming economic logic of the Export-Import Bank has overcome all \nof the ideological discussions. I would love to tell you that. I would \nlove to tell you we are absolutely doing something in a timely fashion, \nwe are doing something that makes common sense. Guess what.

Mr. President, big storms and heavy rain often lead to \nflooding in cities. It seems like that is happening more frequently and \nthe floods have been more damaging. In May we saw the extent of the \ndamage that can be done when flood waters inundate a city. Twenty-seven \npeople died in Houston, TX as a result of the rainfall and flooding \nthere. Eleven people are still missing. The truth of the matter is, we \ndon't have very much data on frequency, severity, or how we might \nbetter prepare for the kind of weather that turns into flooded streets, \nbusinesses, and homes.\n  I introduced a bill this week, with Senator Whitehouse and \nCongressman Quigley in the House, to address that. The Urban Flooding \nAwareness Act calls for a study to document the costs to families, \nbusiness, and government associated with urban flooding. There are many \nways we can do a better job of preparing for storm flooding--including \ncreative, environmentally sound, ``green infrastructure'' approaches--\nbut first we need to have a firm understanding of the scope of the \nproblem.\n  Stronger, more destructive storms are pounding urban areas at an \nalarming rate. They threaten the quality of drinking water. Urban \nfloods erode river banks and spread pollution. They bring massive \ndamage to homes and businesses. When you consider events like \nSuperstorm Sandy and Hurricane Katrina, it is clear we need to do more \nto understand how flooding can be predicted and prevented.\n  In Illinois we have had more than our fair share of urban flooding in \nrecent years. Chicago has seen three ``hundred year floods'' in the \nlast 5 years.\n  Just a few inches of water can cause thousands of dollars in damage \nfor both home and small business owners. Wet basements from flooding \nevents are one of the top reasons people do not purchase a particular \nhome. Industry experts estimate flooding can lower property values by \n10 to 25 percent. Moreover, nearly 40 percent of small businesses do \nnot reopen following a disaster, according to FEMA, the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency.\n  Most homeowners in urban areas do not have Federally backed flood \ninsurance through FEMA's flood insurance program. They are not able to \nparticipate in the flood insurance program because it focuses entirely \non designated floodplains along rivers, not in urban areas. With the \nfrequency and severity of storms growing year by year, we need to gain \na better understanding of flooding in our cities.\n  A clear definition of urban flooding--which this legislation would \nestablish--would allow experts to understand the scope of the problem, \ndevelop solutions, and consider more than just coastal and river \nflooding when designing flood maps. The bill also would require FEMA to \ncoordinate a study on the costs and prevalence of urban flooding and \nthe effectiveness of green and other infrastructure.\n  The Urban Flooding Awareness Act will help American communities \nidentify ways to protect our investments and our environment. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/03/senate-section/article/S3674-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3674-S3675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING MARSELIS PARSONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to pay honor to a Vermont \nlegend who passed away last month. Marselis Parsons, known to friends \nas ``Div,'' was a deeply respected newsman in my home State. His low, \nsteady voice in anchoring the evening news became a mainstay in living \nrooms for decades. Div Parsons knew news. He knew the importance of \nhaving personal connections, and he built trust based on his integrity \nand fairness.\n  Div Parsons rose through the ranks at Vermont's CBS affiliate, WCAX \nChannel 3, and he never became too important in his own mind that he \nwouldn't report on a fire or track down a lead. In short, he knew the \npulse of the State, and he reported on what he knew. He also shared his \nyears of experience with young reporters, many of whom he hired \nstraight out of college and gave them the break they needed.\n  When he wasn't working long hours at the station, he was known to \ntake to the waters of the great Lake Champlain, either on his antique \npower boat or, if the winds held up, under full sail. In retirement, he \nstill relished tracking the latest political news.\n  I am grateful for our friendship and our many conversations over \ntime, and I am grateful that he was able to cherish the recent birth of \nhis granddaughter, Pippa. Div Parsons' death will leave a void, no \ndoubt, but we'll have many memories to share.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a fitting \ntribute to Div Parsons that ran in the Times Argus newspaper.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From Barre Montpelier Times Argus, June 1, 2015]\n\n                             `Div' Departs\n\n       This last week saw the departure of Bob Schieffer from the \n     anchor desk of the CBS show ``Face The Nation,'' and closer \n     to home, the passing of a Vermont television icon, Marselis \n     Parsons. While Schieffer occupied a place in the national \n     consciousness, it is not a mistake to place the two men in \n     company. They represent the best of an era in television that \n     is rapidly receding into history.\n       For Vermont, Parsons was the face that a generation of \n     Vermonters grew up with, in an era when the habits of the \n     populace were still to turn on the local news at 6 p.m., \n     followed by the national report at 7 p.m. He was both larger \n     than life, and unassuming in a way that led us to welcome him \n     into our homes. ``Div,'' as he was nicknamed through obscure \n     origins, was for many the one and only local news anchor they \n     knew.\n       Because of the vagaries of television transmission over the \n     hills of Vermont, many children in rural homes--and their \n     parents--had just one or two options on the dial beyond the \n     local PBS station. Even then, the reception was sometimes \n     tricky leading to elaborate coat hanger antennas on the TV \n     and ``snow'' making the picture a bit fuzzy. But the \n     television was often the window to the wider world--both the \n     world at large, and because of Parsons and family-owned WCAX, \n     the world in the next town over, or in the state of Vermont \n     at large.\n       He was the guide to the stories that connected Vermont and \n     gave us a sense of shared identity, whether we turned on the \n     evening news in Derby Line or in Tinmouth. He reported on the \n     first Green Up Day, in 1970, on the return of hostages from \n     Iran in 1980, and was the anchor the day that Dick Snelling \n     died and Howard Dean was sworn in as governor. Parsons became \n     synonymous with Channel 3, and both remain Vermont \n     institutions.\n       He looked us in the eye and told us the bad news when \n     tragedy had struck; he also shared the triumphs of the day, \n     or narrated some kind of community gathering in one of the \n     tiny towns that Vermont is known for. He often shared a \n     chuckle with his co-anchors, but never allowed his \n     personality--of which there was plenty--or his demeanor to \n     outshine the efforts of the team as a whole.\n       He could be, as his former colleague Kristin Carlson \n     recalled, unscripted and direct on live television, meaning \n     the reporters in the field had better know their story and be \n     able\n\n[[Page S3675]]\n\n     to go off the script. Carlson grew up watching Parsons, and \n     like dozens of television reporters, was mentored by him and \n     grew to serve the state of Vermont better because of it.\n       After his start in television in 1967, Parsons worked as a \n     reporter for years, and only took over the anchor desk in \n     1984, on the death of his predecessor, Richard Gallagher. By \n     then much of the most tumultuous period in Vermont's modern \n     history was over: Act 250 was in place, Vermont had rapidly \n     transitioned from a conservative, rural state to a \n     politically diverse, rural state, and the social and \n     governmental change ushered in by the '60s and '70s was in \n     full swing. There was much to come, however, and Parsons was \n     a constant throughout--the rest of the Kunin years, the rise \n     of Howard Dean, civil unions and the Jim Douglas era.\n       The days of the network evening news are rapidly passing \n     on. The news world has further fragmented with the rise of \n     the Internet. In some ways, the new world is better. We have \n     many choices now, and our ability to connect to others around \n     the state and the world has never been greater. Our choices \n     for information are more diverse.\n       In other ways we feel the pangs of nostalgia for times gone \n     by, when there was a constant presence who would share the \n     news of the day before saying ``Good Night''. The sense of \n     loss is for one of our familiar community, and of a person \n     who did not put himself before the news.\n       There are many examples of the anchor desk lending too much \n     ego to the occupant. Often today an anchor desk is almost \n     like a podium or a stage. But Parsons had no need to \n     exaggerate or embellish who he was. He was a different kind \n     of anchor. In the current era of flamboyance and \n     exaggeration, his humility, compassion and honesty stand out. \n     Parsons was not a ``personality.'' He was not acting or \n     putting on a show while on air--the man he was was what you \n     saw. He was steady and sometimes deadpan, and committed \n     entirely to the Green Mountain State.\n       While we are grateful to have had him, it is our great loss \n     that he is gone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/03/senate-section/article/S3675-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         RECOGNIZING JIM WEBER\n\n Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Jim Weber, a \nwelding and machining teacher at Capital High School in Helena, MT. Mr. \nWeber uses Mastercam CAD/CAM software to give his students real world, \npractical skills, as well as the work ethic necessary to complete any \ntask. His instruction helped lead one of his students to victory at the \nNational Machining Competition for creating a custom fly fishing rod \nand display case.\n  Mr. Weber's fly fishing rod project not only leads to great and \nnecessary personal skills, but he inspired this years' senior class to \nmake an even bigger impact with their fly fishing rods. Mr. Weber's \nclass designed and machined 15 custom fly fishing rods for the Big \nHearts under the Big Sky project which helps to create free and \ngratifying opportunities for service men and women, life-threateningly \nill children, and women battling breast cancer to explore the vast and \nbeautiful Montanan outdoors. Not only was he able to teach high school \nstudents how to make rings, knives, and fishing rods, he was also able \nto motivate his students to help themselves by helping others.\n  The ability to educate students and make them ready to take on the \nchallenges that our world contains is a valuable asset to the young \nadults. Each and every day Mr. Weber provides a great service to our \nfuture leaders that words cannot adequately express. I am excited to \nsee what comes of the great men and women Jim Weber is able to teach \nand inspire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/03/senate-section/article/S3675-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOE DOWLING\n\n Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Joe Dowling, \nthe outgoing artistic director of the Guthrie Theater. For 20 years, \nMr. Dowling has served the Guthrie with integrity, creativity, and \nstyle. His passion, talent, and years of international theater \nexperience have added so much to the Guthrie Theater and the entire \nTwin Cities theater community.\n  Mr. Dowling joined the Guthrie Theater as artistic director in 1995. \nSince then, he has directed 48 plays and build relationships with \nesteemed theater artists, such as Angela Bassett, the late Arthur \nMiller, and T.R. Knight, just to name a few. But his legacy reaches far \nbeyond the plays he has directed and the relationships he has formed. \nUnder Mr. Dowling's leadership, the Guthrie moved into its beautiful \nnew building, allowing the company to expand its repertoire and reach \nover 400,000 patrons each year.\n  Joe Dowling has also focused on developing the next generation of \ntheater artists. He led the development of two new actor training \nprograms at the Guthrie and initiated the WorldStage Series, a program \nthat invites international theater companies to perform on Guthrie \nstages. His vision and leadership have brought tremendous positive \nchange to the Guthrie Theater, and his legacy will be felt long after \nhe has gone.\n  Tyrone Guthrie founded the Guthrie Theater with a specific goal in \nmind--to create a first-rate regional theater that would nourish the \nminds and souls of artists and audiences alike. In the 52 years since \nits founding, the Guthrie Theater has become just that--a shining \nexample of everything regional theater is and can be. Whether producing \nShakespeare's ``Hamlet'' or more contemporary fare, the Guthrie has \ntackled some of humanity's most pressing issues with innovation, \ncompassion, and professionalism. On its stages and in its classrooms, \nthe Guthrie brings people of all walks of life together to laugh, cry, \nand contemplate some of life's deepest questions.\n  I hope you will join me as I say thank you to Joe Dowling for his 20 \nremarkable years of service to the Guthrie Theater, the people of the \nState of Minnesota, and the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/03/senate-section/article/S3675-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURMENT\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate on January 6, 2015, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on June 2, 2015, during the adjournment of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 802.

A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Arizona urging the United States Congress to \n     enact legislation that confirms that state law determines the \n     entire scope of R.S. 2477 right-of-way; to the Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Memorial 1002\n\n       Whereas, in order to promote settlement of the American \n     West in the 1800s and provide access to mining deposits \n     located under federal lands, the United States Congress \n     granted rights-of-way across public lands for the \n     construction of highways by a provision of the Mining Law of \n     1866, now known as Revised Statute (R.S.) 2477; and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress repealed R.S. 2477 in \n     1976 as part of its enactment of the Federal Land Policy and \n     Management Act, along with the repeal of other federal \n     statutory rights-of-way, but it expressly preserved R.S. 2477 \n     rights-of-way that already had been established; and\n       Whereas, in its entirety, R.S. 2477 provided that ``the \n     right of way for the construction\n\n[[Page S3678]]\n\n     of highways over public lands, not reserved for public uses, \n     is hereby granted''; and\n       Whereas, R.S. 2477 was self-executing and did not require \n     government approval or public recording of title, which \n     resulted in uncertainty regarding whether particular rights-\n     of-way had in fact been established; and\n       Whereas, in April 2014, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals \n     issued a decision in San Juan County v. United States in \n     which the court rejected the notion that state law should \n     determine the entire scope of R.S. 2477 rights-of-way, \n     holding that state law has provided ``convenient and \n     appropriate principles'' for determining the scope and \n     validity of an R.S. 2477 right-of-way, but it can be \n     dismissed when it ``contravenes congressional intent''; and\n       Whereas, in October 2014, the Ninth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals issued a decision in County of Shoshone v. United \n     States in which it confirmed that state law controls, or is \n     ``borrowed,'' in determining what constitutes sufficient \n     public use, reflecting a rejection of the approach taken by \n     the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Juan County v. \n     United States; and\n       Whereas, outdoor recreation is an essential industry in \n     Arizona, generating $10.6 billion in consumer spending, \n     104,000 direct Arizona jobs, $3.3 billion in wages and \n     salaries and $787 million in state and local tax revenue; and\n       Whereas, the reduction of public roads in this state would \n     diminish access to and enjoyment of outdoor recreation \n     opportunities on public lands, detrimentally impacting \n     Arizona's economy.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of \n     Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring, prays:\n       1. That the Members of the United States Congress enact \n     legislation that is consistent with the decision of the Ninth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals in County of Shoshone v.

Bush and Congress; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That we urge the President of the United States \n     and Congress to consider all possible trade and economic \n     policies to protect this vital American industry and minimize \n     the financial impact on these hardworking men and women; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution be \n     presented to the President and Vice-President of the United \n     States, the Majority and Minority Leaders of the United \n     States Senate, and the Speaker and Minority Leader of the \n     United States House of Representatives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/03/senate-section/article/S3678-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3678-S3679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. DAINES (for himself, Mr. Lankford, and Mr. \n             Blunt):\n       S. 1487.

A bill to require notice and comment for certain \ninterpretative rules; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I often hear from Montanans how \nWashington, DC, regulations stifle the ability to create jobs and \nprevent our small businesses from reaching their full potential. Too \nmany Montana businesses face regulatory burdens that hinder innovation \nand block opportunities for growth. In fact, when I drive around \nMontana, I have yet to hear a small business owner stop me and say: You \nknow, we would like to see more regulations from Washington, DC.\n  In today's environment, business owners are left with few options. \nThey either struggle to keep up with frequent regulatory changes or \nthey suffer the penalty of regulatory fines. That is unacceptable. \nThere is something fundamentally wrong when your business owners spend \nmore time adapting to Washington regulations than focusing on their \nbusiness's growth and their job creation.\n  We need to reduce the redtape that is holding our small businesses \nback and work towards commonsense regulations that don't place \nunnecessary burdens on Montana families and small business. Today, I \nhave introduced legislation to help fix the regulatory burdens facing \nAmericans. My bill facilitates public input on Federal rulemaking and \nprovides a more predictable regulatory environment so that businesses \ncan make plans to expand and have a predictable environment to create \ngood high-paying jobs.\n  Currently, bureaucrats in Washington, DC, can issue interpretative \nrules without warning and without public input. In fact, oftentimes, \ninterpretative rules are dramatically changed at the whim of the \nPresident.\n  I would also like to thank Senators Lankford and Blunt for joining me \nin introducing this critical piece of legislation. The Regulatory \nPredictability for Business Growth Act will ensure that Americans' \nvoices are heard in the rulemaking process, providing a crucial \nplanning period for individuals and businesses. I want to give a \nspecial thanks to Senator Lankford and his staff for his leadership on \nthe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Regulatory \nAffairs and Federal Management Subcommittee. Our staffs worked closely\n\n[[Page S3681]]\n\nto make this piece of legislation possible today.\n  For far too long, government bureaucracy has stifled our small \nbusinesses' potential. With commonsense reforms such as this bill, we \ncan encourage both innovation and job growth. The Regulatory \nPredictability for Business Growth Act will decrease regulatory \nuncertainty, and it will empower Montanans and their businesses to grow \nagain.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY:\n  S. 1494. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize \nand update the National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative for grants to \naddress the problems of individuals who experience trauma and violence \nrelated stress; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am here this afternoon to talk about an \nissue that is so important to my State and to communities nationwide; \nthat is, how do we help children and families rebuild and recover when \nthey face serious trauma? As we have seen all too often in recent \nyears, traumatic events can impact children at any time and in any part \nof our country. If children don't get the support they need in the wake \nof a hardship such as a natural disaster or violence at school or \nstress related to a family member's military deployment, those \nexperiences can be even more difficult to recover from and they can \nleave our children with serious and long-lasting challenges such as \ndepression, anxiety, and difficulty maintaining employment.\n  An estimated two-thirds of our children experience traumatic events \nbefore the age of 16. Their need for support and treatment after trauma \nis something that simply cannot go unmet. That is why I am very proud \nto introduce the Children's Recovery from Trauma Act. This bipartisan \nlegislation would continue support for child trauma centers across the \ncountry which help make sure that as children in families face \ndifficult times, our Nation's health care system is better prepared to \nprovide support and help ease that burden.\n  Child trauma centers have played an important role in my home State \nof Washington. For example, when the State Route 530 mudslide caused \nunthinkable devastation in Oso and Darrington, the Washington State \nUniversity CLEAR Center stepped in to help children and families who \nwere impacted by that horrific tragedy. Staff at the CLEAR Center held \nparent nights at Darrington Elementary School and worked with the \nteachers there to help make sure students got the right kind of support \nthey needed. They even helped teachers explain to students how the \nbrain operates under stress and how that might influence their \nbehavior. As a mom and former preschool teacher, a school board member, \nand a Senator from the great State of Washington, I believe this \nsupport can make a world of difference in this kind of scary and \nstressful time for our kids.\n  I am very proud that under the Children's Recovery from Trauma Act, \nthe CLEAR Center would continue to receive critical Federal investment. \nIn addition, I am very proud that other child trauma centers, such as \nthose that mobilized after the 2001 terrorist attack and natural \ndisasters such as Hurricane Katrina and Sandy and the shootings at \nVirginia Tech and in Newtown, would continue to get those investments \nas well.\n  As I have said before, I am inspired by the strength and resilience \nof communities in Washington State that were impacted by the tragedy of \nthe State Route 530 mudslide and the shootings recently at Marysville-\nPilchuck High School. Children in these communities and communities \nlike them across the country face hardships that can't always be \npredicted or prevented, but they do need and deserve our support. The \nChildren's Recovery from Trauma Act would take some critical steps \nforward in this effort, and I hope all of my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 1498. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to require \nthat military working dogs be retired in the United States, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, since World War I, military working dogs \nhave worked side-by-side with our men and women in uniform in various \nroles and operations. Today military working dogs routinely assist U.S. \ntroops on dangerous front-line assignments, helping to detect roadside \nbombs and improvised explosive devices, saving hundreds of American \nlives and preventing countless injuries. Moreover, both on and off the \nbattlefield, these dogs represent critical partners, invaluable team \nmembers, and cherished companions.\n  Unlike traditional soldiers, a canine's service does not necessarily \nend when it reaches retirement. Instead, military working dogs often \ncontinue to support our nation by acting as service dogs for veterans \nsuffering from mental and physical disabilities. Because of the close \nbond forged by their shared experiences in the military, these dogs can \nplay a unique and important role in for our veterans--quite literally \nsaving lives even once they return to the home front.\n  Unfortunately, it is not always so easy for former dog handlers to be \nreunited with their four-legged comrades-in-arms. Because of the way \nthe law is currently written, the Department of Defense is not required \nto bring military working dogs back to the United States upon \nretirement. As such, most military working dogs end up being retired \noverseas wherever they end their service. As a result, former handlers, \nveterans, and other members of the military community wishing to adopt \na dog may be forced to cover the cost of transporting the dog halfway \nacross the world.\n  Our Nation's veterans deserve to be reunited with their canine \ncounterparts and they should not have to shoulder the official costs \nand fees associated with doing so. To correct this situation, I am \nintroducing the Military Working Dog Retirement Act. By requiring the \nDepartment of Defense to arrange and pay for the transportation of \nretiring military working dogs to the United States, this bill is a key \nstep to ensuring former military dog handlers may benefit from the \ncontinued partnership and service of these loyal canines. It is my hope \nthat the Senate will pass this legislation swiftly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1498\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to promote and reform foreign capital investment and \njob creation in American communities; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n[[Page S3682]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the \nbipartisan American Job Creation and Investment Promotion Reform Act of \n2015, which will extend and significantly improve the EB-5 Regional \nCenter program. Since its inception in 1993, the EB-5 Regional Center \nprogram has generated billions of dollars in capital investment and \ncreated tens of thousands of jobs across the country, much of which has \noccurred in areas that traditionally struggle to attract investment and \njobs. The program's authorization is set to expire at the end of \nSeptember. My legislation would reauthorize it for 5 years while \nenacting broad reforms to enhance the program's integrity. I am proud \nto be joined by Senator Grassley in this effort.\n  The EB-5 Regional Center program faces significant challenges. I have \nalways been supportive of its ability to create American jobs but the \nprogram has experienced some problems in recent years. There have been \ntroubling reports of fraud and abuse, concerns regarding onerous \nprocessing delays for developers and investors, and questions over \nwhether the program is truly benefiting those that Congress intended. \nThese concerns can overshadow the many success stories, and have led \nsome to understandably lose faith in the program.\n  I have not seen any flaw inherent to the EB-5 Regional Center program \nthat could not be remedied, and I strongly believe that this is a \nprogram worth fixing. Over the last two decades this program has proven \nit can result in significant investment and jobs in communities that \ndesperately need both, all at no cost to American taxpayers. While our \nimmigration system as a whole is broken, and only comprehensive reform \nwill remedy its many injustices, reforming and reauthorizing the EB-5 \nRegional Center program warrants our immediate attention because the \nprogram is set to expire in a matter of months.\n  In Vermont, this program revitalized rural communities during the \nworst of economic times. At the height of the recession, Country Home \nProducts was able to speed up its engineering initiative to develop a \nnew line of equipment in the power tool market. Sugarbush ski resort \ninvested in new facilities and resources to increase visitors and keep \nits doors open. Without EB-5 capital, these manufacturing, \nconstruction, and hospitality jobs would likely not exist in Vermont. \nThe state-run Vermont Regional Center continues to attract substantial \ncapital investment and--with the Department of Financial Regulation now \njoining the Agency of Commerce and Community Development in overseeing \nthe program--also provides unparalleled oversight of EB-5 projects.\n  I have long sought substantial reforms to the EB-5 Regional Center \nprogram at the Federal level. Last Congress, my EB-5 amendment to \nComprehensive Immigration Reform provided the Department of Homeland \nSecurity the authority to revoke suspect regional center designations \nor immigrant petitions. This amendment, which was unanimously approved \nby Senate Judiciary Committee, also provided for increased regional \ncenter reporting, background checks, and oversight related to the offer \nand sale of securities. Sadly these improvements have all had to wait, \nas the House of Representatives failed to allow a vote on the \nbipartisan immigration reform bill that passed the Senate last \nCongress.\n  Fortunately, however, the agency that administers EB-5 has not stood \nidly by waiting for Congress to strengthen the program. I credit \nAlejandro Mayorkas, the former Director of United States Citizenship \nand Services, with bringing many concerns to light. The agency has \nsince transformed its review of EB-5 applications. Staff levels have \nincreased nearly ten-fold, in-house economists now analyze proposed \nbusiness plans, and fraud detection and national security staff now sit \nside-by-side with adjudicators. These actions have all helped the \nagency to guard against abuses.\n  However, as Congress now faces reauthorizing this job-creating \nprogram, I have listened to concerns raised about how the program \nfunctions. I believe we must do more, which is why I have been working \nfor over a year to further reform and modernize the Regional Center \nprogram. The bill I introduced today builds upon what the Senate passed \nlast Congress as part of Comprehensive Immigration Reform.\n  This legislation, if enacted, would provide the Department of \nHomeland Security additional, much-needed authorities, including \nfurther expanding background checks, conducting a more thorough vetting \nof proposed investments earlier in the process, and providing for the \nability to proactively investigate fraud, both in the United States and \nabroad, using a dedicated fund paid for by certain program \nparticipants. The bill would also provide investors with greater \nprotections and more information about their investments. It would \nprovide project developers clarity and shorter processing times in \norder to make the program more predictable and functional. It would \nraise minimum investment thresholds so more money goes to the \ncommunities that need it. It would help to restore the program to its \noriginal intent, by ensuring that much of the capital generated and \njobs created occur in rural areas and areas with high unemployment.\n  Taken together, the oversight tools, security enhancements, and anti-\nfraud provisions included in this legislation provide the framework for \na complete overhaul of the EB-5 Regional Center program. These reforms \nwill instill both confidence and transparency in the program.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with all Senators and \nstakeholders to improve and reauthorize this important program. I am \nconfident our work will result in a secure EB-5 program that will \ncreate American jobs and promote economic growth throughout our \ncountry, particularly in the rural and distressed communities that need \nit most.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/03/senate-section/article/S3682-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3682-S3683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 190--ENCOURAGING REUNIONS OF KOREAN AMERICANS WHO \n      WERE DIVIDED BY THE KOREAN WAR FROM RELATIVES IN NORTH KOREA\n\n  Mr.KIRK (for himself and Mr.Warner) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

FIELDING OF AMP MODIFIED C-130 H AIRCRAFT\n\n       Section 134 of the Carl Levin and Howard P. `Buck' McKeon \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 \n     (Public Law 113-291) prohibits the Air Force from canceling \n     or modifying the C-130H AMP program of record. Elsewhere in \n     this Act the committee states that it expect the Air Force to \n     continue to execute AMP and field C-130H aircraft previously \n     upgraded by the AMP program until the Air Force provides a \n     concrete plan that describes the final modification \n     configuration for a restructured AMP program, a service cost \n     position, and a procurement and installation schedule that \n     would realistically support a fleet viability requirement.\n       The Air Force has resisted fielding the five previously \n     modified AMP aircraft or to install the previously purchased \n     installation kits to modify an additional four aircraft \n     because of the difficulties in training aircrews and \n     establishing logistics support, thereby negating the ability \n     to deploy these aircraft in the C-130 schedule rotation. \n     However, in order to comply with 134 of the Carl Levin and \n     Howard P. `Buck' McKeon National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 2015 (Public Law 113-291) and stated \n     committee desires, the Air Force must continue fielding these \n     aircraft.\n       The five current AMP-modified C-130Hs, plus aircraft \n     modified with the four previously purchased installation kits \n     would be\n\n[[Page S3687]]\n\n     ideal aircraft to support 18th Airborne Corps, 82nd Airborne \n     Division, and U.S. Army Special Operations Command training \n     and contingency requirements as they would primarily provide \n     training support to these units and not be required to deploy \n     in the normal rotation of C-130 units.\n       The committee believes the Air Force has expended \n     significant funds on the AMP program of record and therefore \n     should use due diligence to give the American taxpayer the \n     best return on scarce funding to maximize military \n     effectiveness.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1479.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the Soviet Union no \n     longer exists, and the Cold War is over. The nature of \n     threats to the national security and military interests of \n     the United States has changed. However, the United States \n     continues to maintain an enormous arsenal of nuclear weapons \n     and delivery systems that were devised with the Cold War in \n     mind.\n       (2) The current nuclear arsenal of the United States \n     includes approximately 5,000 total nuclear warheads, of which \n     approximately 2,000 are deployed with three delivery \n     components: long-range strategic bomber aircraft, land-based \n     intercontinental ballistic missiles, and submarine-launched \n     ballistic missiles. The bomber fleet of the United States \n     comprises 93 B-52 and 20 B-2 aircraft. The United States \n     maintains 450 intercontinental ballistic missiles. The United \n     States also maintains 14 Ohio-class submarines, up to 12 of \n     which are deployed at sea. Each of those submarines is armed \n     with up to 96 independently targetable nuclear warheads.\n       (3) This Cold War-based approach to nuclear security comes \n     at significant cost. Over the next 10 years, the United \n     States will spend hundreds of billions of dollars maintaining \n     its nuclear force. A substantial decrease in spending on the \n     nuclear arsenal of the United States is prudent for both the \n     budget and national security.\n       (4) The national security interests of the United States \n     can be well served by reducing the total number of deployed \n     nuclear warheads and their delivery systems, as stated by the \n     Department of Defense's June 2013 nuclear policy guidance \n     entitled, ``Report on Nuclear Employment Strategy of the \n     United States''. This guidance found that force levels under \n     the Treaty on Measures for the Further Reduction and \n     Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, signed on April 8, \n     2010, and entered into force on February 5, 2011, between the \n     United States and the Russian Federation (commonly known as \n     the ``New START Treaty'') ``are more than adequate for what \n     the United States needs to fulfill its national security \n     objectives'' and that the force can be reduced by up to \\1/3\\ \n     below levels under the New START Treaty to 1,000 to 1,100 \n     warheads.\n       (5) Even without additional reductions in deployed \n     strategic warheads, the United States can save tens of \n     billions of dollars by deploying those warheads more \n     efficiently on delivery systems and by deferring production \n     of new delivery systems until they are needed.\n       (6) Economic security and national security are linked and \n     both will be well served by smart defense spending. Admiral \n     Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated on \n     June 24, 2010, ``Our national debt is our biggest national \n     security threat'' and on August 2, 2011, stated, ``I haven't \n     changed my view that the continually increasing debt is the \n     biggest threat we have to our national security.''.\n       (7) The Government Accountability Office has found that \n     there is significant waste in the construction of the nuclear \n     facilities of the National Nuclear Security Administration of \n     the Department of Energy.\n\n     SEC. 1673.

REQUIREMENT TO USE HUMAN-BASED METHODS FOR CERTAIN \n                   MEDICAL TRAINING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Department of Defense has made impressive strides \n     in the development and use of methods of medical training and \n     troop protection, such as the use of tourniquets and \n     improvements in body armor, that have led to decreased \n     battlefield fatalities.\n       (2) The Department of Defense uses more than 8,500 live \n     animals each year to train physicians, medics, corpsmen, and \n     other personnel methods of responding to severe battlefield \n     injuries.\n       (3) The civilian sector has almost exclusively phased in \n     the use of superior human-based training methods for numerous \n     medical procedures currently taught in military courses using \n     animals.\n       (4) Human-based medical training methods such as simulators \n     replicate human anatomy and can allow for repetitive practice \n     and data collection.\n       (5) According to scientific, peer-reviewed literature, \n     medical simulation increases patient safety and decreases \n     errors by healthcare providers.\n       (6) The Army Research, Development and Engineering Command \n     and other entities of the Department of Defense have taken \n     significant steps to develop methods to replace live animal-\n     based training.\n\n[[Page S3699]]\n\n       (7) According to the report by the Department of Defense \n     titled ``Final Report on the use of Live Animals in Medical \n     Education and Training Joint Analysis Team'', published on \n     July 12, 2009--\n       (A) validated, high-fidelity simulators were to have been \n     available for nearly every high-volume or high-value \n     battlefield medical procedure by the end of 2011, and many \n     were available as of 2009; and\n       (B) validated, high-fidelity simulators were to have been \n     available to teach all other procedures to respond to common \n     battlefield injuries by 2014.\n       (8) The Center for Sustainment of Trauma and Readiness \n     Skills of the Air Force exclusively uses human-based training \n     methods in its courses and does not use animals.\n       (9) In 2013, the Army instituted a policy forbidding non-\n     medical personnel from participating in training courses \n     involving the use of animals.\n       (10) In 2013, the medical school of the Department of \n     Defense, part of the Uniformed Services University of the \n     Health Sciences, replaced animal use within its medical \n     student curriculum.\n       (11) The Coast Guard announced in 2014 that it would reduce \n     by half the number of animals it uses for combat trauma \n     training courses but stated that animals would continue to be \n     used in courses designed for Department of Defense personnel.\n       (12) Effective January 1, 2015, the Department of Defense \n     replaced animal use in six areas of medical training, \n     including Advanced Trauma Life Support courses and the \n     development and maintenance of surgical and critical care \n     skills for field operational surgery and field assessment and \n     skills tests for international students offered at the \n     Defense Institute of Medical Operations.\n       (b) Requirement to Use Human-based Methods for Certain \n     Medical Training.--\n       (1) In general.--Chapter 101 of title 10, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     section:\n\n     ``Sec. 2017.

Roosevelt, \n     through Executive Order Number 9054, established the War \n     Shipping Administration that was charged with building or \n     purchasing, and operating the civilian shipping vessels \n     needed for the war effort.\n\n[[Page S3720]]\n\n       (5) During World War II, United States merchant mariners \n     transported goods and materials through ``contested waters'' \n     to the various combat theaters.\n       (6) At the conclusion of World War II, United States \n     merchant mariners were responsible for transporting several \n     million members of the United States Armed Forces back to the \n     United States.\n       (7) The GI Bill Improvement Act of 1977 (Public Law 95-202) \n     provided that the Secretary of Defense could determine that \n     service for the Armed Forces by organized groups of \n     civilians, or contractors, be considered ``active service'' \n     for benefits administered by the Veterans Administration.\n       (8) Department of Defense Directive 1000.20 directed that \n     the determination be made by the Secretary of the Air Force, \n     and established the Civilian/Military Service Review Board \n     and Advisory Panel.\n       (9) In 1987, three merchant mariners along with the AFL-CIO \n     sued Edward C. Aldridge, Secretary of the Air Force, \n     challenging the denial of their application for veterans \n     status. In Schumacher v. Aldridge (665 F. Supp. 41 (D.D.C. \n     1987)), the Court determined that Secretary Aldridge had \n     failed to ``articulate clear and intelligible criteria for \n     the administration'' of the application approval process.\n       (10) During World War II, women were repeatedly denied \n     issuance of official documentation affirming their merchant \n     marine seamen status by the War Shipping Administration.\n       (11) Coast Guard Information Sheet #77 (April 1992) \n     identifies the following acceptable forms of documentation \n     for eligibility meeting the requirements set forth in GI Bill \n     Improvement Act of 1977 (Public Law 95-202) and Veterans \n     Programs Enhancement Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-368):\n       (A) Certificate of shipping and discharge forms.\n       (B) Continuous discharge books (ship's deck or engine \n     logbooks).\n       (C) Company letters showing vessel names and dates of \n     voyages.\n       (12) Coast Guard Commandant Order of 20 March, 1944, \n     relieved masters of tugs, towboats, and seagoing barges of \n     the responsibility of submitting reports of seamen shipped or \n     discharged on forms, meaning certificates of shipping and \n     discharge forms are not available to all eligible individuals \n     seeking to document their eligibility.\n       (13) Coast Guard Information Sheet #77 (April, 1992) states \n     that ``deck logs were traditionally considered to be the \n     property of the owners of the ships. After World War II, \n     however, the deck and engine logbooks of vessels operated by \n     the War Shipping Administration were turned over to that \n     agency by the ship owners, and were destroyed during the \n     1970s'', meaning that continuous discharge books are not \n     available to all eligible individuals seeking to document \n     their eligibility.\n       (14) Coast Guard Information Sheet #77 (April, 1992) states \n     ``some World War II period log books do not name ports \n     visited during the voyage due to wartime security \n     restrictions'', meaning that company letters showing vessel \n     names and dates of voyages are not available to all eligible \n     individuals seeking to document their eligibility.\n       (b) Methods.--For the purposes of verifying that an \n     individual performed service under honorable conditions that \n     satisfies the requirements of a coastwise merchant seaman who \n     is recognized pursuant to section 401 of the GI Bill \n     Improvement Act of 1977 (Public Law 95-202; 38 U.S.C. 106 \n     note) as having performed active duty service for the \n     purposes described in subsection (d)(1), the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security shall accept the following:\n       (1) In the case of an individual who served on a coastwise \n     merchant vessel seeking such recognition for whom no \n     applicable Coast Guard shipping or discharge form, ship \n     logbook, merchant mariner's document or Z-card, or other \n     official employment record is available, the Secretary shall \n     provide such recognition on the basis of applicable Social \n     Security Administration records submitted for or by the \n     individual, together with validated testimony given by the \n     individual or the primary next of kin of the individual that \n     the individual performed such service during the period \n     beginning on December 7, 1941, and ending on December 31, \n     1946.\n       (2) In the case of an individual who served on a coastwise \n     merchant vessel seeking such recognition for whom the \n     applicable Coast Guard shipping or discharge form, ship \n     logbook, merchant mariner's document or Z-card, or other \n     official employment record has been destroyed or otherwise \n     become unavailable by reason of any action committed by a \n     person responsible for the control and maintenance of such \n     form, logbook, or record, the Secretary shall accept other \n     official documentation demonstrating that the individual \n     performed such service during period beginning on December 7, \n     1941, and ending on December 31, 1946.\n       (3) For the purpose of determining whether to recognize \n     service allegedly performed during the period beginning on \n     December 7, 1941, and ending on December 31, 1946, the \n     Secretary shall recognize masters of seagoing vessels or \n     other officers in command of similarly organized groups as \n     agents of the United States who were authorized to document \n     any individual for purposes of hiring the individual to \n     perform service in the merchant marine or discharging an \n     individual from such service.\n       (c) Treatment of Other Documentation.--Other documentation \n     accepted by the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to \n     subsection (b)(2) shall satisfy all requirements for \n     eligibility of service during the period beginning on \n     December 7, 1941, and ending on December 31, 1946.\n       (d) Benefits Allowed.--\n       (1) Burial benefits eligibility.--Service of an individual \n     that is considered active duty pursuant to subsection (b) \n     shall be considered as active duty service with respect to \n     providing burial benefits under chapters 23 and 24 of title \n     38, United States Code, to the individual.\n       (2) Medals, ribbons, and decorations.--An individual whose \n     service is recognized as active duty pursuant to subsection \n     (b) may be awarded an appropriate medal, ribbon, or other \n     military decoration based on such service.\n       (3) Status of veteran.--An individual whose service is \n     recognized as active duty pursuant to subsection (b) shall be \n     honored as a veteran but shall not be entitled by reason of \n     such recognized service to any benefit that is not described \n     in this subsection.\n       (e) Determination of Coastwise Merchant Seaman.--The \n     Secretary of Homeland Security shall verify that an \n     individual performed service under honorable conditions that \n     satisfies the requirements of a coastwise merchant seaman \n     pursuant to this section without regard to the sex, age, or \n     disability of the individual during the period in which the \n     individual served as such a coastwise merchant seaman.\n       (f) Primary Next of Kin Defined.--In this section, the term \n     ``primary next of kin'' with respect to an individual seeking \n     recognition for service under this section means the closest \n     living relative of the individual who was alive during the \n     period of such service.\n       (g) Effective Date.--This section shall take effect 90 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1586.
