The landmark agreement forged in Paris by the United States and \nabout 200 other nations will go far in protecting our planet for future \ngenerations.\n  Climate change poses one of the greatest threats our world has ever \nknown.

Now is the time to act to stem the tide of \nclimate change.\n  I applaud President Obama for his work on this issue. His leadership \nhas inspired the international community to address climate change and \nits catastrophic effects.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/14/senate-section/article/S8624-6", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL ROBERT T.

Madam President, on a note that I feel important to make \nfor my staff and me, it is important to recognize the accomplishments \nof everyone here in Washington, here on Capitol Hill, here in the \nSenate; it is important to recognize the accomplishments of our staff. \nWe have such remarkably dedicated people. I am so proud of my staff. \nThey have worked this past week tirelessly.\n  I want to talk today, though, about just one of those who has worked \nfor me. His name is BG Robert T. Herbert. He came to me as a \ncongressional fellow two decades ago, and he never left. He was so \ngood. This month marks the 40th year of General Herbert's service in \nthe United States Armed Forces. In 1975, he joined the Army and \nembarked on a remarkable military career. He grew up in a military \nfamily and always dreamed of becoming a military aviator. He made that \ndream a reality, logging over 7,000 flight hours in all different kinds \nof aircraft--fixed-wing and rotary--spending time in virtually every \naircraft within the United States Army inventory.\n  As with all pilots, as they get a little older and have different \nassignments, they just can't stand the fact that they can't fly as they \nused to. So he no longer spends his days in the cockpit when he does \nhis duties at the National Guard. He is Special Assistant to the Chief \nof the National Guard Bureau for National Security Policy here in \nWashington. He previously worked as Nevada's assistant adjunct general.\n  I am grateful for Bob's service to our Nation. A 40-year military \ncareer is an incredible achievement. But I am also thankful for his \nwork here in the Senate. He has been a tireless worker for the people \nof Nevada and for the country.\n  Congratulations to BG Robert T. Herbert on this important milestone, \nand I look forward to his many other accomplishments as Bob's \nillustrious career continues.\n  Would the Presiding Officer announce to the Senate what we are going \nto be doing the rest of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/14/senate-section/article/S8624-7", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise \ntoday to speak about the loss of one of the bravest men in the Chicago \nFire Department, Daniel Capuano.\n  Daniel went to work this morning--just as he has done every day for \nthe past 15 years--ready to fight fires and risk his life to save the \nlives of others. Not many people can say they wake up each day ready to \nmake that sacrifice, but this morning, Daniel Capuano did just that.\n  At 2:40 a.m. today, Daniel Capuano and his fellow firefighters were \ncontacted about a warehouse fire in the 9200 block of South Baltimore \nAvenue on the South Side of Chicago. Daniel and the other firefighters \nwere immediately dispatched to the scene. The warehouse was undergoing \nconstruction, and because of that, there were reports of holes in the \nfloors. When they got there, they saw billowing smoke coming out of the \nvacant three-story warehouse. Firefighter Capuano and his team moved \ncautiously through the second floor of the warehouse in search of the \ncause of the fire, but the heavy, thick smoke made it nearly impossible \nto see, causing Capuano to fall through an elevator shaft from the \nsecond floor of the building to the basement. His fellow firefighters \nwere able to find him quickly and get him on an ambulance and to a \nnearby hospital. Sadly, it was too late. By the time he arrived at the \nhospital, he was already in serious condition. At 4:25 a.m. this \nmorning, Daniel Capuano was pronounced dead from trauma.\n  It is times like these when we are reminded of just how dangerous the \njob these men and women face every day really is. Daniel Capuano spent \nhis entire career putting the safety of his community before his own. \nFor 15 years he served the Chicago Fire Department fighting and \neliminating fires while pulling others to safety. Before that, he was a \nfirefighter in Evergreen Park, a Chicago suburb.\n  Daniel Capuano is a true hero who made the ultimate sacrifice to make \nthe residents of his community and neighborhood safe. Daniel's death is \na devastating loss and serves as a reminder of the risk our \nfirefighters and\n\n[[Page S8625]]\n\nother first responders take every day. My condolences and prayers are \nwith his wife Julie; his three children, Nicholas, Andrew, and Amanda; \nand his fellow firefighters.\n  Daniel, you are a hero to me and to the people of Chicago and \nIllinois. There are no words to truly describe the sorrow for your \nloss. I cannot, nor can anyone, thank you for the commitment you made \nfor the safety of the people in your community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/14/senate-section/article/S8625-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8625-S8626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FREEDOM OF RELIGION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it is interesting--the Midwest draws us \ntogether in the right way.\n  Last night in Springfield, IL, a typical midwestern American city, \nthere was a gathering of people from all across the city at 5:30 on a \nSunday night. It was a gathering at the Islamic Society of Springfield. \nA request had been made for people of all religions to come together \nand to pray in solidarity with our Islamic neighbors. It was billed as \na peace rally originally scheduled to be held outside, even in winter \nweather. Although it has been warm for this time of year, it was \nraining heavy last night as we all arrived at the building, so everyone \ncrammed inside the building. There was standing and sitting room only. \nIt was a huge outpouring of support for our Muslim brothers and sisters \nin the Springfield community.\n  There were representatives of virtually every religion present, and \nmany spoke--rabbis, ministers, Catholic nuns, and even a few elected \nofficials--trying to let our friends in the Muslim community know that \ndespite some of the things that had been said over the last few weeks \nby Presidential candidates, we in fact embrace them as part of the \nAmerican family.\n  There was also an event this weekend that occurred far away from \nSpringfield, in Scottsdale, AZ, where my colleague in the Senate, Jeff \nFlake of Arizona, visited a mosque. It was widely reported. He made \noutstanding remarks about the regret he felt over some of the political \nstatements that had been made over the last several weeks by political \ncandidates. Jeff Flake reminded us across the Nation, as I tried to \nremind those in Springfield last night, that America is a nation which \nvalues the freedom of religious belief.\n  Our Constitution speaks to only three elements when it comes to \nreligion and our government. First, it says that each of us has the \nfreedom and liberty to choose our own religion or to choose no \nreligion. Second, it says our government will never establish an \nofficial state religion. Third, in article VI, it says there will be no \nreligious test in the United States of America of candidates for public \noffice.\n  It is hard to believe that those three simple thoughts have carried \nthis Nation for more than two centuries when it comes to religion, but \nwe have been successful. Our Nation has been successful where others \nhave failed. There have been times when we failed to live up to our own \nideals and our own values, and when hateful statements are made by \nPresidential candidates, it calls on us to remember our history and to \nremember triumphant moments and sad moments as well.\n  It was May of 1939 when the ship SS St. Louis left Germany with 900 \nJewish passengers. They were trying to escape Hitler and the Nazis. \nThey went to Havana, Cuba, and they were turned away. Then they came to \nMiami, FL, asking if they could be refugees, Jewish refugees, coming to \nthe United States, and they were turned away as well. The 900 Jewish \npassengers went back to Germany. According to the records of the \nHolocaust Museum, 200 of them perished in the Holocaust. It was about \nthat same time when Senator Robert Wagner of New York offered a measure \nin the Senate--in this very Chamber--that our country would accept \n10,000 Jewish children from Germany who were seeking to escape the \nHolocaust. Sadly, that measure was defeated.\n  We have other instances in history that go back to the beginning of \nour Nation where we have been challenged to live up to the ideals and \nprinciples of the Constitution. That challenge is with us again today.\n  A candidate for President of the United States--of a major political \nparty--has called for the exclusion of Muslims from being allowed to \nimmigrate into the United States. That is reprehensible, it is \noutrageous, and it is un-American. Members of both political parties in \nCongress have spoken out against it, as they should.\n  We must remember that many of our Nation's Founders fled religious \npersecution to come to this Nation. George Washington summed up the \nprevailing view when he said, ``In this land of equal liberty, it is \nour boast, that a man's religious tenets will not forfeit the \nprotection of the laws.'' That, of course, is included in the First \nAmendment to our Constitution.\n  Throughout our history, many religious minorities have faced \nintolerance, often prejudice. It was once Catholics from Ireland, \nItaly, and my mother's homeland of Lithuania who were questioned. Today \nAmerican Muslims face the same threats of similar discrimination.\n  In recent weeks a number of prominent Republican leaders have made \nthese threats. But I add quickly that there has been a greater number, \nthank goodness, who have spoken out against these statements, even on \nthe Republican side.\n  One Presidential candidate compared Syrian refugees to ``rabid dogs'' \nand said that American Muslims should not be President of the United \nStates. The frontrunner for the Republican nomination called for a \n``total and complete'' ban on Muslim immigrants coming to the United \nStates and advocated for closing down their places of worship. These \ncomments are reprehensible and do not reflect who we are as a nation.\n  These comments also don't reflect the vital role that millions of \nMuslim Americans play in my hometown of Springfield, IL, and across the \nUnited States. There are American Muslims who are teachers, professors, \ndoctors, police officers, first responders, and members of the U.S. \nArmed Forces.\n  I am concerned that the anti-Muslim rhetoric we have heard in recent \nweeks could alienate the Muslim community and harm the important \nrelationship between the community and Federal law enforcement.\n  Last night, as I was leaving the gathering in Springfield, a mother \npulled me aside and said she feared for her daughter who wears a \nhijab--a veil--and who may be the subject of discrimination because of \nthe things that have been said by some of these Presidential \ncandidates. It is important for us to understand her feelings, the love \nof her children, just as we love our own children and grandchildren, \nand to also realize that the feelings of the Muslim Americans are truly \npart of our Nation.\n  Last night we began the gathering in Springfield, IL, pledging \nallegiance to the flag--all of us--and singing ``The Star-Spangled \nBanner.'' Then the first person to make remarks in the Muslim community \ntold us he had served in the U.S. Navy for 19 years. It is hard to \nimagine some of the hateful things that have been said in that context.\n  In testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee in 2004--not \nlong after 9/11--FBI Director Robert Mueller thanked the Muslim and \nArab American communities ``for their assistance and for their ongoing \ncommitment to preventing acts of terrorism.'' It has been important to \nthe United States. He went on to say: ``All of us understand that the \nevolving threats we face today, and those we will face tomorrow, can \nonly be defeated if we work together.''\n  The current FBI Director, James Comey, spoke before a Senate \nJudiciary Committee hearing last week and said:\n\n       We've worked so hard over the last 15 years to build \n     relationships of trust that allow us to find out who might be \n     trouble and to stop it. That's in everybody's interest. And \n     anything that gets in the way, that erodes that relationship \n     of trust, is not a good thing.\n\n  The inflammatory speeches we have heard create a fertile ground for \ndiscrimination. Attorney General Loretta Lynch recently denounced the \n``disturbing rise in anti-Muslim rhetoric'' and stated that her \n``greatest fear as a prosecutor . . . is that the rhetoric will be \naccompanied by acts of violence.''\n  Sitting next to me last night in Springfield was the U.S. attorney \nfor the Central District of Illinois, James Lewis--a friend and someone \nI am very honored and proud to have nominated to the President for this \nposition. He\n\n[[Page S8626]]\n\ntold me he spent the last several weeks traveling across Central \nIllinois, visiting Muslim mosques and assuring them that they were \nstill part of America and that they had the full protection of the law. \nNevertheless, there has been a dramatic increase of anti-Muslim bigotry \nsince 9/11. In fear and anger, some Americans have wrongly struck out \nat Muslims.\n  I had my differences with former President George W. Bush, but he \nshowed real insight, wisdom, and leadership after 9/11 when he made it \nclear to America that our war was with terrorists who perverted the \nteachings of the Islamic religion, not with Muslims who were faithful \nto what he called ``a faith based upon love, not hate.'' Congress at \nthat time spoke with a clear voice too. I cosponsored a resolution with \nJohn Sununu, a Republican from New Hampshire, who was then the only \nArab American in the Senate. Our resolution condemned anti-Muslim, \nanti-Arab bigotry, and said that American Muslims are vibrant, \npeaceful, law-abiding, and greatly contribute to American society. That \nresolution passed both Chambers unanimously. I hope it would pass \ntoday.\n  Earlier this decade, we saw another wave of anti-Muslim rhetoric and \ndiscrimination. In 2011 I chaired the first ever congressional hearing \non the civil rights of American Muslims. That hearing documented an \nalarming increase of anti-Muslim bigotry. At the time, the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission found that Muslims accounted for \napproximately 25 percent of religious discrimination cases, although \nthey were less than 1 percent of the population. Mary Jo O'Neill of the \nEEOC said:\n\n       There's a level of hatred and animosity that is shocking. \n     I've been doing this for 31 years, and I've never seen such \n     antipathy towards Muslim workers.\n\n  Unfortunately, we are again experiencing an increase in anti-Muslim \ndiscrimination. Last week Oren Segal of the Anti-Defamation League \nsaid, ``We're definitely seeing anti-Muslim bigotry escalating around \nthe country.''\n  In recent weeks vandals defaced a mosque near Austin, TX; a pig's \nhead was thrown on the doorstep of a Philadelphia mosque; a man was \narrested for breaking into a Florida mosque and damaging property; a \nsixth grade girl in New York City was allegedly called ``ISIS'' as a \ngroup of boys punched her and tried to remove her hijab; and on \nThanksgiving day a Muslim cabdriver from Pittsburgh was shot in the \nback by a passenger who reportedly asked the driver about ISIS and \nwhether he was a ``Pakistani guy.''\n  Just this weekend a man in California was arrested and charged for a \nhate crime and arson after allegedly setting a fire in a mosque.\n  Last week Representative Andre Carson--a Democrat from Indiana and \none of the two American Muslims who serve in the U.S. Congress--\nreceived a death threat. Here is what Congressman Carson said:\n\n       You have other politicians who are joining the bandwagon \n     and who are fanning the flames of bigotry. That concerns me \n     because we're putting people into the line of fire exposing \n     them to death threats, discrimination at the workplace and \n     assaults.\n\n  These incidents of intimidation, hostility, and violence impact the \nentire Muslim American community. They also play into our enemies' \nwarped views of the United States. Director Comey of the FBI noted last \nweek that ``the notion that the U.S. is anti-Muslim is part of ISIL's \nnarrative and Al Qaeda's narrative.''\n  It is important to note that not only Muslim Americans are being \ntargeted. Bigots have also targeted Arab Americans, many of whom are \nChristian, and Hindus, and Sikhs. After 9/11, the first victim killed \nin the backlash was Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh American, in Mesa, AZ. I \nsubmitted a resolution, which passed the Senate unanimously, condemning \nbigotry against Sikh Americans.\n  In 2012, a White supremacist murdered six Sikhs at a gurdwara in Oak \nCreek, WI. Following this terrorist attack, I chaired a hearing on hate \ncrimes and the threat of domestic extremism where we learned that the \nFBI wasn't even tracking these crimes against Arab Americans, Hindu \nAmericans, and Sikh Americans. I asked the FBI to change the policy, \nand they did. Clearly there is more work to be done.\n  Last week, a vandal spray-painted anti-Muslim graffiti on a Sikh \ngurdwara in Buena Park, CA. In September, a Sikh man in my home State \nof Illinois suffered a fractured cheekbone after he was allegedly \nassaulted by a man who yelled ``terrorist'' and ``go back to your \ncountry'' at him.\n  As we work to combat terrorism, we must also work to prevent and \npunish discrimination and hate-fueled violence against Muslim \nAmericans. The rights of Muslim Americans are just as important as the \nrights of Christians, Jews, followers of other faiths, and nonbelievers \nas well.\n  We know the First Amendment protects both the free exercise of \nreligion and the freedom of speech. But all of us, especially those of \nus in public life, have a responsibility to choose our words carefully. \nWe must condemn bias and bigotry aimed at Muslim Americans and make it \nclear that we will not tolerate religious discrimination in the United \nStates of America. We can protect our Nation and still be true to the \nfundamental freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold that suggestion?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/14/senate-section/article/S8626-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NOMINATION RETURNED TO THE EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, will the Presiding Officer inform me when \nI have used 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified when his time has \nexpired.\n\n\n                           Starzak Nomination\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, these are all able and capable individuals \nwho have been nominated and approved by the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. I want to pay particular attention to the nomination of \nAlissa Starzak to be general counsel of the Department of the Army. I \nhave had the pleasure of working with Ms. Starzak for several years in \nher current capacity as the deputy general counsel of the Department of \nDefense. She has done an extraordinary job. I am confident that her \nextensive legal experience in her current--as well as previous--\nposition has prepared her well for the position for which she has been \nnominated.\n  Prior to her current position at the Department of Defense, Ms. \nStarzak worked at the CIA's Office of General Counsel and also served \nas counsel on the staff of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. \nI don't need to\n\n[[Page S8627]]\n\ntell my colleagues in the Senate how much we rely on capable and \nmotivated staff to fulfill our responsibilities on behalf of the \nAmerican people.\n  I understand from Senator Feinstein, under whose chairmanship Ms. \nStarzak served, that her work in support of the committee was nothing \nshort of exemplary. She was an extraordinary asset to the committee in \nall of its deliberations.\n  Ms. Starzak was originally nominated to be general counsel of the \nArmy in July 2014, and she was later approved by the Senate Armed \nServices Committee by a voice vote in December 2014. Unfortunately, Ms. \nStarzak was not confirmed by the full Senate prior to the adjournment \nof the last session of the Congress. She was renominated in January of \nthis year and her nomination was unanimously agreed to by a voice vote \nof the committee earlier this month.\n  The Army has now been without a Senate-confirmed general counsel for \nnearly 2 years, thereby contributing to institutional instability and \nuncertainty. It is time to provide the Army with the leadership it \ndeserves. If confirmed today, Ms. Starzak will join a new Secretary of \nthe Army and also a new Army Chief of Staff, GEN Mark Milley, where \ntogether they will begin to address the challenges--all of them \ncritical--that face the Army and all of our services.\n  I have no doubt that Ms. Starzak is up to the task and will execute \nher duties with the best interest of the men and women in uniform in \nthe U.S. Army and their families. These thoughts will always be in the \nforefront of her mind, and I urge my colleagues to support her \nnomination.\n  I wish also to point out that there were several issues raised with \nrespect to Ms. Starzak's performance as a member of the staff of the \nIntelligence Committee. All of them have been found to be inaccurate. \nOne suggestion is that there was a document known as the Panetta \nreview, and that the committee staff gained inappropriate access to \nthis document.\n  Senator Feinstein pointed out--at the time she was the chairman of \nthe Intelligence Committee--during a March 2014 floor speech that this \nPanetta review and all of these documents were accessed by staff \nthrough the regular use of a search tool provided by the CIA on a \ncomputer network provided by the CIA to search documents provided by \nthe CIA. This was a process that was overseen and monitored by the CIA, \nobviously.\n  This specific suggestion, allegation, or whatever you want to call \nit, has been reviewed by the CIA's Inspector General, the Senate's \nSergeant at Arms, the CIA's Accountability Review Board, and they found \nno wrongdoing on the part of members on the Intelligence Committee \nstaff.\n  There was another suggestion that some of these documents were marked \ndeliberative and/or privileged. According to Senator Feinstein, this \nwas not especially noteworthy to SSCI--Intelligence Committee staff--\nbecause they were providing, at the direction of their Senators, a \nreview of CIA activities, and thousands of these documents were marked \ndeliberative, procedural, privileged, et cetera. The responsibility of \nthe Congress is to oversee the CIA--not what they will let us look at \nbut what we must look at.\n  Additionally, Senate legal counsel confirmed to Senator Feinstein \nthat Congress does not recognize these claims of privilege when it \ncomes to documents provided to Congress for its oversight duties, and \nthis review process was completely within the purview of the Senate's \noversight responsibility.\n  And then there was another suggestion, or allegation, that, in fact, \nMs. Starzak was involved in the relocation of these Panetta review \ndocuments from an offsite CIA facility to the offices of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee here in the Hart Building. These are absolutely \nand totally without merit because it turns out that the date of the \nremoval of the documents from the offsite facility occurred late in \n2013, more than 2 years after Ms. Starzak left the staff of the \nIntelligence Committee.\n  I think it is important to get these facts and conclusions by \nauthoritative sources, such as the Sergeant at Arms, the CIA Inspector \nGeneral, and the Accountability Review Board of the CIA because there \nhave been some suggestions that she was, in fact, culpable, and that is \nnot the case at all.\n  I again urge all of my colleagues to support a very capable \nindividual who has the skill, the dedication, and the ability to be an \nextraordinary general counsel for Department of the Army.\n  With that, I retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If no one yields time, the time will be \ncharged equally.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be \ndivided equally.\n  We have already divided the time equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REED. How much time do we have remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight and a half minutes.\n  Mr. REED. I believe Senator Feinstein is coming to the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent that the time be equally charged to \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I am very pleased to rise in strong \nsupport of the confirmation of Alissa Starzak to be the general counsel \nof the Army. I urge my colleagues to support her nomination in the vote \nwe are about to take.\n  Alissa was nominated for the position in July of 2014. While she was \nreported out favorably by the distinguished Armed Services Committee \nlast year, she did not receive consideration by the full Senate prior \nto the end of the 113th Congress. The President nominated her again in \nJanuary of this year, and I am very pleased that the Armed Services \nCommittee, under the chairmanship of John McCain and the ranking \nmember, Jack Reed, approved her nomination just a week ago, and I thank \nboth of them for doing so.\n  I support Alissa Starzak for the only reason that matters: She will \nbe an excellent general counsel for the Department of the Army. First, \nshe is a strong lawyer. Second, she cares deeply about the men and \nwomen of the U.S. Army. Given the many challenges our military faces, \nwe can't afford to have this position remain vacant when there is a \nvery strong candidate before us.\n  Since mid-2011, Alissa Starzak has been a senior attorney within the \nOffice of General Counsel of the Department of Defense. She currently \nserves as a deputy general counsel. She has led the Department's \ninteractions with Congress on preparing and negotiating the annual \nDefense authorization, and she has had senior roles in policy \ndiscussions about detainee affairs, sexual assault, and harassment in \nthe military.\n  Alissa has strong expertise in the legal challenges that confront the \nU.S. Army, and she is well suited to provide legal guidance to the \nSecretary and Chief of Staff of the Army and ensure the Department \nstrictly obeys the law.\n  More importantly for me, Alissa was a counsel on the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence from early 2007 to 2011, first under Chairman \nJay Rockefeller and then continuing under my chairmanship. In that \nrole, she worked diligently on legislation to update the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, culminating in the FISA Amendments Act \nof 2008, and she drafted our Intelligence authorization bills, among \nother issues.\n  From December 2007 until her departure from the committee in 2011, \nAlissa was one of two staff leads for our review of the CIA's Detention \nand Interrogation Program. She coauthored a\n\n[[Page S8628]]\n\nsummary of interrogations of two early CIA detainees, Abu Zubaydah and \nal-Nashiri, that spurred the committee to approve, by a 14-to-1 vote, a \nfull review of the entire program.\n  As the colead of that study, Ms. Starzak reviewed many thousands of \ndocuments, drafted portions of the committee's study, and advised me \nand other members of the committee on the progress of the \ninvestigation. She departed the committee in 2011--that was 4 years \nago--before the completion of the report, its declassification, and its \npublic release.\n  I know her work on the SSCI study came up during her confirmation \nhearing at the Armed Services Committee, and I want the record to be \nperfectly clear. Alissa Starzak departed the committee staff in May of \n2011, well before the controversy of the CIA gaining unauthorized \naccess to the committee staff computer network and well before the \ncontroversy over the so-called Panetta Review documents. So it is not \nfair to blame her for anything that happened during that time. She was \nnot there and has not been there for 4 years.\n  As I stated in a Senate floor statement on March 11, 2014, a portion \nof the CIA's Panetta Review was transported securely, consistent with \nits classification from a CIA off-site location to another secure \nfacility--the committee's safe in the Senate. This relocation occurred \nin late 2013, more than 2 years after Ms. Starzak left the committee \nstaff and long after she began her work at the Pentagon. She had no \nprior knowledge and no role in the transportation of the document to \nthe Senate. So there should be no confusion on that point.\n  Before coming to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Alissa \nStarzak worked as an attorney at the CIA's Office of General Counsel \nand as an associate in the international law firm of O'Melveny & Myers.\n  She clerked for the Honorable E. Grady Jolly on the Fifth Circuit of \nAppeals after graduating from the University of Chicago Law School with \nhonors. Ms. Starzak did her undergraduate work at Amherst College where \nshe graduated magna cum laude. So Alissa Starzak has the intelligence, \nthe right background, and the strong experience within the Department \nof Defense to be general counsel for the Army.\n  I urge my colleagues to confirm Alissa Starzak. It is unfortunate \nthat it has taken a year and a half since she was first nominated, but \nI am very pleased we are voting to confirm her today.\n  I conclude by thanking Senator McCain and Senator Reed for working \ntogether to get this done.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, since no one else seeks the floor at \nthis time, it has just been brought to my attention that there are a \ncouple of letters here which I thought are on point, and it will become \nclear.\n  This letter is from Alberto Mora:\n\n       I want to state my absolute and explicit endorsement for \n     the nomination of Alissa Starzak to be the next General \n     Counsel of the Army.\n       By my current affiliation with the Harvard Kennedy School's \n     Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, I served as the General \n     Counsel of the Navy from 2001-2006. I have served alongside \n     many of the most senior civilians in the Department of \n     Defense, and I know what qualities successful civilian \n     leaders should bring to their work, among them professional \n     competence and a commitment to honorable public \n     service. These two qualities describe Ms. Starzak.\n       The Senate has honored me four times by confirming me for \n     appointments in both Republican and Democratic \n     administrations. I am familiar with and supportive of the \n     Senate's role in confirming senior federal officials, but I \n     fear that in Ms. Starzak's case her confirmation has been \n     impeded for reasons unworthy of the Senate. As you are no \n     doubt aware, she served as counsel on the Senate Select \n     Committee on Intelligence for more than four years. Her work \n     on that committee was thorough and professional; she has \n     served the Congress and our republic ably. That she has been \n     disparaged for her work is wrong. It sends a clear and \n     troubling signal to every congressional staffer of both \n     parties that his or her dedicated public service may be \n     treated not as a credential, but as a disqualification for \n     senior administration appointments. If that signal is \n     confirmed by failing to confirm Ms. Starzak--not for what she \n     did wrong, but for what she did right--it would only serve to \n     damage the Senate, this and future administrations, and our \n     nation.\n\n  It is signed by Alberto Mora.\n  I would also like to submit a letter from RADM John D. Hutson, U.S. \nNavy, head of the JAG Corps, retired.\n\n       I write to express my complete and unequivocal support for \n     the nomination of Alissa Starzak to be the next General \n     Counsel of the Army. I have deep concerns that her nomination \n     has been the subject of unfortunate and nasty political \n     theater, but I am heartened to know that her nomination will \n     receive a full floor vote on Monday, 14 December 2015. As you \n     are no doubt aware, she served as a professional staff member \n     on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for more than \n     four years. . . .\n       I served as The Judge Advocate General of the Navy. I \n     underwent the confirmation process. As the senior uniformed \n     lawyer in our service, I spent significant time assisting \n     nominees with confirmation. Throughout my career I worked \n     alongside, and under, some of the most capable, professional, \n     and brilliant people who make up the civilian ranks of \n     appointed leaders in our government. While I don't know her \n     personally, I am very familiar with her reputation, which is \n     stellar.\n       I write because I believe her case has been one that has \n     damaged our republic. She has been maligned for performing \n     her duties as a public servant, and her nomination was held \n     up because of events that occurred after she left the \n     committee staff.\n       I encourage you in the strongest terms to confirm her for \n     this position. Losing her services to the rankling of \n     partisan disputes would be to the detriment of both the \n     Department of Defense and the country.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   John D.

TONINI\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute today to a \ndistinguished airman and honored Kentuckian who has given over four \ndecades of his life to military service. Maj. Gen. Edward W. Tonini, \nfor 8 years the adjutant general of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, \nretired from service on December 8.\n  General Tonini is a career Air National Guard officer and was \nappointed adjutant general by the former Governor in 2007. As adjutant \ngeneral, he served as the commanding general of both the Kentucky Army \nand Air National Guard and as executive director of the Department of \nMilitary Affairs.\n  In his 8 years of service in that role, he successfully led the \nNational Guard and Kentucky through many difficult challenges with \ngreat skill and ability. He leaves Kentucky's National Guard stronger \nand more effective than when he found it.\n  During his tenure, Kentucky's National Guard continued to deploy \nsoldiers and airmen to Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Djibouti, Kenya, \nEthiopia, South America, and even Antarctica. In fact, Kentucky \nNational Guard soldiers and airmen were deployed in support of \ncontingency operations every day of General Tonini's tenure, to the \ntune of over 16,000 servicemembers over the years.\n  In January 2009, Kentucky experienced one of the worst natural \ndisasters in the State's history when 10 inches of snow fell on top of \n3 inches of ice throughout most of the State. More than 100 counties \ndeclared states of emergency while FEMA declared the whole State a \ndisaster zone.\n  In response to this crisis, General Tonini led the largest State-\nactive-duty call up in Kentucky's history. More than 4,600 \nservicemembers assisted Kentuckians in need, as nearly 800,000 people \nwere without power and heat. Surely many lives were saved thanks to his \nleadership during these efforts.\n  General Tonini worked to establish Kentucky's new, state-of-the-art \nCommonwealth Emergency Operations Center, which serves as a vital \ncommand center and liaison to local governments in times of crisis. The \nnew Commonwealth Emergency Operations Center\n\n[[Page S8630]]\n\nisn't the only new improvement under General Tonini's watch.\n  During the last 8 years, the Kentucky National Guard has undertaken \nnearly $200 million in facility improvements, consisting of both new \nbuildings and additions and alterations to existing buildings, to add \nabout 650,000 square feet of facilities to the Guard's resources. These \nnew facilities include the Paducah and Richmond Armed Forces Reserve \nCenter, the Owensboro Readiness Center, and the Army Aviation Support \nFacility in Frankfort, among others. General Tonini was also a champion \nof the important work taking place at the Bluegrass Station industrial \npark in central Kentucky.\n  General Tonini was a strong advocate of Kentucky's Agribusiness \nDevelopment Teams, a program in support of Operation Enduring Freedom \nin Afghanistan. These teams of Kentucky soldiers and airmen taught \nagricultural expertise to the people of Afghanistan, sharing their \nknowledge of irrigation techniques, food preservation, veterinary \nmedicine, and more with hundreds of Afghans across the country.\n  General Tonini also was a strong supporter of the Guard's state \npartnership program, where the Kentucky National Guard partners with a \nforeign nation to strengthen the operations of both partners. The \nKentucky National Guard has partnered with Ecuador for 19 years. Under \nthe general's leadership, Kentucky added a second partnership program \nwith Djibouti, making my State the first to partner with an east \nAfrican nation. Djibouti is a key strategic partner for us in \nhumanitarian and counterterrorist operations.\n  General Tonini's leadership has also been recognized outside the \nCommonwealth. In 2013, he was elected the president of the Adjutants \nGeneral Association of the United States. During his tenure as \npresident, America's National Guard boasted more than 450,000 personnel \nacross the Nation.\n  Under General Tonini, Kentucky hosted the two largest events in the \nNation for survivor outreach to support the family members of fallen \nservicemembers, one in Louisville and the other in northern Kentucky. \nWe were able to honor more than 850 survivors from multiple States.\n  Finally, the Kentucky National Guard Memorial saw completion after 10 \nyears thanks to General Tonini's persistence and his prodigious \nfundraising efforts. Located at Boone National Guard Center in \nFrankfort, the memorial honors 234 Kentucky guardsmen who have given \ntheir lives in the line of duty since 1912.\n  General Tonini has all these accomplishments and many more to be \nproud of as he steps down from the adjutant general post he so ably \nfilled for 8 years. He has truly earned a place not just in Kentucky \nhistory, but in Kentuckians' hearts for his honorable service.\n  I would be remiss if I did not also laud the general's wife, Carol, \nwho has been a consistent presence with him at the full range of \nNational Guard events, both in Kentucky and throughout the country. She \nhas been a tremendous asset to him thanks to her grace, her support for \nthose in uniform and their families, and her rock-solid support for her \nhusband.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating General Edward W. \nTonini upon his retirement and thanking him for his service--not just \nover the last 8 years, but over the last four decades. Kentucky is \nthankful for the many sacrifices he has made over the years to protect \nour communities and our Nation. I certainly want to wish General Tonini \nall the best in whatever awaits him in his next endeavors, and I am \nsure he will tackle all future challenges with the same vigor and \nfortitude he applied to his military service. Thank you, General \nTonini, on behalf of a grateful Commonwealth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/14/senate-section/article/S8630-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNIZING THE 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CULINARY WORKERS UNION LOCAL \n                                  226\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 80th \nanniversary of the Culinary Workers Union Local 226.\n  Since it was founded in 1935, the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 \nhas successfully advocated on behalf of thousands of hospitality \nworkers throughout Nevada. These workers include the housekeepers, \nkitchen staff, cooks, and food and beverage servers who play an \nindispensable role in our local and national economy. Along with local \npartners, the culinary union has effectively represented workers by \nadvocating for competitive wages, affordable health insurance coverage, \nand enhanced working conditions. The culinary union is vital in the \neffort to provide real opportunities for working-class individuals and \nfamilies.\n  Over the past eight decades, workplace environments across the United \nStates have been transformed to meet our country's changing needs. \nThroughout these changes, the culinary union has always been on the \nfrontlines to ensure that workers continue to receive fair treatment \nand the benefits they have earned. In particular, the culinary union \nsuccessfully mobilized casino workers on many occasions to ensure that \nthey received adequate health care coverage, improved contract terms, \nand pension benefits.\n  The organization has also had a positive impact on its members \nthrough the establishment of local services, such as the culinary \nhealth fund and the culinary pharmacy. The culinary health fund is a \nhealth plan that provides benefits to more than 130,000 participants, \nensuring that union members and their families have access to essential \nhealth care services that keep them healthy. Additionally, in 2001, the \nculinary union launched a citizen project, which provides assistance \nfor individuals and families navigating the citizenship process.\n  I applaud the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 for their dedicated \nwork and commitment to improving the lives of Nevadans. Their work is \ntruly appreciated and admired, and I wish the organization continued \nsuccess for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/14/senate-section/article/S8630-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8630-S8631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LOURDES TIBAN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want other Senators to be aware of \ninformation I received about Ecuadorian National Assembly member \nLourdes Tiban, a prominent and respected leader of Ecuador's indigenous \npeople.\n  As an indigenous leader, Ms. Tiban has become one of the most \noutspoken advocates for freedom of expression, indigenous rights, and \nsocial rights in Ecuador. Not surprisingly, this has made her the \ntarget of verbal attacks by President Rafael Correa.\n  Earlier this year, Ms. Tiban was beaten by unidentified assailants as \nshe was walking to work. The assault was filmed and then shared online \nby government supporters who posted humiliating comments.\n  This isn't the first time that Ms. Tiban has been physically \nassaulted. She is the victim of two other similar incidents which I am \ntold have not been properly investigated.\n  It is regrettable that, instead of vigorously investigating this \nlatest attack against Ms. Tiban, a National Assembly member from \nPresident Correa's political party has brought a criminal case for \nlibel against her. This is believed to be in retaliation for Ms. \nTiban's claim that government supporters were responsible for targeting \nher, presumably in an attempt to silence her and remove her from the \nNational Assembly.\n  Ecuador is a country where judicial independence is seriously \ncompromised. I have spoken about this several times, and it has been \nwell documented by the Department of State, the United Nations, and \nhuman rights organizations. It is also illustrated by the fact that the \nCouncil of the Judiciary, with the power to appoint and remove judges, \nis comprised of five former officials of the Correa administration. It \nis likely that the criminal investigation against Ms. Tiban could \nresult in an unjust conviction.\n  We should condemn these attacks on freedom of expression, political \nrights, and the rights of indigenous people, and we should defend \njudicial independence which is fundamental to democracy in Ecuador and \nthroughout the hemisphere.\n  Lourdes Tiban has devoted her legislative efforts to protecting human \nrights for her people, and I am confident that she will continue to do \nso as she is not easily intimidated. She has my support and the support \nof others who believe in the principles of democracy.\n\n[[Page S8631]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/14/senate-section/article/S8631-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n         RECOGNIZING THE GRAND ISLE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, many talented Vermonters support local \nagencies charged with ensuring the safety of Vermont communities \nthroughout the State, each and every day. Today I would like to \nrecognize one such department--the Grand Isle County Sheriff's \nDepartment, which received two national Highway Safety Awards at last \nmonth's annual gathering of the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice in Chicago.\n  Grand Isle County lies in the northwest reaches of Vermont, covering \nfive towns and 85 square miles of land. It is actually a chain of \nislands surrounded by the waters of Lake Champlain, with commanding \nviews of the Adirondacks to the west and the Green Mountains to the \neast. Its communities swell with summer visitors who come to enjoy the \n``beauty spot'' of the islands. While it is a rural area, Grand Isle \nCounty is also home to the busy Route 2 corridor that links the United \nStates and Canada, a critical transportation route for commerce between \nthe two countries. As such, Grand Isle provides unique challenges for \nSheriff Ray Allen and his 13 sworn deputies who work to protect the \nsafety of its visitors and residents while ensuring that traffic is not \nimpeded.\n  The Grand Isle Sheriff's Department was one of only three small \nsheriff agencies to be recognized with the National Law Enforcement \nSafety Challenge award, as noted by the Burlington Free Press. The \naward cited the department's excellence in traffic safety, with \nspecific focus on impaired driving and speeding violations.\n  Sheriff Allen's department was also honored with the National \nSheriffs' Association's Top Traffic Safety Award, sharing that \ndistinction with the Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office.\n  These two awards are a notable achievement for a small department and \nin no small part due to Sheriff Allen's strong leadership. Sheriff \nAllen is the type of law enforcement officer who cares deeply about the \ncommunities he serves and the department he represents. Sheriff Allen \nwas sworn into office in 2011, following 20 years of service as a \ndeputy sheriff. When he is not tending to highways, he is tending to \nthe family's well-known apple orchard.\n  On the Grand Isle Sheriff's Department Web site, Sheriff Allen cites \n``the great working relationship with Local, State and Federal \nagencies'' that his department enjoys. This, we know, does not happen \nby accident, and such cooperation is a trademark of successful \npolicing.\n  ``We will strive to build upon the confidence and trust the citizens \nof Grand Isle County have placed upon us by developing strong \nrelationships with the community and providing high quality, cost \neffective law enforcement services.'' This is Sheriff Allen's pledge, \nand one supported by those who work with him.\n  With these awards, Sheriff Allen has done just that. He has made his \ndepartment and his community proud. Congratulations, Sheriff Ray Allen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/14/senate-section/article/S8631-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO PRISCILLA HOBSON HANLEY\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the contributions \nof Priscilla Hobson Hanley, who is retiring after more than 30 years of \ndistinguished public service as staff in the U.S. Congress.\n  Since the very beginning of my service in the Senate nearly 19 years \nago, Priscilla has been one of my most valued advisers. She has always \nprovided me with expertise on health care issues and Social Security, \nand most recently, she has served as staff director for the Senate \nAging Committee. She exemplifies the ideal public servant; integrity, \nthoroughness, a spirit of inquiry, and hard work characterize her \nservice. Above all, Priscilla has always demonstrated her belief that \nit is an honor to serve the people of Maine and our Nation.\n  I first met Priscilla in 1984 when we both worked for Maine Senator \nBill Cohen. After brief stints working in the House for two Congressmen \nfrom her native California, Priscilla was hired by Senator Cohen that \nyear and developed an in-depth knowledge of health care issues. She \nbecame deputy staff director of the Aging Committee when Senator Cohen \nserved as chairman.\n  When I assumed Senator Cohen's seat in 1997, Priscilla was one of the \nvery first people I hired; thus I had a terrific expert in two subject \nareas of great concern to my Maine constituents: health care and senior \nissues. As health policy adviser and legislative assistant, Priscilla \nbrought her intelligence and experience to bear on the complex and \nmyriad issues of health care, biomedical research, access to care in \nrural areas, women's health, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. \nThrough her leadership role on the Aging Committee staff, she advanced \nour priorities of improving retirement security, increasing funding for \nresearch on diseases like Alzheimer's and diabetes, and protecting \nagainst scams targeting seniors.\n  Three examples illustrate Priscilla's commitment to service. In 1997, \nmy very first year in the Senate, we were considering a massive tax \nbill. At the last minute, a one-sentence provision appeared out of \nnowhere that was, beneath the innocuous wording, a $50-billion tax \ngiveaway to Big Tobacco. Priscilla spotted that one sentence in the \n327-page bill, and we were able to put an end to the subsidy.\n  Priscilla also helped me start the Diabetes Caucus in the Senate in \n1998. As a result of her dedication, funding for diabetes research has \ntripled since that year.\n  In 2003, our Nation was still reeling from the attacks of 9/11, and \nCongress was working on a tax-cut bill to invigorate the struggling \neconomy. A key to the success of that bill and to the economic rebound \nthat followed was the temporary increase in the Federal Medical \nAssistance Percentage, or FMAP, to help States provide health care to \nlow-income families. Priscilla led the way in developing that key \nprovision.\n  From dramatic increases in funding for diabetes and Alzheimer's \nresearch to improvements in rural health care and advancements in \nmental health parity, Priscilla has played a leadership role. Her work, \ndue to her unassuming nature, may often be unheralded, but her legacy \nis inspiring to all of us who serve.\n  When not working for the American people, Priscilla's great passion \nis a love of musical theater. In fact, a rare interruption in her more \nthan three decades of service on the Hill came when she took a brief \nrespite from Congress to help run an opera company in Virginia.\n  Priscilla has a particular fondness for the comic operas of Gilbert \nand Sullivan, and like Major General Stanley of The Pirates of \nPenzance, she has an encyclopedic knowledge of all things ``vegetable, \nanimal, and mineral.'' She truly is the very model of a modern Senate \nstaffer, a model all should emulate.\n  A life so devoted to public service brings to mind the parable of the \ntalents. The master, leaving on a journey, entrusts a servant with a \nportion of his treasure. Upon his return, the master is delighted to \nfind that his wealth was been wisely invested and multiplied.\n  Priscilla Hobson Hanley was entrusted the great treasure of \nintelligence, energy, and passion. She invested that treasure wisely \nand through hard work and determination multiplied its benefits to all. \nTo her, I quote Scripture and say, ``Well done, good and faithful \nservant.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/14/senate-section/article/S8631-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8631-S8632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MARK FELTON\n\n  Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I wish to recognize one of West \nVirginia's prized public servants, Mark Felton, on the occasion of his \nretirement. Through his various roles in the Region III Planning and \nDevelopment Council, Mark has been an indispensable resource to the \nfour counties he has served for over 30 years.\n  After earning his bachelor's and master's degrees in geography from \nMarshall University, Mark began his career in the transportation \ndepartment of the regional planning council in 1983. Mark authored and \nsupervised innumerable transportation-related studies that benefited \nresidents of the region through improved roads, bridges, travel times, \nand safety.\n  The regional councils serve as integral partners in the planning and \nexecution of infrastructure improvements, including water and sewer \nprojects. During my time representing the 2nd\n\n[[Page S8632]]\n\nCongressional District and continuing through to my time in the Senate, \nmy staff and I worked with Mark and the council to complete numerous \ninfrastructure projects; as a result, we provided potable water to \nthousands of West Virginians. I have always appreciated the technical \nassistance and knowledge that Mark and his staff bring to any \nundertaking. These projects are not always the most glamorous, but they \nare necessary for the health of the people we serve.\n  In 2006, Mark was promoted to executive director of the regional \nplanning council. In this role, Mark successfully worked alongside \nlocal, county, and State leaders to achieve many goals throughout the \nregion. Mark was consistent in his determination to utilize region \nIII's resources in the most efficient manner possible.\n  One highlight of Mark's career includes working with the West \nVirginia Division of Highways and the U.S. Department of Transportation \nto build the Saint Albans--Nitro Bridge. This was a major achievement \nthat required patience and diligent planning to complete. Through a \nclever design variation, millions of taxpayer dollars were saved, and \nthe project was completed ahead of schedule. I commend Mark and his \nteam for working skillfully with Federal and State partners to \naccomplish this huge undertaking under budget and on time. Time and \nagain, Mark exhibited great leadership and wisdom in his roles with the \nregional planning council and has made a lasting difference in the \nhealth and safety of residents of Kanawha, Clay, Boone, and Putnam \nCounties.\n  In his spare time, Mark actively participates in local theater \nactivities in the Kanawha Valley, acting in roles for the Charleston \nLight Opera Guild and Kanawha Players. In addition, he previously \nserved as president of the Children's Theater of Charleston. Hopefully \nhe will continue with his passion, as I have always enjoyed seeing him \non stage.\n  Mark is also a member of Kanawha United Presbyterian Church where he \nactively participates in the church and bell choirs. Additionally, he \nis a property trustee of the church and plans to be more involved in \nboth internal operations and outreach ministries after his retirement. \nMark and his wife, Kerry, a kindergarten teacher for Kanawha County \nSchools, have two children, Erin and Patrick.\n  I wish Mark a fond farewell and the best of luck to him and his \nfamily in the next phase of their lives. Our State owes Mark a debt of \ngratitude for his hard work and dedication to his community. It has \nbeen a privilege working with him, and I urge my colleagues to join me \nin congratulating Mark on a wonderful career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/14/senate-section/article/S8632-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO MAYOR DONNALEE LOZEAU\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Nashua Mayor \nDonnalee Lozeau. As a resident of Nashua, I am so proud to call \nDonnalee my mayor. She is an extraordinary public servant, and I extend \nmy heartfelt gratitude as she approaches the conclusion of her two \nterms serving the people of the Gate City.\n  As a third generation resident of Nashua and a graduate of the city's \npublic school system, Donnalee cares deeply about Nashua's future, and \nshe has a long record of service to the people of our city. That \nincludes her previous service to Nashua in the New Hampshire House of \nRepresentatives for eight terms, earning the role of deputy speaker. \nShe has always been known for her independent leadership, her \ncommitment to bringing people together to build consensus, and for \nensuring that government is responsive and efficient on behalf of hard-\nworking taxpayers. Donnalee grasps the qualities of what makes our \nState unique, and in turn, she leads with a passion for problem-solving \nand a dedication to delivering results. She truly listens to everyone \nand communicates in sincere and candid terms--which I believe makes her \nan exceptional leader. In addition, as Nashua's first female mayor, \nDonnalee is an inspiration for young women in our State to pursue \npublic service.\n  Under her leadership, Nashua's growth and resilience as a city helped \nlead to major accomplishments in infrastructure, public education, new \nbusiness sectors, and companies. Donnalee brought her welcoming, \nhonest, and accessible approach to governing and enhanced the \nreputation of the city of Nashua by exemplifying those values. In \naddition to her tireless work at city hall, she has also been an active \nleader promoting philanthropic, cultural, and business activity across \nthe city. As part of her ongoing dedication to serving Nashua's \ncommunity and those in need, Donnalee will continue to contribute to \nour city as executive director of Southern New Hampshire Services, a \nnonprofit social services agency. Her legacy is also being honored by \nNashua's Rivier University with the creation of the Mayor Donnalee \nLozeau Leadership Scholarship, which will be used to support the \ndevelopment of many generations of new leaders to come.\n  As Donnalee prepares to leave city hall, I would like to thank her \nfor the thousands of hours she devoted to making Nashua an even better \nplace to live, work, and raise a family. I am so grateful for \nDonnalee's leadership, commitment, and friendship, and I wish her all \nthe best as she begins the next chapter of her career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/14/senate-section/article/S8632-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8632-S8633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO DR. ROBERT E. WOLVERTON, SR.\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to commend the \nremarkable 66-year, and still counting, career of Mississippi State \nUniversity professor and lifelong educator, Robert E. ``Bob'' \nWolverton, Sr., of Starkville, MS. His many years of hard work and \ndedication continue to inspire the Mississippi State family to learn \nmore and achieve more for the betterment of our State and Nation. I \ncongratulate Dr. Wolverton for his important contributions to higher \neducation throughout his distinguished career. He and his wife, Peggy, \nare well respected and admired throughout the university and community.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a December 1, 2015, article from \nMississippi State University, titled ``MSU honors Wolverton with naming \nof new building rotunda,'' be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                [From the Mississippi State University, \n                             Dec. 1, 2015]\n\n        MSU Honors Wolverton With Naming of New Building Rotunda\n\n                           (By Harriet Laird)\n\n       Starkville, MS.--An accomplished professor and lifelong \n     educator whose career spans more than six decades will be \n     honored by Mississippi State with the naming of a select area \n     in one of the university's newest and largest buildings.\n       Robert E. ``Bob'' Wolverton Sr., former vice president for \n     academic affairs and longtime professor of classics, will see \n     his name etched into the rotunda of MSU's new classroom \n     building, a 150,000 square foot structure currently under \n     construction in the heart of the 137-year-old campus. The \n     honor comes while the 90-year-old educator is still active as \n     a member of the MSU faculty.\n       Seeing more than 2,000 students walk each day through the \n     facility's rotunda once construction is completed in the fall \n     of 2016, this naming reflects Wolverton's dedication to \n     educating students for 66 years, 38 of those at Mississippi \n     State.\n       ``Simply put, Dr. Wolverton is a venerable institution at \n     our university,'' said MSU President Mark E. Keenum. ``At an \n     age where most professors have long since retired, Dr. \n     Wolverton continues to inspire his students, his colleagues, \n     and this administration through his true wisdom and the \n     passion he still has for the subject matter he imparts. What \n     a fitting honor that the rotunda in one of our soon-to-be \n     iconic buildings will forever bear his name.''\n       Wolverton began his tenure at MSU in 1977 when he became \n     the university's vice president of academic affairs, having \n     served previously as president for the College of Mount St. \n     Joseph in Ohio. In 1986, he began teaching in the Department \n     of Foreign Languages, now the Department of Classical and \n     Modern Languages and Literatures, serving as the unit's head \n     from 1991-1996.\n       A two-term chair of MSU's Robert Holland Faculty Senate, he \n     last held the title eight years ago at age 82, with many \n     regarding him as the ``elder statesman'' in such a position \n     at any college or university.\n       Also an MSU John Grisham Master Teacher, the highest honor \n     given for excellence in classroom instruction, Wolverton has \n     been honored with the MSU Alumni Association Faculty \n     Achievement Award and College of Arts and Sciences Humanist \n     Award.\n       ``All of us admire Bob Wolverton for his unwavering \n     commitment to excellence in\n\n[[Page S8633]]\n\n     teaching and to the students of MSU,'' said Jerry Gilbert, \n     MSU provost and executive vice president. ``Through his many \n     years of service, he has established himself as a tremendous \n     asset to the university. I am so proud that we have chosen to \n     recognize Bob by naming the rotunda in his honor.''\n       Wolverton holds a bachelor's degree in classics from \n     Hanover (Indiana) College, a master's from the University of \n     Michigan, and a doctorate from the University of North \n     Carolina. He has been on the faculty at the University of \n     Georgia, and Tufts and Florida State universities.\n       Active in the community, he was honored in 2001 as one of \n     Mississippi's ``Ageless Heroes'' by Blue Cross and Blue \n     Shield of Mississippi.

NOLAN\n\n Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise to honor a Nebraskan who \nwas recently interred at Arlington National Cemetery. Lt. Col. John J. \nNolan of Lincoln, NE, was a U.S. Air Force pilot who deserves our \nrespect and gratitude. After the bombing at Pearl Harbor, he gave up a \nfootball scholarship at Temple University to enlist in the Army Air \nCorps in 1943.\n  During World War II, John was a B-25 aircraft commander with the \nheralded Air Apaches, 345th Bombardment Group, assigned to the Fifth \nAir Force operating in the Southwest Pacific.\n  In this capacity, he flew low-level strafing missions in specially \nconfigured B-25s with eight .50-caliber machine guns that were \ncontrolled by pilots. He flew in the Black Sunday raid on Hollandia, \nNew Guinea, on April 16, 1944. This raid became the worst operational \nloss ever suffered by the Fifth Air Force in a single day.\n  Following World War II, the Air Force realized more pilots had been \nlost on instruments than in actual combat. In response, the Instrument \nPilot Instruction School was created. John was one of the initial cadre \nof pilots tasked with providing standardized instrument procedures, \ntechniques, and training methods. These pilots were also required to \ntest and evaluate flight instruments in adverse weather conditions. \nDuring this period, he became the B-25 high-time pilot for the entire \nU.S. Air Force.\n  John also wrote a substantial part of the instrument flying \nguidelines, known as Air Force Manual 51-37. Many pilots owe their \nlives to this manual. As a matter of fact, when his two sons went \nthrough pilot training in 1967 and 1973, respectively, his instructions \nwere still in the manual.\n  John transitioned to F-86s as a part of the Air Force's newly created \nAll Weather Interceptors. He also served in Japan during the Korean \nwar.\n  In the 1960s, when commercial aviation was converting to jet-powered \naircraft and entering into military airspace at high altitudes, John \nwas assigned to Richards-Gebaur Air Force Base, known as Air Defense \nCommand. He became the Air Force liaison to the FAA Central Region, and \nhe was tasked with developing and coordinating procedures to ensure \nsafe arrival and departures within this shared airspace. In this \ncapacity, John was also responsible for maintaining military readiness \nand operational capabilities.\n  Upon his retirement in October 1963, John was chosen to serve as the \nMidwest recruiter for the Air Force Academy.\n  John dedicated his entire life to his beloved U.S. Air Force. Not \nonly did he serve honorably, John was also an integral participant in \nso many of the milestones that are now a part of Air Force history.\n  John never lost his love of flight. He continued to fly well into his \nlate eighties in his restored Fairchild PT 19/26, which is the same \naircraft he initially learned to fly in as a cadet in the Army Air \nCorps.\n  Lt. Col. John Nolan's entire life was for God and country. He married \nMarie Di Giambattista on January 6, 1944, before he was assigned \noverseas. Together, they raised four children. Marie sacrificed much, \nas so many of our military families experience today, moving 23 times \nin John's 20-year career. They were married 71 years. Only 27 days \nafter Marie passed, John died this past July 3, 2015, at the age of 94.\n  We owe a debt of gratitude to John Nolan and his family. He led an \nextraordinary life at a time when our country needed people like him \nthe most. Through all of this, he remained humble. We will never forget \nhis sacrifices and patriotism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/14/senate-section/article/S8633-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO FRED GRAY\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \nlife and accomplishments of civil rights attorney Fred Gray, Sr., of \nMontgomery, AL.\n  Fred Gray was born in Montgomery, AL, on December 14, 1930. He \nattended the Nashville Christian Institute and received a baccalaureate \ndegree from the then-Alabama State College for Negroes. From there, he \nwent on to receive a law degree from Case Western Reserve University \nSchool of Law in Cleveland, OH. Mr. Gray passed the bar examination and \nreturned to his home town of Montgomery to establish a law office. He \ndedicated himself to the goal of ``destroying everything segregated he \ncould find.'' He also began preaching at the Holt Street Church of \nChrist.\n  During the 1950s and 1960s civil rights movement, Mr. Gray worked \nalongside Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., E.D. Nixon, and other leaders of \nthe movement. He represented Claudette Colvin and Rosa Parks, who were \ncharged with disorderly conduct for refusing to seat themselves in the \nrear of segregated city buses. Mr. Gray also successfully defended Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr., against tax evasion charges.\n  In addition, he represented the Montgomery Improvement Association \nduring the more than yearlong Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1955, which \nultimately led to the United States Supreme Court case Browder v. \nGayle. This case was filed by Mr. Gray. Additionally, Mr. Gray filed \nand argued the historic and much-cited case of Gomillion v. Lightfoot \nbefore the U.S. Supreme Court, which overturned State redistricting of \nTuskegee, AL. After this case, Mr. Gray continued to lead legal efforts \nto desegregate schools in Alabama.\n  In 1970, Mr. Gray was one of the first African Americans elected as a \nState legislator in Alabama. However, he did not allow his new role to \nprevent him from continuing to represent local Alabamians in the \njudicial system.\n  In the early 1970s, Mr. Gray represented plaintiffs in the class-\naction lawsuit regarding the Federal Tuskegee syphilis study and \nsucceeded in securing appropriate damages and restitutions for 72 study \nsurvivors. As a result of efforts led by Mr. Gray, President Clinton \ninvited the study survivors and their families to a ceremony at the \nWhite House, where he officially apologized for the actions of the \nFederal Government regarding the study.\n  In 2002, Fred Gray became the first African-American president of the \nAlabama Bar Association. Mr. Gray has spent his life working to achieve \nequal justice and liberty for the citizens of Alabama. His dedication \nto the civil rights movement is unequaled, and we are all grateful for \nthe tireless work he has done on behalf of all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/14/senate-section/article/S8633-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/14/senate-section/article/S8633-4", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/14/senate-section/article/S8633-5", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8633-S8634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 6, 2015, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on December 4, 2015, during the \nadjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House of \nRepresentatives announcing that the Speaker pro tempore (Mrs. Comstock) \nhad signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 22.
