Madam President, this week we commemorate National \nPolice Week and pay tribute to the local, State, and Federal law \nenforcement officers who keep our country and our communities safe. We \nare grateful for their service and for their sacrifice. We benefit from \ntheir pledge to serve, protect, and defend.\n  I had the pleasure recently of meeting with several officers from \nRichmond, KY, who were in town for the events of police week. I also \nmet with the families of Kentucky police officers who laid down their \nlives in the line of duty. Tragically, five officers from the Bluegrass \nState were lost in 2015: on March 5, Lieutenant Clifford Scott Travis \nof the Bullitt County Detention Center; on March 11, Officer Burke \nJevon Rhoads of the Nicholasville Police Department; on June 23, State \nTrooper Eric Keith Chrisman; on September 13, State Trooper Joseph \nCameron Ponder; and on November 6, Senior Patrol Officer Daniel Neil \nEllis of the Richmond Police Department.\n  The names of these five officers, along with the names of hundreds of \nother brave officers from across the country, have been added to our \nnational monument to law enforcement officers lost in the line of \nduty--the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. The names of over \n500 Kentuckians appear on the memorial, and more than 20,000 names from \nacross the country appear in all.\n  That includes the four Capitol police officers we have lost in the \nline of duty since 1994. The Capitol police recently held a ceremony to \nhonor their fallen officers. It reminds us of the continuing sacrifices \nof the men and women who stand guard every day at the very heart of our \ndemocracy. We are grateful for their service.\n  I am a proud cosponsor of the resolution to recognize National Police \nWeek this year. The resolution recognizes the work of active-duty law \nenforcement officers, the 25th anniversary of the National Law \nEnforcement Officers Memorial, the 15th anniversary of 9/11, and all \nthe officers lost in the line of duty in 2015.\n  I am also a proud cosponsor of the Fallen Heroes Flag Act. This bill \nwould create a program to provide flags that have been flown over the \nCapitol to the immediate family members of law enforcement and public \nsafety officers who were lost in the line of duty. This bill has passed \nboth the House and the Senate and is awaiting the President's \nsignature.\n  I am also a cosponsor, with my friend the senior Senator from Texas, \nof the POLICE Act. The POLICE Act would expand COPS grants so that \nthose grants could be used for active-shooter training and to help \nequip law enforcement to respond to events like the San Bernardino \nshootings. Passing the POLICE Act would help give our police officers \nthe training they need to do their jobs more effectively. I am hopeful \nwe can quickly move to this important legislation.\n  I am proud to represent Kentucky's police officers here in the \nSenate. Law enforcement is very dangerous work. It is also a noble \ncalling, and I am grateful for the service of every police officer in \nKentucky and across the Nation. I know my colleagues share my deep\n\n[[Page S2798]]\n\nadmiration and respect for police officers everywhere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/16/senate-section/article/S2798-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

In Nevada, we too have had our share of these awful \ninstances where these men and women are killed needlessly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/16/senate-section/article/S2798-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2798-S2799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ZIKA VIRUS AND NOMINATION OF MERRICK GARLAND\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, what we know today is that the Zika virus \nwas first discovered in 1947 in Uganda. It was first detected in \nmonkeys, but in 1947 they also learned that the mosquito was now \ncarrying this same virus the monkeys had. Initially, we didn't know or \nhear much about Zika. But we have heard plenty now, and we are going to \nhear a lot more.\n  Researchers named the virus Zika because that is where the mosquito \ncarrying the virus was discovered, in the Zika Forest of Uganda, as I \nmentioned. The Ugandan term ``zika'' means ``overgrown.'' So these \nmosquitoes with this virus were discovered in an overgrown forest in \nUganda. Now, seven decades later, Zika is an international emergency, \nand countries are scrambling to address the problems created by this \nmosquito that bites. What I have learned is that there is more than one \ntype of mosquito; there are two.\n  Already Zika-carrying mosquitoes have transmitted the disease to \nAmerican citizens in Puerto Rico and other United States territories. \nSoon, mosquitoes carrying this virus will be biting and infecting \npeople in the continental United States. That is not hyperbole. It is \ngoing to happen. Zika-carrying mosquitoes won't be limited to the gulf \ncoast.\n  Madam President, look at this map. You can't see it very well on \nthis, but you can see the discoloration here, the original coloring \nthat we have. We have the blue, and we have the orange and the gray. \nNow, I was really surprised. I thought this would really be in the \nsubtropical climates here in the United States, in the southern part of \nour country. I thought that is where it would be, but you can see that \nis not the case.\n  Nevada is here, and Las Vegas is here. There are over 2 million \npeople living there. It is all over the United States. Boulder, CO, is \nup here. Puerto Rico and Hawaii are here.\n  This map is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and \nit shows the estimated range of the two types of Zika-carrying \nmosquitoes. Areas of this map, as I have indicated, are three in color \nand cover 39 States. Most of these States, as I have indicated, don't \nhave subtropical weather. Nevada, Colorado, Wisconsin, Ohio, Kentucky, \nNew Hampshire, and Maine are listed.\n  Health officials are desperate to stop Zika, this devastating virus \nthat has been around so long but it was not known to carry all the many \nproblems it now carries. It causes birth defects and other deadly \nconditions.\n  Last week, a report on NPR described what Zika does to the brain as \nit begins to grow. This is one condition:\n\n       As the brain . . . starts to grow, it creates pressure, \n     which pushes on the skull and causes it to grow. But if \n     something stops brain growth--such as [the Zika] virus--\n     pressure on the skull drops. And the skull can collapse down \n     onto the brain.\n\n  Two weeks ago we had people come to explain this to my caucus, and \nthey described these skulls that just collapse. But Zika isn't only \nlinked to birth defects. As I have indicated, the virus is also \nassociated with a nervous system disorder that can result in paralysis, \namong other problems.\n  Yet, in spite of all the devastating impacts of Zika, I am sorry to \nsay, the Republicans in Congress don't see this virus as an urgent \nissue. Months ago, President Obama requested almost $2 billion to fight \nZika, and for the same months the Republicans have refused to give the \nmoney America needs to fight this crisis.\n  The best time to deal with any crisis is before it is here, but \nRepublicans have dragged their feet. We should have passed an emergency \nspending bill months ago--months ago. We need to address Zika in the \nterritories and give States and local governments the resources they \nare begging for.\n  Last Thursday, appropriators filed an amendment that would provide \n$1.1 billion in Zika funding. That simply is not enough. This isn't \nabout negotiating an arbitrary number made up by lawmakers. Our public \nhealth officials have made it clear they need that money.\n  Senate Republicans are giving our government half of what it needs to \nfight this ravaging virus. This is beyond reckless. House Republicans \nare even doing less. The chairman of the House Committee on \nAppropriations last week said that Republicans are working on a Zika \nfunding measure, but what House Republicans are proposing is even less \nthan about half of the already low $1.1 billion amendment from Senate \nappropriators.\n  Republicans are trying to haggle as if this is some sort of bidding \nwar. That is not how Congress should react to a potentially disastrous \nhealth crisis. We know what is going on in Puerto Rico. We know. \nBecause of Republicans' refusal to lift a finger to help fight the Zika \ncrisis, the administration was forced to use Ebola funds in order to \nfight Zika now. They had to take about $510 million that was set aside \nspecifically for Ebola.\n  Two years ago, America was afraid of Ebola. Ebola is still a killer, \nand we invested in supporting public health infrastructures to prevent \nfuture outbreaks like the one we saw, as I indicated, 2 years ago. We \nneed to replenish these monies so we can continue to work on vaccines \nand other things, but Republicans are standing in the way.\n  It is really a sad commentary on Republicans that when asked for \nemergency funding to protect millions of Americans, they respond by \noffering half of what is needed. This is in a spending bill, and then \nwe have to go to the House and have a conference. In the meantime, \npeople are begging for this money. Republicans should be ashamed that \nwe aren't doing everything in our power to protect the American people \nfrom this virus now. We should have an emergency spending bill on the \nfloor now. If it were a flood or a fire that occurred, we would have \nbeen here. It is just too bad because this is a crisis that is already \nhere. It is not an emerging crisis. It is here.\n  Madam President, last week, the Republican leader came to the floor \nand here is what he said: ``We have elections in this country right on \ntime, and that is not an excuse not to do our work.''\n  Again: ``We have elections in this country right on time, and that is \nnot an excuse not to do our work.''\n  That is what Senator McConnell said. So I say to my friend from \nKentucky: I agree. Elections are no excuse not to do our work. So \nSenate Republicans should do their job and give Supreme Court nominee \nMerrick Garland a hearing and a vote.\n  There is clearly no question that Merrick Garland is experienced and \nqualified to be a nominee. He is the nominee, and he has the expertise \nto go along with what a Supreme Court nominee should have. Throughout \nhis decades as a prosecutor and judge, Mr. Garland has proven himself \nto be committed to the rule of law and following it. That is more than \nI can say for my Republican colleagues who, by refusing to consider \nthis nominee, are rejecting their constitutional duties.\n\n  The Republican leader needs to practice what he preaches. He says \nthat elections shouldn't interfere with our Senate duties. He should \nprove it. The Republican Senators should prove that. Put aside \nPresidential elections, put aside Donald Trump, put aside all the phony \nexcuses, and give Merrick Garland the consideration he deserves. Study \nJudge Garland's questionnaire; it is here. Analyze his record; it is \nhere. Give him a hearing and send his nomination to the floor now.\n  As the Republican leader put it, ``We have elections in this country \nright on\n\n[[Page S2799]]\n\ntime, and that is not an excuse not to do our work.'' That is \nabsolutely right. I would ask the Republicans to do their job.\n  Madam President, on the Zika matter, I would add the following: ``The \nnews from the House virtually guarantees that the Republican Congress \nwill provide too little aid, too late to address the looming Zika \ncrisis.''\n  The way things are going around here, the appropriations bills are \nnot going to be finished until right before the end of this fiscal \nyear, late September. The crisis will long have arrived and we will be \ntalking about cases that exist in the continental United States. It is \nwrong to wait.\n  I don't see anyone here on the floor, so I would ask the Chair to \nannounce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/16/senate-section/article/S2799-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, 3 months ago President Barack Obama \nasked this Congress for funding to address a public health emergency: \ncombating the Zika Virus. I am pleased that this week, 14 weeks after \nhis request, we are going to respond. We are not responding in full. \nThe President asked for $1.9 billion to address this serious public \nhealth challenge. We are not responding without some theatrics and \nposturing first, but we are going to vote on some amendments this week, \nand it is about time.\n  It has been 14 weeks since representatives from the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health \ntestified at the Senate Appropriations Committee on the dire need for \nimmediate action to combat the Zika virus.\n  I visited the Centers for Disease Control about 14 weeks ago. By \nthen, they had been able to verify that the tissue samples from \nmiscarriages and other serious health problems coming in from Brazil \nwere linked to the Zika Virus. So there was no question that these \nmosquitoes carrying this virus had serious public health consequences--\nso serious that the Centers for Disease Control dedicated 1,000 \nstaffers to deal with this issue. That was about 12 or 14 weeks ago.\n  The President used his authority to come to Congress and say: We have \na public health emergency; treat it like it is an emergency. Here we \nare 14 weeks later getting around to discussing it.\n  When I think back in times of American history when Congress has been \ncalled on to respond to an emergency, there have been amazing examples \nwhere partisanship was set aside and people said: In the interest of \nAmerica, we need to act and act now. Whether we are talking about \nmobilizing for a war, whether we are talking about responding to \nterrorism, we have done it. We can do it. This time we have failed. We \nhave failed for 14 weeks. In that period of time, 1,200 Americans in 44 \nStates, Washington, DC, and 3 U.S. territories, including over 110 \npregnant women, have contracted Zika. Six more have contracted \nGuillain-Barre, an autoimmune disorder that can cause paralysis and \ndeath. Recently, the first Zika-caused death and the first Zika-related \nmicrocephaly cases were reported in Puerto Rico. In my State of \nIllinois, 16 people have tested positive for Zika, including at least 3 \npregnant women.\n  Over the past few months, we have learned more about Zika and how \ndangerous it can be. We now know it is carried by two types of \nmosquitoes. We now know it is linked to serious neurological damage and \nbirth defects in children. We now know it can be sexually transmitted. \nWe also know that the mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus thrive in the \nwarm summer months, which is why this action should have been taken \nlong ago and must be taken this week.\n  The best way to fight a public health threat such as Zika is to have \na strong, stable public health infrastructure in place. That is what \nthe President asked for. That means reliable and stable funding year \nafter year.\n  Our public health agencies have to be viewed as the first line of \ndefense, just as we view the Pentagon as the first line of defense when \nit comes to military and terrorist threats. Our public health agencies \nare the first line of defense when we are speaking of Ebola, the Zika \nvirus, and a variety of other challenges that could literally threaten \nthe health and lives of innocent Americans.\n\n  We must ensure robust and stable funding for agencies like the \nCenters for Disease Control. These invasive problems can pop up at any \ntime. We can't rally to each and every occurrence after it happens; we \nhave to be prepared. The Centers for Disease Control is not only the \nbest, it is the best in the world, but it cannot operate without \nadequate funding.\n  The National Institutes of Health is working on a vaccine right now \nto protect all of us from the Zika virus. That is the answer, but it \ntakes time--a year. We should have been moving on it sooner.\n  We must provide critical resources to the Food and Drug \nAdministration. Their reviewers are responsible for ensuring that any \nZika treatments or vaccines are safe and effective, and in order to \nensure the safety of those vaccines and treatments, they have to be \nclinically tested.\n  For years we have heard congressional Republicans rail against \nFederal spending and even embrace the notion of a sequester--a blind \nacross-the-board cut. Case in point: Over the past few months, we have \nheard Republicans protest, stall, and push back on providing funding to \nhelp combat the Zika virus. There have been a variety of excuses for \ntheir delay, but the outcome has always been the same: We have lost \ntime in responding to this public health emergency.\n  For years, those of us on this side of the aisle have been arguing \nthat this approach--one of starving funding and endless delays--is \nshortsighted and irresponsible. Yes, we must be good stewards of the \ntaxpayers' dollars, but I would argue that there is no better use of \nthe taxpayers' dollars than investments in public health--investments \nin the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control, \nand the Food and Drug Administration. These are investments that \nprepare our Nation for the unforeseen, such as Zika or Ebola, but they \nare also investments that help us prepare for the foreseen situations \nthat Americans face every day, such as Alzheimer's, cancer, \nParkinson's, and diabetes. That is why I introduced the American Cures \nAct--legislation that would provide our Federal health research \nagencies reliable and robust funding increases every year into the \nfuture.\n  We are not going to win a war against Zika, Ebola, Alzheimer's, or \ncancer if our response is tepid, delayed, watered down, or subject to \nthe whims of political fate. Big budget cuts make a good talking point \nin a speech somewhere, but the results can be devastating.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on the Senate \nAppropriations Committee to find a path forward to address the funding \nof these critical Federal health agencies. There is more to do, and we \nmust do it together. If we don't do it together, we will pay a heavy \nprice.\n  This week we will take up the issue. We will be voting on three Zika-\nrelated amendments this week. The first, offered by Senator Nelson of \nFlorida, is one that I fully support. It would fulfill the President's \nrequest by providing the $1.9 billion in needed funding to ensure an \nimmediate and comprehensive response to Zika. We need to treat this \npublic health emergency like a public health emergency. Senator \nNelson's amendment would ensure that the CDC has the money they need to \nsupport States in conducting surveillance, vector control, emergency \ncommunications, and research. It would ensure that the National \nInstitutes of Health has the money to develop this vaccine, and it \nwould ensure that USAID has the money they need to build up a global \nhealth response to Zika.\n\n[[Page S2800]]\n\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Nelson amendment. It would \nprovide the United States, as well as pregnant women in many affected \ncountries, with the very best chance of minimizing the damage done by \nthe Zika virus. Let's not be penny wise and pound foolish. Cutting back \non this money for pregnant women and running the risk that a baby is \nborn with a lifetime of medical challenges and expenses is not a way to \nsave money; it is a disaster for the family and a disaster for our \nbudget.\n  Then comes the second amendment, offered by Senator Cornyn of Texas. \nThis is a misguided amendment. I urge my colleagues to defeat it. \nSenator Cornyn's amendment would provide a portion of the funding \nneeded to adequately respond to the Zika virus. He picked the number \n$1.1 billion and said: Let's take the money out of the Prevention and \nPublic Health Fund for America--money that is currently being invested \nto deal with other health challenges around our country. In order to \ndeal with the Zika virus, Senator Cornyn would take money away from \nother efforts to keep Americans healthy.\n  The prevention fund accounts for 12 percent--nearly $900 million--of \nthe Centers for Disease Control's core public health efforts, such as \nlead poisoning prevention, breast and cervical cancer screening, and \ntobacco prevention and control. Think about that for a second. Senator \nCornyn of Texas wants to take the money out of those areas--legitimate \npublic health concerns--and put it in Zika. He is going to move some of \nthe pieces around on the chessboard in the hope of moving the right \none. Sadly, it will endanger innocent people.\n  There is something else to be considered. His amount is $1.1 billion, \nand the President asked for $1.9 billion. For some reason, Senator \nCornyn believes that we can reduce the threat of the Zika virus by 40 \npercent on the floor of the Senate. I don't buy it. This is a public \nhealth emergency. Reducing the funding for it from what the President \nrequested by 40 percent is playing Russian roulette with innocent lives \nacross America and around the world. Senator Cornyn's amendment cuts \nbase funding that would ordinarily be provided to the Centers for \nDisease Control.\n  We are also dealing with lead poisoning issues across America, which \nwas yesterday's front-page story in the Chicago Tribune. All of the \nlead testing around my State of Illinois finds that areas you wouldn't \ndream of--the suburbs of Chicago, including some of the wealthier \nsuburbs of Chicago--sadly have too much lead in the water. We know that \nafter what happened in Flint, we have to take it seriously. The impact \non innocent children is obvious. Cutting back on funding for that to \npay for the Zika virus is robbing Peter to pay Paul.\n  Lastly, we have an amendment that will be offered by Senator Blunt. \nIt is like Senator Cornyn's approach in that it would only provide $1.1 \nbillion, and I take exception to that number. As I said, it is 40 \npercent less than what the President believes is needed for this \nemergency, but it would not cut the money out of the prevention fund, \nso that is a positive thing to say about the Blunt amendment over the \nCornyn amendment. This amendment is an improvement, but still, it is \nimportant for us to adequately fund public health defense for innocent \nAmericans.\n  When Dr. Frieden of the CDC tells us how much the CDC needs to fight \nZika, I trust the doctor. I do not believe we should second-guess his \napproach, and I don't believe we should provide the Centers for Disease \nControl with less money than what Dr. Frieden says is needed.\n  That said, I appreciate that Senator Blunt is trying.\n  I hope the initial amendment by Senator Nelson passes. That is the \nresponsible amendment to deal with the public health emergency.\n  We have seen Zika coming for months. We had the administration's \ndetailed, comprehensive plan of action sitting up here for over 3 \nmonths. The time to act is way overdue.\n  It is my hope that the Senate will finally approve Zika funding this \nweek and that House Republicans will stop their stalling as well and \nget to work and do the same. We have lost enough time already.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Barrasso). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to share some remarks and ask \nunanimous consent that I be allowed such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Durbin's comments, \nand I believe there is clear bipartisan support for dealing with the \nZika virus. And something will be done on that, but make no mistake--\nthere is a disagreement, and our colleagues on the Democratic side, as \nthey always do, just want to add whatever new expense comes up during \nthe year to the deficit of the United States of America.\n  There are many ways we can save money to pay for new expenditures, \nand that is what Senator Cornyn is talking about. He wants to have it \npaid-for so we don't add more debt.\n  You say: How can that be?\n  Well, we are already in debt. This year we borrowed approximately \n$540 billion to fund the government. We spent $4 trillion and we \nborrowed $540 billion of that. That is a very large number. It is \nunsustainable, and it is getting worse.\n  We have to start paying for things that we want to do around here and \nmake some choices and set some priorities. That is the entire dispute \nabout this matter, if you want to know the truth about it. There is no \nway we can't find the money to fund this Zika challenge--sufficient \nfunds to do that--within the spending we already have.\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF PAULA XINIS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to speak in opposition to the \nnomination of Paula Xinis to the U.S. District Court for the District \nof Maryland. By all accounts, she is a nice person and has a number of \nadmirers. I don't question her integrity. I had an exchange with her at \nthe Judiciary Committee hearing when she came before the committee. I \nthink this nominee has perhaps the most hostile record toward police of \nany I have seen in a long time. Her background is troubling to me, and \nI believe it justifies us not allowing her to have a lifetime \nappointment where she is unaccountable to anyone as she conducts her \ndaily duties involving, on a very frequent basis, the appearance of \npolice before her in criminal cases of all kinds. She would even hear \ncases against police officers for misconduct that may come before her \nover her career.\n  I was a prosecutor for almost 15 years in Federal court before \nFederal judges. I was blessed to appear before Federal judges of high \nquality who gave the prosecutor a fair trial and gave the defendant a \nfair trial, and that is what we are looking for. I am aware of a lot of \nFederal judges who have a clear bias against law enforcement and have \nmade the communities less safe, made prosecuting a nightmare, and I \ndon't believe it is good for the legal system. There is nothing you can \ndo about it. A judge can declare that the evidence is insufficient to \nconvict on his or her own motion which nobody can appeal. That is the \nfinal word even though a jury, had they been able to hear the case, \nmight have found otherwise.\n  Yesterday was Peace Officers Memorial Day, and this week is Police \nWeek. We take special occasion each year to remember the service and \nsacrifice of law enforcement officers and their indispensable role in \nensuring law and order in our cities and towns throughout the country.\n  Too often when something goes wrong on the streets today, the media \nis quick to point their fingers at the police, and that is why we have \nan impartial justice system--so that the facts can come out in open \ncourt. In my experience, when those facts do come out--and I have had \nthe duty of prosecuting police officers--many more times than not, we \nlearn that the police did everything they could according to the \nprocedures and that the complaints we heard about in the media and \nthrough others are not accurate. That is what the facts show us time \nand time again.\n  It is critical that we have judges who respect the rights of the \naccused but also respect the role of law enforcement and the dangers \nthey face on a daily basis.\n  We have a nominee for the Federal court in Maryland before us, and \nevery police officer in the country needs to know where she stands and \nhow she approaches the duties, responsibilities,\n\n[[Page S2801]]\n\nand requirements of the police and how she approaches law enforcement. \nWill she give them a fair hearing? Aren't they entitled to that?\n  Ms. Paula Xinis worked as a Federal public defender for the District \nof Maryland for 13 years; that is, she was on a paid defender's staff \nwho defended the criminals who were being prosecuted in Federal court, \nthose accused for a whole lot of crimes. There is nothing wrong with \nthat. It is a perfectly honorable profession, and I certainly want to \nemphasize that. For 6 of those 13 years, she simultaneously served as a \ncomplaint examiner in the Office of Police Complaints for the District \nof Columbia here in DC. During the course of her work there, she heard \ncomplaints against police officers for conduct as part of their duties. \nShe heard six complaints, and in every one of those cases, every single \none, she found against the police officers.\n  It troubled me, and I asked her some questions about it. In one of \nthe cases, an officer arrested a man who was loitering amidst a group \nof individuals outside a grocery store while talking on his cell phone. \nWhen he was asked to move along, he refused to do so. Then the man \nbecame belligerent and repeatedly swore and cursed at the police \nofficer. The officer eventually arrested the man for disorderly \nconduct. On the panel, Ms. Xinis concluded that the police had harassed \nthe man and found the police officer guilty of misconduct.\n\n  When I asked her about this decision at her confirmation hearing in \nthe Judiciary Committee, she said she didn't even know what \nconsequences this finding might have on the career of a police officer \nas a result of having this on their record.\n  In 2011, Ms. Xinis began work with her current 11-attorney law firm \nin Baltimore, where she focuses her practice emphasis on lawsuits \nagainst the police. According to her firm's Web site, she and two of \nher colleagues recently settled a $5 million police brutality lawsuit. \nNotably, her firm also represented the family of Freddie Gray, Jr., the \n25-year-old man who was arrested on April 12, 2015, for possessing an \nillegal switchblade and who subsequently tragically died in police \ncustody, causing riots in Baltimore, if my colleagues recall. On \nSeptember 8, 2015, the suit against the city and the police department, \nin which her firm represented the plaintiff, settled for $6.4 million.\n  This may have been a totally justified settlement. I certainly \nbelieve that any death in the custody of a police officer by any \naccused is entitled to and requires a thorough investigation. But in a \nbig city like Baltimore, when there is civil unrest and huge public \nattention, cities are under political, if not legal, pressure to reach \nsome sort of financial settlement. This was a tragic case. The details \nwere disputed. But it appears that some of the facts were not clear, \ncertainly.\n  The point is, Ms. Xinis has built a career of dealing with lawsuits \nagainst police and police departments and dealing with complaints \nagainst the police. In every complaint case she heard, she ruled \nagainst the police, which, frankly, makes me uneasy, as it does many \nlaw enforcement officers. When a lawyer sits as a complaint examiner in \na case involving alleged police misconduct, the examiner--the judge, \nalmost, in that case--should know and understand the reality of police \nwork and what our people have to do every day to defend us from crime.\n  I asked her about her findings that the arrest of a loud, cursing \nloiterer outside a store was police harassment. In other words, the \ncursing loiterer was OK, but the police officer was wrong.\n  I would think that someone who has spent their entire professional \ncareer in this arena would be familiar with some of the concepts and \nprocedures in policing in cities around the country today.\n  For example, broken windows policing is well known. I think most \npeople know what broken windows policing is. It is a short-hand way to \ndescribe a policy that originally grew and became predominant in New \nYork City under Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and many believe it saved New York \nCity. Crime was surging, disorder was about, the city's financial \nstatus was at risk, and they started a systematic smart method of \npolicing, and the murder rate is less than half of what it was in New \nYork City. The entire city has been transformed.\n  So here she is judging police officers about how to handle \nconfrontations on the street and how to make our communities safer. \nShouldn't she know about these things?\n  Broken windows policing suggests that when law enforcement \nconsistently enforces the law in cases involving minor crimes--not just \nbig crimes but even minor crimes--that consistency helps to prevent \nmajor crimes. It is proven to work. It is a major trend. Virtually \nevery city in America does it.\n  Yes, we have people who are out on the streets causing trouble or \nrisks, and they get their backs up and complain when anybody says \nanything to them. Police officers have to use judgment. But this police \nofficer, to me, did what one would normally expect him to do. He \ncertainly didn't need to be charged and convicted of harassment.\n  Her statement that she did not know what ``broken windows'' was and \nwas not familiar with it I think evidenced a real lack of \nunderstanding.\n  There is concern about this appointment by people who have to deal \nwith this every day. Here is a letter from the Fraternal Order of \nPolice, the Baltimore City lodge, signed by Lieutenant Gene Ryan, \nPresident. Again, this is the Baltimore City Fraternal Order of Police:\n\n       On behalf of almost 5,000 members of the Baltimore City \n     Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge #3, I write this letter in \n     extreme opposition to the appointment of Paula Xinis as a \n     United States District Judge in the Federal District Court \n     system.\n       While on paper, Ms. Xinis appears to be a highly qualified \n     criminal attorney, our membership is urgently concerned about \n     her obvious disdain for the law enforcement profession as \n     expressed time and again through the various court \n     appearances in which she has represented citizens claiming \n     harm caused by police personnel. In fact, her current \n     partnership in the Baltimore firm of Murphy, Falcon, & Murphy \n     itself is of concern as this is a firm well known in our area \n     for hostility toward our profession and our members and, as a \n     result, we question the ability of Ms. Xinis to remain \n     impartial in any Federal cases involving law enforcement.\n       Senators, we respectfully request that you give \n     consideration to our request to deny the appointment of Paula \n     Xinis to the Federal bench at this time.\n\n  I also have a letter from the Maryland State Lodge of the Fraternal \nOrder of Police, President Ismael Vincent Canales. He writes:\n\n       As President of the Maryland Fraternal Order of Police and \n     on behalf of over twenty-thousand active and retired law \n     enforcement officers throughout the State of Maryland, I \n     respectfully request that members of the U.S. Senate vote \n     unfavorably on the appointment of Paula Xinis as a Judge to \n     the United States District Court of Maryland.\n       I believe that Ms. Xinis at this time fails to have the \n     requisite temperament and ability to be fair and impartial on \n     matters that directly affect law enforcement.\n\n  And he goes on.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these two letters be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Fraternal Order of Police,\n\n\n                                   Baltimore City Lodge No. 3,\n\n                                      Baltimore, MD, May 16, 2016.\n       To All Members of the United States Senate: On behalf of \n     the almost 5,000 members of the Baltimore City Fraternal \n     Order of Police, Lodge #3, I write this letter in extreme \n     opposition to the appointment of Paula Xinis as a United \n     States District Judge in the Federal District Court system.\n       While, on paper, Ms. Xinis appears to be a highly qualified \n     criminal attorney, our membership is urgently concerned about \n     her obvious disdain for the law enforcement profession as \n     expressed time and again through the various court \n     appearances in which she has represented citizens claiming \n     harm caused by police personnel.

Jeff Sessions,\n     Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Jeff Sessions: As President of the Maryland \n     Fraternal Order of Police, and on behalf of the over twenty-\n     thousand active and retired law enforcement officers \n     throughout the State of Maryland, I respectfully request that \n     the members of the United States Senate vote unfavorably on \n     the appointment of Paula Xinis as a Judge to the United \n     States District Court of Maryland.\n       After careful review and consideration, I believe that Ms. \n     Xinis at this time fails to have the requisite temperament \n     and ability to be fair and impartial on matters that directly \n     affect law enforcement. Based on prior and recent experience, \n     Ms. Xinis has shown a clear bias towards law enforcement \n     which began in her position as a complaint examiner in the \n     Office of Police Complaints for the District of Columbia and \n     culminated with her involvement in the civil suit surrounding \n     the Freddie Gray Case in Baltimore City, MD. Ms. Xinis is \n     clearly a consummate advocate which we commend her for. \n     However, at this time, I do not believe that she has \n     displayed throughout her professional career a sufficient \n     ability to equitably apply the law.\n       It is for these reasons that I respectfully request that \n     the Senate vote unfavorably on the appointment of Paula Xinis \n     to the United States District Court of Maryland.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Vince Canales.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, Federal judges decide cases every day \nthat have a significant real world impact on our criminal justice \nsystem--sometimes good, sometimes bad.\n  Let me point out this case. It gives an insight into the kinds of \nthings I saw every day as a prosecutor, and it is happening every day \nright now in courts all over America.\n  Here is the case before United States District Judge Royce C. \nLamberth. He denied a request by the prosecutor for early release of \ntwo top associates of Rayful Edmond III, a notorious drug kingpin in \nWashington, DC. I think they made a movie about him or a film about \nhim, one of the most notorious gang leaders around. The Washington Post \ndescribed Judge Lamberth's astonishment when the U.S. Attorney did not \nobject to the drug felon's request for early release. Quote:\n\n       The judge rebuked the Office of acting United States \n     attorney Vincent H. Cohen Jr., of the District, saying \n     prosecutors did not give due weight to the criminal history \n     of Butler, 52, the Los Angeles-based cocaine broker and \n     partner of D.C. drug lord Rayful Edmond III, and Jones, 58, \n     one of four top armed enforcers of Edmond's violent \n     trafficking network. The group imported as much as 1,700 \n     pounds of Colombian cocaine a month.\n\n  That is almost a ton a month. That is the largest amount I have ever \nseen. I thought the biggest case I had ever seen was 600 pounds flown \nin on about 20 plane loads over several months. This is 1,700 pounds a \nmonth.\n\n       Edmond's organization enabled drug addiction on a scale \n     that until then ``was unprecedented and largely \n     unimaginable'' in Washington, Lamberth wrote, and the harm \n     the defendants caused ``is immeasurable and in many cases \n     irreversible.''\n       ``To put it bluntly, the court is surprised and \n     disappointed by the United States Attorney's decision to not \n     oppose the present motions,'' Lamberth said.\n\n  Quote:\n\n       ``The court struggles to understand how the government \n     could condone the release of Butler and Jones, each convicted \n     of high-level, sophisticated and violent drug trafficking \n     offenses.''\n\n  So that is a Federal judge doing their duty. I am not sure where Ms. \nXinis would be on this.\n  Contrast that with many courts across the country that are currently \nrubberstamping motions for early release for Federal drug trafficking \nfelons under the Sentencing Commission's reductions to the sentencing \nguidelines that have already occurred and that are impacting the prison \npopulation significantly, as we will see. That is according to an \nOctober 2015 article in the Los Angeles Times entitled ``The face of \nthe federal prison release: A heavy dose of meth, crack, and cocaine.''\n  This is what the article says:\n\n       A federal analysis of the expected impact of the first wave \n     of those approved for early release shows 663 prisoners from \n     California had filed for shorter sentences as of late July. \n     Federal judges denied 92 of them.\n\n  It looks as though six out of seven were granted.\n  According to an October 2015 article regarding offenders released in \nthe Pittsburgh area, the U.S. Attorney's Office there ``erred on the \nside of granting'' the motions.\n  So the U.S. attorney's office is not defending the legitimate, \noriginal sentence that was imposed. They walk in and just don't--if \nthere is any doubt about it, they just go along with the prisoner's \nrequest.\n  According to a November 2015 article entitled ``Upstate NY gang \nmembers on secret list of 6,000 freed early from prison,'' it is \nhappening in New York too.\n  Quote:\n\n       In the Northern District of New York, the [Court, \n     prosecutors, and defense attorneys] agreed on the eligibility \n     of almost all of the inmates, and disagreed on only five \n     cases that became subject to litigation. . . . Of those five \n     cases, a judge ordered early release for three and rejected \n     one. A fifth case is pending.\n\n  So out of all the cases, only one was rejected.\n  Judges have a duty to make sure that they--they don't have to take \neverything the prosecutor says. The prosecutor sometimes asks for a \nhigher sentence than a judge wants to give, but a judge is equally \nrequired to reject a prosecutor's failure to oppose unjustified \nreductions.\n  This is, frankly, President Obama's policy, and the policy of the \nAttorney General, whom he has appointed--Loretta Lynch and Eric Holder \nbefore her--basically to cut people's sentences that have been lawfully \nimposed throughout this country. In my opinion, it is impacting public \nsafety and will continue to do so in the future.\n\n  Judges must protect the rights of the accused, absolutely, and give \nthem a fair hearing, as they are required to do, but they must give the \npeople, the police, and the prosecutor the right to a fair trial also. \nThese kind of cases cause concern about who is protecting the public. \nWould Judge Xinis be more likely to follow the pattern of Judge Royce \nLamberth in saying no or go along with these other cases?\n  Over the past year, our law enforcement officers across the country \nhave been shot at, assaulted, and murdered, too often simply because \nthey wear a badge. Last year we lost 123 police officers--35 in the \nfirst 4 months of 2016. Violent crime and murders have increased across \nthe country at alarming rates.\n  Let me share with my colleagues some of the things we are seeing in \ntrends in violent crime. Recently, the Major Cities Chiefs Police \nAssociation, a long-established group, called an emergency meeting to \ndeal with the numbers I am going to share with you today. The numbers I \nwill quote represent the percentage of increase in total murders in the \nfirst quarter of this year, 2016, over the first quarter of 2015: Las \nVegas, 82 percent increase; Dallas, TX, 73 percent increase; Chicago, \n70 percent; Jacksonville, FL, 67 percent; Newark, NJ, 60 percent \nincrease; Miami-Dade, 38 percent; Los Angeles, 33 percent; Atlanta, 20 \npercent; Baltimore, 10 percent. These are substantial increases in \ncrime.\n  The FBI Director, Mr. Comey, a long-term experienced law officer, who \nserved at the top of the Department of Justice as a prosecutor, \nrecently said he believes the pushback on police officers--this trend \nof attacking and blaming police officers--has caused some drawback and \nreluctance of police officers to take on situations like the guy at the \nstore standing out front that was cursing the police officer. Properly \nhandled, those kinds of things reduce crime. They help violence not to \nstart. Once it gets started, bad things can happen. Oftentimes, \nsomebody gets killed. It is not like on television where somebody \npunches somebody and they get up and walk away and laugh about it. A \ngood punch breaks teeth, jaws, and can kill. This increase in murder \nrates is significant, and we have to be aware of it. Lives are at \nstake, many innocent people. If we get off the right path, we will lose \nlives as a result of criminal conduct.\n  Think about some of the cases, such as that of Kate Steinle in \nCalifornia, who was out with her father and was murdered by an illegal \nimmigrant who had been deported multiple times. Judges have to know \nthis isn't a game. We don't want to put anybody in jail, but if we \ndon't maintain order in cities, chaos can result, innocent people will \ndie, and prosperity will be reduced.\n  According to the FBI statistics released just this year, the number \nof\n\n[[Page S2803]]\n\nviolent crimes committed across the country was up in the first half of \n2015 compared to the same period of 2014. The number of murders, rapes, \nassaults, and robberies were up all over the first 6 months of 2015. \nThere was a 6.2-percent increase in murder. Violent crime across \nAmerica rose 5.3 percent in large cities, and overall violent crime \nincreased 1.7 percent, an increase that followed two consecutive years \nof decline.\n  In my judgment, what I am seeing is this is a long-term trend. I \nthink we will continue to see this increase. I wish it weren't so, but \nI am afraid it is. According to statistics released Friday by the Major \nCities Chiefs Police Association, the number of homicides increased in \nthe first months of 2016 in more than two dozen major cities. The \nWashington Post reports ``the numbers were particularly grim for a \nhandful of places--Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas and Las Vegas--where \nthe numbers of homicides increased in the first three months of 2016. . \n. . ''\n  The article goes on to quote FBI Director Comey. He said:\n\n       I was very worried about it last fall, and I am in many \n     ways more worried, because the numbers are not only going up, \n     they're continuing to go up in most of those cities faster \n     than they were going up last year. Something is happening. I \n     don't know what the answer is, but holy cow, do we have a \n     problem.\n\n  He also said before our committee that he remembered the last \ncrimewave in the seventies and the sixties and how enforcement brought \nit down dramatically. He said we don't want to forget the lessons we \nlearned previously. Director Comey has further suggested that possible \nexplanations for this spike in violent crime included gang and drug \nviolence. He has also suggested that greater scrutiny of police as they \ndo their duty has possibly changed the way officers and communities \ninteract, something he calls the ``viral video effect,'' which he \nbelieves leads to less aggressive policing. Less aggressive policing \nmeans more crime and more deaths.\n  On Mother's Day weekend in Chicago, more than 50 people were shot \nbetween Friday afternoon and early Monday. During a 3\\1/2\\-hour period \nearly Saturday, one man was killed and 14 others wounded, as the \nChicago Tribune said, ``the equivalent of someone being shot every 14 \nminutes.''\n  According to the Tribune, Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson ``saved \nhis harshest criticism for a criminal justice system that he said isn't \nputting away the city's most dangerous offenders for long enough \nperiods. `Until we have real truth in sentencing and hold these \noffenders accountable, this will be the unfortunate reality in the city \nof Chicago.' ''\n  According to an article in the Washington Post, April 2 of this year, \n``violence is occurring at levels unseen for years [in Chicago]. In the \nfirst quarter of 2016, 141 people were killed, up from 82 last year, \naccording to police department data. The number of shootings surged to \n677 from 359 a year earlier. The city is on track to have more than 500 \nkillings this year, which would make this just the third year since \n2004 that Chicago topped that figure.''\n  Some say we have too many people in prison. We have heard that. It is \ncertainly our responsibility, in part, in Congress, to set sentencing \nlaws that are smart, that protect the public, don't put too many people \nin jail, and strike the right balance.\n  In the early to mid-1980s, Congress passed, in a bipartisan, \noverwhelming vote, mandatory minimum sentences and sentencing \nguidelines. They allowed dangerous people to be denied bail on appeal. \nThey allowed people who made frivolous appeals--for the judge to assert \nthat there was no substantial basis for the appeal and he could leave \nthem in jail while they made their appeals because too many people were \nfiling for appeals just to stay out of jail and committed crimes while \nthey were out. All of these are great reforms. They are now under \nsystemic attack. During that entire period of time, the crime rate in \nAmerica went down. The murder rate in the late nineties was half what \nit was in 1980. How many good people are alive today because of this \nimprovement in law enforcement? We ended the revolving door, where \npeople were arrested, released, arrested. They came in another time and \nthey are arrested and then they would get out and murder somebody. It \nwas happening all the time. We didn't have the jail capacity to put the \npeople in jail. We didn't have enough police to deal with the surging \ncrime rate. When you have 20-, 30-, 40-percent increases in crime, you \nare talking about doubling the crime and murder rate in America in 2 or \n3 years, after we spent 20 years bringing it down by half.\n  We have to be sure that what we are doing, colleagues, is smart, and \nwe are not signing death warrants for thousands of American innocent \ncitizens.\n  Well, what is the prison situation today? Is the population going up? \nAccording to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the rate of imprisonment \nin the United States is at its lowest in a decade. The Federal prison \npopulation--195,914 as of May 12, 2016--is at its lowest level since \n2006. Since 2013, the Federal prison population has decreased by over \n20,000, and it is projected to continue downward. According to the \nFederal Bureau of Prisons, the population is projected to drop another \n10,000 this year, which will bring it to its lowest levels since 2005. \nThe Bureau of Prisons, which houses prisoners, ``projects that the \ninmate population will continue to decline for the next couple of \nyears, particularly as a result of retroactive changes to sentencing \nguidelines.''\n  Indeed, the 46,276 Federal drug trafficking inmates made eligible for \nearly release comprise 25 percent of the current prison population. \nAdmissions to Federal prisons have declined every year since 2011 and \nwill likely decline further due to the Obama administration's policy \ndirecting prosecutors not to charge certain criminal offenses.\n  I don't think this Congress has a duty to confirm everyone who is \nappointed by the President. We know the President has hostility toward \nprisons. He has directed his Attorney General to reduce prison \npopulations, and that is happening. He has directed the Bureau of \nPrisons to participate in this. He has directed the Attorney General \nand the Attorney General has agreed and issued policy that rejects \nAttorney General Thornburgh's policies when I was a U.S. attorney. \nBasically, the Thornburgh policy was, if a person used a gun during a \ncrime, a bank robbery, or drug dealing, they were required, under the \nlaw, to get an additional 5 years' penalty in addition because the goal \nwas to deter people from carrying guns during the criminal act, \ntherefore, having fewer people killed in this country. It actually \nworked. In my opinion, it was part of the reason for the decline in the \nmurder rate, clearly. You were required to charge them because the law \nsaid, if you carried a gun, you must get 5 years in addition to the \nother penalties. Now the Attorney General tells everybody: Well, \nprosecutors, you don't have to charge that; in fact, we don't want you \nto charge too much on these kinds of cases. As a result, the \nprosecutions are down, drug prosecutions are down 21 percent, and \nsentencing is down too.\n  When I asked the Attorney General why the prosecutions of these cases \nare down so much, she said they are prosecuting bigger cases. I have to \nsay that for the last 50 years, that is the excuse that prosecutors use \nfor having a decline in statistics. They say: Well, we are working \nbigger cases. But regardless if you are working bigger cases, why are \nthe sentencing numbers down? Presumably, she is saying: We are \nprosecuting more serious criminals, but the sentences are going down. \nWe are seeing from the prosecutorial end a significant retrenchment or \nbacking off of strong prosecution policy.\n  A judge who gets a lifetime appointment and is no longer accountable \nto the American people--or anyone else, for that matter--is not \nentitled to confirmation if we have doubts about the ability over the \nyears to treat police fairly and protect the public from serious \ncriminals.\n  Certainly, it does not send a positive message to police and the \ncommunity in Baltimore, where she will hear cases if confirmed. Last \nyear was the deadliest year in Baltimore's history--344 murders and \ncountless crimes against persons and property.\n  I believe Ms. Xinis's record demonstrates such a lack of \nunderstanding of the reality of law enforcement and the duty of our \nwhole criminal justice system to protect the public as to disqualify \nher from the Federal bench.\n\n[[Page S2804]]\n\nThat is why I will oppose the nomination.\n  I do not believe she lacks the personal qualities or the integrity \nneeded to be a judge or be a successful person throughout her life, \nwhatever job she holds. She certainly has many admirers. I am not \nquestioning that, but her record, as I have discussed, indicates an \napproach to law enforcement that does not justify the support of a \nlifetime appointment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/16/senate-section/article/S2804-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2804-S2805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               ZIKA VIRUS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, over the past few months the Zika virus \nhas not only spread across the Caribbean and Latin America, but it has \nbecome a matter of grave concern in the United States.\n  Although many of the symptoms are relatively minor, Zika has been \nfound to cause severe birth defects in children if the virus is \nacquired by a woman of childbearing age who is, in fact, pregnant. In \nplaces where the virus has been especially active, experts have found \nalarming rates of infants born with something called microcephaly--in \nother words, basically a shrunken skull. Obviously, it is a profoundly \ndamaging birth defect. This is due to the mother being infected by the \nvirus while pregnant.\n  As the weather continues to warm, Texans are rightly concerned about \nthe continued spread of the virus in our State because it is \ntransmitted primarily by mosquitoes. But it is not just any mosquito \nbut those known to be present in places such as Texas, Florida, \nLouisiana, and some of the warmer areas. But we don't know if that will \nalways be the case or whether they will expand their range or exactly \nhow this could unroll.\n  In fact, cases in 11 Texas counties have already been confirmed, \nincluding Austin, Houston, and Dallas. One important distinction in \nthese cases is that they are tied to people traveling to Latin America, \nPuerto Rico, or Central America right now. In other words, there has \nbeen no confirmed case, I believe, by the Centers for Disease Control \nof anybody actually being bitten by a mosquito in the United States and \nhaving acquired the Zika virus. But that doesn't mean that it is not \npotentially dangerous, in fact, for the reasons I have mentioned, along \nwith the fact that we now have at least a couple of cases of confirmed \nsexual transmission of the Zika virus.\n  Fortunately, top research and medical facilities in Texas have been \nworking on ways to prevent the spread of the Zika virus and to protect \nall Americans from its symptoms. A few months ago, I visited with some \nof those at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, where \nthey told me about their work in Brazil studying this virus. As the \nworld leader in mosquito-borne viruses, their research is continually \ngroundbreaking.\n  In fact, recently the Brazilian Ministry of Health announced a \ncollaboration with researchers at the University of Texas Medical \nBranch at Galveston to help them develop a Zika virus vaccine. They \nhave also had experience when it comes to tackling other large-scale \nviruses. Last year UTMB was named one of the first regional Ebola \ntreatment centers in the country, and UTMB researchers went on to \ndevelop an effective, quick-acting Ebola vaccine.\n  When they stressed the urgent need for the United States to approach \nthis virus in a careful and deliberate manner, I listened to what they \nwere telling me. I heard a similar message when I recently visited the \nTexas Medical Center in Houston. They, too, are medical pioneers and \nare working to create a rapid test for the virus and to strengthen \nmosquito control in potential hot spots. Interestingly, this is one of \nthe most important components of dealing with the Zika virus; that is, \nmosquito control.\n  Indeed, we will hear more about some of the EPA regulations that are \ncurrently in effect which discourage or inhibit the ability of local \npublic health units in places such as Houston, Galveston, and elsewhere \nto actually control the mosquito population. We will talk more about \nthat later.\n  But like the researchers in Galveston, these folks at the Texas \nMedical Center urge congressional action so that our country can be \nbetter prepared to handle this potential health crisis, instead of \nhaving to react after the fact. When the cases of Ebola were confirmed \nin Dallas, I remember very clearly how people felt overwhelmed by the \nfast-developing situation on the ground, so much so that they really \ndid not feel that they were totally prepared ahead of time to deal with \nit. We don't want to make that mistake twice when it comes to the Zika \nvirus.\n  Conversations I have had with these Texas institutions, as well as \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Director of the \nCenters for Disease Control, the CDC, have underscored to me the need \nto act with urgency to avert what could become a major public health \ncrisis in this country.\n  Because States like mine boast a warmer climate and they are in \ncloser proximity to where the mosquitoes that currently carry the Zika \nvirus are located, we will likely serve on the frontline in dealing \nthis summer with this response nationwide.\n  Congress can't afford to sit back and do nothing. I don't hear \nanybody saying: Do nothing. I hear everybody saying we need to act \nclearly, with dispatch, and without unnecessary delay.\n  But part of what we need to do is to make sure we have a plan in \nplace and that we are executing a plan in a way that maximizes the \neffectiveness in combatting not only the mosquitoes that carry this \nvirus but also the virus itself. We have to make sure our public health \nofficials on the frontline of research and prevention have the \nresources they need to get the job done too.\n  Fortunately, tomorrow, the Senate will vote on several pieces of \nlegislation designed to provide additional Federal funding so public \nofficials can handle this impending crisis head on.\n  The first proposal is from the President of the United States. \nPresident Obama has made a spending request of nearly $2 billion that \nisn't paid for. It is emergency funding, meaning that the funding would \nbe deficit-increasing and debt-increasing. Also, the President's \nproposal to spend $2 billion comes without very much in the way of a \nplan about how the administration would use the money. I guess they are \nasking us to trust them, but, frankly, I think we have a greater \nresponsibility to make sure that the money will be put to good use and \nthat we have appropriated an adequate amount of money--but not more \nmoney than is necessary--to deal with this potential crisis.\n  The second piece of legislation we will vote on is a compromise \npackage that was negotiated between the chairman and the ranking member \nof the Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee in \na bipartisan and commonsense way. I congratulate Senator Blunt and \nSenator Murray for working through this in an orderly sort of process, \nand I commend them on reaching an agreement.\n  Their compromise bill is basically for $1.1 billion. In other words, \nit is not the $1.9 billion or $2 billion that the President requested. \nThey thought the $1.1 billion was a more accurate and justifiable \nnumber.\n  Unfortunately, the legislation that has been negotiated between the \nchairman and the ranking member of the Labor, Health and Human Services \nAppropriations Subcommittee is not paid for either. What this would \nessentially do is borrow from our children and grandchildren to meet \nthe present exigencies of this crisis.\n\n  The good news is we have a third option, which I want to talk about \nbriefly. It is a third piece of legislation that I have introduced and \nwhich is nearly identical to the Blunt-Murray proposal, the \nAppropriations subcommittee proposal. It would also provide a \ncompromise of $1.1 billion in Federal funding targeted toward health \ncare professionals across the country.\n  But my bill has a key distinction. It is fully paid for. You might \nask: Where does that money come from?\n  When the Affordable Care Act--or ObamaCare, as it has come to be\n\n[[Page S2805]]\n\nknown--was passed, it included a provision for the Prevention and \nPublic Health Fund. This, again, was part of the Affordable Care Act. \nThe purpose that was stated in the legislation was ``to provide for \nexpanded and sustained national investment in prevention and public \nhealth programs.'' In other words, it could have been tailor-made to \ndeal with this potential Zika crisis.\n  What I would propose is that we deal with the problem without delay. \nWe appropriate the right amount of money, which both Democrats and \nRepublicans--at least in the Appropriations Committee--have agreed is \n$1.1 billion, but that we take available funds and funds that will be \navailable under the Prevention and Public Health Fund, and we pay for \nit.\n  You wouldn't think that would be particularly revolutionary or novel \naround here, but unfortunately I think too often what we do is we act \nin an emergency or to avert an emergency and we don't follow through \nand do it in a fiscally responsible sort of way.\n  The fact of the matter is we do need to address the Zika virus. There \nis no doubt about that. There is no difference among us in this Chamber \nor in Congress about the need to deal with that. As a matter of fact, \nthe House of Representatives has proposed a version of their response \ntoday, I believe. But we need to do this responsibly.\n  There is no reason why we have to put our country deeper in debt to \nprotect ourselves against this virus. We don't have an endless supply \nof money. The Federal Treasury can't just keep printing money, and we \ncan't just keep imposing on our children and grandchildren the \nresponsibilities to pay the money back that we continue to borrow, \nparticularly when we have a fund available to offset this expenditure.\n  As the Presiding Officer well knows, our growing debt in and of \nitself is a threat to our country's future and our way of life. The \nPresiding Officer and I have listened to the Senator from Georgia, Mr. \nPerdue, talk about what impact our debt has on our ability not only to \nwithstand another financial crisis, such as we had in 2008, but simply \nto fund such essential functions of the Federal Government like \nnational defense.\n  Particularly, as the interest rates are going up, more and more money \nis going to be paid to our bond holders, such as China and others, \ninstead of paying for essential functions of the government, like \nnational defense or safety net programs that we all agree are \nworthwhile.\n  If we can deal with this potential crisis and do so in a fiscally \nresponsible way without growing the debt, then we ought to be able to \ndo that. This should be a no-brainer.\n  We should take this opportunity tomorrow to give our public health \nofficials and local officials back home the resources they need to \nprotect our constituents--the American people--against the spread of \nthe Zika virus, but we ought to do so without adding to our mounting \ndebt.\n  Fortunately, this legislation also includes a provision that would \nwaive provisions of the Clean Water Act--I have referred to those a \nlittle earlier--and permit State and local officials to spray to \nprotect against mosquitoes year around. Unfortunately, this particular \nlegislation, the Clean Water Act, has provisions in it that essentially \ntie the hands of public health officials when it comes to mosquito \neradication, which is one of the essential components of a strategy to \ndefeat this potential crisis.\n  We all agree that the Zika virus is a real threat with real public \nhealth consequences. It has already impacted a generation in Brazil and \nother Latin American countries. We are told it is apparently rampant in \nPuerto Rico and Haiti, and there is no question it is coming our way. \nWith the summer months ahead of us, the potential for this virus to \nspread to the United States is a major concern that we ought to address \nwith dispatch. We have to give those on the ground the tools and \nsupport they need to address this threat, but we have to do so in a \nresponsible way.\n  I urge our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the \nlegislation which funds the Zika prevention program at $1.1 billion but \npays for it out of the Prevention and Public Health Fund, as apparently \nthis fund was created to do--to ``provide for expanded and sustained \nnational investment in prevention and public health programs.''\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides to support this legislation when \nwe have a chance to vote tomorrow. The time to act is now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to talk about the Zika \nvirus. We will have a vote on this tomorrow.\n  Tonight I wish to speak about the need for us to move forward with \nemergency funding with regard to this virus. We need to combat it. It \nis spreading. It poses a threat to the safety of women, children, and \nthe elderly. It is particularly important that we keep it from \nspreading because there is no known Zika vaccine or treatment.\n  A lot of my constituents have asked me about this back home. This is \na virus that has spread from Africa, to Asia, to Latin America, and now \nit is coming into our own country. It is spreading so quickly because \nit is insidious. It is difficult to test for it because it is usually \nconfused with other viruses, like dengue. It can only be detected in a \nfew days after you get it in the blood. Many of its symptoms in older \nadults are similar to other viruses, such as influenza, so it is tough \nto know whether you have it. It is typically contracted simply by being \nbitten by a mosquito, and two kinds of mosquitoes--both of which are in \nthe United States--are the problem. We now know that it can also be \ntransmitted by sexual activity. We are told that men may be able to \nsexually transmit the virus for months after the initial infection \nbased on some experiences.\n  So, again, this is a difficult issue. Some people may not even know \nthey have it; yet they might be spreading it. The spread of the virus \nis accelerating. It took 60 years for Zika to make it out of Africa to \nthe Pacific. Just 8 years after that, it reached the Western Hemisphere \nin Latin America.\n  Today it has infected people in 62 countries, including the United \nStates and 34 other countries in the Americas, so pretty much every \ncountry in the Americas is now infected with it. Hundreds of Americans \nhave been infected. We know of nearly 500, including 48 pregnant women \nand 12 people in my home State of Ohio, in fact. Thus far, it looks as \nthough all of the Americans who have become infected did so by \ntraveling overseas, being infected by the mosquito or by sexual contact \nwith someone who had Zika.\n  The World Health Organization calls it ``a threat of alarming \nproportions'' because it is spreading so quickly and because it has \nserious consequences for the most vulnerable in our society, \nparticularly the elderly--an older gentleman in Puerto Rico recently \ndied of Zika--children, babies in the womb, which we will talk about in \na second, and pregnant women.\n  As Zika has spread, health officials have reported an increased \nincidence of babies born with a horrible birth defect\n\n[[Page S2806]]\n\nwhere a baby's head and brain are abnormally small. The consequences of \nthis birth defect are absolutely tragic. These kids have seizures, slow \ndevelopment, intellectual disabilities, and often loss of hearing and \nvision. The consequences last a lifetime. There is no known cure for \nthis disease. We don't want any child to have to suffer through that. \nIt is in all of our interests to protect more babies from this \nsyndrome.\n  In Brazil, there have been more than 900 confirmed cases since Zika \narrived, with another 4,000 suspected cases. These are conservative \nestimates, and they are rising. That is up from around an average of \n150 each year--a 600-percent increase from year to year.\n  Officials also tell us that Zika can cause what is called Guillain-\nBarre syndrome, which causes the body's immune system to attack its own \nnerves. It is a cruel syndrome, and in bad cases it can cause total \nparalysis and loss of sensation. This can happen to anyone, not just \nnewborns but adults as well. These are just two of the neurological \nside effects that can result, and, like Zika, they are thought to be \nincurable.\n  For most adults, Zika is not fatal, but to the most vulnerable, like \nthe elderly and the unborn, it could be a lifetime of suffering, \ndisability, or even death. I mentioned the man in Puerto Rico who died \nlast week after being infected by Zika, a fellow American. His immune \nsystem began to attack the platelets in his blood, so they couldn't \nclot, and that was the effect for him.\n  As Zika spreads, it becomes clearer than ever that our response has \nto be very aggressive, both domestically and internationally. It has to \nbe aggressive, and therefore it has to be funded. That is why I think \nit is important that we deal with emergency funding before it is truly \nan emergency.\n  I thank my colleagues for the steps they have already taken to \nimprove our response. In March, this body passed and President Obama \nsigned into law bipartisan legislation which I cosponsored with my \nfriend Senator Franken that will give accelerated priority review at \nthe Food and Drug Administration for new drugs and vaccines to treat \nZika. This is very important, and I applaud the Senate for moving \nquickly and the administration for moving on that. It is a critical \nstep. Right now, there is no cure and no treatment. President Obama has \nsigned it into law.\n  I am also grateful to the administration for redirecting more than \n$500 million of residual Ebola funds that were originally appropriated \nby Congress to deal with Ebola and were not necessary. They stopped \nusing those funds for Ebola and shipped those funds over to Zika to \nstop it from spreading. I applaud them for that as well.\n  Again, we have more work to do, and it is my view that we ought to \nmove forward with emergency funding. There was a proposal--I believe it \nwas finalized just last week, Thursday or Friday--from Senator Blunt \nand Senator Murray that goes a long way toward dealing with this issue.\n  The majority of the funding is right here in the United States, while \nthe rest will go to international immigration purposes so we can keep \nZika from crossing our borders again. A lot of this funding goes to the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention--the majority of it--to \nenhance mosquito control programs, improve infrastructure for testing \nfor Zika, and expand the pregnancy risk assessment monitoring system, \nall of which are important. This is emergency funding, and I think it \nis necessary. Some funding also helps provide health services for \npregnant women in Puerto Rico and invests in scientific research for a \ntreatment or a vaccine. This is perhaps the most important thing we can \ndo. These are critical priorities.\n  I would also note that I am pleased that we have maintained the Hyde \nprotections in this proposal, and I believe this is consistent with the \ngoal of protecting innocent life, protecting these innocent babies from \nbirth defects. We want this funding to be used to help preserve life \nand to help the vulnerable.\n  We need to ensure adequate funding. We have to recognize the tools \nalready at our disposal and use them. I have remained in contact with \nthe Secretary of the Air Force as this virus has spread to make clear \nthat in Ohio we have reservists at Youngstown Air Reserve Station who \nare ready to help. This Air Reserve Station in Youngstown, OH, is the \nhome of the 910th Airlift Wing, which is the only fixed-wing aerial \nspray unit in the United States. It has been used by the military all \nover the United States. They have played key roles in other public \nhealth emergencies, including spraying millions of acres in Louisiana \nand Texas for mosquito abatement after Hurricane Katrina. I believe \nthey could play that same role now. They are ready to do it, but \nfrankly they need an upgrade in their equipment to be able to do it.\n  As RADM Stephen Redd of the CDC told me in the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, ``there could be a role for that \nairwing in locations that do not have [finely honed mosquito control \nenterprises].'' He said that a lot of counties in this country do not \nhave that. He said: ``One of the things that we think is really \nimportant that the Zika virus outbreak is pointing out is the need to \nreally revitalize those mosquito control efforts.'' I couldn't agree \nwith him more.\n  We need to revitalize these efforts to be sure we have them and use \nthe tools that are at our disposal right now. If Zika were to spread \naround the country, it is incredibly important that we have this \ncontrol effort.\n  I hope we move forward on this in the next couple of days, send this \nlegislation to the President for his signature, and get moving on \ndealing with the Zika emergency we have before us. People all over Ohio \nask me about it because they are worried. We need to keep our \nconstituents safe, and we need to give them peace of mind.\n  Adopting the amendment I think we are going to have before us in the \nnext couple of days is the best action we can take right now to achieve \nthese goals, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nstrongly support emergency funding for this purpose.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield back my time.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it has been 5 weeks since the Senate last \nconfirmed a judicial nominee. In that time, judicial vacancies have \ncontinued to increase. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership has \nrepeatedly objected to unanimous consent motions made to overcome the \nobstruction of 20 judicial nominees. These are nominees who were voted \nout unanimously by committee and are awaiting a confirmation vote.\n  The majority leader claims that President Obama's nominees have been \ntreated fairly, but anyone paying attention to the Senate over the past \n7 years knows that is not the case. It has been almost 2 months since \nChief Judge Merrick Garland was nominated by President Obama to fill a \nvacancy on the Supreme Court. Chief Judge Garland is widely respected, \nand prior to his nomination, he had repeatedly received praise from the \nvery Republicans who now refuse to allow him to appear for a \nconfirmation hearing. These same Republicans refuse to do their jobs as \nSenators while outside groups pour millions of dollars into television \nads that seek to discredit Chief Judge Garland's record. Before there \nwas even a Supreme Court nominee, one Republican aide promised \nconservatives were ``going to light this person up.'' Sadly, it appears \nthey are making good on their threat while simultaneously refusing to \nallow him a public hearing where he could respond.\n  Meanwhile, lower court nominees have stalled. Paula Xinis, whom we \nwill vote on today, was nominated more than a year ago to fill an \nemergency vacancy--not just a regular vacancy but an emergency vacancy \nin Maryland. Since 2011, she has practiced as a criminal defense \nattorney at a law firm. Prior to that, she served in the Federal Public \nDefender's Office for the District of Maryland for 13 years, from 1998 \nto 2011. Ms. Xinis has extensive trial experience, representing \nhundreds of clients as a public defender and trying 16 cases to \ncompletion over the course of her career. The ABA Standing Committee on \nthe Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Ms. Xinis ``well qualified'' to \nserve in the district court. They gave Paula Xinis their highest \nrating. She is strongly supported by both Senators from Maryland, and \nher nomination was unanimously approved by the Judiciary\n\n[[Page S2807]]\n\nCommittee by voice vote 8 months ago. All the Republicans on the \nJudiciary Committee approved her nomination from the Committee by \nunanimous voice vote.\n  Senator Sessions came to the floor today to oppose Ms. Xinis's \nnomination based on her experience as an examiner of complaints against \npolice officers in the District of Columbia. From 1995 to 2011, Ms. \nXinis served as a complaint examiner in six cases where she made \ndeterminations on complaints brought against Metropolitan Police \nDepartment officers. At her Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Senator \nSessions questioned Ms. Xinis about her experience and expressed \nconcern that, in the six cases Ms. Xinis served as a complaint \nexaminer, she sustained rulings against police officers in all of them. \nSenator Sessions questions Ms. Xinis's fairness to police officers \nbased on her determinations in these six cases.\n  However, as Senator Sessions said on the floor today, he does not \nquestion her personal qualifications or her integrity to be a Federal \njudge. And he also did not question her testimony before the Judiciary \nCommittee in which she committed to being a fair and impartial judge, \nshould she be confirmed. Furthermore, Ms. Xinis's record as a complaint \nexaminer shows that each one of her six determinations was sustained by \nthe chief of police; none of them was overturned. Her decisions could \nhave been appealed and overturned if they were incorrect, but they were \nnot.\n  Paula Xinis has earned the express support of law enforcement and has \ndefended police officers as an attorney on a number of occasions. For \ninstance, in one case, she provided legal counsel to a Baltimore police \nofficer unfairly accused of criminal wrongdoing. That officer wrote a \nletter of support for Ms. Xinis, where he said: ``Throughout the entire \nordeal, I spent countless hours with Paula and her team. They worked \ndiligently seeking the evidence needed to exonerate me. Although it was \nan extremely dark time for me, she always made me feel confident that \nshe `had my back' and that she was dedicated to seeing that I was \nvindicated. Thankfully, as a result of her tireless efforts on my \nbehalf, all of the charges brought against me were dismissed earlier \nthis year.'' This does not sound like a person who holds any biases \nagainst law enforcement. In addition to this officer, several other \nmembers of the law enforcement community have written in support of Ms. \nXinis's nomination.\n  After we actually vote on Paula Xinis's nomination today, there will \nstill be 19 judicial nominees pending on the Executive Calendar waiting \nfor a confirmation vote. Every single one of these nominees was voted \nout of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote. Instead of \nallowing a vote on these nominees on a regular basis, the Republican \nleadership objects to the Senate being able to do our jobs.\n  After today's vote, the next in line for consideration is a district \ncourt nominee from New Jersey and then a district court nominee from \nNebraska. I know the Senators from New Jersey are pushing for a vote on \nthe nominee to serve in their State. I hope the Republican Senators \nfrom Nebraska are urging their leadership to schedule the confirmation \nof Robert Rossiter, who was approved by unanimous voice vote in \ncommittee. That vacancy has been pending for over a year and a half. \nThere is no good reason for votes on these nominees to be further \ndelayed.\n  Senator Grassley has indicated that Republicans will shut down the \njudicial nominations process in July, even though vacancies have risen \nfrom 43 to 81 since Republicans took over the majority. They have \nallowed vacancies to rise dramatically and now want to shut it down \neven though the judicial nominees pending are not controversial and we \nhave numerous vacancies that need to be filled. This is wrong. Contrast \nthis to the last 2 years of George W. Bush's administration, when \nDemocrats were in control. At this same point in the Bush Presidency, \nDemocrats had reduced vacancies to just 46.\n  Because of Republican obstruction, our independent judiciary is \nstruggling to perform its role under the Constitution. The Marshall \nProject recently interviewed several sitting judges to examine the \nimpact judicial vacancies are having on our courts. Chief Judge Ron \nClark of the Eastern District of Texas, which currently has three \njudicial emergency vacancies, said: ``We're managing the best we can--\nbut if they don't get us another judge soon, you could start to see \nsome more draconian kinds of delays.'' There is a nominee to this court \npending in the Judiciary Committee, but the Texas Senators, who both \nare members of the committee, have not returned their blue slips to \nallow that nominee to even receive a hearing. I hope the Texas Senators \nheed the call of Chief Judge Clark and get moving on their nominee.\n  And I hope the Senate majority allows this body to return to regular \norder when it comes to processing judicial nominees. We have a \nconstitutional responsibility to provide advice and consent on the \nPresident's nominees. The Constitution has not changed, but once \nPresident Obama took office, this body's normal practice for treating \nnominees turned for the worse. Deference to home State Senators was no \nlonger the norm, and procedural delay after procedural delay quickly \nbecame the standard practice of the Republican caucus, whether they \nwere in the minority or now in the majority. In a New York Times op-ed \na week ago, former Judge Shira Sheindlin of the Southern District of \nNew York warned that the Republicans' obstruction to district court \nnominees ``undermines public trust in the impartiality and legitimacy \nof the judiciary.''\n  I was heartened to hear the majority leader last week make the point \nthat an election year is ``not an excuse not to do our work.'' I could \nnot agree more. That is why in the last 2 years of the George W. Bush \nadministration, when I served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nwe confirmed 68 of President Bush's judicial nominees. That is compared \nto a handful of President Obama's nominees that the Republicans have \nallowed. We confirmed 68 of President Bush's judicial nominees, and we \nconfirmed right up to the time we went out for the elections in \nSeptember, not in June or July or May.\n  We have also confirmed more than a dozen Supreme Court Justices in \nPresidential election years, and many in this Senate served at the \ntime. The last one we had, of course, was during President Reagan's \nfinal year in office. We did so because we knew the Supreme Court \nshould not be held hostage to election-year politics; yet we are being \nheld hostage to election-year politics because we are not doing our \njobs. And the Supreme Court issued a couple more 4-to-4 opinions today.\n  I urge the majority leader to heed his own advice and to schedule a \nconfirmation vote for the pending lower court nominees, and I urge the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee to follow suit by scheduling \nconfirmation hearings for Chief Judge Garland so that we can do our \njobs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Judge Sheindlin's op-ed \nand the Marshall Project review be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Marshall Project, April 26, 2016]\n\n       What Happens When There Aren't Enough Judges to Go Around?\n\n                             (By Eli Hager)\n\n       The ninth seat on the Supreme Court has been vacant for two \n     months.\n       But Antonin Scalia's chair is not the only empty one in the \n     vast federal judiciary, where several judgeships have \n     remained unfilled for 30 months or more. Around the country, \n     there are 84 of these vacancies, largely as a result of the \n     Senate's historically low rate of confirming President Barack \n     Obama's nominees. And since the beginning of last year, the \n     number of unfilled seats and pending nominations have been \n     steadily rising.\n       Down in the gears of the justice system, all those absent \n     judges have taken a toll.\n       Because courts are obligated to find ways to meet speedy-\n     trial rules, at least in criminal cases, the vacancies have \n     not caused across-the-board delays. But by all accounts, the \n     unconfirmed nominees--combined with what advocates say is an \n     insufficient number of judgeships overall--have forced the \n     system to find sometimes extraordinary ways to make do with \n     the few judges available.\n       Some judges, for example, are having to drive hundreds of \n     miles to cover the empty seats. Less-qualified magistrate \n     judges, senior judges who are supposed to be entering \n     retirement, and visiting judges who fly in from other states, \n     have all had to pitch in. And many of the remaining judges \n     say that it's hard, with such a lack of personnel, to give \n     every case the attention it deserves.\n       In the worst-hit districts, including all four districts of \n     Texas, some areas of Florida\n\n[[Page S2808]]\n\n     and California, Middle Alabama, and elsewhere, the situation \n     is now considered an ``emergency.''\n       Ron Clark, chief judge of the Eastern District of Texas, \n     which has three judicial emergencies out of only eight total \n     judgeships, says that ``we're managing the best we can--but \n     if they don't get us another judge soon, you could start to \n     see some more draconian kinds of delays.''\n\n\n                Judicial Vacancies in the Federal Courts\n\n       In the past year, unfilled federal judgeships have been \n     rising dramatically. Similarly, the number of seats on the \n     bench considered ``emergencies''--vacant for many months with \n     a large caseload per judge--and the number of White House \n     nominations awaiting Senate confirmation have climbed.\n       A 2014 study by the Brennan Center for Justice found that \n     the vacancies led to a host of negative consequences. Among \n     them were unresolved motions, habeas corpuspetitions waiting \n     years to be heard (or being handled by law clerks instead of \n     judges), judges spending less time on each case, and \n     defendants pleading guilty because they believed a trial \n     would not get the timely attention it deserved.\n       And in civil proceedings, where the Speedy Trial Act does \n     not apply, longer wait times for trial are becoming more \n     common.\n       Morrison C. England Jr., chief judge of the Eastern \n     District of California, says that ``cases that aren't the \n     priority are going to get pushed back for years, literally.''\n       In Middle Alabama, Ricky Martin, a pastor, had been \n     allowing registered sex-offenders to stay in mobile homes \n     surrounding his church--until the state legislature made it \n     illegal for him to do so. Martin filed suit in August of \n     2014, and the local D.A. responded with a ``motion to \n     dismiss'' a few months later. But a judge didn't get around \n     to weighing in--in Martin's favor--until this April, and the \n     case may not actually be resolved for two more years or \n     longer.\n       The process would have taken only three to four months if \n     there were more judges available, says Randall Marshall, \n     legal director of the ACLU of Alabama.\n       But sometimes, the effect is the opposite: the proceedings \n     get rushed.\n       Brian McGiverin, a civil-rights lawyer in Austin, Texas, \n     says that because there are so few judges, the remaining ones \n     are all overbooked. As a result, they often ``give you a \n     cramped amount of time for trial, regardless of how many \n     witnesses you'd like to call.''\n       McGiverin recently assisted in the case of a woman named \n     Abieyuwa Ikhinmwin, who claimed that she was racially \n     profiled, handled with excessive force, and wrongfully \n     arrested by police in San Antonio.\n       He says the court tried to ``fast-track'' her lawsuit, \n     threatening to dismiss it within 21 days unless she paid a \n     fee and submitted additional information--which would not \n     have happened when there were enough judges.\n       Clark, chief judge in the nearby Eastern District of Texas, \n     says that ``with so few of us, it's definitely harder to have \n     the flexibility that a defense lawyer might want us to. So \n     the answer sometimes has to be, `No, sorry, we can't offer \n     that time in court.' ''\n       Meanwhile, the consequences of too few judges are worsened \n     in the most geographically expansive districts.\n       ``When there's a missing judge in a state like ours,'' \n     Clark says, ``it's not like we can walk down the hall and \n     take care of a trial for him--the trip from Beaumont to Plano \n     is five and a half hours, and that's if the traffic is \n     good.''\n       He and the other judges in his district waste about two \n     days a week on the road.\n       ``We're one traffic accident away from the wheels falling \n     off,'' he says.\n       As an additional stop-gap measure, the worst-hit districts \n     are relying on pinch hitters.\n       In Middle Alabama, less-experienced magistrate judges (who \n     are appointed directly by the district judges, rather than \n     nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate) have \n     for several years been doing work once reserved for the \n     district judges, from taking guilty pleas to overseeing \n     evidentiary hearings. The district is also getting last-\n     minute help from visiting judges, who have traveled from Iowa \n     and Florida to pitch in.\n       ``When there are judges who come in from elsewhere,'' says \n     Christine Freeman, executive director of the federal \n     defender's office in Montgomery, Ala., ``they are strangers \n     to us, to the prosecutor, to court officials, to the \n     probation officers, to every single person involved in a \n     case.''\n       ``That makes it very hard to predict outcomes for your \n     client,'' Freeman adds.\n       But the lack of judges has perhaps fallen hardest on senior \n     judges, who, because they are typically over 70 or 80 years \n     old, usually take on 50 percent or less of a full caseload.\n       Instead, in Middle Alabama and elsewhere, their caseloads \n     have been 150 or even 200 percent of normal.\n       ``I'm 73, and I'd like to be able to say, `Look, I'm done, \n     I want to spend more time with my family,' '' says Michael \n     Schneider, one of the senior judges in Eastern Texas. ``I'm \n     encouraged that the president has nominated someone, but I \n     can't actually cut back until a nominee is approved.''\n       ``I'm going to be at this for awhile,'' Schneider adds. \n     ``It's frustrating.''\n       England, the chief judge in Eastern California, says that \n     senior judges are the only reason why vacancies haven't \n     become more of a crisis.\n       ``We are living and dying with our senior judges,'' England \n     says. ``They're taking on cases they shouldn't have to, but \n     that's what's saving us.''\n       Of course, federal courts being overburdened is the symptom \n     of more than simply a lack of nominations and confirmations.\n       Since 1990, Congress has not passed major legislation \n     creating new judgeships, even as the war on drugs, and now \n     the surge in prosecution of undocumented immigrants, have \n     jammed up the system with exponentially more cases.\n       As a result, by 2013, there was a 39 percent uptick in the \n     number of overall filings, while only 4 percent more judges \n     were added to handle all that extra work.\n       Throw in the higher-than-normal number of vacancies, and \n     it's a recipe for an overburdened judiciary. After a three-\n     year wait, for instance, the Eastern District of California \n     finally got a vacancy filled last October. But Chief Judge \n     England says the crushing burden of too few judges hasn't \n     lessened.\n       ``One way or the other, Congress would need to give this \n     district more judges,'' he says. ``We need help--we have too \n     many trials. I'm booked for 2016 and 2017 already.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the New York Times, May 6, 2016]\n\n        America's Trial Court Judges: Our Front Line for Justice\n\n                        (By Shira A. Scheindlin)\n\n       The outcry over the Senate's failure to hold hearings on \n     Judge Merrick Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court is \n     fully justified. But that isn't the only judiciary scandal on \n     Capitol Hill. Even as the spotlight shines on the high court, \n     the Senate has refused to confirm dozens of uncontroversial \n     nominees to fill vacancies in the federal trial courts.\n       Such obstructionism has become an everyday occurrence. Just \n     last week, Senate Republicans refused to vote on 11 federal \n     district court nominees whom the Judiciary Committee had \n     already approved--even those who were supported by \n     Republicans in their home states. During President George W. \n     Bush's last two years in office, the Democratic-controlled \n     Senate confirmed about 57 district court judges. Since \n     Republicans took power in 2014, the Senate has confirmed only \n     15 of President Obama's trial court nominees.\n       This is an even bigger problem than Judge Garland's stalled \n     nomination. Trial court judges do the bulk of the work in the \n     federal court system: Last year nearly 375,000 new cases were \n     filed, while the Supreme Court justices issued just under 75 \n     opinions. And because most trial court decisions are never \n     appealed, they become the final word in significant disputes \n     that affect millions of Americans.\n       I know this firsthand. I served as a trial judge for over \n     21 years, and stepped down from the bench last week. As I \n     walked out of a federal courthouse in Lower Manhattan on one \n     of my last days, an African-American United States marshal \n     asked me if he could have a word.\n       He explained that he had grown up in New York City's public \n     housing, and thanked me for my 2013 decision in the ``stop \n     and frisk'' case. (I ruled that the New York Police \n     Department's practice in which police officers stopped \n     hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers without reasonable \n     suspicion, a vast majority of whom were innocent African-\n     Americans and Latinos, was unconstitutional.)\n       ``You just can't know what a difference this has made to so \n     many people in my community,'' he said. ``You can't even \n     imagine.''\n       But I think I can. At the policy's peak in 2011, officers \n     stopped nearly 700,000 people. That number dropped to about \n     23,000 last year, and the policy change was not accompanied \n     by a rise in serious crime, despite dire predictions to the \n     contrary. As a result of my rulings and community outcry, the \n     Police Department agreed to reforms, which include better \n     record keeping, the use of police body cameras and the \n     abandonment of racial profiling.\n       Other examples abound. In 1974, Judge Jack Weinstein of the \n     Eastern District of New York found the de facto segregation \n     in a Coney Island public school to be unconstitutional, a \n     ruling affirmed on appeal. The school was ultimately \n     integrated under his supervision, and without the ``white \n     flight'' that politicians had feared would result.\n       And in one of the highest-profile civil rights cases ever \n     in a trial court, Leonard about a decade later that both the \n     housing and schools in Yonkers were intentionally segregated, \n     and ordered construction of integrated housing in the city. \n     An appeals court upheld this ruling, which, despite years of \n     public protest, immensely improved the living conditions for \n     thousands of Yonkers residents.\n       The influence of district judges has likewise had an effect \n     on national security. In the mid-2000s, Judge Alvin \n     Hellerstein, also from the Southern District of New York, \n     ordered the government to disclose photographs under the \n     Freedom of Information Act that depict the abuse of Abu \n     Ghraib detainees, which was affirmed by the appellate court. \n     Judge Hellerstein also effectively forced the government to \n     turn over the Department of Justice's infamous ``torture \n     memos,'' which incited a national conversation about whether \n     torture is ever appropriate.\n       Not every decision by district court judges benefits the \n     public: Last week Judge Thomas Schroeder of North Carolina's \n     Middle District upheld myriad legislative changes to the \n     state's voting rules that will result in reduced voting \n     opportunities for minorities, unless reversed.\n\n[[Page S2809]]\n\n       Whether Judge Garland should be confirmed or not, there can \n     be no denying that Supreme Court nominations are inherently \n     political. So it's no surprise that they are drawn out for \n     ideological or partisan reasons. But district court \n     nominations are different. Ideology is not the issue: \n     Experience and competence are the only criteria.\n       And yet the Senate majority's policy of delaying qualified \n     district-court nominations on purely political grounds \n     undermines public trust in the impartiality and legitimacy of \n     the judiciary. This is especially worrisome because the \n     public's understanding of how justice is administered is most \n     likely based on its access to and experience with lower court \n     proceedings.\n       Presidential debates have focused on the Islamic State, \n     trade pacts and immigration policy; meanwhile, the next \n     president will most likely appoint 130 trial judges over the \n     next four years. The public needs to know what's at stake. \n     Trial judges must spot the issues, decide the outcomes and \n     fashion the remedies in all kinds of disputes. I cannot force \n     this Congress to do its job. But I urge voters not to forget \n     the White House's power to appoint all judges when they \n     choose the next president.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I rise this evening in support of the nomination of Paula Xinis to \nserve on the District Court of Maryland. I know Senator Cardin will be \ncoming to the floor shortly to also comment on Ms. Xinis's nomination. \nSenator Cardin and I recommended Ms. Xinis to President Obama with the \nutmost confidence in her abilities, talent, and competence for the job. \nShe is a brilliant litigator and a dedicated public servant. The \nJudiciary Committee agreed with us, because they also voted her out of \nthe committee unanimously.\n  I thank Senator McConnell, the majority leader, for scheduling this \nvote; Senator Grassley for moving this nomination; and I also thank my \nvery good and dear friend Senator Leahy, the vice chairman of the \ncommittee, who has been a strong advocate not only for this nomination \nbut for moving all nominations forward, as voted out by the committee \nin a prompt way.\n  As I talk about Ms. Xinis, I want the Presiding Officer to know that \nI have recommended several judicial nominees for district and appellate \ncourts, and I take my advise and consent responsibility very seriously. \nWhen I recommend to the President a position on the district court, I \nhave four criteria: absolute integrity, judicial competence and \ntemperament, a commitment to core constitutional principles, and a \nhistory of civic engagement in Maryland.\n  Ms. Xinis exceeds these expectations over and beyond. She has \ndedicated her career to the rule of law, achieving equal justice under \nthe law and also being an advocate for the underdog. She is truly an \noutstanding nominee with a long history of public service--14 years as \na Federal public defender, handling everything from the most simple \nmisdemeanors to very complex white-collar crimes. She has also taken on \nextra duties, training staff and being an attorney supervisor of \nresearch and writing, proving time and time again how committed and \ndedicated she is.\n  She worked as a clerk for the distinguished and esteemed Judge Diana \nGribbon Motz, a well-respected judge on the Fourth Circuit. She also \nhas been a member of the private sector as a senior trial partner in a \nprivate law firm in Baltimore, taking on complex civil litigation and \nprotecting those who have been harmed by lead paint or carbon monoxide \npoisoning.\n  Judge Motz, in recommending Ms. Xinis to me, said she is so \nintelligent and generous in terms of working very hard, in terms of \nknowing the law and practicing the law, but she also commented on her \nwork ethic, praising her skill in the courtroom and her service to the \ncommunity.\n  She has mentored children, provided legal advice to at-need \ncommunities in Baltimore, and served on numerous bar associations. She \nhas deep appreciation for the law and everything that it means. I do \nbelieve she will be an outstanding judge.\n  There have been criticisms raised of Ms. Xinis, and the criticisms \nhave centered around her support within the law enforcement community. \nFlashing yellow lights were raised by one of our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle, asking whether she had an impartial attitude \ntoward police officers. I have four letters here from retired police \nofficers in Baltimore City all attesting to that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have these letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          City of Charlottesville,\n\n\n                                            Police Department,\n\n                             Charlottesville, VA, August 30, 2015.\n     Re Letter in Support of Paula Xinis, for the position of \n         United States District Judge for the District of \n         Maryland.\n\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Honorable Senators Grassley and Leahy: My name is \n     Timothy Longo and I currently serve as the Chief of Police in \n     the City of Charlottesville, Virginia. I am a career law \n     enforcement officer having previously served as a Colonel \n     with the Baltimore City Police Department, retiring in March \n     of 2000. In addition, to my professional training and \n     experience, I am proud to have received my law degree from \n     the University of Baltimore and was admitted to the Maryland \n     Bar in December of 1993.\n       For the past 25 years, I have had the honor of instructing \n     thousands of law enforcement officers and administrators on \n     matters of policy, law, and generally accepted policing \n     practices. In addition to my sworn duties and \n     responsibilities, I have served on many occasions as a police \n     practices expert assisting both plaintiff and defense counsel \n     in civil rights claims resulting from the actions of law \n     enforcement officers, and the policies and practices related \n     to those actions. It is in this capacity that I have come to \n     know and respect Paula Xinis. I have come to learn that the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee is presently considering Paula's \n     candidacy and I respectfully write in support of her \n     appointment.\n       Paula and I met several years ago when I was asked to \n     assist her in the evaluation of a civil rights claim that she \n     had filed on behalf of a client related to the actions of a \n     municipal law enforcement officer and the agency and \n     municipality that employed that officer. The claim arose out \n     of a use of force incident which resulted in serious and \n     permanent injury. I firmly believe that cases such as this \n     requires not only a thorough understanding of Section 1983 \n     litigation and that of municipal liability, but an equally \n     thorough understanding of police training, policy, and \n     practice.\n       For more than a year, I worked closely with Paula as she \n     sought to better understand how a police officer is trained, \n     the policies, principles, and practices that guide their \n     work, as well as the manner in which police departments \n     investigate incidents that result in force. What I discovered \n     from the onset, and frankly what continued to impress me as I \n     worked with Paula on this important matter, is the thoughtful \n     and objective manner in which she approached both the facts \n     and the theory of her client's case.\n       Although the complaint she had advanced on behalf of her \n     client depicted a series of facts that one may find was \n     clearly contrary to generally accepted policing practices on \n     the face of her client's complaint, she consistently \n     endeavored to examine that complaint and the facts in the \n     support of it through the lenses of a career law enforcement \n     officer who had not only worked the streets of a large \n     metropolitan city, instructed thousands in policing, but also \n     served as a policy maker as to the training of police \n     officers and practices that guide that work. She and I spoke \n     countless times, and at great length, about not only that \n     particular case but the way that police officers go about \n     their work and the decisions that they make quickly and \n     oftentimes without much deliberation.\n       Paula was amazingly careful to reserve her own judgment and \n     opinion as to the appropriateness of the officer's conduct \n     and that of the agency's policy maker and listened carefully \n     to my assessment of her claim and my opinion as to its \n     propriety in light of my specialized training and experience.\n       America's law enforcement officers are facing incredibly \n     difficult challenges as we closely evaluate the manner in \n     which we go about our work, carefully consider re-shaping and \n     reforming our practices, and endeavor to strengthen the \n     necessary relationships we have with those whom we serve. \n     Undoubtedly, law enforcement officers, policy makers, and \n     municipalities will more frequently find themselves being \n     scrutinized by our trial and appellate courts, and ultimately \n     the court of public opinion. The nature of our work and \n     recent police-citizen interactions that have ended tragically \n     makes this reality most certain. Thus, it has never been more \n     critical to connect the right people to this important work; \n     not just on the front line but throughout the criminal \n     justice continuum.\n       It is with a tremendous amount of pride and the utmost \n     confidence that I respectfully ask the Senate of the United \n     States to confirm the appointment of Paula Xinis to the \n     United States District Court for the District of Maryland. I \n     have absolutely no doubt that Paula will bring the competence \n     and objectivity that is necessary to discharge the\n\n[[Page S2810]]\n\n     duties of such an important position. She has my confidence, \n     respect, and unfettered support.\n       If I can be of further assistance, please don't hesitate to \n     call upon me.\n       Meanwhile, I thank you for your time and thoughtful \n     consideration.\n           Respectfully Submitted,\n\n                                      Timothy John Longo, Sr.,\n\n                                                  Chief of Police,\n     City of Charlottesville, Virginia.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                Police Department,\n\n\n                                          Baltimore, Maryland,\n\n                                                 4 September 2015.\n     To: Senator Patrick Leahy.\n     From: Sgt Brian Atwood.\n     Subject: Recommendation for Paula Xinis to U.S. District \n         Judge for Md.\n       Sir: My name is Sgt Brian Atwood; I am a twenty year \n     veteran with the Baltimore Police Department, I started my \n     career in May of 1995 in the Western District. During my \n     career I have received three Bronze Stars for Valor, two Life \n     Saving awards and have received numerous unit citations of. I \n     have held several positions of authority include: Field \n     Training Officer, Officer in Charge, Sergeant and Sergeant in \n     Charge. I have been assigned to follow district units: \n     Patrol, Flex Units, Drug Unit, and Firearm Instructor. I'm \n     currently assigned to the departments, Special Operation \n     Section. I have held tactical positions as both an officer \n     and sergeant within the elite Emergency Service Unit. My \n     current assignment is supervising sergeant of the K-9 unit.\n       I am also a passed board member of Maryland's largest FOP \n     with over 5000 active and retired members. As a member of FOP \n     Lodge #3, I have held numerous positions within our lodge to \n     include. Grievance Rep, Grievance Chairman, P.A.C funds \n     Chairman, Legal Advisory Board, Contract Team Chairman, and \n     was elected to the position of Vice President for our Lodge.\n       It is my understanding that the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     will be considering Ms. Paula Xinis for United States \n     District Judge. I would proudly recommend Ms Xinis to the \n     position of U.S District Judge for Maryland. Ms Xinis is a \n     person of honor, integrity, fairness and would be outstanding \n     in that position.\n       In closing as a 20 year member of the law enforcement \n     community, I know first hand the need to have judges that are \n     well balanced, fair and great listeners. It is equally \n     important that our judges take the rule of law and always \n     apply it equally, with understanding and compassion in there \n     decision. That is why I proudly recommend Ms. Paula Xinis to \n     the position of U.S. District Judge.\n           Respectfully,\n     Sgt. Brian Atwood.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    Abingdon, MD, August 31, 2015.\n     Re Letter in Support of Judicial Nomination of Paula Xinis \n         for the United States District Court for the District of \n         Maryland.\n\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Grassley and Leahy: Please accept this letter \n     as support for the nomination of Paula Xinis as a United \n     States District Judge for the District of Maryland. I was \n     employed as a Police Officer with the Baltimore Police \n     Department from 1987 until the time of my retirement in \n     September 2014. While assigned to the Patrol Division, I \n     handled calls for service related to violations of Maryland's \n     handgun and narcotics laws. I also actively participated in \n     shooting investigations. I also spent thirteen years assigned \n     to the Tactical Unit/Quick Response Team. During my tenure \n     with the Tactical Unit, one of the Unit's primary focus was \n     serving high risk warrants for the Homicide and Robbery \n     Units. When we weren't training, serving warrants and/or \n     responding to barricade/hostage situations, we were utilized \n     as suppression unit for illegal handguns and narcotics \n     violations. For five straight years, my partner and I \n     maintained the highest number of gun seizures/arrests and the \n     largest narcotics cases within the Baltimore City Police \n     Tactical Section. We received numerous commendations for our \n     handgun arrests. Throughout the course of my career, I was \n     called upon to testify in both the District and Circuit \n     Courts in Baltimore City and County, as well as the United \n     States District Court for the District of Maryland in \n     Baltimore.\n       Unfortunately, my successful career in law enforcement was \n     derailed in 2014 when I encountered difficulties in \n     connection with a call for service. I was improperly and \n     unfairly accuse of wrongdoing which led to criminal charges. \n     This was a new experience for me as I had never even been \n     disciplined during my career. I felt vulnerable and betrayed. \n     It was clear to me and my wife that we needed legal \n     representation that would aggressively fight to vindicate me.\n       My wife, whose practice is primarily the defense of civil \n     cases, had been involved in a case in Baltimore City where \n     Ms. Xinis represented the plaintiffs several years prior. \n     During the course of that case, she would often remark that \n     Ms. Xinis was a worthy advocate, yet fair and open-minded. \n     Because of her experience with Ms. Xinis, my wife contacted \n     her on a weekend to seek legal counsel and advice. From that \n     point forward, Ms. Xinis made herself available to us, even \n     if it was to simply reassure us that we were in good hands. \n     Throughout the entire ordeal, I spent countless hours with \n     Paula and her team. They worked diligently seeking the \n     evidence needed to exonerate me. Although it was an extremely \n     dark time for me, she always made me feel confident that she \n     ``had my back'' and that she was dedicated to seeing that I \n     was vindicated. Thankfully, as a result of her tireless \n     efforts on my behalf, all of the charges brought against me \n     were dismissed earlier this year.\n       I can personally attest to Ms. Xinis' legal acumen and her \n     commitment to seeking justice, regardless of who the \n     defendant may be. I observed her demonstrate the ability to \n     forcefully argue her position to the court while being \n     respectful to the court and other counsel. She can be a \n     fierce advocate while maintaining a reassuring demeanor. My \n     exposure to the judicial process throughout the course of my \n     law enforcement career and as an officer who was wrongfully \n     accused, has provided me with insight as to what is required \n     to be an effective, fair and open-minded jurist. I can state \n     without a doubt that Ms. Xinis possesses all of the necessary \n     traits to be an asset to the federal bench in Maryland. The \n     Committee could not find a more qualified candidate to fill \n     the vacancy in Maryland.\n           Sincerely,\n     Thomas J. Schmidt, Sr.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                September 1, 2015.\n     Re Support of Paula Xinis, for United States District Judge \n         for the District of Maryland.\n\n       Dear Senator Patrick Leahy (Ranking Member) United States \n     Senate Committee on the Judiciary: My name is Gregory Eads, \n     Jr. I am a retired Baltimore City Police Officer. I served 22 \n     years on the Baltimore City Police Department and retired in \n     November 2014. I was currently assigned to the Bomb Squad and \n     Emergency Services Unit where primarily I responded to \n     suspicious package calls, bomb sweeps for visiting V.I.P's \n     and stadium events. In my tenure as a police officer with the \n     department I've acquired several skills and with worked in \n     numerous specialized units. I have worked in Patrol, \n     Bike(flex) squad, Drug enforcement unit, SWAT, Organized \n     Crime Unit, Firearms Apprehension Strike Team. I am highly \n     decorated officer that was awarded several unit citations, \n     accommodations, and bronze star for valor.\n       I've come to learn the senate Judiciary Committee is \n     considering Paula for a United States District Judge. I want \n     to extend my support for Paula as a candidate. Paula and I \n     met at her law firm as she was preparing to defend a co-\n     worker in criminal case. She was interviewing me as a \n     character witness. During this exchange we discussed my \n     family, experiences and my background being a second \n     generation Police Officer in Baltimore City. We share some \n     similarities on life and making a difference in the world. \n     Paula has a young child, demanding career and is very well \n     known among her peers.\n       I was most impressed with her attention to detail, due \n     diligence and preparation of the case. She is hardworking, \n     open minded, and fair. I believe she would be an asset as she \n     exemplifies the firm qualities that a United States District \n     Court Judge possesses. As a police officer we need Judges \n     that are fair, impartial and firm on the bench. With Paula \n     being confirmed by the Senate Committee you will have that \n     Judge I am referring to. I am grateful that I had the \n     pleasure of meeting and working with Paula.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Gregory Eads Jr.,\n                                                    (Retired) BPD.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. One letter is from someone who is a 20-year veteran, \nworking in the Western District. The Western District is where they \nfilmed ``The Wire.'' It is rough, tough, and hardscrabble. This former \npolice sergeant said:\n\n       In closing, as a 20-year member of the law enforcement \n     community, I know firsthand the need to have judges that are \n     well balanced, fair and great listeners. . . . That is why I \n     proudly recommend Ms. Paula Xinis to the position of U.S. \n     District Judge.\n\n  I won't go through every letter--the Record will speak for itself--\nbut when you have retired police officers, those who are not on duty \nnow but who worked with her hands-on and who know the way she works \nwith law enforcement, the way she engages with them when she was a \npublic defender and so on--I think these letters speak for themselves.\n  In closing, let me say this: The job of a U.S. Senator to recommend \nsomeone to be a judge is indeed a great honor, but it is an enormous \nresponsibility. I take it very seriously, and I would only recommend \nsomebody who was truly qualified to render impartial justice and bring \nthe competency and the temperament to do that. I believe Ms. Xinis \npossesses competency, the judicial temperament, and a real commitment \nto equal justice under the law.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n[[Page S2811]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I join Senator Mikulski, as the two \nSenators from Maryland, in strongly recommending the favorable \nconsideration of Paula Xinis for the district court judgeship of \nMaryland.\n  I first want to acknowledge the leadership of our senior Senator from \nMaryland in developing a process in which we screen the very most \ntalented people for opportunities to serve on our Federal bench. This \nis a professional process that we have gone forward with under Senator \nMikulski's leadership in order to try to get the very best on our \ncourts.\n  It is not a partisan issue at all. It is strictly looking for those \nwho have the judicial temperament and experience to be able to be an \noutstanding member of the bench. We have done that on previous \nnominations that have been considered on this floor, and Paula Xinis \nfollows in that tradition. I thank Senator Mikulski for the process \nthat we went forward on in making this recommendation to President \nObama.\n  I might tell you, President Obama then forwarded the nomination to \nthe Senate in March of last year--in March of 2015. It took 6 months \nfor the Judiciary Committee to make its recommendations to the full \nfloor in September of 2015. It was not a controversial nomination in \nthe committee. The committee reviewed all of Ms. Xinis's background, \nrecord, everything that she has done, and on a very strong voice vote \nbrought her forward to the full floor.\n  So this is not a controversial nomination. Because of the delay, \noriginally to fill the vacancy of Deborah Chasanow, who took senior \nstatus, it is now a judicial emergency. People of Maryland are in a \ndesperate situation to have an adequate number of judges to handle the \nworkload in our district. It is critical we move forward in the \nconfirmation of this nominee. Senator Mikulski has pointed out how \nqualified this person is.\n  I can tell you, over the last several months, I have been stopped on \nnumerous occasions by attorneys and nonattorneys in Maryland saying: \nWhy isn't Paula Xinis confirmed by now? She is a wonderful person. We \nhave had experience with her.\n  I have heard glowing comments about her dedication to our community, \nher professional competency, and her qualifications to serve on the \nU.S. district court. It is for that reason the ABA gave her the highest \nratings in their review of her qualifications. She has been in the \nprivate practice of law at Murphy, Falcon & Murphy. After just 2 years, \nshe was made a partner in that firm. She has been an assistant Federal \npublic defender, showing her compassion to represent some of the most \ndifficult cases in our criminal justice system.\n  She was a law clerk for Judge Motz on the Fourth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. She has devoted her life to understanding our legal system but \nalso to carrying out its major charge to make sure we have equal access \nto justice under the law. She got her JD from Yale Law School, her BA \nfrom the University of Virginia.\n  What I really appreciated, in getting to know Paula Xinis better \nduring this confirmation process, was getting to know her family \nbackground; that is, to represent the American story. Her father was an \nimmigrant from Greece, came over with very little resources. They were \nable to take advantage of the opportunities in this country as an \nimmigrant family. Now Paula Xinis has been nominated by President Obama \nto serve on the district court for Maryland.\n  Quite a success story, but Paula Xinis has never forgotten her \nbackground. She has always been giving back to our community. She is \nknown for her pro bono work for her church members in the church she \nbelongs to, but as Senator Mikulski pointed out, in working with the \nHouse of Ruth in a mentoring program, she has taken on some of the most \ndifficult challenges to affect the lives of people who are less \nfortunate. She has an 11-year-old who is like her second son whom she \nhas mentored and given a real opportunity in our community.\n  She has the whole package. She will make a great district judge. \nSenator Mikulski mentioned the comments that were made on the floor in \nregard to her support for law enforcement for police officers. I hope, \nif anyone has any questions about that, read the letters Senator \nMikulski put into the Record. I know of some of these cases. I know of \nthe case of Timothy John Longo, who served with the Baltimore City \nPolice Department and is now the chief of police for Charlottesville, \nVA.\n  He said:\n\n       I have absolutely no doubt that Paula will bring the \n     competency and objectivity that is necessary to discharge the \n     duty of such an important position. She has my confidence, \n     respect and unfettered support.\n\n  Then there is Thomas Schmidt, who Ms. Xinis represented when he was \naccused of wrongdoing as a police officer. She represented him in the \nmost difficult challenge. Mr. Schmidt said:\n\n       Throughout the entire ordeal, I spent countless hours with \n     Paula and her team. They worked diligently seeking the \n     evidence needed to exonerate me. Although it was an extremely \n     dark time for me, she always made me feel confident that she \n     had my back, and that she was dedicated to seeing that I was \n     vindicated. Thankfully, as a result of her tireless efforts \n     on my behalf, all the charges brought against me were \n     dismissed earlier this year.\n\n  She has been in the forefront of defending those who were defending \nus as first responders. There are other letters that have been written \nby police officers indicating that Paula Xinis contains exactly what \nthey want to see in a judge: someone who is fair and impartial and who \nwill carry out the rule of law in an objective manner. So for all of \nthose reasons, we bring you a nominee who is eminently qualified and \ndeserves the support of this body. We would urge our colleagues to \nsupport this nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Today the Senate will vote on the nomination of Paula \nXinis to be a judge for the District of Maryland. I will support that \nnomination.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor at this time to also talk about \njudges generally. I have been hearing the usual complaints from Members \nof the minority party regarding the pace of judicial nominations. I \nwould urge my colleagues to step back and look at the bigger picture. \nThe relevant number to consider is the number of confirmations during \nan entire Presidency. At this point in his Presidency, President George \nW. Bush had 303 judicial nominees confirmed. After tonight's vote, so \nfar in his Presidency, President Obama will have 325 confirmed. Those \nare 22 more nominees than Bush had.\n  So as we continue to hear complaints about how many judges are being \nconfirmed, we should put these complaints in context. The simple fact \nis, President Obama has had quite a few more nominees confirmed than \nPresident Bush did.\n  Further, I would note that as chairman, after this Wednesday, I will \nhave held hearings for the same number of nominees this Congress has \nhad as the last chairman of the committee did to this point during the \nlast 2 years of President Bush's Presidency. At this point in the 2008 \nCongress--that would be the 110th Congress--the former chairman held \nhearings on 43 nominees. At the end of May of this year, we will have \nheld hearings on 43 nominees thus far in the 114th Congress.\n  I yield back all remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  All time is yielded back.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the Xinis \nnomination?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a copy of a newspaper article at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  Income inequality has been a hot topic this campaign season. It has \nbecome the rallying cry of the left to support their economic agenda. \nWhether it is taxing the rich, raising the minimum wage, combating \nglobal warming, or any other number of policies. If you listen to \nSecretary Clinton and Senator Sanders on the campaign trail, you would \nget the impression that income inequality is the fault of Republicans. \nThey contend that their preferred policies will close the gap between \nthe rich and the poor. However, the inconvenient fact is that \ninequality rose considerably more under President Clinton than it did \nunder President Reagan. Further, it has increased more under President \nObama than it did under President Bush.\n  For any of my colleagues wondering how this could be the case, I \nwould encourage them to read Lawrence Lindsey's op-ed that ran in the \nWall Street Journal in March.\n  Mr. Lindsey's article title ``How Progressives Drive Income \nInequality'' details how liberal policies have not only failed to \nreduce income inequality, but may in fact be contributing to it.\n  For instance, my colleagues on the left all too frequently look to \never richer and more expansive transfer payment programs as the \nsolution. However, too often our existing transfer programs meant to \nhelp the less fortunate act as an anchor preventing Americans from \nclimbing up the income ladder.\n  This risks creating a permanent underclass of citizens that are \ndependent on the state for their basic needs. That may be the dream of \nEuropean- style Social Democrats, but it is most certainly not the \nAmerican Dream.\n  The Congressional Budget Office looks at this effect in terms of \nmarginal effective tax rates on low and moderate income workers. This \nrefers to how much extra tax or reduction in government benefits is \nimposed on an--American worker when he or she earns an additional \ndollar of income.\n  CBO estimates that in 2016 those under 450% of the federal poverty \nlevel will face an average effective tax rate of about 41%. Keep in \nmind that this is just the average. CBO demonstrates how a substantial \nnumber of workers could experience marginal effective rates exceeding \n50, 60, or even 80%, which is far higher than the top statutory rate of \n39.6% paid by the wealthiest Americans.\n  The end result is a worker facing these rates may just decide it \ndoesn't make much sense to take on extra hours or put in the effort to \nlearn extra skills to increase their earnings potential. Historically, \nthis has impacted married women in the workforce most of all as they \nare more likely than men to drop out of the workforce completely as a \nresult.\n  Discouraging individuals from entering the labor force, taking on \nmore work hours, gaining extra experience, or learning new skills, is a \nrecipe for stagnate incomes and increased income disparity. But, far \nfrom seeking to address these work disincentive effects, President \nObama has made it worse for millions of workers. Take the premium tax \ncredit enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act for instance. CBO \nestimates it will raise marginal tax rates by an estimated 12 \npercentage points for recipients.\n  Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders also have provided no \nindication they would reverse this trend. In fact, they appear to only \nbe interested in exacerbating this problem through richer transfer \nprograms, increased costs on employers, and increased payroll taxes.\n  The scapegoat of the income inequality debate on the left has, of \ncourse, been the much-hyped top 1 percent. Here we are told that if we \njust tax the rich, we can solve all of our problems and address income \ninequality in one fell swoop.\n  But, if increased taxes on the wealthy is a solution to income \ninequality, why--as I pointed out at the start of this speech--did \nincome inequality grow faster under President Clinton than under \nPresident Reagan? And why has income inequality grown faster under \nPresident Obama than under President Bush?\n  The fact of the matter is that taxing the wealthy to reduce income \ninequality at best is a fool's errand and at worst could be a blow to \nour economy--potentially harming individuals at all income levels.\n  A recent research paper by the liberal Brookings Institution looked \ndirectly into the question of whether substantially increasing taxes on \nthe wealthy would reduce income inequality. To quote their findings, \n``An increase in the top tax rate leads to an almost imperceptible \nreduction in overall income inequality, even if the additional revenue \nis explicitly redistributed.'' Raising taxes might be successful at \ngenerating revenue to fund greater wealth transfer payments. But it \ndoes nothing to rectify the ``opportunity gap.''\n  Soak the rich policies do not create greater opportunity for low-\nincome individuals. In fact, wealth transfer policies often have the \nperverse effect of trapping their intended beneficiaries in soul-\ncrushing government dependency. Moreover, because of their negative \neffects on economic growth and capital formation, they can reduce \nopportunity for all Americans. You do not have to take my word for the \nanti-growth effects of increasing taxes. Research by Christina Romer, \nPresident Obama's former chief economist, found that a tax increase of \n1% of GDP reduces economic growth by as much as 3%.\n  According to this study, tax increases have such a substantial effect \non economic growth because of the ``powerful negative effect of tax \nincreases on investment.''\n  In effect, what those who pursue wealth-destroying redistributionist \npolicies are really saying--to quote Margaret Thatcher--is that they \n``would rather that the poor were poorer, provided that the rich were \nless rich.'' That may result in less differences in wealth between \nAmericans, but the expense of making us all worse off. Our goal must be \nto create wealth and opportunity for ALL Americans.\n  We should reject the notion that in order to improve the lot of one \nindividual, someone else must be made worse off. The leadership of \nother side has become fixated on redistributing the existing economic \npie. The better policy is to increase the size of the pie. When this \noccurs, no one is made better off at the expense of anyone else.\n\n[[Page S2813]]\n\nThis is best achieved through pro-growth policies aimed at growing the \neconomic pie, not by taking from some and giving to others.\n  Instead of seeking to reduce inequality by knocking the top down a \nfew pegs on the income ladder, policies should be focused on helping \nindividuals climb upwards by tearing down barriers that stand in their \nway. We all agree with the need for a sound safety net to protect the \nmost vulnerable among us. But when that safety net begins to act like \nan anchor holding people back, we need to be brave enough to chart a \nnew course. This is what we sought to do with welfare reforms in 1994 \nthrough work requirements and incentives. It is once again time for us \nto review and reform programs so as to minimize as much as possible the \ncurrent built-in work disincentives from transfer programs that I \ndiscussed earlier.\n  Another often overlooked issue is the burden overregulation imposes \non low-income individuals.\n  Dr. McLaughlin of the Mercatus Center in testimony before a Senate \nJudiciary subcommittee hearing earlier this year discussed two negative \nimpacts regulation can have on low-income households.\n  First, while it is well recognized that regulations can increase \ntransaction costs for businesses, it is equally true that consumers \nfeel the costs in the form of higher prices. Since low-income \nhouseholds tend to spend, rather than save, a much larger share of \ntheir income, they are the ones hit hardest by the regulatory costs. In \nthis regard, regulation acts much like a regressive tax on the \nconsumption of those that are the least well off.\n  A second point made by Dr. McLaughlin is that regulations can often \ncreate a barrier to entry. Setting out on one's own to start a business \nis as American as apple pie. It is an avenue that Americans throughout \nhistory have taken to climb from the poor house to the penthouse. But, \nthe cost imposed by entry regulations can too often stand in the way. \nThis directly limits opportunities of lower-income individuals who are \nthe least likely to be able to cut through the red tape and have money \non hand to afford the associated costs. Research by Dr. McLaughlin \ndirectly links entry regulations with income inequality. His study \nlooked at the relationship between regulation and income inequality \nacross 175 countries and found that stringent entry regulations are \ncorrelated with significantly higher levels of income inequality.\n  On the campaign trail we have heard Senator Sanders sing the virtues \nof Denmark in his crusade against inequality. Interestingly enough, \nDenmark scores very well in the World Bank's ``ease of doing business'' \nranking, which looks at the cost, time, and overall red tape in \nstarting and running a business. In fact, Denmark is ranked third, \nwhile the U.S. lags behind in seventh and has been consistently falling \nbackwards since 2008. While Senator Sanders points to Denmark as a \nmodel for the U.S. due to its tax and social welfare policies, it is \nDenmark's regulatory efficiency that deserves our attention. In \naddition to reducing unnecessary regulatory barriers and built-in work \ndisincentives, there is no question we need to do a better job ensuring \nindividuals have the skills necessary to compete in the 21 century \neconomy.\n  There has been considerable research demonstrating that the widening \nwage gap between skilled and unskilled labor has contributed to the \ngrowth in income inequality. I consistently hear from employers in Iowa \nwho cannot find enough skilled workers to fill well-paying jobs. If we \nare to reduce income inequality, we must first reduce opportunity \ninequality.\n  We have an excellent system of community colleges in Iowa that train \nIowans for jobs that are available in Iowa, but those who are \nchronically unemployed tend to lack the so-called ``soft skills'' that \nare necessary to hold down a job. In order to eliminate opportunity \ninequality, we must get back to the notion of the inherent dignity of \nwork and ensure that hard work pays off.\n  These are just a few areas we should be able to work together on to \nincrease opportunities for those least well off among us. Increasing \nopportunity should be our focus, not pitting American against American \nbased on their socioeconomic status. If we make increased opportunity \nour focus, no one is required to be made worse off to benefit someone \nelse. In fact, by tearing down barriers standing in the way of \nhardworking Americans, all Americans will benefit from higher \nproductivity, higher wages, and higher economic growth.\n  My colleagues on the other side who are truly interested in reducing \npoverty and inequality should abandon their divisive politics of envy \nand class warfare Instead, work with Republicans on an agenda focused \non economic growth and opportunity to benefit ALL Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             [Mar. 4, 2016]\n\n                How Progressives Drive Income Inequality\n\n                        (By Lawrence B. Lindsey)\n\n       Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are promising all types \n     of programs to make America a more equal country. That's no \n     surprise. But when you look at performance and not rhetoric, \n     the administrations of political progressives have made the \n     distribution of income more unequal than their adversaries, \n     who supposedly favor the wealthy.\n       The Census Bureau releases annual updates on income \n     distribution in the U.S., publishing three technical \n     statistical measures--the Gini index, the mean logarithmic \n     deviation of income (mean log deviation for short), and the \n     Theil index--each of which represents inequality levels on a \n     scale of 0 to 1 (zero signifies perfect equality and 1 \n     indicates perfect inequality). By all three measures, \n     inequality rose more under Bill Clinton than under Ronald \n     Reagan. And it wasn't even close. While the inequality \n     increase as measured by the Gini index was only slightly more \n     during Clinton's two terms, the Theil index and mean log \n     deviation increased two and three times as much, \n     respectively.\n       Barack Obama's administration follows this pattern, despite \n     the complaints he and his supporters have made about his \n     predecessor. The mean log deviation increased 37% more under \n     Mr. Obama than under President George W. Bush, although when \n     this statistic was released, Mr. Obama had only six years as \n     president compared with Mr. Bush's eight. The Gini index rose \n     more than three times as much under Mr. Obama than under Mr. \n     Bush. The Theil index increased sharply during the Obama \n     administration, while it fell slightly under Bush 43.\n       Sure, no president intends to raise inequality. And the \n     spin doctors for Messrs. Clinton and Obama may insist that it \n     wasn't their fault.\n       But consider their policies. Both Democratic presidents \n     presided over bubble economies fueled by easy monetary \n     policy. There is no better way to make the rich richer than \n     to run policies that push up the price of financial assets. \n     Cheap money is a boon to those who have access to it. \n     Interest rates were also too low under Bush 43, but that \n     bubble was in housing, and the effects were therefore more \n     evenly distributed than under Mr. Clinton's stock-market \n     bubble or Mr. Obama's credit bubble.\n       Money matters, but so do other policies, such as the long, \n     historic sweep of the expanding welfare state. In 1968, \n     government transfer payments totaled $53 billion or roughly \n     7% of personal income. By 2014, these had climbed to $2.5 \n     trillion--about 17% of personal income. Despite the \n     redistribution of a sixth of all income, inequality measured \n     by all three of the Census Bureau's indexes is far higher \n     today than in 1968.\n       Transfer payments under Mr. Obama increased by $560 \n     billion. By contrast private-sector wages and salaries grew \n     by $1.1 trillion. So for every $2 in extra wages, about $1 \n     was paid out in extra transfer payments--lowering the \n     relative reward to work. Forty-five million people received \n     food stamps in mid-2015, an increase of 46% since the end of \n     2008. Similarly, 71.6 million individuals were enrolled in \n     Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, an \n     increase of 13.3 million since October 2013.\n       In 2008, during the deepest recession in 75 years, 13.2% of \n     Americans lived below the government's official poverty line. \n     The Great Recession officially ended in June 2009, but in \n     2014, after five years of economic expansion, 14.8% of \n     Americans were still in poverty. The economy was better, and \n     there were a lot more handouts, but still poverty rose.\n       The structure of American households shows how this \n     happened. From 2008 through 2014, the most recent year for \n     which we have data, the number of two-earner households \n     declined. These two-earner households have become the \n     backbone of the American middle class.\n       Research by the Hamilton Project and the Urban Institute \n     show that when families with children making between $20,000 \n     and $50,000 attempt to have a second earner go back to work, \n     the effective tax rate on the extra earnings--including lost \n     government benefits such as food stamps, the earned-income \n     tax credit, and medical support payments--is between 50% and \n     80%. This phaseout of the ever increasing array of benefits \n     has created a ``working-class trap'' instead of a ``poverty \n     trap'' that is increasing inequality and keeping the income \n     of these households lower than they might otherwise be.\n       While the number of two-earner households declined during \n     the first six years of the\n\n[[Page S2814]]\n\n     Obama presidency, the number of single-earner households rose \n     by 2.6 million and the number of households with no earners \n     rose by almost five million. In other words, two thirds of \n     the increase in the number of families under Mr. Obama was \n     accounted for by households with no one working. This is the \n     reason the middle class has shrunk, and the reason inequality \n     has increased. And unless we increase the number of people \n     wanting to work and the number of jobs through economic \n     growth, inequality will only increase.\n       The flip side of the progressive agenda to redistribute \n     income to those with less is to raise taxes on the ``rich.'' \n     The data show that it is also an ineffective way to reduce \n     inequality.\n       President Clinton increased the top tax rate on higher \n     earners--yet inequality rose during his administration, and \n     faster than under the tax-cutting Ronald Reagan. The same \n     happened under President Obama. Tax rates went up on upper-\n     income earners. Inequality rose too, and more than under his \n     tax-cutting predecessor.\n       A recent Brookings Institution study--whose authors include \n     Peter Orszag, President Obama's director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget--found that boosting the top tax rates \n     even more, as Sen. Sanders suggests, would have little or no \n     effect on inequality. The paper explored the effects of \n     raising the highest marginal income-tax rate to 50% from \n     39.6%. Assuming no behavioral effects, the expected revenue \n     was then distributed directly (and in theory costlessly) to \n     the bottom 20% of income earners.\n       The $95 billion in extra taxes and transfers reduced the \n     Gini Coefficient by only 0.003. To put that in perspective, \n     that reversed only one fifth of the increase in inequality \n     during the Obama presidency.\n       There was a catch. When the authors assumed that there \n     might be a behavioral response by higher income taxpayers, \n     inequality fell--but for the wrong reasons. Less work, \n     saving, investing and more tax sheltering reduced the taxable \n     income of higher earners and therefore meant less revenue to \n     redistribute So the rich got poorer, by their own choice, but \n     the poor got less in benefits. A true lose-lose situation.\n       None of this should really be surprising. If the socialist \n     ideal of ``from each according to his ability, to each \n     according to his need'' worked in practice, the Berlin Wall \n     might still be standing. Of course, one of the reasons it \n     came down is that a new ruling class emerged to take from the \n     productive and give to those in need, siphoning off a cut of \n     the swag along the way. Ruling classes always have sticky \n     fingers.\n       Redistribution through the political process is not \n     costless--even in a perfect world there would be a large \n     bureaucracy to feed. Special-interest elites also emerge when \n     so much money is being moved around. They take their cut, \n     introducing even more inefficiency into the system.\n       Presidential contenders who boast of their plans to reduce \n     inequality might ponder the fact that providing more free \n     things is not the answer. Even free college and free health \n     care are paid with taxes that discourage people from \n     increasing their work, savings and entrepreneurship.\n       Attacking the rich and running against inequality may be a \n     sensible political strategy. But in the end the programs to \n     implement this strategy make the problem worse. Yet advocates \n     come back and demand the same programs. That is perilously \n     close to the definition of insanity attributed to Einstein: \n     doing the same thing over and over again and expecting \n     different results.\n       The repeated failure of political promises has another \n     downside--increasing voter alienation and cynicism. The \n     appeal of redistribution is understandable, but voters who \n     think the progressives running today are going to reduce \n     inequality are falling into the same trap as people entering \n     fifth or sixth marriages--the triumph of hope over \n     experience.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will be submitting a bipartisan \nresolution to commemorate National Police Week, which this year began \non Sunday, May 15, and ends on Saturday, May 21.\n  Senator Leahy and 52 others have joined me as original cosponsors of \nthe measure. The theme of this year's Police Week is ``Honoring Our \nHeroes.''\n  National Police Week is dedicated to the brave men and women in blue \nwho selflessly protect and serve our communities every hour of every \nday of every week and in every community across the United States.\n  The week affords an opportunity to honor those who have made the \nultimate sacrifice while striving to make our neighborhoods safer and \nmore secure.\n  Multiple events have taken place in Washington, DC over the past week \nto not only remember those officers who tragically lost their lives in \nthe line of duty but also to honor outstanding acts of valor and \nservice by many others.\n  Tens of thousands of police officers as well as their friends and \nfamily members have gathered in our nation's capital for these events, \nwhich included the Annual Blue Mass, a Candlelight Vigil and a Police \nUnity Tour Arrival Ceremony, among others.\n  Yesterday was National Peace Officers Memorial Day and thousands \ngathered on the West Front of the Capitol for the 35th Annual National \nPeace Officers Memorial Service.\n  This solemn service offered an opportunity for all of us to pay our \nrespects to fallen officers and the families, communities, and law \nenforcement agencies that have been permanently altered because they \npaid the ultimate sacrifice.\n  We owe these brave men and women our utmost respect and gratitude as \nwe honor their noble profession this week.\n  Each of the officers killed in the line of duty this year started \ntheir shift with the same goals: do some good, backup my fellow \nofficers, and return home safely.\n  Some of these officers had dedicated decades of their lives to \nprotecting their communities.\n  One of these officers was murdered mere hours after being sworn to \nher oath of service.\n  At the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, the names of some \n200 Iowans are inscribed amongst their law enforcement family.\n  Carved into the Memorial's walls are the names of more than 20,000 \nmen and\n\n[[Page S2820]]\n\nwomen who have been killed in the line of duty throughout U.S. history.\n  Each are unique in their own personal stories but they are uniform in \ntheir fidelity to truth and justice.\n  The individuals are heroes, not because of the manner in which they \ndied but because time and again they answered a call to do right, \nimpervious to the constant lurking of danger.\n  Regrettably, 123 new names of officers killed in the line of duty in \n2015 will be added to the rolls this week and we know that they will \nnot be the last.\n  Mr. President, the men and women of law enforcement make sacrifices \nboth big and small, frequently missing family celebrations and holidays \nbecause they believe in serving something greater than themselves.\n  The work of law enforcement is not a job, it is a calling.\n  That calling and those officers' devotion to duty merits our \nadmiration and we are deeply indebted to them.\n  I call on all Americans this week to pause and contemplate the safety \nand security they enjoy.\n  We all must recognize that such peace is the result of sacrifices \nmade by the brave men and women of law enforcement.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to urge my colleagues to support \nthis year's resolution designating National Police Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/16/senate-section/article/S2820-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADAM WALSH REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, hopefully this week the Senate will vote on \nlegislation to reauthorize key elements of the Adam Walsh Act. I \nsupported this important law when it was first enacted nearly 10 years \nago, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of this reauthorization bill. \nOver the years, I have worked closely with John Walsh and others who \nhave been such tireless advocates on behalf of missing and exploited \nchildren. And as a Senator and former prosecutor, but most importantly, \nas a father and a grandfather, I take seriously my duty to protect the \nchildren of Vermont and every community throughout the country.\n  The Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act will reauthorize two important \nprograms that assist State and local law enforcement agencies to \nmonitor and apprehend sex offenders. Specifically, this legislation \nauthorizes the Attorney General to continue providing grants to State \nand local law enforcement agencies in their efforts to improve sex \noffender registry systems. The bill also reauthorizes funding for \ngrants to improve information sharing and verification and supports the \nwork of the U.S. Marshals Service in helping State and local law \nenforcement to locate and apprehend sex offenders who fail to comply \nwith registration requirements.\n  Last Congress, I was proud to help lead the fight to reauthorize the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children, NCMEC, which has \nserved for more than three decades as a national clearinghouse on \nissues related to missing and exploited children. I know that the \ncenter works closely with the marshals and other Federal, State, and \nlocal law enforcement agencies, and the Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act \nwill help further our support for these collaborative efforts.\n  The bill also includes an important set of provisions authored by \nSenator Shaheen to protect the rights of sexual assault survivors. I \nwant to thank and applaud Senator Shaheen for her hard work and \nleadership on the Sexual Assault Survivors Rights Act. As an original \ncosponsor of her bill, I supported the inclusion of her important \nmeasure as part of this bill.\n  I encourage all Senators to support this bill. I hope that the House \nwill take it up and promptly pass it so that it can be signed into law \nby the President. There is no need to delay any longer our support for \nthe Federal, State, and local enforcement agencies that work tirelessly \nto protect the children of our community. But once this bill becomes \nlaw, our job does not end there. It is not sufficient to just pay lip \nservice to this issue and allow Congress to pat itself on the back for \npassing an authorization bill. Just as we have seen with our efforts to \ncombat the opioid abuse epidemic, a bill that authorizes programs is \nimportant and worthy of support, but ultimately an empty promise if it \nis not backed up with the actual Federal resources that Congress \nauthorizes. I will keep fighting to ensure that Congress puts its money \nwhere its mouth is and provides the funding that is necessary to \nsupport these important efforts. I will continue fighting to improve \nour laws so that we protect the most vulnerable in all of our \ncommunities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/16/senate-section/article/S2820-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2820-S2822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION\n\n  Mr. CORKER.

Description: On 28 October 2011, Congress was notified \n     by Congressional certification transmittal number 11-37, of \n     the possible sale under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export \n     Control Act (AECA) of 70 AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface \n     Standoff Missiles (JASSM), 2 test vehicles, support and test \n     equipment, publications, and technical documentation, \n     personnel training and training equipment, U.S. Government \n     and contractor engineering, technical and logistics support \n     services, and other related elements of logistical and \n     program support. The estimated total cost was $255 million. \n     Major Defense Equipment (MDE) constituted $134 million of \n     this total.\n       This transmittal reports the addition of one test vehicle, \n     a JASSM Missile in which the warhead has been replaced by \n     test instruments. The additional unit will result in a net \n     increase in cost of MDE of $2 million, resulting in a revised \n     MDE cost of $136 million. The total cost will remain at $255 \n     million.\n       iv. Significance: This report is being provided to increase \n     the quantity of JASSM test vehicles Finland will procure from \n     2 to 3.

Finland intends to integrate the \n     JASSM on its F/A-18C/D aircraft. Finland's acquisition of \n     JASSM is intended to modernize its current aircraft munitions \n     suite and counter potential threats. This will contribute to \n     the Finnish military's goal of updating its capability. \n     Finland will have no difficulty absorbing this additional \n     test vehicle into its inventory.\n       The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not \n     alter the basic military balance in the region.\n       vi.

Pastor Moran held the \nchurch's first service in 1967 from his home with only 10 people in \nattendance. Word of the newly formed church spread throughout the \ncounty, so the growing congregation had to meet at the Westover \nCommunity Building for the next 7 years. In 1973, the church moved into \nits first permanent location. Faith Baptist Church remained there until \n1995, which is when they moved into their current location. Pastor \nMoran was there helping the church every step of the way.\n  Born in Fairmont, WV, Bennie grew up a son of a coal miner. He \nattended Fairmont State University for his undergraduate degree and \nreceived his doctorate from Bob Jones University. Bennie also proudly \nserved his country in the U.S. Army. I am honored to represent this \nindividual who has faithfully served both this country and his \ncommunity. Today I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Pastor \nMoran's service to Faith Baptist Church and the State of West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/16/senate-section/article/S2822-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL OBSERVANCES OF GREELEY AND NORTHERN COLORADO\n\n Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, for over 35 years, the Holocaust \nMemorial Observances of Greeley and Northern Colorado have worked to \nraise awareness of the atrocities of Nazi crimes and the perils of \nanti-Semitism and have fostered greater understanding and knowledge \nthroughout Colorado. Through various educational experiences, the \nHolocaust Memorial Observances have preserved many of the stories of \nthe courage and bravery that have come to define that period.\n  This month, the members of the Holocaust Memorial Observances \ncommittee hosted a series of discussions, films, and school visits, \nincluding a presentation by Holocaust survivor Peter Daniels, formerly \nknown as Peter Berlowitz.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Mark Van \nTine, vice president of Digital Aviation for the Boeing Company and \nchief executive officer of Jeppesen. He is retiring after 35 years with \nthe company as a champion of the aviation industry.\n  Mr. Van Tine leads more than 3,800 employees at Jeppesen, which is \nheadquartered in Englewood, CO, and serves general, business, military, \nand the commercial aviation sectors. Additionally, Jeppesen works \nclosely with the aviation industry to improve the flying experience at \nDenver International Airport. A new navigation pattern design, for \nexample, allows commercial airline pilots to descend in a single, \nsmooth arc rather than a more traditional stair-step pattern, resulting \nin lower costs, fewer carbon emissions, and gentler landings.\n  Since 1981, Mr. Van Tine has held numerous positions at Jeppesen, \nincluding serving as its chief information officer, before being named \nCEO in 2002. In 2012, he became the leader of Boeing's new Digital \nAviation organization, taking on the tremendous challenge of overseeing \nJeppesen's digital transformation. This involved moving the entire \nglobal aviation industry to electronic charts, which reduced paperwork \nand increased efficiency.\n\n[[Page S2823]]\n\n  Mr. Van Tine is also an active contributor to the general aviation \ncommunity. He sits on the boards of the General Aviation Manufacturers \nAssociation, GAMA, and the Experimental Aircraft Association, EAA. In \n2009, he served as GAMA's chairman and has since chaired the \nassociation's Security Issues Committee for the last 5 years. He also \nchairs the Jeppesen Aviation Foundation, which honors the legacy of \nCaptain Elrey B. Jeppesen by supporting educational institutions, \norganizations, and students in the aviation community.\n  Encouraging students to become the next generation of aviation \nleaders is Mr. Van Tine's greatest passion. His commitment to education \nhas ensured Jeppesen continues to support programs that introduce \nColorado students to science, technology, engineering, and math using \naviation. This includes initiatives such at Aurora Public Schools, \nExperience Aviation, Rocky Mountain BEST, Shades of Blue, and the \nCherry Creek School Foundation.\n  Under Mr. Van Tine's leadership, Jeppesen has become a sponsor of \nnumerous scholarships aimed at encouraging students to pursue aviation \ncareers. Mr. Van Tine has also created a national STEM competition for \nhigh schoolers with the annual prize being a 2-week build of a Glasair \nSportsman airplane. This June marks the third year Mr. Van Tine will \njoin students to assemble an aircraft in the GAMA/Build-A-Plane \nAviation Design Challenge.\n  I congratulate Mark Van Tine on his many accomplishments and years of \noutstanding service to the aviation community. He is truly an asset to \nthe people of Colorado and to the millions of passengers around the \nworld who are safer in the skies and at sea through the use of his \nnavigation services.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/16/senate-section/article/S2823-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING THE SLCC MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. LEE. Mr. President, on March 14, 2016, the Salt Lake \nCommunity College men's basketball team walked into the Hutchinson \nSports Arena in Hutchinson, KS, to play their first game in the NJCAA \nnational tournament, the ``Big Dance'' for America's community \ncolleges, ranked 13th out of 24 highly talented and competitive teams. \nSix days and five games later, the Salt Lake Bruins walked out as \nnational champions, having bested the home team, Hutchinson Community \nCollege, 74 points to 64, in front of a sold-out crowd of more than \n6,000 fans.\n  On behalf of the people of Utah, I commend the Salt Lake Community \nCollege 2015-2016 men's basketball team for their well-deserved \nchampionship. In particular, I applaud the Bruins not just because they \nwon, but because of how they won.\n  When a team is awarded the national title after winning 5 games in 6 \ndays, beating the opposition by an average of more than 18 points, as \nthe Bruins did in Hutchinson, it can be tempting to look back at the \nseason and see a preordained path to the championship. But, as head \ncoach Todd Phillips surely knows, there are no guaranteed victories in \nbasketball, only earned ones, even for a team as storied and successful \nas Salt Lake Community College.\n  Indeed, the story of the Salt Lake Bruins' championship season is one \nnot of assured success, but obstacles overcome.\n  At the end of the regular season, the Bruins had lost five of their \nlast seven games, finishing third in the Scenic West Athletic \nConference, their worst performance in Coach Phillips' five seasons \nwith the team.\n  Entering the regional tournament on a three-game losing streak, the \nteam seemed to be fraying at the edges, their season on the brink of \nirrelevance. Something wasn't right. The team was playing well below \nits potential, and everyone knew it.\n  The easy response for the players and the coaches would have been to \npoint fingers, assign blame, and begin looking forward to the fresh \nstart always promised by the next season waiting around the corner.\n  But that is not the Salt Lake way. Instead of giving up, the team \ndoubled down, rebuilding their confidence and rededicating themselves \nto each other and to their season. And they did this as all good teams \nmust do: together.\n  The Salt Lake Bruins' always have plenty of stand-out athletes, and \nthis season was no exception, but the 12-man roster that took home the \nnational title truly played and won as a team.\n  To the 16 men who earned this championship, as players and as \ncoaches, congratulations. Your legendary season--and the teamwork that \nmade it possible--is an inspiration to the Nation and one of the many \nreasons I am proud to call Utah home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/16/senate-section/article/S2823-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RESERVE OFFICERS' TRAINING CORPS AT THE \n                          UNIVERSITY OF OREGON\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this year marks the 100th \nanniversary of the Webfoot Warriors, the Reserve Officers' Training \nCorps program at the University of Oregon. As an alumnus of the \nUniversity of Oregon Law School, I would like to commemorate this \nmilestone. Reserve Officers' Training Corps, or ROTC, is a voluntary \nprogram offered at hundreds of schools across the country. Students who \nmeet the eligibility requirements and stick with the program receive \nsubsidized tuition and, after graduation, are commissioned as officers \nin the U.S. military. The ROTC curriculum consists of courses in \nmilitary science and history as well as practical skills and leadership \ntraining.\n  The ROTC program we know today traces its roots to the National \nDefense Act of 1916, a bill signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson \nbarely a year before the United States entered World War I. Like many \nother university administrators of the day, Prince Lucien Campbell, the \nUniversity of Oregon's president at the time, was a supporter of the \nprogram. President Campbell established the first ROTC curriculum at \nthe University of Oregon, placing a retired British military officer--\nthe appropriately named Lieutenant Colonel John Leader--in charge. More \nthan 100 students participated in the first drill in March 1916.\n  The University of Oregon ROTC program commissioned its first officers \nin 1919, after the Allied victory in World War I, and the unit has \nproduced some truly top-notch officers in the decades since. In fact, \nthe Army Cadet Command awarded the unit a General Douglas MacArthur \nAward for the 2014-2015 academic year, recognizing it as one of the top \neight Army ROTC programs in the country. According to the unit's \nrecords, the University of Oregon has produced more general officers \nthan any nonmilitary ROTC program in the country. The program also \ncounts a total of 47 flag officers among its graduates.\n  As Oregonians, we have long taken pride in serving our State and this \ngreat country, and the Webfoot Warriors are hardly an exception. As \nthen-President Campbell put it himself, ``the matter of military \ntraining in any school seems to me to be a training for better \ncitizenship, rather than for war.'' Today I say thank you to all of the \nmen and women of the Webfoot Warriors past and present, and I wish the \nUniversity of Oregon ROTC program another 100 years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/16/senate-section/article/S2823-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2823-S2824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            50TH ANNIVERSARY OF CLACKAMAS COMMUNITY COLLEGE\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate \nClackamas Community College, CCC, in Clackamas County, OR, on 50 years \nof continued growth and achievement in providing valuable education to \nOregon's citizens. From Gladstone, to Oregon City, to Wilsonville, CCC \nhas grown to include three campuses and two extension sites. Now with \ncampuses educating 35,000 students, CCC still has a community-minded \nfocus and provides its communities with affordable education and \ntraining opportunities which aid in creating family-wage jobs.\n  Since 1966, CCC has prided itself on being a welcoming place for \nstudents seeking transfer degrees, specialized career technical \neducation, or returning to finish a high school diploma. The college \nhas over 80 career and technical programs, from automotive technology \nand renewable energy, to the ever-growing field of medical and dental \nassistance.\n  CCC has also grown into one of the top community colleges in the \nNation\n\n[[Page S2824]]\n\nfor our veterans, earning a Best in the West award from the Military \nTimes last year. The college has made service to veterans and military \nfamilies a high priority and an integral part of its campus identity. \nThe college has several full-time veterans advocates on staff and the \nonly Army Strong Community Center in the western U.S., connecting \nmilitary families to the resources they need.\n  For 50 years, educators, administrators, and board members have \nfollowed their vision that has led to CCC being a fixture of \nachievement in northwest Oregon. And to help continue that tradition of \nachievement, CCC has recently launched the ``Imagine Clackamas'' \nproject, which is a 2-year outreach effort designed to help the college \nidentify where to adapt and expand its strengths. I am excited to see \nwhat new heights this great community college will reach as it thrives \nfor decades to come.\n  It is an honor to represent Clackamas Community College in the U.S. \nSenate, and congratulations again to the college on its 50th \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/16/senate-section/article/S2824-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1818.

Res. 465\n\n       Whereas the solar energy industry has reached 1,000,000 \n     solar installations nationwide, a milestone that marks just \n     the beginning of the role of solar energy as a mainstream \n     power source;\n       Whereas although decades elapsed before the solar energy \n     industry reached the 1,000,000 installation milestone, the \n     solar energy industry projects that the solar energy industry \n     will reach 2,000,000 installations in just 2 more years;\n       Whereas, as of December 2015, there are over 27 gigawatts \n     of cumulative solar electric capacity operating in the United \n     States, which is enough energy to power more than 5,400,000 \n     average homes in the United States;\n       Whereas, as of December 2015, the United States solar \n     energy industry provides employment opportunities for more \n     than 208,000 solar workers in all 50 States and the solar \n     energy industry is creating jobs at a rate 12 times higher \n     than the rate of employment growth in the overall economy;\n       Whereas the United States solar energy industry is a \n     leading employer of minorities, women, and veterans;\n       Whereas there are nearly 4,000 primary and secondary \n     schools in the United States with active solar energy \n     systems, which means that more than 2,700,000 students in the \n     United States attend solar schools;\n       Whereas the cost of solar energy has dropped by 70 percent \n     in the last 7 years and solar energy has brought billions of \n     dollars in new investments to communities across the United \n     States;\n       Whereas continued decreases in cost, new financing models, \n     and innovative programs, such as community solar, have made \n     solar power accessible to millions of homeowners of many \n     incomes and backgrounds;\n       Whereas grid-connected solar energy reduces carbon \n     emissions by more than 31,000,000 metric tons annually;\n       Whereas, by 2020, solar electric capacity will quadruple in \n     size to nearly 100 gigawatts and employment in the solar \n     energy industry will more than double to 420,000 workers in \n     the United States; and\n       Whereas, having reached the milestone of 1,000,000 solar \n     installations in the United States, solar energy should be \n     supported by sound policies and continued private sector \n     innovation and ingenuity that will propel the United States \n     forward to a stronger economy and well-paying jobs: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate supports the United States solar \n     energy industry in its effort to bring low-cost, clean, 21st-\n     century solar technology into homes and business across the \n     United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/16/senate-section/article/S2826-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2826-S2827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 466--RECOGNIZING NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH AS AN \nOPPORTUNITY TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF CHILDREN IN THE \n  FOSTER-CARE SYSTEM, AND ENCOURAGING CONGRESS TO IMPLEMENT POLICY TO \n        IMPROVE THE LIVES OF CHILDREN IN THE FOSTER-CARE SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Franken, Mr. Gardner, \nMs. Heitkamp, Mr. Kaine, Mr. Peters, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \nScott, Mr. Merkley, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Blumenthal) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 466\n\n       Whereas National Foster Care Month was established more \n     than 20 years ago to--\n       (1) bring foster-care issues to the forefront;\n       (2) highlight the importance of permanency for every child; \n     and\n       (3) recognize the essential role that foster parents, \n     social workers, and advocates have in the lives of children \n     in foster care throughout the United States;\n       Whereas all children deserve a safe, loving, and permanent \n     home;\n       Whereas the primary goal of the foster-care system is to \n     ensure the safety and well-being of children while working to \n     provide a safe, loving, and permanent home for each child;\n       Whereas there are approximately 415,000 children living in \n     foster care;\n       Whereas there were approximately 255,000 youth that entered \n     the foster-care system in 2014, while over 107,500 youth were \n     eligible and awaiting adoption at the end of 2014;\n       Whereas children of color are more likely to stay in the \n     foster-care system for longer periods of time and are less \n     likely to be reunited with their biological families;\n       Whereas foster parents are the front-line caregivers for \n     children who cannot safely remain with their biological \n     parents and provide physical care, emotional support, \n     education advocacy, and are the largest single source of \n     families providing permanent homes for children leaving \n     foster care to adoption;\n       Whereas children in foster care who are placed with \n     relatives, compared to children\n\n[[Page S2827]]\n\n     placed with nonrelatives, have more stability, including \n     fewer changes in placements, have more positive perceptions \n     of their placements, are more likely to be placed with their \n     siblings, and demonstrate fewer behavioral problems;\n       Whereas some relative caregivers receive less financial \n     assistance and support services than do foster caregivers;\n       Whereas recent studies show foster children enrolled in \n     Medicaid were prescribed antipsychotic medications at nearly \n     4 times the rate of other children receiving Medicaid;\n       Whereas youth in foster care are much more likely to face \n     educational instability with 65 percent of former foster \n     children experiencing at least 7 school changes while in \n     care;\n       Whereas an increased emphasis on prevention and \n     reunification services is necessary to reduce the number of \n     children that are forced to remain in the foster-care system;\n       Whereas more than 22,000 youth ``age out'' of foster care \n     without a legal permanent connection to an adult or family;\n       Whereas the number of youth who age out of foster care has \n     steadily increased for the past decade;\n       Whereas foster care is intended to be a temporary \n     placement, but children remain in the foster-care system for \n     an average of 2 years;\n       Whereas children in foster care experience an average of 3 \n     different placements, which often leads to disruption of \n     routines and the need to change schools and move away from \n     siblings, extended families, and familiar surroundings;\n       Whereas children entering foster care often confront the \n     widespread misperception that children in foster care are \n     disruptive, unruly, and dangerous, even though placement in \n     foster care is based on the actions of a parent or guardian, \n     not the child;\n       Whereas children who age out of foster care lack the \n     security or support of a biological or adoptive family and \n     frequently struggle to secure affordable housing, obtain \n     health insurance, pursue higher education, and acquire \n     adequate employment;\n       Whereas on average, 8.5 percent of the positions in child \n     protective services remain vacant;\n       Whereas due to heavy caseloads and limited resources, the \n     average tenure for a worker in child protection services is \n     just 3 years;\n       Whereas States, localities, and communities should be \n     encouraged to invest resources in preventative and \n     reunification services and postpermanency programs to ensure \n     that more children in foster care are provided with safe, \n     loving, and permanent placements;\n       Whereas Federal legislation over the past 3 decades, \n     including the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of \n     1980 (Public Law 96-272), the Adoption and Safe Families Act \n     of 1997 (Public Law 105-89), the Fostering Connections to \n     Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-\n     351), the Child and Family Services Improvement and \n     Innovation Act (Public Law 112-34), and the Preventing Sex \n     Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (Public Law 113-\n     183) provided new investments and services to improve the \n     outcomes of children in the foster-care system;\n       Whereas May 2016 is an appropriate month to designate as \n     National Foster Care Month to provide an opportunity to \n     acknowledge the accomplishments of the child-welfare \n     workforce, foster parents, advocacy community, and mentors \n     for their dedication, accomplishments, and positive impact \n     they have on the lives of children; and\n       Whereas much remains to be done to ensure that all children \n     have a safe, loving, nurturing, and permanent family, \n     regardless of age or special needs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the designation of National Foster Care Month;\n       (2) recognizes National Foster Care Month as an opportunity \n     to raise awareness about the challenges that children face in \n     the foster-care system;\n       (3) encourages Congress to implement policy to improve the \n     lives of children in the foster-care system;\n       (4) acknowledges the special needs of children in the \n     foster-care system;\n       (5) recognizes foster youth throughout the United States \n     for their ongoing tenacity, courage, and resilience while \n     facing life challenges;\n       (6) acknowledges the exceptional alumni of the foster-care \n     system who serve as advocates and role models for youth who \n     remain in care;\n       (7) honors the commitment and dedication of the individuals \n     who work tirelessly to provide assistance and services to \n     children in the foster-care system; and\n       (8) reaffirms the need to continue working to improve the \n     outcomes of all children in the foster-care system through \n     parts B and E of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 601 et seq.) and other programs designed to--\n       (A) support vulnerable families;\n       (B) invest in prevention and reunification services;\n       (C) promote adoption in cases where reunification is not in \n     the best interests of the child;\n       (D) adequately serve those children brought into the \n     foster-care system; and\n       (E) facilitate the successful transition into adulthood for \n     children that ``age out'' of the foster-care system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"},
