Mr. President, with each passing day, the American \npeople are reminded of the peril attached to the Obama administration's \ninflexible determination to conduct foreign policy based on campaign \npromises made in 2008. These goals--unilaterally withdrawing from Iraq \nand Afghanistan based on fixed deadlines, ending the war on terror and \nsome of the critical tools used to pursue Al Qaeda, closing the secure \ndetention facility at Guantanamo Bay, withdrawing from our deployed \nforward presence, slashing investment in our conventional armed \nservices, and pursuing nuclear agreements with Russia and Iran at any \ncost--have remained constant, although the world has changed right in \nfront of our Commander in Chief.\n  Yesterday we saw the Obama administration threaten to veto the \nnational Defense authorization bill, which recently passed the Senate \nby a large bipartisan majority of 71 to 25. It passed the House by a \nbig bipartisan margin as well.\n  This is the legislation that sets out military policy and authorizes \nfunds for our military each year. It is always one of the most \nimportant bills we consider every year, but it is especially important \nright now.\n  The number of threats currently facing us is truly staggering. The \nlast month and week have brought glaring reminders. We are now seeing \nRussian forces deploy to Syria to preserve the Assad regime. Although \nMoscow may try to call this some kind of counterterrorism campaign, \nlet's be perfectly clear: Russia's offensive is designed to protect \nAssad's Alawite stronghold and Russian military installations, while \ndriving out the moderate opposition and compelling coordination of \nSyrian airspace with the coalition. Russia aims to forcefully insert \nitself into the middle of coalition operations to gain insights into \nthe plans of the United States and, of course, to secure a seat at the \ntable. Meanwhile, our moderate Syrian allies stand appalled that the \nUnited States has ceded its leadership position in the broader Middle \nEast.\n  Of all the promises made by this administration, withdrawing from \nAfghanistan by a date certain seems to ignore the attack upon Kunduz by \nthe Taliban and the efforts of President Ghani to secure the gains of \nthe coalition and his country's future. How can the administration be \npondering a withdrawal of the force when the Taliban's offensive \npersists and the campaign against Al Qaeda has not yet achieved its \ndefeat?\n  So many threats face us--from Russia, Iran, Syria, ISIL, and even \nChina--as do so many different means of attack: conventional, cyber, or \nterror. And now the Obama administration is talking about vetoing \nAmerica's national defense bill. They are talking about vetoing the \nnational defense bill in the wake of all of this.\n  I will have more to say about the national defense bill in the coming \ndays. But this is about more than one bill; it is the latest in an \nincreasingly worrying pattern. Just last week, Democrats voted again to \nblock funding for our military. Democrats had voted for that military \nfunding bill in committee. They issued press releases praising the bill \nthey had supported in the Appropriations Committee, but then they \nblocked the Senate from even debating it. Now they appear ready to give \nthe same treatment to our veterans. Democrats voted for the veterans \nfunding bill in committee. They issued press releases praising the \nbill. But now they seem prepared to block the Senate from even debating \nthis bill too. It is all part of some half-baked Democratic scheme to \nget more money for the IRS and for Washington bureaucracies. It makes \nno sense, it is extreme, and it needs to stop.\n  The veterans funding bill before us would do right by the men and \nwomen who have given everything to protect us and who have suffered so \nmuch\n\n[[Page S7056]]\n\nunder the failings of this administration. This is the bill that \nsupports veterans by funding the health care and the benefits they rely \non. This is the bill. This is the bill that supports military families \nby funding the housing, schools, and health facilities that serve them.\n  The veterans legislation before us provides support for women's \nhealth, for medical research, and for veterans suffering from traumatic \nbrain injury. It provides funding for design work at a new VA medical \ncenter in Louisville, for educational facilities at Fort Knox, and for \na special operations headquarters at Fort Campbell, all in my State.\n  The bill contains important reforms aimed at supporting veterans in \nthe wake of a true national disgrace--the VA scandal. The reforms \nfunded in this bill will allow for greater national and regional \nprogress in reducing VA claim backlogs, and they will deploy important \nprotections for whistleblowers too.\n  Look, we need to remember that we have an all-volunteer force in this \ncountry. The young men and women who sign up to defend our Nation don't \nask for a lot, but our Nation certainly asks a lot of them. These \nheroes shouldn't have to worry that their benefits or health care or \nthe housing and support their families need might not be there.\n  There is a long tradition in the Senate of bipartisan support for our \ntroops, our veterans, and their families. We saw that bipartisan \ntradition on full display just a few months ago when Republicans and \nDemocrats came together in the Appropriations Committee to pass \nbipartisan legislation to fund our troops and support our veterans.\n  We ask a lot of the men and women who serve. They don't need a bigger \nIRS or political games like the Democrats' self-described filibuster \nsummer; they need our care and our support. It is our turn to give back \nto them. Why don't we get back to the bipartisan tradition of \nsupporting these bills so we can do what we need to do for our \nveterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/01/senate-section/article/S7056-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is hard for me, when I come here every \nday, to be patient and listen to my friend the Republican leader talk \nbecause he is talking about something that is not real. He is not \ntalking about reality. He wants to get back to the bipartisan way we \nused to do things. I certainly agree with him, but having looked at \nsome 600 filibusters during the last few years conducted by my \nRepublican friends, I think that speaks volumes.\n  To have the Republican leader come to the floor and criticize Obama \nabout what is going on in the Middle East--that takes a lot of gall. We \nall know what happened in the Middle East a number of years ago that \ncreated all these problems. It was the worst foreign policy mistake in \nthe history of our country--invading Iraq. For what? Look what we have \nnow in Iraq. Look what we have in the entire Middle East. So it takes a \nlot of rearranging facts for the Republican leader to come to the floor \nevery day--most days I just sit here, listen, and go on about my \nbusiness, but I can't do that. It is just unfair. Everyone knows we \nneed to look no further than President Bush's invasion of Iraq to find \nout what the real problem is in the Middle East.\n  He talks about the Defense authorization bill. If it is such a great \npiece of legislative action, why does all of our military think it is a \nbad deal? This would be as if you decided one day you are going to make \nyour house payment and your car payment with money that doesn't exist. \nThat is what they have done. That is what the Republicans have done. \nThey have $39 billion in the Defense authorization bill that doesn't \nexist. It is just on paper. It is a gimmick for short-term funding. And \nto have the audacity to come here and talk about--look at all the \nthreats we are having with cyber security, cyber threats. We have a \ncyber bill we have tried to get on this floor. The Republicans blocked \nit when they were in the minority. Now when they are in the majority, \nthey won't do a bill, period.\n  We have an order that is before this body now that allows us to go \nforward on cyber security. We already have a list of amendments to \nagree on. But the Republican leader won't bring it to the floor. To \nhave him come to this floor and complain of Obama not doing anything \nabout cyber--I would suggest my friend, every morning when he gets up, \nwalk into the bathroom, put a little water on his face, wake up, and \nlook in the mirror.\n  I will talk about this a little more in a minute, but I want to start \nwhat I have to say right now by reading a direct quote from the current \nHouse majority leader, and we are told he is going to be the next \nSpeaker of the House of Representatives. Listen to this one, speaking \nabout the Benghazi committee. This is what Congressman McCarthy told \nFOX News:\n\n       Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? \n     But we put together a Benghazi select committee, a select \n     committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are \n     dropping.\n\n  I might add, the person doing the interviewing--good job.\n  But there you have it. According to the odds-on favorite future \nSpeaker of the House, the Benghazi select committee was put together to \nhurt Hillary Clinton politically, to make her poll numbers drop. We \nhave been saying this all along, but we have now had a gaffe. But it \nwasn't a slipup; he just told the truth. This is evidence of what we \nhave been saying. The Benghazi committee is a political stunt meant to \ninfluence Presidential elections that will be coming up in about a \nyear. It is no surprise that Congressman McCarthy's own colleagues are \nnow backpedaling on his comments as fast as they possibly can. Their \nelections will be in 1 week. They better take a look at whom they are \ngoing to put in as Speaker. The Republicans have taken a national \ntragedy--four Americans were killed--and turned it into the cheapest \npolitical farce imaginable. This is a shame. The very notion that an \nofficial House committee was used as a political tool is appalling. \nEven more disgraceful is the fact that they spent almost $5 million on \nthis select committee--dollars spent on this rightwing political \nhatchet job.\n\n  That is not all. In addition to this select committee, they have had \nsix other committees investigating this. There are untold millions of \ndollars spent on this. Whose money are they spending? They are spending \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  We hear my friend make references to how bad it is that we are \nconcerned about nondefense stuff. Yes, we are. We are concerned about \nnondefense stuff. We think the nondefense part of this budget should \nalso get some recognition. We are concerned about the FBI and the \nFederal court system. We are concerned about the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration and all the immigration officials who need help. We are \nconcerned about our forests that are burning down. We are concerned \nabout the situation we have where we don't have enough money to build \nour highways or to repair our highways. Yes, we are concerned about \nthat and rightfully so. To have a secure nation is more than having a \nlot of bombs and bullets and airplanes and tanks and ships. It is also \nhaving a population that is educated.\n  We sent a letter to Speaker Boehner asking that the Benghazi Select \nCommittee be disbanded. Get rid of it. It is a disgrace. Do the right \nthing; get rid of this.\n  Senate Republicans are stuck in a deep rut. They have dug this hole. \nThey are in it, and they don't know how to get out of it. The \nRepublican leader continues bringing bills to the Senate floor that \nhave no chance of passing. We have things out there we could be doing.\n  Four months ago we said to the Republican leader: Why don't we sit \ndown and try to work something out on this budget for the long term. We \nhave been ignored. They have ignored the need for a consensus budget \nframework and instead are trying to move a flawed appropriations bill \nbased on the Republicans' partisan budget. The Senate spoke and, of \ncourse, the bill didn't advance.\n\n[[Page S7057]]\n\n  The Republican leader tried to move the same measure again last week, \neven though the Senate already rejected it. And to no one's surprise, \nit failed.\n  How about this one? This year--this year--we have already had eight \nvotes on the health of American women--eight votes. Everyone knows how \nthose votes are going to turn out, but you can't satisfy this voracious \nappetite the Republicans have to bash women. Yet the Republican leader \ncontinues to schedule votes on legislation that can't pass the Senate.\n  I think C-SPAN will have to have a disclaimer each time that flips up \nthere that says: This is not a rerun. This is the Republican Senate \ndoing it again. We have already done it seven times. Once more won't \nmatter that much.\n  Today the Republican leader wants to rerun the same show again, this \ntime with another bill--military construction. This appropriations bill \nis still based on the Republican's faulty budget. The senior Senator \nfrom Montana, the ranking member of that subcommittee, said yesterday \nthis bill ``is shackled to an unwise and unrealistic budget that locks \nin destructive sequestration cuts and vastly underfunds programs vital \nto this nation's security and prosperity.''\n  That is what Senator Tester said yesterday.\n  It has no chance of getting 60 votes--none. I know that, and my \nfriend the Republican leader knows that. So why are we wasting time on \nanother vote that is destined to fail? Because they do not want to \nbring real legislation to the floor. Why aren't we spending our time \ncoming to a real bipartisan solution that helps our veterans and helps \nthe nondefense part of our country, which is so important?\n  The time to sit down and to begin real budget negotiations was a long \ntime ago, but we will take it now. I am happy to learn the Republican \nleader said he wants negotiations--he said this a couple days ago--he \nwants negotiations to begin very soon. Well, isn't that nice. Democrats \nhave been waiting for 4 months. So let's get to it.\n  Just imagine what we could have accomplished if the Republican leader \nhad taken us up on our offer 4 months ago. The U.S. Government wouldn't \nhave come within hours of a shutdown, hundreds of government agencies \nwould not have had to spend time and effort preparing for a shutdown, \ndiverting them from their main jobs.\n  If you want to see how close we were to a government shutdown take a \nlook at what took place in the House of Representatives yesterday. We \npassed over here in the Senate a short-term continuing resolution to \nfund the government until December 11. It went to the House, and they \nvoted on it yesterday. Three-fifths of House Republicans--151--voted \nfor a shutdown. They voted against the continuing resolution. That says \nit all.\n  I have reminded people before, and I will do it again. The government \nwas shut down here a couple of years ago for 17 days. We finally got it \nopen. We passed something over here, and it went to the House. Two-\nthirds of the House of Representatives--Republicans in the House--voted \nto keep the government closed.\n  There are so many programs that are just not being taken care of. I \nwill talk about a couple of them right now. There is something I have \nworked on since I came here--the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The \nPresiding Officer is from Nevada. He has represented the northern part \nof the State for many years in different elective jobs. He understands \nand knows Lake Tahoe very well. It is a beautiful lake that we share \nwith California. Well, the Land and Water Conservation Fund helps us \ngreatly because we were able to take some money out of that program and \npurchase land that was going to be used for subdivision that would have \nallowed more filth to go into Lake Tahoe. We were able to stop that \nwith money from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The money hasn't \nbeen coming in as we have wanted in the past, so we beefed it up and \nwere able to do a lot of things.\n  Now, for the first time in 50 years, this program has been allowed to \nexpire. It is gone. This program has been supported by Democrats and \nRepublicans and by rural and urban communities. But on the Republicans' \nwatch, one of the most important programs and one of the best programs \nfor our Nation's parks--and one of the most broadly supported programs \nin the country--has been allowed to lapse. It is gone.\n  The program is funded by a portion of fees collected by offshore oil \nand gas drilling. Every day that it is not authorized, we lose out on \ncollecting $2.4 million of offshore oil and gas so it can be used for \nour beautiful natural resources that are in a state of disrepair. This \nLand and Water Conservation Fund has supported projects in every State, \nfrom protecting the rim of the Grand Canyon to securing access to the \nAppalachian Trail, and from Lake Tahoe to building neighborhood \nplaygrounds in urban areas across the country.\n  In a last-ditch effort to sway their own leadership, several \nRepublicans came to the floor yesterday and tried to pass a stand-alone \nextension of the program that would be dead on arrival in the House. \nThe Republican leaders refused to extend the program in the continuing \nresolution, despite many Democrats and Republicans asking for it to be \nincluded.\n  One other program. The good Senator from Illinois--the senior Senator \nfrom Illinois, the assistant Democratic leader, served in the House of \nRepresentatives, as I did, with a man named Claude Perkins. He was a \nwonderful House Member. When we came to the House in 1982, he was a \nvery senior person. He was responsible for something called the Federal \nPerkins Loan Program. It wasn't reauthorized in the continuing \nresolution. What does that mean? As a result of that, the Nation's \noldest student aid program has expired, leaving up to 150,000 students \nwho are coming into college in the lurch.\n  The Perkins Loan Program offers low-interest, federally subsidized \nstudent loans for students with exceptional financial needs and also \noffers a variety of forgiveness options for those who choose to pursue \npublic service professions. Last year, more than $1.2 billion in new \nPerkins loans were made to about 540,000 new and returning college \nstudents around the country, including 500 low-income students from \nNevada.\n  It is hard to believe the tea party-dominated House--and obviously \nthe Republican Caucus here is heavily influenced by the tea party--has \nturned a blind eye to this. It is hard to believe the tea party-\ndominated House of Representatives passed an extension of Perkins \nunanimously, but Senate Republicans would not agree to do the same. \nYesterday, Senate Republicans even blocked a bid to extend the program.\n  These are just two of the programs that expired at midnight last \nnight. There are many more. It is a shame because they wouldn't have \nexpired at all if we had sat down and negotiated a few months ago. So I \nsay to my friend the Republican leader: Let's not waste another minute \non politically motivated votes that are doomed to fail. Instead, let's \nfocus the Senate's energy and attention on bipartisan negotiations to \nget our country on the right track.\n  Mr. President, would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/01/senate-section/article/S7057-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to speak on the Military \nConstruction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill that is now being \nconsidered. I will start by saying that this is 3601 Gerstner Memorial \nParkway, Lake Charles, LA. This is the location for the new Lake \nCharles VA clinic--a clinic that has taken 13 years to get\n\n[[Page S7058]]\n\napproved, a clinic that has seen delay after delay, costing veterans \naccess to quality health care, a clinic still waiting to be built.\n  This is a picture of the current facility in Lake Charles, where \nveterans have to go for their health care while they have waited for \nover 13 years to have the new facility built. This RV and this small \nbuilding are why Congress must advance this MILCON-VA appropriations \nbill and why the President should sign it into law.\n  This mobile clinic in Lake Charles--you almost laugh--is the clinic \nfor our veterans. It is one of many such clinics in our country and is \nunacceptable. This is something one might see in a documentary about \ndeveloping nations, not the United States of America. This RV, where \nour veterans are treated for serious medical conditions, is connected \nto a waiting room that is triple the size of the square footage of the \nmobile home. That is because the demand for care so greatly exceeds \nthis subpar facility's ability to deliver health care to our veterans.\n  In the waiting room there is a television set, but it is not plugged \nin and it doesn't have a remote. That is because VA rules say you must \nhave a TV in the waiting room, but the rules don't stipulate that it \nmust function. It sounds like a joke. We have to have a television, but \nwe don't say it has to be plugged in.\n  This is the current state of the VA, and this is what Congress is \nallowing when we fail to pass this needed legislation.\n  I would like to say this is an isolated problem but there are \nveterans all over the country receiving health care under similar \ncircumstances. For more than 10 years, our young men and women have \nreturned from war in the Middle East. These young veterans are joining \nmen and women who have served this Nation in uniform, defending our \nfreedom in every corner of the globe. They deserve better than a mobile \nhome. They deserve action, and they deserve it now. If we don't pass \nthis bill, there will be consequences for people--America's heroes--who \nneed help now.\n  This is the VA portion, but it is also the military VA construction \nbudget. If we fail to act, it will not just be our veterans who are \nhurt; it will also affect our Active-Duty military and our national \nsecurity.\n  We know there is a portion of the budget which goes for actually \nprotecting our military construction, but what sometimes people forget \nis there is a human face to our military. Gen. Robert Rand recently \ntook control of Global Strike, a position that is charged with \nmaintaining our nuclear triad and first strike capabilities, but there \nare those in the Air Force who serve under General Rand. He needs the \nresources to maintain our nuclear ability, but without this legislation \nwe cannot maintain his combat readiness, which includes basic needs \nsuch as housing for our soldiers and educating their children.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to consider what is included in this \nlegislation: family housing, schools, medical facilities for Active-\nDuty personnel and their families, and funding for the care of 6.9 \nmillion veterans.\n  Let me add something to this. As a doctor, I am glad we also \nspecifically provide for groundbreaking hepatitis C treatments and for \nmodernizing the VA electronic medical records system.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee passed the Military Construction \nand Veterans Affairs appropriations bill by a bipartisan vote of 12 to \n9, with all Republicans and 5 Democrats voting in favor.\n  This is common sense. Congress has the duty to pass this legislation \nnow, and the President has an obligation to sign it. We must honor our \ncommitment to our military and to our veterans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to support the Military Construction and \nVeterans Affairs appropriations bill.\n  Yesterday, Congress sent the President a continuing resolution, a \nbill to prevent a government shutdown. This was necessary to ensure \nthat vital resources and services the American people depend on do not \nlapse and in order to avoid harm to jobs and our economy. But as my \ncolleagues fully realize, simply putting government on autopilot \nthrough a continuing resolution is not the responsible way to fund \ngovernment. It locks in last year's priorities, delays the start of \nvital new programs, and allows unneeded programs to continue to be \nfunded. We must pass the 12 annual appropriations bills.\n  In July of this year, the Senate Appropriations Committee, on which I \nam privileged to serve, reported the last of the 12 bills. This was the \nfirst time that all 12 of the appropriations bills have been approved \nby the committee, in plenty of time for the Senate to act, since 2009. \nIt is past time for the Senate to take up and pass these funding bills \nso that we can go to conference with our House colleagues and send to \nthe President annual funding bills that reflect our current priorities \nthat benefit the American people.\n  In May of this year--in May--the Senate Appropriations Committee \nreported the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs funding bill by \na strong, bipartisan vote of 21 to 9. As a member of the subcommittee \nwith jurisdiction over this bill, I know this represented bipartisan \nconsensus and hard work. It reflected the leadership of Chairman Kirk \nand Ranking Member Tester.\n  This bill provides vital resources for our veterans and our \nservicemembers. We are operating under very challenging budget \nconstraints, and I support the negotiations that are going on now. But \nit is long past time for the Senate to take up, debate, amend, and pass \neach of these appropriations bills. We have the opportunity to do that \njust now, and I do not understand those who argue that we should not \nproceed with the normal appropriations process.\n  Those who disagree with provisions in this bill will have the \nopportunity to offer amendments to change the bill. But to not even \nallow this vital funding bill for our military and for our veterans to \ncome to the Senate floor is an argument that I do not accept nor \nunderstand.\n  We owe it to our Nation's veterans, 127,000 of whom reside in the \ngreat State of Maine. There are more than 21 million nationwide. We owe \nit to them to move forward with this important bill. These veterans \nanswered the call to duty. They shouldered the hardships and sacrifices \nof military service. They have done their jobs. It is time for the \nSenate to do its job. We must fulfill our obligations and affirm a \nlarger commitment made long ago to take care of those who have so \nproudly served our Nation--the patriots who have worn our Nation's \nuniform.\n  To highlight a few examples of why this bill is so important, let me \nmention that it ensures our veterans have access to critical mental \nhealth care services. It aims to reduce veteran homelessness--a very \nimportant issue to me that I have worked on with Senator Jack Reed as a \nmember of the HUD and transportation appropriations subcommittee--\nanother bill that we need to bring to the Senate floor. This bill \nprovides funding to pay veterans benefits and includes $270 million for \nthe Office of Rural Health, important to the Presiding Officer as well \nas to my State. This office has established the program called the ARCH \nProgram, or Access Received Closer to Home. ARCH ensures that rural \nveterans in the pilot States, who often have a difficult time accessing \nthe regular VA health system, can receive care closer to where they \nlive. This has been a tremendous success in northern Maine, which has \none of the pilot programs in Caribou, ME, in conjunction with Cary \nMemorial Hospital. This has made such a difference to our veterans.\n  I remember one of our veterans telling me about breaking his hip last \nwinter in the height of a terrible winter storm. Instead of enduring a \npainful and bumpy ride for more than 4 hours to get to the VA hospital \nin Augusta, he was able, through the ARCH Program, to receive care at \nhis local hospital, Cary Memorial in Caribou, ME. He also had the \nbenefit of being able to receive care closer to where his family and \nfriends were.\n  The programs that I just mentioned, like so many that are contained \nwithin the Military Construction-VA appropriations bill, are essential \nto ensuring that veterans who have placed their lives on the line for \nour continued safety receive the benefits they have\n\n[[Page S7059]]\n\nearned. This bill is essential to providing updated military housing \nand other construction upon which those who are serving today depend.\n  It is simply irresponsible for us not to proceed with consideration \nof this and every other appropriations bill. They are ready. They have \nbeen reported by committee. Let's do our job. We must do our best to \nhonor those who serve, and who have served, and who have sacrificed so \nmuch for our country. Surely--surely--the Senate should do its part. We \nshould do our part by promptly passing this important bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish to commend the distinguished \nSenator from Maine. She has articulately explained why we need to move \nforward, and I want to underscore something that she said.\n  For 6 years now, the Senate has abdicated its responsibility to \nappropriate. We have left the prioritization of spending to faceless \nbureaucrats and faceless buildings in Washington, DC. The needs of our \nveterans and soldiers and our country have gone unheeded, while we in \nhere have argued about things that are superfluous and actually \nunimportant.\n  I came into this Chamber today and listened to the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada, the minority leader, make the following statement: \nHe can't understand why the leader would bring forward a ``can't-pass'' \npiece of legislation and not go to something more important.\n  I want the Senator from Nevada to go out to Walter Reed Hospital or \nto go to the hospital in Maine or the hospital in Arkansas and tell \nthose soldiers, who sacrificed and risked their lives for us, that \ntheir needs for health care are not more important, or to tell Jim \nWebb, who was a Member of this Senate and passed the GI bill expansion \na few years ago, that the educational benefits for dependents, \nchildren, wives, and others are not that important. Tell the people of \nthe United States of America that those who protect us, those who have \nsacrificed, those at risk are not more important.\n  There is nothing more important than our veterans and our military. \nThere is nothing more important in our constitutional responsibility as \nSenators than to appropriate the money of the American people. We are \nabdicating our responsibility. It is professional and political \nmalpractice, and it is time it stopped. I get sick and tired of the \npolitical bantering back and forth when there are things come before us \nthat must be done.\n  As chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, last Thursday night \nin this Senate we passed unanimously--and it has now passed the House--\na total reform of VA construction, and we fixed the Denver hospital \nproblem that has been going on for 6 years in the VA. The Denver \nhospital has had a 428.3 percent cost overrun. That is unconscionable \nand that is wrong. But we finally are fixing it.\n  With this bill--if the distinguished minority leader will let us take \nup this important bill, rather than something that is not as \nimportant--we are going to fix VA construction forever because what \nthis does is to say that the VA no longer is in charge of construction \nof hospitals and clinics. The Corps of Engineers is. It is about time \nwe had construction management by people who know what they are doing. \nDoctors are good at fixing people, but they are not very good at bricks \nand mortar. We need the bricks and mortar people doing it.\n  Secondly, this bill funds mandatory veterans' benefits through 2017. \nWe had a threat of a government shutdown yesterday. Fortunately, we \navoided it, but we have had it in the past, and we could have it again. \nVeterans health care should never be shut down, and we need to continue \nto forward-fund medical benefits so our veterans know--whether or not \nwe are foolish and shut down the government--that their health care is \ngoing to be met.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, in the great State of South Dakota--\nand Senator Collins knows from Maine--the biggest complaint we get is \nabout the lack of timely responsibility in determining disability \nclaims in the VA; right? We have veterans waiting 478 days to get a \ndisability claim on an injury they suffered fighting a war for us--478 \ndays, almost 2 years. That is terribly wrong. This bill fixes that. It \nprovides the money for the personnel necessary to expedite disability \nclaims so veterans get a timely judgment.\n  Now you tell me this, Senator from Nevada: What is more important, \ntaking care of these guys taking care of us or just debating on the \nSenate floor a bunch of hot air that means no difference to the \nAmerican people?\n  It is time we fished or cut bait. It is time we did what we were \nelected to. It is time we set the priorities. It is time we honored our \ncommitment to those who honored their commitment to us, the veterans of \nthe United States of America.\n  So as chairman of the most bipartisan committee in the Senate, the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee--of which the Presiding Officer is a \nmember--we don't have Democratic spats and Republican spats. We talk \nabout our veterans. Almost everything we pass out is unanimous. We do \nso because we all agree that--Republican or Democrat, black or white, \nrich or poor, whatever the case might be--we would not be where we are \ntoday nor would we be what we are today if it weren't for those who \nsacrificed, risked their lives, and, in some cases, died for the people \nof the United States of America while serving in the military.\n  So I don't know what the Senator from Nevada thinks is more \nimportant. But for me, these guys right here are the most important \nthing in the world. And to vote against proceeding to debate this \nimportant appropriations bill is professional malpractice and wrong. I \nhope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will make a commitment to \nthose who served us and vote to proceed to the VA-MILCON appropriations \nbill.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, yesterday Congress passed yet another \nshort-term continuing resolution. While this avoids a shutdown, it is \nfar from ideal. Certainly a shutdown is not good governing. I think all \nof us can agree on that much. I wish to remind my colleagues, though--\nparticularly those on the other side of the aisle--that continuing \nresolutions are hardly better. While the American people demand that we \nget our financial house in order, Washington continues to pass stopgap \nafter stopgap funding bills. Instead of tackling this challenge head-\non, these short-term extensions continue current funding levels and \nprevent us from stopping waste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayer dollars. \nJust like a shutdown, this, too, is no way to govern. There is another \noption. We don't have to choose between a continuing resolution and a \nshutdown. The third choice is the right choice, and that choice is for \nthis Chamber to follow regular order and pass all 12 appropriations \nbills.\n  We have done our work at the Appropriations Committee. For the first \ntime in 6 years, every spending bill has cleared committee--all 12--and \nmost of them passed with strong bipartisan support. I commend the \nAppropriations Chairman Cochran and Leader McConnell for their \nleadership to make that happen.\n  The full Senate has the responsibility to consider each of these \nbills as well. Leader McConnell is committed to this approach. Our \ncaucus is behind it 100 percent. The minority, on the other hand, is \nactively working against it. Committee passage of these 12 bills was no \neasy task. Both sides made compromises. These bills were the product of \na great deal of give-and-take.\n  We worked very hard for months to ensure that these bills reflect the \nspending and policy priorities that are right for our Nation. These \nbills should not simply be left for dead. The President is encouraging \nthe Senate Democrats to obstruct the appropriations process because he \nwants more domestic spending for agencies like the EPA and IRS. This is \nnot the direction our country needs to go. I hope my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle will reconsider this failed strategy.\n  The funding bills show the American people that we share their \npriorities. For instance, the bill before us takes care of our Active \nMilitary and our veterans when they return home. Clearly this is an \narea of bipartisan agreement. Yet talk of a filibuster remains.\n\n[[Page S7060]]\n\n  Here is what the minority is considering filibustering: increases in \nfunding for veterans services, military housing and family support, \nhospital and health facilities construction, just to name a few vital \nthings in this bill. The bill increases funding in areas where our \nveterans need it most--health care, benefit claims processing, and \nmedical research. It also includes funding for projects to ensure \nmilitary readiness and improve the quality of life for military \nfamilies. In light of the numerous scandals that have plagued the VA, \nit includes some strong policy reforms such as protection for \nwhistleblowers.\n  These are funding and policy priorities for both sides of the aisle. \nThat is why this bill passed out of the Appropriations Committee with \nstrong bipartisan support. That is why it should move forward without \nresistance on the Senate floor. Yet the minority is threatening a \nfilibuster for reasons that have nothing to do with this bill. This is \nall about protecting the President's agenda.\n  President Obama wants spending increases across the board. He has \nissued a blanket veto threat for any appropriations bill that does not \nmeet his demands. Basically, the President's view is that if such \nagencies don't get more money, then neither should our veterans or \nmilitary families. It is my hope my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle recognize this is out of line with our Nation's priorities.\n  The right thing to do is reject the President's call to obstruct so \nwe can continue to work together for the good of the country. \nDetermining how we allocate taxpayer dollars is our responsibility, not \nthe President's. Continuing resolutions have been all too common, while \nthey should be a rare exception. We need to reestablish our priority of \nregular order and pass the individual funding bills that are needed to \nkeep the government open. We can start that today and by moving the \nMilitary Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, we heard from many Members talking about \nthe situation with the appropriations bill, and I would like to add my \nvoice to the chorus. For too long uncertainty has hampered our Nation's \nability to grow our economy and make necessary investments in our \nworkforce, our infrastructure, and our technology. It was imperative \nthat we avoided an unnecessary and reckless government shutdown this \nweek, but that was a short-term patch. Now more than ever we need to \ntake longer term actions to move our economy and our Nation forward.\n  As the Senator from Arkansas mentioned, earlier this year the \nAppropriations Committee, on which I sit, accomplished something that \nhas not been done since 2009. We passed all 12 appropriations bills \nthrough the full committee. We did so in a fiscally responsible way. We \ndid so within the budget caps agreed to by the Congress. Many of us \nvoted for those budget caps. We did so with broad-based bipartisan \nsupport; 9 of the 12 bills had broad-based bipartisan support. These \nbills touch every aspect of government and every facet of our economy. \nFrom transportation, medical research, energy investments to justice \nprograms, these funding bills were robustly debated.\n  Knowing all this, why are the Democrats blocking the Senate from \nconsidering one of these single appropriations bills? Earlier this week \nit was the Defense appropriations. Today it is the MILCON-VA. Why? Why \nare they blocking these same bills that many of them have previously \nvoted for in committee and touted to their constituents?\n  Last week I had the privilege of traveling across West Virginia with \nVA Secretary McDonald. We heard directly from veterans about their \nchallenges and needs. One of the things we discussed was the Greenbrier \nCounty community-based outpatient clinic that had been closed. \nSecretary McDonald made a commitment, with over 200 veterans that we \nhad in the room from that area, that that clinic would reopen quickly, \nbut without the certainty of the funding that we have in these bills, \nSecretary McDonald cannot make those assertions across the country. We \nwent to the Huntington VA Hospital, where we met with employees and \nveterans--committed individuals who want to see our veterans treated \nthe way we want them to be treated, but the advances in medical \ntechnologies can't move forward without a certainty of what the funding \nlevels are.\n  These men and women, our brave veterans, deserve our unified support \nand should not be subjected to the gridlock that has been so common in \nthese past few years. The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs \nbill funds construction and care for facilities and services that \nassist our military veterans. It improves facilities for men and women \nwho are willing to sacrifice for our freedoms. I will say, many of our \nVA facilities are challenged with approximately 20 percent of women \nveterans who are coming out. They don't have facilities to adequately \ntreat our women veterans. This bill also includes funding for \nconstruction of State extended-care facilities, which helps construct, \nexpand, and remodel nursing home facilities to care for our elderly \nveterans. We know many of our veterans are aging in larger and larger \nnumbers.\n  Determining our Nation's spending priorities, especially when it \ncomes to our veterans, is one of Congress's most important \nresponsibilities. Our process can work and our government can function. \nWe demonstrated that at the committee level. We need to demonstrate \nthat as well today on the floor of the Senate, but make no mistake \nabout this, this is not just about process; it is also about progress. \nFunding bills are not just numbers on paper; they are people. They are \nour veterans. They are our friends and neighbors, our fathers and \nmothers, our sons and daughters. They represent the priorities of our \nNation.\n  There are other things in the appropriations bills that are equally \nimportant. We passed out historic investments in NIH and community \nhealth centers. We passed out critical infrastructure improvements from \nexpanding broadband access to trying to help with the drug epidemic. \nYou cannot measure the impact of programs like the National Guard \nCounterdrug Program, which is helping to combat the spread of illegal \ndrugs in our State, or the work of the Appalachian Regional Commission \nwhich helps to improve the lives of so many. Endless continuing \nresolutions are not the most effective ways to meet these needs and can \nbe proved wasteful in both time and dollars. Our bills provide critical \nfunding, but they also provide direction on significant policy matters \nthat are facing this Nation.\n  When we operate from one short-term funding patch to the other, we as \nMembers of Congress are forfeiting our responsibility to hold the \nexecutive branch accountable. Advancing appropriations bills through \nregular order is a vital check on wasteful spending and overreach in \nour government agencies.\n  We need to work together. We can start that today, and I hope we will \nlater this afternoon. These are broad goals, and the goals are shown in \nthose bills. As the Senate begins consideration of funding for Military \nConstruction and Veterans Affairs, we should remember this: Governing \nis about setting priorities and bringing fiscal responsibility to the \nFederal Government, while ensuring that we provide for the necessary \ninvestments and services. Supporting our veterans is not only \nnecessary, it is about the men and women who put their lives on the \nline for us so we can enjoy the freedoms we have here today. West \nVirginia is a very patriotic State, with one of the highest percentages \nof military veterans. I want to see that they are cared for properly. I \nam going to make that vote today. I hope my colleagues--the ones who \nare on the Appropriations Committee who have already voted in favor of \nthis bill--will convince their colleagues on the other side that \ngridlock and obstructionism is not the way to go in the Senate. It is \ntime to work across the aisle to pass this bill and support our \nveterans. Doing so will strengthen our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S7061]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Capito). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/01/senate-section/article/S7061-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SENTENCING REFORM\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, there are many stories written in the \nlast months about the dysfunction of Congress, why can't they get \nalong, why can't they produce something, why can't they address the \nissues and challenges of our time. It is easy to get into that mindset \nand believe that something has happened on Capitol Hill that cannot be \nrepaired. For those who are about to give up hope, I hope they are \nreflecting on what I left just a few moments ago. It was a press \nconference held up in the radio and TV Senate gallery.\n  Attending this press conference were Senator Chuck Grassley, who is \nthe chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee; Senator John Cornyn, \nthe Republican whip; Senator Mike Lee of Utah; and Senator Tim Scott. \nOn the Democratic side: Senator Patrick Leahy, the ranking Democrat on \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee; Senator Corey Booker of New Jersey, a \nrelatively new Member of the Senate; Senator Sheldon Whitehouse; and \nSenator Chuck Schumer.\n  We were there to announce what we think is a historic achievement, a \nhistoric agreement. We have been working now for years, literally for \nyears, on both sides of the aisle to make significant and meaningful \ncriminal sentencing reform and reform to the corrections system of the \nUnited States of America. On that stage, from Mike Lee to Pat Leahy and \nDick Durbin, was the entire political spectrum of the Senate. Within \nthat spectrum, there are a lot of differences of opinion. There were \ntimes a year ago that I did not think that meeting and that \nannouncement would take place.\n  But today we came together, on a bipartisan basis, to announce that \nwe had reached an agreement, a historic agreement, on the Sentencing \nReform and Corrections Act of 2015. We knew we had a problem in \nAmerica, a problem of incarceration. A nation with 5 percent of the \nworld's population has 25 percent of the world's prison population. \nWhat is going on in America? Why are so many people in prison, and has \nit made us any safer? We asked those hard questions and came up with \nwhat we think is a good response.\n  We took a category of crime, drug use, that does not involve violence \nor a gun or gang activity and said: We are going to give to the judge \nin that case, that category of cases, more flexibility when it comes to \nsentencing. The minimum mandatory requirements can be changed by the \njudge based on the defendant before him, the crime they committed, and \nwhat that judge believes to be the best for our society.\n  It is such a change. For the longest time, years and decades, our \ngoal was to incarcerate as many as possible, and we did, some of them \nfor extraordinarily unfair and unjust periods of time. The worst vote--\nthe worst vote I ever cast as a Member of Congress was in the House. It \ngoes back more than 20 years ago. A basketball player at the University \nof Maryland named Len Bias died from a drug overdose. We were called on \nto stiffen the penalties for crack cocaine in America and we did, \ndramatically: 100 to 1 for crack cocaine versus sentencing for powdered \ncocaine--100 to 1. The net result of that in several decades of \nsentencing was to send away primarily African Americans for incredibly \nlong sentences. Eugenia Jennings of Alton, IL, a teenage mother and a \ncrack addict was selling crack cocaine, a handful of it, to buy clothes \nand food for her children. It was her third offense.\n  When she was convicted, the mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines \ngave Judge Patrick Murphy no choice but to hand down a sentence of 23 \nyears in prison. Judge Murphy said at the time: This country, this \ngovernment, has done nothing for you, Ms. Jennings, through your \ntortured life, and now at this moment in life we are going to kick you \nhard.\n  The judge knew it was the wrong sentence. Fortunately, Eugenia \nJennings' sentence was commuted after a dozen years. She was released \nfrom prison to be with her children, only for a short time. She passed \naway from cancer. But that is just one statistic, one story, and it can \nbe repeated thousands of times.\n  This bill tries to avoid that type of injustice. We were not going to \nbe a safer State, a safer nation if she served 23 years instead of 12. \nIt made no sense. So we address it with this bill. With this bill, we \ngo after a new approach in sentencing on this narrow category of \ncrimes, which we believe can result in many serving shorter sentences.\n  Secondly, for those who are still in prison subject to that 100-to-1 \nratio on sentencing, we give 6,500 inmates in the Federal prison system \na chance to petition for reconsideration of their sentence on an \nindividual basis, so they can be judged by judges, prosecutors, and \npeople in the community as to whether their sentence should be changed.\n  So this, in a way, is a sweeping bill when it comes to the population \nof our prisons. I believe--many agree--it would be far better to take \nthe $25,000, $30,000, $35,000 a year it costs to house an inmate and \nput it instead into community policing, making our neighborhoods safer, \ngiving our prosecutors the resources they need to not only come down \nwith the right sentences but variations in sentencing like drug courts, \nveterans courts, and things that are working around America which will \nmake us safer at a lower cost. We will have more money available to the \nDepartment of Justice and across the board to go after the seriously \nthreatening criminals we still have in America whom we can never ever \nignore.\n  Senator Cornyn and Senator Whitehouse took a look at those in prison \nto determine ways they could earn an earlier release or better terms of \nrelease. They did extraordinary work. Senator Corey Booker of New \nJersey stepped in on an issue that all of us who serve with him know he \nfeels so passionately about, the African-American incarceration rate \nand particularly the impact it has on young people in that part of our \npopulation. He made some valuable contributions to this bill.\n  It is our hope we can bring this bill to the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee soon. Senator Grassley gave his word that would happen, \nand then bring it to the floor and send it to the House.\n\n  For those who say, ``What is going to happen over there, with all of \nthe changes taking place?'' I would make one observation: Our spectrum \nof political support for the bill we had at the press conference \nrepresents the spectrum in the House as well. All of us came together. \nAll of them can come together too. They may not agree with every word \nin this bill. Having served in the House, I am sure they won't. But if \nthey will make the same good-faith effort at finding reasonable \ncompromise, then we can reach a historic achievement, a historic \noutcome in this process.\n  I wish to commend one member of my staff in particular who has \ndevoted more hours than I could ever count to make this a reality. His \nname is Joe Zogby. He is my lead counsel on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. Time and time again, Joe Zogby has performed so \nprofessionally and with such determination, from my point of view and I \nam sure from other Senators' points of view. We wouldn't be here today \nif we didn't have staffers like Joe who have given so much of their \ntime and their heartfelt dedication to finding a solution to an \nAmerican problem.\n  So before we walk away from the Congress and say there is no hope, \ntake a look at this bill and this effort. This is how the Senate is \nsupposed to work. This is how the House is supposed to work. It is how \nCongress is supposed to work. It is how America expects us to work.\n  The President is anxious for us to come up with this work product. \nLet's not disappoint him and the millions of Americans who count on us \nto solve the problems facing America.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/01/senate-section/article/S7061-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7061-S7062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          9/11 HEALTH PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise today to mark a sad occasion. \nYesterday, parts of the Zadroga 9/11 Health\n\n[[Page S7062]]\n\nand Compensation Act expired. Specifically, the authorization of the 9/\n11 health program--one of the two critical programs in the Zadroga \nact--came to an end last night and will have to start winding down. \nThankfully, Dr. Howard and his team, who run the program, have \nresponsibly managed their funding, so they can continue to support \nhealth services and benefits for several months on into the future, \nperhaps another year.\n  To be clear, our brave heroes are still able to get health care from \nthis program today. That fact, however, should diminish in no way our \nresponsibility in Congress to reauthorize the program as quickly as \npossible and permanently--forever. In truth, it is a black mark on a \nCongress that the program was ever allowed to expire, regardless of its \nability to continue operations in the short term.\n  The firefighters, police men and women, construction workers, and \nfirst responders from 9/11--many of them injured, many of them sick--\ntraveled to Washington a few weeks ago to lobby Congress, to petition \ntheir representatives and their government to continue supporting basic \nhealth services they need to treat cancers, respiratory ailments, and \nother illnesses directly linked to 9/11.\n  I wish to thank my colleague from New York, Senator Gillibrand, for \nher valued work on this issue. It has been a passion for her. She took \nthe torch Hillary Clinton first lit when she was here as Senator and \nhas run with it hard and well. I am proud to be her partner in trying \nto make sure that Zadroga, in both its parts, is extended permanently.\n  People would think it would be easy to get this done considering all \nthe legislators who say they will never forget, who make promises each \nanniversary to honor the heroes of 9/11. We should not need them to \nwalk the Halls of Congress to win support for basic services for those \nwho walked undaunted through dust, fire, rubble, and ash, who risked \ntheir lives to save their fellow citizens. The first responders who ran \nto the smoldering towers on 9/11 are just like our veterans--they \nvolunteered and risked their lives for our safety. These folks didn't \nhave to do this. They volunteered. They knew the dangers, but they care \nabout our safety. We should not forget them.\n  But their voices and the impassioned advocacy of folks like John Feal \nand Jon Stewart have had a real impact. On September 16, when these \nfirst responders visited Congress, the majority leader graciously said \nhe would meet with them personally and said: ``We do plan to extend the \nprogram and the committees . . . in the House and the Senate are \nactually working on the details now.'' It was a real breakthrough.\n  The first responders who pled their case, the advocates who supported \nthem each step of the way, and champions in Congress such as Senator \nGillibrand here and Representatives Nadler and Maloney in the House, \nwho passionately led the fight for this bill for years now, deserve \nmuch of the credit. They are the reason we have so many cosponsors--56 \nhere in the Senate, including 12 Republicans. I wish to thank the \nPresiding Officer for being one of those recent cosponsors.\n  That is why I was so troubled to hear earlier this week, when again \nasked if the Senate would consider the extension of the Zadroga act \nbefore the deadline, the majority leader said he would ``have to check \nand get back on that.''\n  When the towers were hit, the firefighters and the EMS workers and \ncops who rushed into those burning buildings did not stop and say ``I \nhave to check on that and get back to you.'' When the towers came down \nand there was a hellhole of twisted steel and smoldering plasterboard, \nwith our brothers and sisters trapped within, the smell of burning \nflesh still in the air--I was there; I vividly remember it--and \nthousands with anguished faces holding signs that said ``Did you see my \nmother, Mary? Have you seen my brother, Bob?'' because people didn't \nknow where people were--maybe they were still alive but trapped in the \nsmoldering towers--the first responders so bravely rushed in to see if \nthey could save any lives. They did not say ``I have to check on that \nand get back to you.'' No, they rushed right to the towers. They rushed \nin even before they were asked. They did their duty. They did more than \ntheir duty. Many died. Many more are suffering. We don't need to check \non things and get back to them. We need to write the check to fund \ntheir health care for the injuries they sustained in selfless service \nto their Nation when we were under attack by a foreign enemy. Period. \nEnd of story.\n  So what changed so much over the course of 2 weeks? When the first \nresponders were here in DC, the majority leader committed to passing \nthe legislation they need and so richly deserve for their heroism. A \nfew weeks later, when the eyes of the world aren't watching quite so \nclosely, he said: I will have to check and get back.\n  I would plead with the majority leader to help move this legislation \nforward and move it forward quickly. Let's not have to have these first \nresponders, many of whom have all kinds of cancers they acquired on \nthose fatal days after 9/11, come back here again and again. Let the \ndoctors who are bravely working for the program not have to worry \nwhether they will have a job. And let the program itself, which has \nbeen done without an iota of fraud--all the claims of ``Let's do it for \n5 years because we are not sure it will work''--those are the things we \nnegotiated, Senator Gillibrand and I with Senator Coburn--those worries \nare gone. It is working exquisitely well, and there has not been an \niota of fraud or misspent money.\n  So we shouldn't have to check on it; we should just move forward. I \nplead, plead, plead with our majority leader, who was genuinely moved \nby the first responders when he met them, to make sure the bill moves \nforward. And let me say the same to the new leaders--whoever they may \nbecome--in the new House, in the new elections that are coming.\n  We cannot leave these heroes in limbo. We cannot leave them wondering \nif their health program, now expired, will be there for them if and \nwhen they get sick. As John Stewart said so well, cancer doesn't \nexpire.\n  I only ask one thing this morning--one thing: that the majority \nleader and the Speaker honor their commitments to put this bill on the \nfloor of both Houses. I implore them to move quickly to pass the \nZadroga 9/11 health reauthorization act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/01/senate-section/article/S7062-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 2029, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 98, H.R. 2029, a bill \n     making appropriations for military construction, the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I am here this morning to speak about \nthe issue that is before this body, the motion to proceed to H.R. 2029, \nor what we refer to as the MILCON-VA appropriations bill.\n  I certainly intend to support closing off debate on this and moving \nto take up this important appropriations measure. This is important for \na host of different reasons, not the least of which is that we need to \nget to the substance of this issue. We need to get back to a regular \norder process in order to advance the appropriations bills that we on \nthe Appropriations Committee have spent a considerable amount of time \nand effort drafting.\n\n[[Page S7063]]\n\n  Over these past many months, we have worked to make sure that the \nbills were ready for floor consideration. We didn't want to find \nourselves in a situation where, at the end of this year, we scramble to \npiece together an omnibus measure that has not had the considered \ndebate and opportunity for amendment that I believe we all seek as \nlawmakers. It is important that we consider the Military Construction-\nVA bill in regular order and do it now--not stick it on the back end of \nanother measure, not incorporate it into an omnibus bill or into some \nfashion of a CR omnibus right before Christmas.\n  I serve on the Appropriations Committee. I had input into this bill \nat the subcommittee level and again at the full committee markup, which \nis a lot more than can be said of many of my colleagues in this body \nwho don't have that opportunity since they are not on the \nAppropriations Committee. But even after having the input that I have \nhad, it is extraordinarily important that I have another opportunity to \ninfluence the bill, and I will illustrate why.\n  I am going to speak about one very specific issue today that has \ngarnered the attention, concern, and passion of Alaskans and veterans \naround the State, and that is the issue surrounding the Veterans Choice \nCard.\n  In the view of many Alaskans, the Veterans Choice Card is an \nunmitigated disaster in our State, and there are many reasons that is \nthe case. We don't host a stand-alone VA hospital in Alaska. So the VA \nhas issued a Choice Card to every veteran in the State who is enrolled \nfor health care. In order to use the Choice Card, you have to identify \na provider that is willing to accept the card, qualifies under the very \nonerous Choice Card standards, and is also willing to put up with the \nbureaucratic strings that are attached to determining which care is \napproved by the VA over what period of time and for what price.\n  In Alaska, we have a demand for health care providers that far \noutstrips the supply, and I have been on the floor many times speaking \non that subject. We have many Alaskans that have private health \ninsurance which pays the providers better, and it is certainly more \nefficient than the government-sponsored programs.\n  Structurally, the way the Veterans Choice Card Program is currently \ndesigned, it does not provide Alaska's veterans with the choices that \nit promises. It is just as simple as that, and those are just the \nstructural problems we are talking about. Many of our colleagues know \nthat TriWest has encountered difficulties with implementing the \nprogram, and the VA has had trouble coordinating TriWest's work with \nthe work of the local VA facilities. Unfortunately, these problems have \nled to some dangerous near-misses.\n\n  We had one situation with a veteran who was scheduled for a fee-basis \nneurosurgery. He was going to receive this care from a community \nprovider in the State. Then he was told by the VA that the VA had \nchanged its mind. They were not going to sign off on paying for the \ncare. The vet was told to call TriWest. The TriWest call center \noperator gave the veteran a list of behavioral health providers who had \nsigned up to accept the Choice Card. The call center operator didn't \nknow that neurosurgery is not the same as behavioral health. By the \ntime the VA had reversed itself, the neurosurgery that the veteran had \ninitially scheduled was no longer available. The vet had to wait for \none to become available.\n  What happened in the interim? They gave the veteran pain medicine.\n  In another case, we had a veteran sent to Seattle for a course of \nradiation therapy, and in the middle of this course of radiation \ntherapy the vet was told to return home because his authorization had \nexpired. He was told: The authorization has expired. Go home.\n  It is not as if he could just get in a car and drive 20 minutes back \nto his house. He had been sent to Seattle from a rural community in \nSoutheast Alaska for the care--for the radiation therapy. They said: Go \nhome. Your authorization has expired.\n  So there was a whole series of exchanges with TriWest and then with \nthe VA itself. The vet began, basically, calling family members to tell \nthem he was coming home to die and to start making funeral \npreparations. This is not how we treat our veterans.\n  Now the Veterans Choice legislation provided that the Choice Card \nprogram does not displace any of the existing VA purchased care \nprograms. It explicitly supplemented those programs, which for us in \nAlaska would be a good thing. In Alaska, the VA--and this was under \nSecretary Shinseki's leadership--established two purchased care \nprograms to address gaps in VA capacity in Alaska. One of the programs \nprovided for partnerships with our tribal health system to care for our \nvets in more remote areas of the State where the VA simply doesn't have \na presence. It was innovative. It was innovative at the time, and these \npartnerships worked. They really did help to facilitate the care. The \nother program called ``Care Closer to Home'' enabled the VA to purchase \ncare from community providers in the State who performed medical \nservices that the VA didn't offer--services such as neurosurgery and \nspecialized forms of radiation therapy.\n  Before this program was implemented, the VA forced veterans to fly to \nSeattle or other parts of the country for services that we would \nconsider pretty routine. You have a 1,000-mile-plus flight to Seattle \nfor an orthopedic appointment or for a neurosurgery appointment. This \nis what we are putting our veterans through. Imagine you are 70 years \nold, 80 years old, and you are told to go take a flight for 3\\1/2\\ \nhours to Seattle--get yourself to the hospital just for an orthopedic \nappointment. By the time the veteran is at this place and needs that \nappointment, you are not feeling well in the first place.\n  I have talked and written before about a veteran on the Kenai \nPeninsula who died while fighting with the VA over urology care. He \ncouldn't travel to Anchorage, which is about a 3-hour drive, much less \nto Seattle where the VA wanted to send him because he was in very frail \ncondition, but the VA refused to purchase his care on the Kenai \nPeninsula where there are facilities that could have helped him. I \nthink we would all agree that when our elderly veterans are in perhaps \ntheir final months of life, they have got a lot better things to do \nthan fight with the VA and the bureaucracy.\n  When the VA came to the hearings before the appropriations \nsubcommittee, I asked them pointblank whether the implementation of the \nVeterans Choice Card would adversely affect the existing purchased care \nprograms in Alaska, whether it is through IHS or further specialized \ncare, and the answer was clear. There was no nuance; there was no \ndoubt. The answer was no, it is not going to impact negatively the \npurchased care program. When the Senate Appropriations Committee marked \nup the MILCON-VA bill on May 21, the VA hadn't changed its answer. It \nis not going to negatively impact, they said.\n  Then a week later, on May 28, I happened to be visiting the VA \nfacility in Anchorage, and I learned there that the VA had spent all of \nits fiscal year 2015 purchased care money and was planning to suspend \nits relationships with community providers and the Alaska tribal health \nsystem.\n  I had gone to the VA center to get an update, to check in with the \nnew docs who were there and to see how things were going. It was \nbasically a checkup with the folks at VA, and they laid this bombshell. \nThey weren't trying to be coy with me or hide the ball. They had just \nlearned themselves. I don't know who was in greater shock, me or the \nfolks there at the VA and their military partners.\n  We were also in a situation where there were a lot of rumors that the \nVA was going to pull out of the Joint Venture Hospital that it shares \nwith the Air Force on the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. Again, this \nwas a bombshell of news. Now we know that the VA was not just out of \npurchased care money, it was out of money to operate its health care \nsystem, and without the emergency infusion of money we provided from \nthe Choice Act fund before August recess, the VA would have run out of \nmoney before we had come back from the August recess.\n  It was a situation that was a mess. We fixed the mess for 2015 but \ndid nothing for 2016.\n  What does the VA's failure to properly project the cost of purchased \ncare in 2015 mean for its fiscal year 2016 appropriations? After asking \nthe VA on several occasions, I am left with the impression that the VA \nonce again will\n\n[[Page S7064]]\n\nrun out of money for purchased care and then will remedy this situation \nby shoving veterans who are seeking care under the Choice Card whether \nthe care is meaningfully available or not. So we have been pushing the \nVA on this, and to Secretary McDonald's credit, he came to Alaska this \nsummer. The Undersecretary for Health, Dr. Shulkin, visited Alaska. \nThey weren't sheltered from the anger that our vets were feeling.\n  My colleague Senator Sullivan conducted an incredible field hearing \nto create a record of how the VA, TriWest, and the Choice Card Program \nwere individually and collectively failing Alaska's veterans. But \nhere's the problem. We don't have a fiscal year 2016 solution locked \ndown, and we may not have an acceptable solution locked down by \nVeterans Day, either.\n  Without an opportunity to debate the fiscal year 2016 appropriations \nbill on the floor, I have limited opportunity to press this point, to \ndemand that the GAO investigate what actually is going on and try to \namend the bill to ensure that the VA has adequate purchased care money \navailable so that it doesn't drop these veterans through the cracks \nwhen it can't serve their critical care issues, and neither can the \nChoice Card program. Without the opportunity to debate in regular \norder, I can't do what the people of Alaska have asked me to do in \nrepresenting them the way I know that we need to in order to deal with \nthis.\n  I hear what the Democratic leader is saying, that the Budget Control \nAct needs to be addressed, but I don't agree with the tradeoff that we \ncannot consider appropriations bills in regular order while \nconversations are ongoing to address the bigger, broader question. \nFailing to consider these bills in regular order corrodes the influence \nof this body; it corrodes the ability of Members to fulfill the \nresponsibilities that we have to the people that we work for. These are \nissues.\n  Again, I chose to focus my comments this morning on one area within \nthe MILCON-VA, on that implementation of the Choice Card in Alaska, and \nhow it has so basically failed our veterans. But there is so much more. \nAgain, if we don't have that opportunity to bring it up, to offer our \namendments, to do our best to serve the needs of our veterans, we fail \nthem. We fail the system.\n  I do hope we will have the opportunity this afternoon to advance to \nthese important measures. Remember, this is just the first of 12. It is \nvery important work that we have in front of us.\n  Madam President, I know my colleague from Connecticut has arrived on \nthe floor, but before I yield the floor to him, I want to briefly \nmention a meeting that I had this morning in my office.\n\n\n     Welcoming Members of The Anchorage Fire Department Honor Guard\n\n  Madam President, I was able to welcome members of the Anchorage Fire \nDepartment Honor Guard to my office. They are making their way to \nEmmitsburg, MD, to be part of a ceremony at the National Fallen \nFirefighters Memorial, where they will pay tribute to and honor the \nfirefighters who have given their lives in the line of duty during the \nyear 2014.\n\n\n                        Remembering Jeff Bayless\n\n  The firefighter whom Alaska is recognizing and honoring is a \ngentleman by the name of Jeff Bayless. He died at the age of 51 on \nMarch 7, 2014, during a strenuous training exercise in Anchorage.\n  How Jeff Bayless lived his life as a fourth-generation Alaskan, and \nas one who had not only a love for the outdoors but a love and care for \npeople, is something that we want to pay tribute to, and we want to \nhonor and recognize him.\n  This weekend, on the campus of the National Fire Academy in \nEmmitsburg, MD, the name of fallen Anchorage firefighter Jeffery Edward \nBayless will be inscribed on the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial. \nA total of 87 firefighters will be honored, and 84 of those \nfirefighters, including Jeff, gave their lives in the line of duty \nduring 2014. Three died in previous years. This week, I welcome members \nof the Anchorage Fire Department Honor Guard to my office, as they make \ntheir way to Emmitsburg to celebrate Jeff's life and his contributions \nto the fire service.\n  I wanted to reflect for a moment on the life of fire hero Jeff \nBayless. Jeff died at age 51 on March 7, 2014, during a strenuous \ntraining exercise in Anchorage. Heroes are remembered for the way they \nlived their lives and this is how we should remember Jeff Bayless.\n  Jeff was a fourth generation Alaskan. He grew up in Copper Center, \nattended Alaska Bible College in Glennallen, and then became a \nparamedic through the Oregon Health Sciences University training \nprogram. Jeff was also trained as a Registered Nurse. After serving as \na paramedic in Oregon, he returned to Alaska to work as a first \nresponder in Matanuska-Susitna Borough. Ultimately he found his home at \nthe Anchorage Fire Department, first as a paramedic and then as a \nfirefighter. He excelled in both roles. Working his way up the ranks, \nJeff was a Senior Captain at the time of his passing.\n  As would be expected of a fourth generation Alaskan, Jeff had a love \nfor the out of doors. From an early age, Jeff put his mastery of the \noutdoors to work in the service of lifesaving. As an older teenager, \nJeff and his buddy happened upon a flash flood in the Yukon that swept \nvehicles off the road. Using their wilderness savvy, they roped up and \nrescued every person.\n  Later in life, as a member of the Anchorage Fire Department's \nwhitewater rescue team, he plucked several victims from dangerous \nwaters. One of these rescues was particularly memorable. On September \n16, 2012, Jeff's Station 11 was called out to rescue a kayaker on the \nEagle River who was lodged against a tree after his kayak overturned. \nThe kayaker was in the water for about 90 minutes when a bystander \ncalled for emergency assistance. First the tree had to be cut, then the \nkayaker plucked from the water by his lifejacket. The kayaker was \nhypothermic by this point. While a number of units from the Anchorage \nFire Department responded, Jeff was senior on the three-man jet boat \nteam that plucked the victim out of the water. Jeff's team won the \nAmerican Red Cross of Alaska Wilderness Rescue Heroes award. Jeff \ncharacterized the rescue as one of the most challenging successful \nrescues his team had ever been involved with. The team was well trained \nto perform the rescue and in spite of the dangers ``everyone went \nhome,'' including the victim.\n  I cannot characterize Jeff's life in words more touching than on his \nNational Fallen Firefighters Foundation official biography. He spent \nhis life simply doing what he loved, completely engaged, lost in the \nmoment. Without any consciousness of the impact his own life was \nhaving, he left behind a great legacy of life, encouragement, \naccomplishments, and friendship.\n  That, my colleagues, is the definition of a fire hero.\n  He would say he was one of the guys who was just doing his job, but \nas one of those men who was just doing his job, he needs to know that \nwe view him as one of our heroes.\n  Our thoughts and our prayers are with his family and all of his \nbrother and sister firefighters as they gather this weekend in \nEmmitsburg.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Zadroga 9/11 Bill\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Alaska for \nyielding and giving me this opportunity to discuss two measures that \nought to be beyond debate or discussion on this floor as well as in \nAmerica--two issues where Americans ought to unite and be together \nwithout controversy or contention.\n  The first relates to the emergency responders who rushed to the \nrubble of the World Trade Center in New York in the wake of that \nhorrific attack on America on September 11. I want to join and thank my \ncolleague from New York, Senator Schumer, who just spoke on the floor, \nand associate myself completely with his very eloquent and powerful \nexplanation for why this Nation must meet its obligation to provide \ncritical health care for those emergency responders, firemen, police, \nand medical personnel who went to that site, even as it continued to \nsmolder with poisonous chemicals and fumes, risking their lives in the \nface of peril that they little understood and could not know. They \nnever asked whether that place was dangerous, but, in fact, as we now \nknow, it has caused\n\n[[Page S7065]]\n\ncountless cancers, blood diseases, and lung problems, which have \nmanifested themselves in the years after.\n  Yet at midnight last night, the beginning of this day, the programs \ndesigned to provide critical medical care and compensation to the \nvictims were permitted to expire. That is unconscionable and \nunacceptable.\n  I join my colleagues from New York and New Jersey as a leading \ncosponsor in urging this Congress to act--and to act immediately and \nurgently--to make sure that we do what is right for those emergency \nresponders who served and sacrificed in the wake of 9/11. Failure to do \nso is absolutely outrageous. The fund still has some money, and it will \ncontinue to function. But this Congress should act to pass the Zadroga \n9/11 bill immediately.\n  Madam President, the second area where I think we ought to be all \nagreeing relates to doing what is right for our veterans, and that \nmeans restoring the $857 million that has been deleted from the \nPresident's request for veterans in the Military Construction, the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations \nAct, 2016. This bill essentially shortchanges our veterans and \nstraitjackets the Veterans' Administration.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a letter from the American Legion.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The American Legion,\n\n\n                             Office of the National Commander,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 30, 2015.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader McConnell: Last May then-National \n     Commander Michael D. Helm called on Congress to pass a budget \n     for the Military Construction-Veterans Affairs Appropriations \n     bill that won't shortchange the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs (VA). On April 30 the House of Representatives had \n     passed a funding bill which unfortunately underfunds VA's \n     medical care, major construction and Information Technology \n     accounts by more than $1.5 billion below the Administration's \n     request.\n       We were pleased when the Senate Appropriations Committee \n     remedied that shortfall somewhat, but because they were \n     tasked with making an unworkable allocation workable, the \n     Senate version of the bill still underfunds veterans by \n     approximately $857 million. This comes at a time when the VA \n     is faced with an unprecedented demand for services, in terms \n     of both numbers and complexity.\n       We need your help to ensure that VA is fully funded so it \n     can provide the care and services veterans have earned and \n     need. An inadequate VA budget will have a negative effect on \n     the timeliness and quality of care that veterans will \n     receive. Fully funding VA must be a very high priority for \n     Congress.\n       The American Legion is the largest veteran service \n     organization in the nation and we take our responsibility to \n     analyze and evaluate veterans' healthcare options very \n     seriously. As VA, Congress and The American Legion move \n     forward together we must ensure that America's veterans are \n     provided with the healthcare and services they have earned \n     and were guaranteed.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                     Dale Barnett,\n                                               National Commander.\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. This letter emphasizes the challenges that the VA \nfaces in meeting the unprecedented and increasing demand for services \nthat our veterans need and deserve. This obligation for our country is \nnot a matter of discretion or convenience, it is a promise that we have \nmade and we must fulfill to provide medical care, skills training, job \nopportunity, and, most especially, the mental health care that our \nveterans need so that we can stop the 22 suicides every day in this \ncountry--the greatest, strongest, country in history of our world, \nwhere 22 of our Nation's heroes commit suicide every day.\n  They suffer from the invisible wounds of war, post-traumatic stress \nand traumatic brain injury. Many of our veterans suffer the more \nvisible wounds, and they need care as well. Many of our veterans in \nincreasing numbers will be coming out of the service needing jobs and \nskills training, not only through the VA but the Department of Labor. \nJust yesterday, the nominee for the Veterans Employment and Training \nServices position in the Department of Labor testified before the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee as to the importance of services provided \nby the Department of Labor, and yet they too will be shortchanged by \nthis budget.\n  So I urge my colleagues to provide sufficient funding to restore that \n$857 million and to make sure that we meet those needs of our veterans. \nFailing to do so is as unacceptable as failing to meet the needs of the \nemergency responders who went to the 9/11 site. This bill underfunds \nthe VA's medical facilities by $100 million, reducing the VA's ability \nto keep pace with the need for critical facility maintenance. This is \nupkeep that is vital for basic repair and maintenance. Facilities will \ndecay and downgrade without that funding. It is an investment in basic \ninfrastructure.\n  We ought to be investing in the personnel of the VA--the doctors and \nnurses and other professionals--so that we recruit and retain the men \nand women who will really do the work on the ground in the trenches to \nmake sure that the VA provides the best care possible--world-class care \nto our veterans. They deserve no less. Fully funding the VA honors the \nservice and sacrifice of men and women who have risked their lives to \nkeep our great Nation free.

Madam President, we are here to discuss the process for \nthe Border Jobs for Veterans Act that is going to pass shortly.\n  I yield to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, first, I thank my colleague from \nArizona for leading and also for his leadership for working, on a \nbipartisan basis, with Members from the other side of the aisle to \nreally accomplish something to produce a result. What I have been \ntrying to do as chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs is that I have reached out to every Senator \nand asked them: If you have identified a problem, if you have a piece \nof legislation that solves that problem, bring it before our committee, \nand I will do everything in my power to mark it up, report it out of \nour committee, and then first work with you to first pass it through \nthe Senate, then through the House, to get that piece of legislation on \nthe President's desk, and to have it signed into law to actually solve \nthat problem.\n  The Senator from Arizona has done a great job in this particular case \nbecause this is a piece of legislation that truly is a win-win. It is a \nwin for our veterans, and it is a win for the border.\n  I am not going to steal the Senator's thunder in terms of describing \nall of the benefits of the bill, but I just want to mention a couple. \nWe obviously have a huge problem at our border, and neither one of us \nwould claim that this is going to solve all of our problems. But it \nidentifies one--a staffing problem with our ports of entry. Also there \nis another problem in terms of our veterans who have served this Nation \nand are unable to find work. So that is the win-win. This is a perfect \nexample of a piece of legislation now that solves that problem.\n  Coming from the manufacturing sector, I never did quite understand \nwhy our returning veterans--with their esprit de corps, with all their \nskills, all their dedication, their great attitude--are having a hard \ntime finding work, because certainly in my manufacturing operation in \nOshkosh, WI, boy, if I found a veteran, I hired that individual because \nthey are great workers. Now, in my Senate office, we actually have \nseven veterans with a combined total of 115 years of service.\n  So I think what we are going to find now at Customs and Border \nProtection is that this bill will make it easier for veterans to \nconnect with those particular jobs to help staff our ports of entry. \nCustoms and Border Protection is going to find that value of being able \nto employ the finest among us because we have made that easier. Our \nveterans are going to have the ability to leave\n\n[[Page S7066]]\n\nservice and have a very good job further serving the country and \nkeeping our Nation safe.\n  I again thank the Senator from Arizona for his leadership on this and \nfor working with me to get this passed through our committee, passed \nthrough the Senate, and put on the President's desk for his signature \nto have this bill signed into law so we can be helping our veterans and \nprotect this Nation.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Thank you. I again thank the Senator from Wisconsin and \nothers I will name later for working so hard on this bill.\n  The Senator made sure that it moved through his committee \nexpeditiously, that we got it to the floor in the Senate and also \nthrough the House as well. It is an example of how the Senate and the \nHouse can work in a bipartisan way. I appreciate both the appeal that \nyou have made to encourage us to come forward with problems that we \nhave and to vote for ways that your committee can help solve them.\n  Thank you again.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. If I could just make one final point, this is a classic \nexample of when we concentrate on the areas of agreement and find the \nareas of agreement that unite us, as opposed to exploiting the \ndivisions.\n  Again, this is a perfect example of getting bipartisan support on a \npiece of legislation. It serves as a great example for everybody \nserving in Washington to see us concentrate on the areas of agreement \nthat unify us rather than exploit those divisions.\n  Again, I thank the Senator very much for his leadership.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Thank you.\n  Madam President, I wish to talk about the problem that led to this \nbill. We have made significant investments along the border in terms of \nport facilities. More needs to be done, obviously, but we made \nsignificant investments to accommodate cross-border traffic.\n  There is a lot of good that goes on at the border. We often just \nfocus on the bad--the illegal crossings, the drug trade, and whatnot--\nbut there is a tremendous amount of good that happens on the border, \nparticularly the border of Arizona and Mexico.\n  There is a lot of commerce that goes in. Arizona's ports of entry \nprocessed $30.5 billion worth of goods in 2014. This is an increase up \nfrom $18.5 billion in 2009. So there is a lot of good that goes on. We \nhave needed more adequate staffing at these ports.\n  The Border Patrol officers with whom we often associate the border \nare in green uniforms. What we need more of are blue uniforms--people \nto actually facilitate this cross-border traffic and the flow of goods \nthat benefits us, benefits Mexico and other countries to the south as \nwell.\n  Secretary Johnson, when we asked why we were having difficulty \nfilling these slots for staffing of these ports, said that--well, let \nme just say we authorized--the Senate and the House authorized--2,000 \nnew CPB officers. We authorized these positions, but as of earlier this \nyear, only 800 of the 2,000 had been filled. So Secretary Johnson was \nexplaining that the delays are associated with applicant background \ninvestigations, low polygraph clearance rates, and a shortage of \nFederal polygraph examiners combined with attrition.\n  So we thought: What group of people do we have who have gone through \nthese security clearances already and who could clear this hurdle and \nexpedite this? And it is, of course, our returning men and women from \nthe military and those who are now out of service. They have, in many \ncases, already gone through the security clearances. They have passed \nthe polygraph test and could more expeditiously move into these jobs. \nObviously, we have concerns, and we have several other programs that \ndeal with returning veterans to make sure that there are jobs awaiting \nthem.\n  Let me say that this doesn't affect any of the preferences or other \npositions that are available for our veterans. This simply requires CPB \nand the Department of Homeland Security to coordinate or collaborate \nwith our military to see what jobs are out there and see what positions \ncan be filled.\n  It shouldn't take an act of Congress to get two agencies to work \ntogether like this, but sometimes it does. So that is what this \nlegislation is doing, and it will require reporting to happen as well \nto make sure that this is being accomplished and the coordination is \noccurring.\n  Let me just talk about some of the endorsements for this legislation, \nsome of those groups that have helped us in exploiting the need and \ncoming to a solution.\n  The Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry said:\n\n       The Border Jobs for Veterans Act . . . helps advance two \n     major national priorities: the facilitation of cross-border \n     commerce and the future employment of the tens of thousands \n     of men and women who separate from military service each \n     year. Ensuring our ports of entry are properly staffed is \n     critical to our nation's ability to compete on a global \n     scale.\n\n  The president of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas said:\n\n       The Border Jobs for Vets Legislation is crucial for \n     continuing to grow the nation's economy. It is helping \n     businesses across the country continue to prosper by \n     facilitating trade while also using the skills and knowledge \n     of an amazing asset we already have, our veterans, to do this \n     important work.\n\n  The Greater Nogales-Santa Cruz Port Authority said:\n\n       Border communities like Nogales, Arizona, depend greatly on \n     the ability of people and goods to cross the border \n     effectively and efficiently. We have been pushing for many \n     years for additional staff. . . . The Border Jobs for \n     Veterans Act is one of the most significant steps taken on \n     this issue in many years.\n\n  The president of the Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce said:\n\n       We appreciate our Arizona Senators' innovative approach to \n     a problem that is impacting our communities and our economy. \n     Any impediments that increase wait times at our ports of \n     entry such as a lack of adequate staffing impact our retail \n     sales and ultimately the financial success of our business \n     community in Arizona.\n  I would like to take a moment to thank my Senate colleagues--Senator \nRon Johnson, who already spoke here; Senator McCain, who played a \ncritical role in this; Senator Schumer, Senator Burr, Senator Baldwin, \nSenator Feinstein, Senator Lankford, Senator Sullivan, Senator Tillis, \nSenator Toomey, and Senator David Vitter--for cosponsoring this \nbipartisan legislation.\n  After being approved by the Senate, Arizona Congresswoman Martha \nMcSally has led the effort to get it passed in the House unanimously. \nShe played a great role there, and I want to thank her for leading this \neffort in the House.\n  Thanks to everyone's support and the hard work of committee staff, \nincluding Brooke Ericson and Holly Idelson on the Senate Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee and Paul Anstine of the \nHouse Homeland Security Committee, we now have this bill ready to head \nto the President's desk.\n  In conclusion, let me just say that those leaving the military need \njobs and CBP needs officers. This is a great bill that will require \ncoordination between the two, and it will lead to greater staffing at \nless cost and certainly in less time. So I look forward to having the \nadministration look at this and look forward to having the President \nsign this legislation.\n  With that, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 2835, which was received \nfrom the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2835) to actively recruit members of the Armed \n     Forces who are separating from military service to serve as \n     Customs and Border Protection officers.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. FLAKE. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time \nand passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements related to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 2835) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S7067]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I come to the floor today to ask for an \nextension of a very important program to my State--the Land and Water \nConservation Fund--and because of that I ask unanimous consent that the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee be discharged from and the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 2101; I ask \nunanimous consent that the bill be read a third time and passed, and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I am very disappointed that last night \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund expired, and so it has lapsed. I \njust offered a unanimous consent request to extend this fund for 60 \ndays to make sure there was not a lapse in this important program.\n  This is a fund that, in my home State of New Hampshire, has been used \nto ensure the public can enjoy our beautiful environment and our \nnatural spaces, from my home city of Nashua, NH, and Mine Falls Park, \nwhich I love to run through every morning when I am in New Hampshire, \nto our beautiful White Mountain National Forest.\n  I had the opportunity to come to the floor yesterday with Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle, including my colleague from Montana, \nSenator Daines. The Senator from Montana had a wonderful picture of him \nand his wife in their public lands that have been preserved using the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund. The picture was of him and his wife \nhiking. We all understand that a big part of the beauty of this country \nis our natural beauty, and because of that, the Land and Water \nConservation Fund was established in 1965. It was actually established \nto aid in the preservation of spaces for outdoor recreation across this \nNation.\n  In New Hampshire we have a very strong tradition of the outdoors \nbeing such a part of who we are. In fact, the Land and Water \nConservation Fund has led to more than 650 individual acquisition and \ndevelopment projects in our State. We very much support the public use \nof our lands in our State, enjoying their natural beauty, whether it is \nhiking, fishing, hunting or any number of other wonderful uses we can \nhave of our public lands. So this fund has been very important, and I \nbelieve we should not let it lapse.\n  The law that created the Land and Water Conservation Fund in 1965 \nestablished that a portion of the revenues coming from oil and gas \nleasing would be designated for this purpose. So to not extend this \nfund really is another example, if you look at the fund itself, where \nportions of these dollars have actually been taken to spend for other \npurposes in the Treasury, not in accordance with the law. We see that \nhappen too much in Washington. But to let this lapse is very \nunfortunate.\n  I am very disappointed my colleague has rendered an objection because \nthis is such a bipartisan issue and something that has done so much for \nour country--this program--and for my home State of New Hampshire. So I \nhope in the coming days we will be able to work together to have the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund program extended and that we can get \nbeyond the partisan objections and get it done so we can work together \nto preserve the beautiful spaces in this country. This program has done \nso much for my home State of New Hampshire and for many States across \nthis country, and that is why it has such strong bipartisan support.\n  Madam President, I am very disappointed that my very reasonable \nrequest in asking for unanimous consent to extend this program for 60 \ndays until we can get to the long-term permanent authorization--which I \nsupport and I have cosponsored, and I think that is what we need to do \nin the long term--has been objected to. To let this lapse is completely \nunacceptable when it has been such a strong program in allowing \neveryone in this country to enjoy our public lands, to enjoy the great \noutdoors in the greatest country on Earth.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I want to talk for a few minutes about \nthe discussion we are having about whether to have a discussion. The \ndebate we are having about whether to have a debate is always amazing \nto me. How far we have moved in such a short period of time from the \nway the Congress always did its work. The way you set your priorities, \nboth at home and in the government, is how you spend your money. You \nmight think that is not the way you set your priorities, but if you \nthink something is very important to you and your family and you find \nout you are not investing any money or time in it, it is probably not \nall that important. It is probably something you have decided is a good \nthing to say is very important.\n  This is the process we go through in the government to talk about \nwhat our priorities are. What could be more significant in our \npriorities than the bill that I would like to see us take up today, the \nVA-Military Construction bill, the bill that determines lots of things \nabout not only people who serve in the military but what is available \nfor their families, and what kind of support structure there is, and \nthen with the Veterans' Administration, what is there after they serve, \nhow are we meeting that commitment we made to our veterans that if they \nserve for the government--and we are grateful, so we should then make \nsure we are always there to do what the American people have told \nveterans we would do if they served.\n  We have already had votes not to go to the Defense appropriations \nbill--a bill that is about the same amount of money the President asked \nfor and what the President said was needed to defend the country, but \napparently there is some balance somewhere in the world--that I am not \naware of--that no matter how much it costs to defend the country, you \nhave to spend that much money on other things that don't defend the \ncountry; that there is a balance between what is happening in Syria \ntoday and how many employees the EPA needs or how many employees the \nIRS needs. Obviously, that is something that doesn't make sense to \npeople. It doesn't make sense to me, but we couldn't get the four \nadditional votes we needed to go to the Defense appropriations bill. I \nguess in a world where the President said he is also going to veto the \nDefense authorization bill--not because of what it authorizes but \nbecause of the money that eventually the appropriators would have to \nspend--people have to wonder what is going on. The No. 1 priority of \nthe Federal Government is to defend the country, and following that \npriority, our obligation is to those who serve in the military and \ntheir families. That is what the Military Construction bill would do. \nIt actually spends a little more money than we spent this year. That \nappears to be everybody's complaint; that somehow the government is not \nspending enough money, but the Appropriations Committee took the amount \nof money that the law allows, and the Budget Control Act did a good \nthing in terms of keeping spending under control. That is one of the \nfew things that has happened in Washington, DC, in a long time that \nactually did put a lid on spending because it actually put a lid on \nspending. It actually says in the law how much money we can spend this \nyear on discretionary spending. The Appropriations Committee, with \nRepublicans in charge for the first time in a long time, did the work \nfor the first time in a long time. In fact, this is the first year in 6 \nyears that the Appropriations Committee voted all the bills out of \ncommittee, marked up all of the bills, cut places where the committee \nthought should be cut, increased places where the committee thought \nshould be increased, and this at a level that the law\n\n[[Page S7068]]\n\nallows, but apparently the law is not good enough for our friends who \nalways want to spend more money. It is not even good enough to debate \nthe bills that come out at the level of the law, to let those be \namended, and to let that work be publicly done.\n  This worked pretty well for a long time. I think initially there was \nprobably one spending bill, but I think in the tradition of Congress, \nthat was the one bill that in both the House and the Senate we were \nable to debate as long as we wanted to, until everybody was worn out, \noffering their ideas as to how to spend the money better or not spend \nit at all. The House has continued to do this, except for a couple of \nyears under Speaker Pelosi, on the half dozen big bills of the 12 \nspending bills we have now, and they traditionally have 200 or 300 \namendments on each of those bills on how to spend the money. Some of \nthose suggestions were not to spend it at all. What could be healthier \nthan that? The Senate is not allowed to do that. At the end of the day, \nwe are saying: Let's debate these bills. Let's, of course, debate the \nbill that defends the country. Let's debate the bill that takes care of \nthose who do defend the country.\n\n  This bill includes $5.5 billion more than was spent last year. I \ndon't recall hearing a hark and cry--when this bill finally gets passed \nas part of one big not very appealing package--from anyone saying that \nwe were not spending nearly enough on military construction or veterans \nprograms last year, but even though we are spending $5.5 billion more \nthan we spent last year, some are saying it isn't nearly enough to \nspend this year. The committee thought it was enough.\n  In fact, this bill was voted out of committee--and remember this \ncommittee has Democrats and Republicans on it--with a vote of 27 to 3. \nEleven Democrats and all the Republicans said: This is the best way to \nspend this amount of money--$5.5 billion more for these purposes than \nwe spent last year. Let's vote this bill out so it can be debated on \nthe Senate floor. Here we are months later, still trying to get 60 \nSenators to agree to have that debate. Actually, I think we are trying \nto get five Senators to agree to have that debate because all of the \nRepublicans, and one Democrat, appear to be willing to move forward on \nthese defense funding bills, but there is not enough on the other side. \nIf we could get half of the Democrats who voted for the bill in the \ncommittee, we would have the votes we need to have this debate and talk \nabout spending money.\n  Eventually the government has to be funded, and we should all \nunderstand that if we don't do it this way, the alternative is that it \nwill be funded in absolutely the worst possible way as one big bill \nwith no debate and having to settle on some desperate decision at the \nend of the year in order to keep the government funded because we do \nhave to defend the country.\n  I am not arguing with the decision that ultimately has to be made to \ndefend the country. I am not arguing with the decision that ultimately \nhas to be made to have the military installations that allow that to \nhappen with military construction. I am not arguing with the decision \nthat has to be made for the veterans affairs part of our government, \nincluding veterans' health--mental and physical--behavioral health, and \nother health, to be funded properly, but why aren't we debating on that \ntoday?\n  What would be wrong with debating this bill? If you were not one of \nthe 27 Senators on that committee--so 27 percent of the Senate has \nalready voted on this bill. Let's send it to the Senate floor and vote \non it. If you are not one of the 27 Senators who voted for it or one of \nthe 3 who voted against it, bring your ideas to the floor. That is how \nthis process is supposed to work. Your ideas may be better than what is \nin the bill, but we will never find out if we are not allowed to debate \nit. This is regrettable for veterans and their families. We see a \nVeterans' Administration that is not doing what it ought to do.\n  A year ago, the President said the Veterans' Administration was the \nbest funded part of ``his government,'' but now there is not enough \nmoney. Suddenly there is not enough money. The President thought there \nwas enough money a year ago, but apparently there is not enough money \nnow. The real issue is that there is not enough commitment to veterans \nand the Veterans' Administration. We could have that debate here too.\n  Over the last year, we have moved a long way toward giving veterans \nmore choices, more options, and more places to go to get their health \ncare. That system is in its fledgling stages, and it ought to be \ndebated as we talk about how to spend money that would be spent on the \nVeterans' Administration, but we can't debate and vote on it if people \naren't willing to have the vote it takes to have that debate. We ought \nto be getting back to the way this process works transparently and the \nway it works constitutionally. We need to have this vote today. We need \nto get to the Defense appropriations bill.\n  Earlier this week, we had a vote--which I didn't support--to move \nforward for a few more weeks with last year's spending. Last year's \npriorities only work for so long. Just a couple of years ago, we had \nthe situation where the Budget Control Act had to go into effect--and \nit went into effect because Congress didn't do its job and ended up \nappropriating more money than the law would allow--and that required \nline-by-line cutting, the sequester, which is not a necessary part of \nthat law at all. It is only a part of the law if the Congress violates \nthe law, and the Congress violated the law. The President signed the \nbill, and then we had to do the line-by-line cutting.\n  We brought the leaders of our military in to talk about this, and \nnone of them were for line-by-line cutting. Who would be? That is the \nworst possible way to reduce spending because you are not making any \nchoices, you are just admitting that you can't make any choices, and so \neverything gets cut everywhere. Every one of them said this is a big \nproblem, but an even bigger problem in almost every case is the \nsequester. In fact, Admiral McRaven of Special Ops said that an even \nbigger problem than the sequester is the continuing resolution because \nwe were cutting lines of a budget that might have met the military \nneeds 5 years before, but it hasn't been updated for 5 years.\n  Let's have this debate. Let's move beyond saying that we can't decide \nhow to spend the money to debating how to spend the money. Let's have a \ndefense structure that works for 2015 and 2016, not a defense structure \nthat might have worked for 2010. One of the great frustrations the \npeople we work for have with us today is they believe this is not all \nthat complicated, and they are right. How complicated can it be? We \nwere elected to the Senate so we could take positions and vote, so \nlet's take positions and vote. The debate we should be having is about \nmoving forward on these critical issues.\n  I hope our colleagues will join us today. I hope there are 60 \nSenators who will say: I am ready to have this debate. I am ready to \ndefend the country. I am ready to take care of those who defend our \ncountry and their families and veterans and their survivors. And that \nis what this budget is all about.\n  How anyone can walk onto the floor and say they don't want to deal \nwith this now and put it off a little while longer is disappointing to \nme and to lots of people.\n  Let's get our work done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I come to the floor to urge my colleagues \nto pass the 2016 Military Construction appropriations bill. This bill \nhas a $4.2 billion increase over last year's level.\n  We passed the MILCON-VA bill out of the full Appropriations Committee \nby a vote of 21 to 9, with Democratic Senators Leahy, Feinstein, Udall, \nSchatz, and Baldwin all supporting that bill and with 16 Republicans \nbacking it.\n  We now have record levels of funding to fix the backlog of disability \nclaims at the VA. We took construction out of the hands of the VA and \ngave it to the Army Corps of Engineers so that we never have cost \noverruns like at the Denver hospital again. The bill also bans funding \nfor Glenn Haggstrom, the bureaucrat responsible for spending\n\n[[Page S7069]]\n\n$930 million over budget in Denver. The bill provides new protections \nfor whistleblowers, especially for doctors and nurses not protected by \nthe Whistleblower Protection Act.\n  By voting no on this bill, Members will be voting against a $4.2 \nbillion increase for our veterans.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                 Trans-Pacific Partnership Negotiations\n\n  Mr. TILLIS. Madam President, I rise today to speak about a subject \nmatter I touched on about a month ago regarding current trade \nnegotiations.\n  I don't blame elected officials for pushing legislation, policy \nproposals, or ideas that further their home State's interests. In fact, \nI think that is one of the first things we should do here, that is, to \nmake sure the folks who elected us know we are standing up for them.\n  But I also think there comes a time when we need to recognize that \nthe long-term interests of our collective constituents are at risk, \neven when we are doing short term things that put us at risk.\n  This is why I have decided that I wish to speak a little bit about \nthe current status of the Trans-Pacific Partnership or TPP \nnegotiations.\n  I learned overnight and this morning that the American team of the \nTPP negotiators has tabled language which would carve certain American-\ngrown commodities out of the protections of the trade deal's investor-\nstate dispute settlement--or ISDS--mechanism.\n  By carving out tobacco from the TPP, the President and his \nadministration are discriminating against an entire agriculture \ncommodity, setting a dangerous precedent for future trade agreements.\n  I rise today to defend the farmers, the manufacturers, and the \nexporters from the discriminatory treatment in this proposed trade \nagreement. What they have decided to do right now relates to tobacco. \nToday it happens to be about tobacco, but I will do this for any crop \nnow and for any agriculture commodity for any State going forward in \nthe future. This is not just about tobacco. This is about American \nvalues and fairness.\n  In July I stood on this same floor and I discussed this same issue. I \nwent out of my way to emphasize that I believe free trade is good. That \nis why I voted for trade promotion authority. A balanced trade \nagreement will benefit all of us.\n  I also recognize that the United States over the years has tried to \ndo more with these agreements than merely haggle for market access or \ntariff reductions. Over the past 30 years, the United States has \nconsistently imported certain components of our American system into \nthese agreements, including due process protections, dispute settlement \nprocedures, and the protection of private property rights.\n  These are now standard terms that those who engage with the United \nStates at the bargaining table know are not negotiable.\n  They never have been--that is, until yesterday.\n  Our negotiators have now concluded that while some investors are \nentitled to equal treatment under the law, others aren't. What our \nnegotiators have proposed sets the stage for the remainder of this \nnegotiation and for those deals which will be negotiated in the future, \nsuch as the agreement with Europe and future agreements with African \nnations.\n  Our trade agreements are now apparently nothing more than \nlaboratories for setting partisan policies and picking winners and \nlosers. If we condone this kind of behavior, how can we be assured it \nwill ever end?\n  As I stated in July, once we allow an entire sector to be treated \nunfairly, the question is, who is next? Is it the beef industry in \nNebraska? Is it the pork industry in States such as Iowa and North \nCarolina? Is it the poultry industry in Delaware, North Carolina, \nArkansas, and Georgia?\n  We need not look far to find protracted, heated policy debates about \nany number of issues that affect trade--the consumption of coal, energy \nexploration practices, the use of pesticides, the use of biotechnology. \nThe right place for those debates is in bodies like this one, not in \ntrade agreements. The wrong place is what is going on right now with \nour trade negotiators and the members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n  I hold a sincere belief that unfair treatment for one agricultural \ncommodity significantly heightens the risk that more unfair treatment \nfor another commodity lurks around the corner.\n  I have no choice but to use this forum to make two very important \npoints and make it very clear to the negotiators as we reach the final \nstages of the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations.\n  First, I would like to speak to process concerns. A failure to abide \nby the process and the terms governing the process as established by \nthe TPA is unacceptable. When I state that I have no choice but to use \nthe Senate floor to make these points, I mean it.\n  A full 8 weeks ago, I wrote to our Trade Ambassador cautioning him \nabout this course of action and requesting that he consult with me as \nhe was statutorily obligated in the TPA to do.\n  To explain to those in the Gallery, we passed a bill that said we \nwanted to provide the President with trade promotion authority. We \nwanted to empower representatives of the United States to negotiate \nwith trading partners who are in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We \nwanted to support that, over the objections of many of my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle.\n  We also set certain ground rules for being able to do that. They had \nto review with Congress some of the proposed items of the agreement \nthat may be the most contentious about intellectual property, about the \ncarve-out. But to date I have had absolutely no additional \ncommunication from the Ambassador or his designees. In other words, it \nhas been lights out.\n  In fact, I would ask any Member of the Senate whether they honestly \nknow what currently is in the TPP agreement that is being, in my mind, \npushed forward and pushed to a point where we will just have a simple \nup-or-down vote. I think this abuse of the process is in violation of \nthe letter and the spirit of the TPA.\n  The last time anybody spoke to me regarding this particular provision \nthat has to do with the carve-out, I was told it is something our \npartners were insisting on. The actions of the last 24 hours--namely, \nthat the United States actually tabled the language in question--really \nraises serious doubts about that assertion.\n  Second, I want to speak to the growing view that the TPP is not being \nnegotiated in accordance with the substance of the TPA. The failure to \nabide by the substance of the provisions of TPA puts the privileged \nstatus of the proposed treaty at risk, and it is something I am going \nto spend a lot of time focusing on.\n  I would remind this body that we have already, in a bipartisan \nfashion, disavowed language that treats some products differently. In \nthe TPA, Congress said that opportunities for U.S. agriculture exports \nmust be ``substantially equivalent to opportunities afforded foreign \nexports in U.S. markets.'' Congress has stated that dispute settlement \nmechanisms must be available across the board, not selectively.\n  I voted to give the President trade promotion authority to allow \ntrade agreements such as the TPP to move through Congress in a quick, \norderly, and responsible fashion. Congress granted the President trade \npromotion authority with the mutual understanding that his \nadministration would negotiate deals in good faith. I did not vote to \ngive the President and the administration the freedom to \nindiscriminately choose when fairness should be applied and when it \nshould be ignored.\n  If the President chooses to arbitrarily ignore TPA provisions he \ndoesn't like, then Congress is not obliged to honor the fast-track \nstatus. If any carve-out is ultimately included in the TPP, I will work \nhard to defeat it.\n  I might add that our own majority leader has expressed concerns over \nthis and has expressed the same sentiment to the trade negotiation \nteam.\n  In closing, I wish to offer this to anyone who believes my sticking \nup for tobacco or this particular provision or for equal treatment and \nAmerican values is shortsighted: I want you to know that I would do it \nfor beef in Nebraska,\n\n[[Page S7070]]\n\nfor pork in Iowa, for poultry in Delaware, for any farmer who is being \nunfairly carved out as a result of the administration's desire to put \nprovisions in a trade agreement that simply shouldn't be there, and \nwhich have not been there historically.\n  So to the Members of the Senate and to the American people and the \nfarmers out there, I want you to know I am going to continue this \nfight. I am going to continue this fight not because it satisfies a \nhome constituency, but because I intend to protect the free trade \nideals that have made the United States the most desirable trading \npartner in the world.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I also want you to know that I think \nthere is a growing sense of concern--whether it is Senator Hatch, \nSenator McConnell, or a number of other Senators--that regardless of \nhow they feel about this particular issue with tobacco, the provision \nin such a trade agreement is unacceptable. I hope our trade negotiators \nrecognize that we are focusing a lot of attention on this, and they \nrisk putting together a good trade agreement that we would all like to \nget behind as a result.\n\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2101\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, for 50 years the Land and Water \nConservation Fund has done amazing work protecting our land, waterways, \nforests, State parks, and critical wildlife habitats. This is \nparticularly true in New Hampshire, where since 1965 LWCF has funded \nmore than 650 individual projects. Just this month, New Hampshire \nreceived eight new LWCF grants, which will allow New Hampshire \ncommunities to develop outdoor recreation facilities in Dover, which is \nclose to where I live, to renovate Osgood Pond in Milford, and to do so \nmany other projects.\n  In the last couple of months, I actually had a chance to go around \nNew Hampshire and visit so many of these projects that were done \nbecause of LWCF grants. One of the things that really struck me about \nthem is that they are not for big projects, although some have been \nused toward doing that. The Silvio Conte National Wildlife Preserve \nthat crosses Vermont and New Hampshire is one of those that have been \npreserved, with the help of Judd Gregg, a former Republican Senator \nfrom New Hampshire. LWCF helped to preserve that.\n  So many of these grants have been used for small projects and \ncommunities, such as Meredith in the Lakes Region of New Hampshire on \nLake Winnipesaukee, where I visited. They have been able to expand the \npark along the lake so that people not only from Meredith but from \nacross the State and other parts of the country when they are visiting \ncan come and sit and enjoy the water. With those projects, they have \nbeen able to put in new docks so that people can get out on the lake on \nboats and enjoy the water. Without LWCF, those projects would not have \nbeen possible. It gets people out into the outdoors who otherwise \nwouldn't be able to do that.\n  Federal and State LWCF funds are also vital to the outdoor recreation \nindustry in New Hampshire. That is one of our biggest industries. It \naccounts for $4.2 billion in consumer spending, $1.2 billion in wages \nand salaries, and nearly 50,000 jobs. The importance of these projects \nand the conservation efforts that are the result of LWCF to the tourism \nsector of our economy and to our outdoor industry cannot be overstated.\n  There has been bipartisan support for LWCF since its inception back \nin the 1960s. There is a bill which Senator Burr has introduced and \nwhich I am a cosponsor of that would extend LWCF for 60 days. \nUnfortunately, last night LWCF expired. Its authorization ended as of \nSeptember 30.\n  The effort to reauthorize the program, to invoke Senator Burr's \nbipartisan legislation, was defeated. When they objected to a simple \nshort-term extension of LWCF, our Republican friends indicated it was \nbecause they believed most LWCF funding goes to Federal land \nacquisition. Well, I would like the Record to reflect that is just not \nthe case. I have seen it firsthand in New Hampshire in the projects I \ntalked about. I would bet the Presiding Officer has seen in North \nCarolina the support LWCF has provided. In fact, during the last 10 \nyears, LWCF funds have been split about 50-50 between Federal agencies \nand States. In New Hampshire, what these Federal grants do is to \nleverage State support and private support and local support.\n  Moreover, most Federal lands that are acquired with LWCF funds are \nwithin the existing boundaries of Federal parks, refuges, forests, and \nother recreation areas. Consolidating these lands helps to reduce \nFederal maintenance and management costs, saves taxpayer dollars, and \nenhances the experience visitors have to these areas. For example, in \n2014, 39 of 40 LWCF national forest acquisitions expanded access to \nproperty already managed by the Federal Government that had been \npreviously closed to the public. This is not about keeping the public \noff these lands, this is about helping to ensure that members of the \npublic can get on these lands and benefit from them and enjoy them.\n  This Senator is very disappointed that we have seen a few people \nblocking the extension of this program in a way that affects every \nsingle State in this country. Our failure to act has significant \nconsequences for each and every State.\n  The expiration of this program jeopardizes access to public land for \nhunting and fishing, which is one of the great benefits we have in New \nHampshire that we use these lands for. It prohibits access to other \noutdoor activities that are important and unique to our American \nheritage. This is going to adversely impact our Nation's outdoor, \nrecreation, conservation, and preservation economy. In New Hampshire, \nour whole outdoor industry is affected. That outdoor industry \ncontributes over $1 trillion to our Nation each year, and it supports \nmillions of American jobs.\n  I think it is critical that we pass a short-term extension to keep \nthis program operating, but ultimately what we need to do is to pass a \nbill that permanently reauthorizes and fully funds LWCF--something a \nbipartisan majority of this body supports doing. I am going to continue \nworking to pass a permanent authorization. I know that Senator Burr; my \ncolleague from New Hampshire, Senator Ayotte; and other people who are \non this bill feel the same way.\n  In the meantime, we should not allow LWCF to lapse any longer. So \nthis Senator is going to renew a unanimous consent request that was \nmade last night by my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Heinrich, to \npass a 60-day extension.\n  I recognize that this request is going to be objected to by Senator \nLankford, whom I see on the floor, but I just want to remind us all \nthat less than 2 weeks ago, 53 Senators wrote the Senate majority \nleader urging action to reauthorize LWCF. To the 12 Republican Senators \nwho signed that letter, I say this: I hope you will work with us to \ncorrect the misconceptions and the mischaracterizations that exist \nabout this program. Let's work together so we can allow this short-term \nextension to pass. Let's work together to get a long-term \nreauthorization for the Land and Water Conservation Fund because LWCF \nhas expanded outdoor opportunities in every single State in the \ncountry.\n  We should come together to support the Land and Water Conservation \nFund, to protect one of America's most essential tools for conservation \nand economic growth.\n  With that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee be discharged from and the Senate proceed \nto the immediate consideration of S. 2101; and I ask unanimous consent \nthat the bill be read a third time and passed and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I do \nobject to this bill moving forward by unanimous consent today. The \nissue is that this bill needs reform. I enjoy our national parks. My \nchildren enjoy our national parks.\n  Twenty-nine percent of the United States is already under Federal \nownership. Twenty-nine percent of all of the United States is under \nFederal ownership. A significant portion of this--in\n\n[[Page S7071]]\n\nfact, last year $306 million was spent from the LWCF, and $178 million \nof that was for new land acquisition.\n  So the bulk of what this program is used for is for new land \nacquisition. But the real issue to address here is not only what \nhappens if we allow it to lapse but what happens with it day to day. \nThe day-to-day operation of the LWCF is for new land acquisition or for \nputting money into a State grant to be able to have them buy new \nfacilities, not to maintain them.\n  We are not setting aside the money to be able to maintain this. We \nhave an $11.5 billion deferred maintenance backlog at our national \nparks right now. The new additional dollars that are used for land \nacquisition are used to be able to pick up new properties and not to be \nable to maintain what we currently have. So the challenge that I have \nis this: Why don't we look at this fund in a new way? Why can't we take \ncare of what we already have and not just focus on acquiring new \nproperties?\n  To leave the LWCF as it currently is would be something akin to \nsaying: I want to buy a new car, but I don't want to set aside money to \nactually put gas in it. I just want to have the new car.\n  Well, if we are going to have that property, we better take care of \nit. Currently, the Federal Government is a terrible steward of the land \nwe have. Now, as far as this program and reauthorizing it right now, we \nchecked with the Congressional Research Service. If this program is not \nreauthorized currently, the program continues. The program currently \nhas $20 billion in reserves right now--$20 billion.\n  Last year, $306 million was spent. The year before, $306 million was \nspent in LWCF, meaning in current status, right now, if we do not put a \nsingle dime into LWCF for the next few years, we will only have 65 \nyears of reserve left in this program. It is not a crisis that we need \nto fix immediately. This authorization does not keep the program going. \nThis authorization means we are not adding new money to the $20 billion \nalready in reserve.\n  I think we have at least 64 years to be able to work this out and a \n65-year reserve. I can't imagine it would take that long, but with the \nSenate, everything seems to take too long. What we are looking for is \npretty straightforward and simple. Let's spend some of these dollars to \nbe able to focus on not just buying new properties but on actually \ntaking care of properties that the U.S. Government has the \nresponsibility to actually be able to maintain. It is to reform this \nprogram in the days ahead and to make sure that we are managing land \nwell, not just adding new land all the time.\n  So with that, I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I would be all for taking the backlog of \nfunding and putting it into LWCF. I think my colleague raises some real \nreforms that could be made to LWCF. In fact, there is legislation in \nthe comprehensive energy bill that Senators Murkowski and Cantwell have \npassed that would make some of those reforms. But if we can't get to \nthat, if we can't extend this program in the short term, we are never \ngoing to get to that point.\n  The fact is that the backlog of maintenance needs should be \naddressed. But it does not make sense for us to suspend the program \nwhile we address those needs. LWCF was not established for maintenance \npurposes. It was established to protect natural areas and to provide \nrecreation opportunities to the American public.\n  When I went to the city of Nashua, the second largest city in New \nHampshire, and walked with the Republican mayor along the Riverwalk \nthat they are trying to establish there, what I heard from her was what \na critical difference LWCF made to the city and being able to leverage \nfunds that the city put in and that the State could put in to help make \nsure that the people of Nashua, many of whom cannot get to national \nparks or to the White Mountains in New Hampshire but they could get to \nthe Riverwalk through downtown Nashua.\n  Those are the kinds of projects that LWCF goes to help fund. Some 99 \npercent of what Federal agencies spend goes to acquire inholds, those \npieces of land that are already within the boundaries of a national \npark, a national forest or a national wildlife refuge that if sold to a \nprivate developer would block public access. It would damage park \nresources. It would harm the visitor experience, and it would make it \nharder to maintain those very projects that my colleague was talking \nabout wanting to maintain.\n  So I think, while it sounds simple to say there is a backlog and we \nshould not reauthorize this program, that is only half the story. It is \nvery disappointing that with the strong bipartisan support this \nlegislation has, with the need to reauthorize it to continue to protect \nspecial places in the country, we are seeing opposition from a very few \npeople in this body who are able to block our moving forward.\n\n\n                       Nomination of Gayle Smith\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to, if I could, move on to address a \ndifferent issue, and hope we will see some cooperative agreement at \nsome point in the future. I also want to urge the consideration of the \nnomination of Gayle Smith to serve as the Administrator of the United \nStates Agency for International Development, also known as USAID. I am \nhere with my colleague Senator Coons from the Foreign Relations \nCommittee to talk about this nominee because this is a noncontroversial \nnominee, a seasoned public servant for a position that should be above \npartisanship.\n  So it is really disappointing that, again, there is only one person \nin this body who is holding this up. This comes at a particularly \ndifficult time because we are witnessing a humanitarian crisis in Syria \nand across the Middle East. It is a crisis that grows worse every day. \nOur European allies are struggling to cope with a massive refugee and \nmigration crisis without precedent since World War II.\n  The United States, with our unparalleled capacity to mobilize \nhumanitarian support for humanitarian relief, has played a leading \nrole, but there is more that we can do to assist both the Syrian \nrefugees and the neighboring countries that are hosting them to help \nwith that humanitarian crisis. But our ability to respond effectively \nto these challenges is hampered by the inability of the Senate to vote \non Gayle Smith's nomination to lead USAID.\n  So, again, nearly 4 months have passed since she appeared before the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee. The committee approved her \nnomination by a voice vote in July. But since then, there has been no \nattempt to bring her nomination to the Senate floor, even as these \nhumanitarian crises have deepened and deteriorated. It is not only our \noperations in the Middle East that are being hampered, USAID currently \noperates in more than 60 countries and regional missions around the \nworld.\n  Following the devastating earthquake in Nepal in April, USAID \ndisaster response teams were among the first crisis personnel to deploy \nthere to organize the humanitarian response. USAID personnel continue \nto support our development efforts in Afghanistan. Those efforts are \ncritical to the long-term success in the country. Given the \nextraordinary humanitarian crises confronting the United States, \nconfronting our allies in the world, we really need a leader in place \nat USAID. It is unconscionable that here we are 4 months later and she \nis still being stalled.\n  Gayle Smith is a superbly qualified nominee who will almost certainly \nbe confirmed by an overwhelming bipartisan vote. The Senate deserves \nthe chance to vote on this critical nomination. So, again, I urge the \nmajority leader to bring her nomination to the floor. We discussed it \nagain today in the Foreign Relations Committee. I know my colleague \nfrom Delaware can speak also to what we heard in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  So I would yield to my colleague from Delaware to discuss what we \nhave heard in the Foreign Relations Committee about Gayle Smith and the \nneed to put her in place as leader of USAID.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, confirmation and expiration are issues \nbefore us today. As we have heard from the Member from New Hampshire, \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on which we both serve, months \nago considered the nomination of Gayle Smith to be the next \nAdministrator of USAID. Today, 60 million people\n\n[[Page S7072]]\n\naround the world are displaced, either within their countries or as \nrefugees spreading throughout the world.\n  It is the single greatest refugee crisis since the end of the Second \nWorld War. Gayle Smith came before our committee and received \ncommendations and plaudits from Republicans and Democrats for her long \nexperience as a journalist, as a leader in humanitarian agencies, as a \nmember of the National Security Council, as a cofounder of the \nModernizing Foreign Assistance Network, and as a seasoned and senior \nleader who can help bring strong leadership to USAID at this difficult \nand important time.\n  Four months later, she has yet to be confirmed by this body. We have \nbroad bipartisan support for this nominee yet fail to move her forward \ndue to a hold by one Member. I think this points to a longer challenge \nthat this body faces because you also heard from the Senator from New \nHampshire of an attempt to move forward the Land and Water Conservation \nFund, which yesterday expired.\n\n\n    Bulletproof Vest Partnership Program and Child Advocacy Centers\n\n  Mr. President, I cannot yield without commenting on how hard I worked \nin the previous Congress to get reauthorized two critical programs, a \nbulletproof vest partnership program that for years provided tens of \nmillions of dollars to State and local law enforcement for lifesaving \nbulletproof vests, and a reauthorization effort I led for years--both \nof these with bipartisan support--to restore authorization to child \nadvocacy centers--centers that critically support families who have \nbeen harmed by child abuse and allow local law enforcement to pursue \neffective prosecutions.\n  It is unconscionable that this body yesterday, September 30, allowed \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund to expire, allowed a whole range \nof child nutrition and school lunch authorizing programs to expire, and \nallowed the James Zadroga 9/11 first responders act to expire. One of \nthe very first bills I cosponsored and was proud to support as a new \nSenator 5 years ago was the James Zadroga 9/11 first responders act, \nwhich provides support for those who raced to the site of the 9/11 \ncatastrophe, risked their lives, and today suffer lasting health \neffects from it.\n  The idea that this body allowed that funding to expire yesterday and \nthat many of the folks who are the beneficiaries of that fund now face \nthe extinction of their medical support is unacceptable to me. So \nbefore I yield the floor, I simply wanted to commend my colleague for \nraising the issue of Gayle Smith's nomination at this unique time of \nglobal humanitarian challenges.\n  USAID cannot effectively do its job without a confirmed leader. I \nremind everybody in this body that when we fail to work together, when \nbills expire, it has real consequences, not just for humanitarian \nissues overseas but for our own first responders who we are pledged to \nsupport. I say it is a shame on this body that we allowed the 9/11 \nJames Zadroga first responders act to expire, that we allowed the \nauthorizing statutes for the summer lunch and school lunch programs to \nexpire, and that we have allowed the Land and Water Conservation Fund \nto expire.\n  It is my hope that we will begin to work together in this place and \nto stop allowing nominations to rest for months and to stop allowing \nthe expiration of valuable statutes that underlie our security at home \nand abroad.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n5 minutes, after which point I will be followed by the Senator from \nMontana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Russia\n\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, 3 years ago when President Obama's \nopponent said that Russia was our chief geopolitical rival, President \nObama chuckled and said: ``The 1980s called and they want their foreign \npolicy back.''\n  Well, now the 1930s are calling President Obama, and they want their \nforeign policy back. Yesterday was the anniversary of Munich. How \nfitting that Russia conducted its first major military operations \noutside of its near abroad since the end of the Cold War on that \nanniversary in Syria yesterday, because the President's foreign policy \nhas invited exactly this kind of provocation all around the world. \nPresident Obama and Secretary Kerry keep saying that they don't know \nwhat Russian intentions are, that they don't know Russia's goals are in \nthe region.\n  It is very simple. So let me lay it out clearly. Russia is an enemy. \nVladimir Putin is a KGB spy who views the world as a zero-sum game. In \nthe short term, he intends to prop up his tyrannical ally Bashar al-\nAssad, and he wants to preserve access to his expeditionary military \nbases outside of his country.\n  In the medium term, he wants to either preserve Assad or he wants to \nreplace him with a like-minded ally. He wants to diminish the power and \nprestige of the United States in the region. He wants to establish \nRussia as the main Middle East power broker, and he wants to divert \nattention from his continued occupation of Ukraine.\n  In the long term, he sees an opportunity to divide EU and divide NATO \nat lower risk than it would take to conduct military operations such as \nEstonia or Latvia. If Europeans are going to be divided because of a \nrefugee crisis of a few hundred thousand, imagine what could happen \nwhen Vladimir Putin turns up the heat in Syria and drives hundreds of \nthousands or more of those refugees into Europe.\n  How has this come to pass? Why would he think he could get away with \nall of this? Because of the unending series of concessions and \nappeasement of Barack Obama toward Vladimir Putin. Before he was even \nelected to office in 2008, when Vladimir Putin invaded Georgia, Barack \nObama--then a candidate--called for Georgia to exercise restraint while \nthey were under an invasion.\n  Just a couple of months later, he called for a reset in relations \nwhile there were still Russian troops on Georgian soil. A few months \nafter that, he withdrew missile defense systems from the Czech Republic \nand Poland--on the 70th anniversary of Russia's invasion of Poland--\nwithout so much as a heads-up and without getting anything in return.\n  He entered into the New START treaty, which allows Russia to continue \nto grow their nuclear forces or requires the United States to reduce \nours. In a ``hot mic'' moment, he was caught with Dmitry Medvedev, \npromising more flexibility toward Russia after the election of 2012. He \nfought tooth and nail against the Magnitsky human rights act, only \naccepting it once he realized it had overwhelming bipartisan support in \nCongress. He continues to look the other way as Russia violates the \nIntermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. He jumped at the opportunity \nthat Vladimir Putin provided him in 2013 to avoid carrying out his \nairstrikes in Syria and to enforce his own red line.\n  Just as in Georgia, when Vladimir Putin invaded Crimea, he demanded \nrestraint from the government of Ukraine. When Vladimir Putin began to \nconduct operations in eastern Ukraine, he looked the other way, he \nimposed weak sanctions. To this day, he refuses to arm them in the ways \nthey are desperately calling for.\n  So what should we do now? Again, I think it is very simple. Let me \nlay it out. We should make it clear that Vladimir Putin and Russia will \nnot be a power in the Middle East. We should pressure our partners to \ndo the same thing. We should establish no-fly zones in Syria and make \nit clear that any aircraft that enters those zones will be shot down. \nWe should make it clear that we will fly where we want and when we \nwant, that any aircraft in Syria--or, for that matter, in the vicinity \nof a NATO country--that turns on the transponder will be shot down as a \nmenace to civil aviation and to our allies. We should ramp up our \nairstrikes in Syria against our enemies such as the Islamic State. We \nshould threaten Iran with termination of the nuclear deal because they \nare continuing to provide support for Bashar al-Assad. We should make \nit clear that Israel retains the right to interdict missile shipments \nfrom Iran through Syria to the terrorist group Hezbollah.\n  Let's not forget about Ukraine and Europe. We should arm Ukranian \nforces. We should give them the intelligence they need on Russian \nforces and rebels who are amassing on their border. We should enhance \nsanctions\n\n[[Page S7073]]\n\nby expanding them across all sectors. We should move troops to base \nthem--at least temporarily, if not permanently--on our eastern NATO \nflank in places such as Estonia and Latvia.\n  Some say these responses will be provocative, but where will Putin's \nprovocations end? What is really provocative is American weakness.\n  Putin is humiliating the United States. If we don't draw a line now \nand enforce it, it will not be a choice between humiliation or war; it \nwill be a choice between humiliation and war.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                    Land and Water Conservation Fund\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I do wish to go back to the comments of \nthe good Senator from New Hampshire on the Land and Water Conservation \nFund, and I want to associate myself with those remarks.\n  I also wish to add for the record that there is a fair amount of this \nmoney that is spent for land acquisition from the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. That is not a bad thing. Get some of the in-holdings \nout of being in-holdings. It helps with management, and it helps with \nmanagement costs.\n  I will tell you, if you are a fisherman or a hunter in this country, \naccess and habitat is a huge issue, and the Land and Water Conservation \nFund is all about access for hunters, fishermen, bike riders, \nbirdwatchers, and all those folks, and habitat for big game and \nfisheries.\n  For this fund to expire for the first time ever is a travesty. You \nare right. We spent $306 million on it the last 2 years; we were \nsupposed to have spent $900 million in this fund, and that is why there \nis the reserve there is. Quite frankly, if you take a look at the \nUnited States, you take a look at the in-holdings, and you take a look \nat the recreational opportunities out there--$306 million isn't enough. \nYet this fund has expired and is not authorized.\n  In Montana alone, just for the record, recreational opportunities add \n$6 billion, with a ``b,'' to our economy. We are a State of 1 million \npeople--$6 billion to our economy. It employs over 64,000 people, and \nthat doesn't count the businesses that moved to Montana for the \nrecreational opportunities nor the people who come to work for those \nbusinesses for the recreational opportunities. I just wanted to get \nthat into the Record.\n  Mr. President, I wish to talk about the bill under consideration, the \nMilitary Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill, and I \nexpress my opposition to that bill.\n  Why? We just heard a presentation on the floor a minute ago from the \nSenator who talked about shooting down planes and potentially going to \nwar. The amount that it costs to take care of our veterans is a cost of \nwar, and we are underfunding the VA today by over $800 million. I \nexpress my deep disappointment in the majority's inability to recognize \nthe true cost of sending this Nation, young men and women, into harm's \nway.\n  Veterans Day is 6 weeks from now. Many of the folks in this Chamber \nwill go back to their home States where they will be attending \nceremonies and taking photos of men and women who are in uniform. We \nwill give speeches and talk about our profound gratitude to the \nveterans and their families who have sacrificed so much for their \ncountry.\n  In the meantime, you will see a flurry of press statements from \nSenators, oftentimes patting themselves on their backs for extending \nbenefits to veterans or enhancing the quality and timeliness of their \ncare, or you will hear Senators and Congressmen lamenting on the lack \nof leadership within the VA and taking the VA to task for not \nperforming up to their expectations. But there is one thing many of \nthose Members of Congress will not do, and that is give the VA the \nresources it needs to serve the men and women who have served this \ncountry and the military.\n  Right now, the VA is under greater demand for services and subject to \na higher degree of accountability than any other time in this \nDepartment's history. After a decade of war in the Middle East, that \ndemand should be expected to be high. After recent allegations of \nmismanagement and wrongdoing, that accountability is absolutely \nwarranted, but the standard we are holding the VA to should be the \nstandard we hold ourselves to.\n  Is Congress doing the very best that it can do to ensure our Nation's \nveterans can access the health care and the benefits they have earned? \nGiven the appropriations bill before us, the answer to that question \nis: No, we are not.\n  Our job is to make sure the VA is working for all veterans and to \nmake sure it can work for all veterans. That means holding the VA \naccountable and ensuring it operates in full transparency, but that \nalso means the VA has to have the capacity to meet the current needs of \nthe demand for its services and to meet those demands into the future.\n  It requires rigorous oversight. Today's President understands that. \nThere is no doubt about that, but it also requires giving the VA the \ntools and the resources it needs to get the job done.\n  Let's be clear. I believe this bill sets the VA up for failure. There \nare folks on the other side who are demanding that the VA fix itself, \nbut in order to fix itself, we have to give it the tools it needs to do \nthat. We are refusing to do that in this bill. We are setting up the VA \nfor failure, and that failure will result in failing our veterans.\n  If this bill is enacted, it could mean that 68,500 fewer veterans are \nreceiving the VA medical care they need, including veterans such as a \nconstituent of mine from Reed Point, MT. This man had an eye exam in \nearly February and received a prescription for a new pair of glasses. \nHe was told he would receive them in 4 to 6 weeks, but due to a large \nbacklog, he did not receive them until July. It took 5 months to get \nthis man glasses.\n  How are we going to improve the quality of care for veterans if the \nVA budget isn't where it needs to be?\n  Take the story of Perry, who is 67 years old. He has a 100-percent \nservice disability due to Agent Orange exposure in Vietnam. He relies \non the VA for lifesaving cancer treatment. Without chemotherapy and \nspecialty care, Perry's prognosis is not good. To make matters worse, \nthe VA can approve only six appointments at a time, which is a real \nchallenge for Perry because he is receiving treatment 5 days a week. So \nevery week he has to fill out another round of paperwork to qualify for \nmedical care.\n  These are real folks who served their county. They are veterans who \nhave real issues with the VA today at current funding levels.\n  Do we think these problems are going to be easier to solve if we give \nthem an underfunded budget? They won't be.\n  Over the last 14 years, we fought 2 wars in the Middle East. Almost \n10,000 Americans are still involved in a fight in Afghanistan at this \nvery moment. For them, this war is far from over, and for many people \nin this Chamber--some who led us into the war in Iraq--they refuse to \nadmit these are also the true costs of war, taking care of our \nveterans.\n  When we send young men and women over there and we put these wars on \nAmerica's credit card as we did--financed by China, Japan, and others--\nwe do not bother to factor in what it would cost to meet their health \ncare and educational requirements when they come back home. Honoring \nour commitment to veterans is a cost of war and one that we should \nnever forget about. Those who came home are now suffering from physical \nwounds but also wounds we cannot see. As I said yesterday, at least 22 \nveterans are taking their own lives every single day, and $1 billion \nless won't help the VA get these men and women back on their feet and \ngive them the mental health care that they need.\n  The VA also faces unprecedented demand for new treatments of diseases \nsuch as hepatitis C, which are shorter in duration, with fewer side \neffects, and that have cure rates--and this is very good news--\napproaching 100 percent, but they cost money. As Vietnam veterans reach \nretirement age, that means that nearly half of this Nation's veteran \npopulation will be 65 years of age or older. They are entitled to their \nVA care. After all, they have earned it, and they are going to need \nmore and more of that care in the years ahead.\n  My home State of Montana has the second highest per capita veterans \npopulation in this country. It is a rural State where distance poses a \nmajor obstacle to care. The Choice Act that we\n\n[[Page S7074]]\n\npassed and enacted last year was designed to address many of those \nobstacles that rural veterans face.\n  The VA is also working to establish residency programs in rural \nStates to encourage rural medical providers to locate in those rural \nStates. We need to build off of these efforts and work to ensure they \nare carried out as we intended and as the veterans deserve.\n  Will cutting pay for VA providers help bring more medical \nprofessionals to Montana or Alaska or Oklahoma or North Carolina? The \nanswer is no.\n  I go home nearly every weekend, and when I travel around the State, I \ntalk to veterans. They tell me that getting in the door of that VA can \nbe very frustrating. Shortchanging the VA's medical facilities doesn't \nsolve that problem. Not allowing the VA to hire more doctors and nurses \ndoesn't solve that problem.\n  So today we need to fix this bill because the folks who sacrificed so \nmuch for this country deserve nothing less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR.

On this vote, the yeas are 50, the nays are \n44.\n  Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Military \nConstruction and Veterans Affairs and related agencies appropriations \nbill. I am very encouraged that has finally come before the U.S. \nSenate. I also wish to remind my colleagues that the Senate \nAppropriations Committee has put forward 12 appropriations bills that \nreflect the priorities of the American people and the budget we passed \nin April.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that budget took $7 trillion out of the \nPresident's proposed budget over the next 10 years. Yet here we are \ntoday, in October, facing the reality that since April we have not been \nable to debate on this floor those 12 appropriations bills. You have \nheard all year that we need to get back to regular order, and that \nmeans the Senate needs to bring up and debate each of these 12 bills \nindividually. However, due to Democratic obstructionism, the Federal \nGovernment is operating under a short-term funding measure, and the \nSenate has not been able to debate any of these 12 funding bills.\n  It is time for the political posturing to stop. People back home \ndon't understand. I don't either. Senate Democrats are again acting as \na roadblock in preventing progress. The American people sent us to \ngovern responsibly, and it is time for Senate Democrats to start living \nup to this expectation, particularly when it comes to funding our \ngovernment.\n  In this vote today, Senate Democrats are blocking us from moving \nforward with a bill to fund military construction projects that help \nour troops and support key veterans programs, many of which need reform \nafter being plagued by backlogs and scandals for years.\n  We must make good on our Nation's promise to our veterans and provide \nour troops with the facilities they need to work, train, and fulfill \nthe mission of the U.S. Armed Forces. Senate Democrats just voted \nagainst improvements to the VA electronic health records system so that \nveterans' records are safely and seamlessly accessed among agencies and \nthe private sector. They just voted against increased transparency for \nthe VA disability claims system to reduce the backlog for those \nveterans who need help the most. They just voted against much needed \noversight of VA construction projects, like the VA hospital in Denver, \nCO, that is over $1 billion over budget. Additionally, they just voted \nagainst construction of the second missile defense site in Poland, a \nproject that is an important deterrent against Russian aggression in \nEastern Europe and had been previously scrapped by President Obama.\n  Our Nation is currently dealing with a global security crisis. We \nmust take recent Russian aggressions and the rise of great power \ntraditional rivals very seriously. Yesterday Russia launched airstrikes \nin Syria to prop up President Bashar Al Assad in a strategy Defense \nSecretary Ash Carter described as counterproductive and equated to \n``pouring gasoline on the fire.'' Clearly, we must make sure our troops \nhave the resources they need to protect our country. Because of that, I \nam shocked that my colleagues across the aisle today just voted to \ndelay construction for our military facilities--facilities our troops \ndepend on to train for current conflicts and to prepare for whatever \nthe future holds.\n  Most appalling of all, Senate Democrats voted today to block this \nbill even after we learned that tens of thousands of our veterans have \ndied while waiting for care they need and deserve. This is \nunconscionable, and the brinksmanship we are seeing from Senate \nDemocrats across the aisle is totally unacceptable.\n  Our veterans sacrificed so much for our freedom, and our service men \nand\n\n[[Page S7075]]\n\nwomen are currently putting their lives in jeopardy every day for us \nand our families. We cannot fail them. This bipartisan Federal funding \nbill does a lot of important things for our Nation, but most \nimportantly it supports our American heroes. Like most of my \ncolleagues, I have traveled this year and met with our fighting women \nand men on frontlines. The very best of Americans are in uniform today, \nand they deserve our full support.\n  Today I call on my colleagues across the aisle to stop blocking these \nimportant bills. Let's get them on the floor and negotiate--compromise \nif we have to but get to a conclusion where we can fund the men and \nwomen defending our freedom. We now have 72 days to return to regular \norder and debate these important appropriations bills so the priorities \nof our veterans, our military, and the American people can once and for \nall be restored. I sincerely hope that all the colleagues in this body \nwill not disappoint the American people yet again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before I proceed to the consideration of a \ncolloquy with my colleague from Wisconsin, I just wanted to take a \nmoment. My colleague from Wisconsin brought to my attention that there \nare news reports that have just come out of a tragic mass shooting at a \ncommunity college in Oregon. I believe it is called Umpqua Community \nCollege.\n  I just wanted to ask all who might be watching or are with us in the \nChamber to keep in your thoughts and prayers the families of the \nvictims, which number somewhere around 10, and of the wounded, \nsomewhere around 20, and to also keep the first responders and students \nand faculty and our colleagues who represent the State of Oregon and \nall who have been affected by this tragedy in Oregon in your thoughts \nand prayers. It is just now being reported.\n  I appreciate the forbearance of my colleague and the Chair and the \nother Members present for my taking a moment just to bring that to \neveryone's attention.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I might enter into a \ncolloquy with my colleague from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       National Manufacturing Day\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nmarking National Manufacturing Day, which will be celebrated across the \ncountry tomorrow.\n  The simple fact is that manufacturing has been and continues to be a \nvital part of our economy. But coming from the State of Delaware, I \nknow firsthand the challenges manufacturing has faced in the 20th \ncentury and the challenges it continues to face today.\n  Almost every day I ride the Amtrak train from Wilmington, DE, to \nWashington, DC, and as I look out the window as we pass through the \ncity of Newark, DE, I see the site of the old Chrysler assembly plant. \nEach time I see it, I think about what it was like going to the plant \ngates and visiting with friends and family and the thousands of men and \nwomen who worked shifts for decades at this tremendous automobile \nmanufacturing plant that made the Durango and, for decades before that, \nother models.\n  Every time I see that site, which has now been leveled and is now \nbeing rebuilt, I am reminded that for decades there were men and women \nthere who had one thing in common--good-paying, steady, high-quality \nmanufacturing jobs. Chrysler, General Motors, and other manufacturers, \nwhich used to be at the center of my State's economy, each employing \nthousands of Delawareans, are today gone, and many families and many of \nour communities still feel the impact of those losses. But for the \nthousands of Delawareans who grew up with friends and family working \nevery day at GM, Chrysler, the steel mill, the Avon plant or other now-\ngone manufacturing sites across our State, it is easy to be skeptical \nabout the prospects for a revival of American manufacturing.\n  I am here today with my colleague from the State of Wisconsin to tell \nour fellow Americans that despite those harsh realities, there are real \nreasons for hope. Manufacturing still supports 25,000 jobs in my State. \nSince 2010, our economy, the growing American manufacturing sector, has \ncreated 870,000 new jobs. As production costs have gone up in our \ncompetitors--countries such as China--and as the key input cost of \nenergy has steadily come down, businesses have seen over the last \ndecade that more reliable financial, legal, and engineering structures \nand resources, and cheaper energy here in the United States have made \nAmerican manufacturing more competitive than it has been in decades.\n  Just as important as the number of jobs created in the manufacturing \nsector is the quality and compensation for those jobs. American \nmanufacturing is also responsible today for three-quarters of all \nprivate sector research and development, just illustrating once again \nhow innovative this sector has always been. To stay ahead and to thrive \nin the modern-world economy, manufacturing has to be on the cutting \nedge.\n  While American manufacturing is resurgent today, there is much more \nwe can do together to build on this momentum. That is why Senator \nBaldwin and I are leading a campaign called Manufacturing Jobs for \nAmerica, to focus on four key areas where we together can strengthen \nAmerican manufacturing--first by investing in America's workforce; \nsecond, by expanding access to capital; third, by opening up markets \nabroad; and fourth, by creating the conditions necessary for growth.\n\n[[Page S7076]]\n\n  In the last Congress, the Manufacturing Jobs for America Initiative \nbrought together 27 Senators to introduce 36 different manufacturing \nbills, half of which were bipartisan. Provisions from eight of those \nbills are now law, including our bill to create a national \nmanufacturing strategy that will, for the first time, lay out a \nproactive, comprehensive long-term policy for investing and \nstrengthening American manufacturing, something that all of our major \ncompetitors have long had.\n  The administration has also come forward with strong ideas and \ninitiatives from their investment in nine new manufacturing hubs, \ninnovation institutes around the country, to new Department of Labor \njobs skills programs that would strengthen apprenticeships and job \ntraining. It is our hope that Manufacturing Jobs for America can \ncontinue to play an important role in investing and scaling up these \nideas so they have national impact.\n  We are optimistic that we can continue together to build on the \nprogress we made and pass more of these bills in this Congress. \nAlready, for example, the Career Ready Act has passed the Senate and is \nwaiting to be taken up by the House. This bill would help prepare \nstudents for advanced manufacturing jobs by strengthening school \ncounseling programs and educator professional development. Another \nimportant bill is the Innovators Job Creation Act, which recently \npassed the Senate Finance Committee, and if passed into law, would help \nsmall manufacturers to invest in and scale up their R\n  Still, as we know all too well, passing legislation is never easy, \nand it could take months or even years to get these commonsense \nbipartisan bills passed into law. But there is something Congress can \ndo right now to help support our manufacturing sector.\n  Just last week I stood on this floor and urged my colleagues to \nreauthorize the Export-Import Bank that was allowed to expire earlier \nthis year. The Ex-Im Bank has helped American companies, many of them \nmanufacturers, to sell their goods around the world for more than 80 \nyears, supporting 150,000 American jobs in just this past year. Each \nday we fail to reauthorize this critical tool for American \nmanufacturers who are exporters, we put more and more American jobs at \nrisk.\n  Manufacturers, such as Boeing and GE, are already moving good \nAmerican jobs overseas. GE's announcement that it is moving 350 jobs \nfrom Wisconsin to Canada is a stark example of this new reality, and \nthe reason is simple. GE, and similar companies, can't risk staying in \na country that doesn't have a reliable export credit agency, a tool all \nof our competitors provide, often with much more robust resources than \nEx-Im used to enjoy. Without the backing of such an agency, other \ncountries won't even consider accepting project bids from GE, Boeing or \nothers. I think that is unacceptable, and it should be unacceptable to \nall of our colleagues. It is time for Congress to recognize what is at \nstake for our economy, our manufacturing sector, and American workers \nif we continue to fail to step up and reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank.\n  Finally, I wish to briefly address a broader issue we face with \nAmerican manufacturing, and that is its reputation and its public \nrelations image.\n  While the changing face of manufacturing is a great thing, it is also \na challenge because too often perceptions about manufacturing are stuck \nin the past. I have personally heard from parents and guidance \ncounselors who tell me that they are reluctant to encourage their kids \nand their best students to pursue a career in manufacturing. Why? \nBecause to them, folks from an older generation, manufacturing brings \nto mind dirty factory floors, dangerous work environments, and lower \nwages. Understandably, they don't see these as the viable, promising \ncareer paths that today's advanced manufacturing truly offers.\n  Their worries don't match up with today's reality, where \nmanufacturing jobs require higher skills than ever before, from hard \nmath and engineering skills to the ability to think critically and work \nas part of a team. Most modern manufacturing jobs require a 2-year \ncollege degree, and many require more.\n  In my 5 years as a Senator, I have had the opportunity to visit \ndozens of manufacturers up and down my State of Delaware that are \ncreating new high-quality, high-paying jobs, and I am certain my \ncolleague from Wisconsin has had the same insight.\n  In Delaware, one of those manufacturers is M. Davis, a woman-run, \nfamily owned manufacturer that has been around for over 140 years. They \nproduce sophisticated equipment for industrial companies, such as \nPhilips 66, Air Liquide, and DuPont. Jobs at that manufacturing plant \nrequire high-skilled workers.\n  Another advanced manufacturer in my State is Accudyne, which is far \nmore than a typical company. They produce products, not for average \nconsumers, but they solve highly complex engineering and design \nproblems for some of the world's most prominent firms, from Boeing to \nAirbus to Rolls Royce.\n  Both of these companies understand that the only way to remain \nsuccessful is to develop a highly skilled workforce by encouraging and \nsupporting professional development and recruiting graduates from \nschools such as Delaware Technical Community College and the University \nof Delaware.\n  Unfortunately, it is not just public perception that hasn't kept up \nwith manufacturing's transformation. Job training programs have also \nlagged behind in preparing people with the skills they need to succeed \nin the advanced manufacturing jobs of today.\n  While I have more I would like to say on that topic, at this moment I \nwould like to invite my colleague from the State of Wisconsin to add \nher views and comments to this important conversation about \nmanufacturing in America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Delaware. As \ndid he, I wish to start my remarks by taking a moment to say that my \nthoughts and prayers are with the community of Roseburg, OR, as we \nheard word of yet another senseless act of gun violence. I hope all who \nare listening join us in our thoughts and prayers.\n  I rise today to join my good friend from Delaware and to lend my \nvoice in calling attention to an important day in America. Tomorrow, \nacross the country, the hard-working Americans who get up every day to \nmove our economy forward will create a collective chorus in celebration \nof National Manufacturing Day.\n  At thousands of events in villages, towns, and cities throughout our \nNation, manufacturers will open their doors Friday and show, in a \ncoordinated effort, what manufacturing is today and what it isn't. I am \nso proud to join this effort because by working together during and \nafter National Manufacturing Day, we can shine a spotlight on the need \nfor America to address workforce readiness issues, connect with future \ngenerations, and recognize the important role manufacturing plays in \ncreating an economy that works for everyone.\n  In Wisconsin, we have a long and proud tradition of making things--\npaper, engines, tools, ships, and, yes, cheese, brauts, and beer. We \npossess one of the largest manufacturing sectors in the Nation, \nsupporting a very significant share of our workforce and exporting \nproducts and goods all over America and, in fact, the world. \nManufacturing has long been the backbone of our ``made in Wisconsin'' \neconomy--so much so that we actually celebrate October as Manufacturing \nMonth in Wisconsin. In my State and across our country, manufacturing \nis increasingly an engine of economic growth and innovation and a \nsource of good-paying jobs with high wages and solid benefits. That is \nwhy I strongly believe middle-class families and small businesses and \nmanufacturers who are working so hard to move our economy forward \ndeserve to have both parties in Washington working together to grow our \nmanufacturing economy and create jobs.\n  I am so proud to join my colleague Senator Coons on the floor today \nto highlight National Manufacturing Day. I thank him for his leadership \nand his partnership on our Manufacturing Jobs for America Initiative. \nOur effort aims to build bipartisan support for legislation that will \nmodernize America's manufacturing sector and help American \nmanufacturers grow and create jobs and assist American workers in \ngetting the skills they need to succeed\n\n[[Page S7077]]\n\nin the next generation of manufacturing jobs.\n  Working together, we are trying to do our part to get Washington to \nfocus on manufacturing jobs. This shouldn't be a difficult task, but \nunfortunately Congress has shown itself better at manufacturing one \ncrisis after another instead of working across party lines to \nstrengthen American manufacturing. The fact is, governing by crisis has \ndistracted us from the important work of moving our manufacturing \neconomy forward.\n  Before we all pat ourselves on the back for simply doing our job and \nkeeping the government open for business, let's address one crisis that \nhas not been addressed.\n  Two months ago the Senate did its job and passed a long-term \ntransportation bill with bipartisan support. That legislation sought to \nend this constant cycle of short-term measures. It put people to work \nrebuilding our roads and bridges and ports and creates jobs and will \nboost our economy. It is also important to manufacturers because it \nmakes an investment in a 21st-century American infrastructure that \nprovides businesses with the quality transportation system they need to \nmove their goods to market.\n  This legislation also includes another measure that is vital to \nmanufacturers and businesses in Wisconsin and across America. We \nreauthorized the Export-Import Bank, which is an important tool that \nhelps us create that level playing field, bringing fairness to global \ntrade and giving American manufacturers the resources they need to \nfight and win against their global competition. However, after we \nincluded that in our long-term transportation and infrastructure \npackage in the Senate, the House adjourned for the August recess \nwithout passing that legislation to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank \nand has failed to take action on it for 2 full months. Just this week, \nRepublicans on the House Financial Services Committee voted in lockstep \nto block an amendment to reauthorize the Bank. These actions and \ninactions have real impacts on workers, and they are being felt by \nWisconsin workers and families right now.\n  GE Power & Water announced this week that it plans to stop \nmanufacturing gas engines in Waukesha, WI, and blamed the closure on \nthe House of Representatives for not reauthorizing the Export-Import \nBank. It is a stark reminder that when Congress fails to do its job, \nhard-working people can lose their jobs as a result. It is my hope that \nthis reminder will be heard by Congress. It is also my hope that \nNational Manufacturing Day will provide an opportunity for my \ncolleagues to rally around on the need for us to come together and \naddress the challenges we face to grow our manufacturing economy.\n  The Wisconsin families for whom I work depend on our manufacturing \njobs, and I believe that if we work to give our workers a fair shot, we \ncan compete against anyone. But one of the challenges we must meet is \nmaking sure our workers have the skills they need for the manufacturing \njobs of the future. We are fortunate to have a very strong technical \ncollege system that is working to provide Wisconsin businesses a \nskilled workforce so they can compete and grow.\n  American manufacturing took a huge hit as a result of the 2008 \nfinancial collapse and ensuing recession, but through sheer grit and \ndetermination, we are coming back. U.S. manufacturing added 876,000 \njobs over the past 66 months. Over the past 12 months, manufacturing \nhas added 124,000 jobs. But despite this positive trend, we need to do \nmore. The sector needs to add 1.7 million jobs overall just to return \nto pre-recession levels.\n  In Wisconsin, our economy isn't growing as strong as we need to \ncreate true shared prosperity. In fact, it is lagging behind national \ngrowth. The manufacturing sector that sustained our economy in \nWisconsin for generations must move forward at a stronger pace if \nmiddle-class families are going to get ahead.\n  One of the most important things we can do is to put a stronger focus \non investing in STEM programs and career and technical education. I am \nproud to have cofounded the Career and Technical Education Caucus--\notherwise known as the CTE Caucus--and worked with cochairs Senators \nKaine and Portman to advocate for career and technical education. I \nbelieve CTE is one of the most effective vehicles for responding to \nlabor market changes and the workforce readiness needs of businesses, \nparticularly our manufacturers.\n  We need to do more to ensure that students are better trained and \nbetter equipped for the highly skilled jobs of the future, especially \nin advanced manufacturing. Our business communities have been clear on \nthe need for a highly trained workforce for in-demand fields, and CTE \nprovides the knowledge and skills that can help drive stronger economic \ngrowth for our ``made in America'' manufacturing economy.\n  In closing, I would like to urge my colleagues to join us tomorrow by \nvisiting a local manufacturer in their State.\n  National Manufacturing Day provides our Nation with an important \nopportunity for us to show our commitment to the idea that \nmanufacturing does not represent the jobs of yesterday. Senator Coons \nwas talking about the branding issues. Well, today's manufacturing \neconomy isn't your father's manufacturing economy, and today's factory \nisn't your grandfather's factory. It is a growing industry that has \nchanged from the assembly lines of the past to high-tech innovation \nthat will drive our future. Today, American manufacturing represents \nthe jobs of tomorrow, providing a range of job opportunities in the \narea of skilled production, information technology, design, \nengineering, and science. Our next generation of manufacturers need \nmore skilled workers, and it is our job to work together to make sure \nour economy has them.\n  Let's join together and celebrate National Manufacturing Day and show \nthat our commitment is a celebration of American manufacturing, and \nlet's inspire the next generation of manufacturers.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from Delaware and my colleague from \nMinnesota for their dedication to this vital issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wisconsin, \nSenator Baldwin, for her hard work on manufacturing and for her deep \nand broad experience in what it takes for manufacturing to continue to \ngrow in the State of Wisconsin, in the State of Delaware, and across \nour country.\n  Let me pick up on a theme through both of our previous comments, \nwhich is that skills are a key challenge for us. If we are going to \ntake advantage of the enormous opportunities, the hundreds of thousands \nof unfilled jobs in this sector, one of the key issues is a mismatch in \nskills.\n  One other theme across both of our comments was how we can't work \ntogether across the aisle. Bad things happen, such as the Export-Import \nBank going unauthorized, but when we can team up and work together, we \ncan make remarkable progress.\n  Let me briefly reference two of the bills we have worked on in the \npast which enjoy strong bipartisan support and which I hope can move \nforward in this Congress.\n  One is the Manufacturing Skills Act, and the lead sponsor is Senator \nAyotte of New Hampshire. It would help cities and States to modernize \ntheir job-training programs and equip workers with the skills they \nneed.\n  Another bill, the Manufacturing Universities Act of 2015, of which \nSenator Lindsey Graham is the lead cosponsor, would designate 25 \nmanufacturing universities across the country and invest up to $5 \nmillion per year, per school to redesign their engineering programs so \nthey are focused on the needs of modern manufacturing.\n  Many of the other ideas that have been brought to the floor by \ncolleagues also focus on skills, and let me briefly reference two.\n  Senator Merkley has drafted and introduced the BUILD Career and \nTechnical Education Act to focus on some of the issues the Senator from \nWisconsin was just speaking to--finding innovative ways to improve CTE \neducation in our K-12 system to draw more talented students into the \npipeline for these unfilled but lucrative manufacturing careers.\n  Last but certainly not least, Senator Franken of Minnesota has \ntirelessly worked to promote greater cooperation\n\n[[Page S7078]]\n\nbetween community colleges and their local manufacturing partners. I \nknow in a moment he will share with us his vision for how we can \nimprove skills training in manufacturing.\n  Let me close by simply saying that tomorrow, as we celebrate National \nManufacturing Day, I will be honored to welcome U.S. Commerce Secretary \nPenny Pritzker to Delaware to look at and visit several of the \nmanufacturers I mentioned--Accudyne and M. Davis--and to talk about \nhow, working together at the State and the Federal level, private \nsector and public sector, we can create and maintain strong 21st-\ncentury manufacturing jobs.\n  We see the revitalization that is going on in American manufacturing, \nand we see the opportunity we have in front of us and we want to seize \nit. By enacting bipartisan bills that tackle the challenges I have \ndiscussed, we hope to have the opportunity to make the very difference \nour Nation requires.\n  With that, I yield the floor to the Senator from Minnesota for his \nremarks on National Manufacturing Day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I thank the good Senator from Delaware \nand the Senator from Wisconsin for organizing today's celebration of \nmanufacturing.\n  As my colleague from Delaware mentioned and as I think the Presiding \nOfficer knows, I have talked a lot about the role of community and \ntechnical colleges and training for students for highly skilled jobs in \nmanufacturing, and I will talk about that role in these remarks.\n\n\n                  Shooting at Umpqua Community College\n\n  But first, I heard a few minutes ago about a shooting at a college in \nOregon. I just want to say something about that.\n  First, all of our hearts in the Senate go out to the victims of that \nshooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon and to their families, \ntheir friends, and loved ones.\n  Students at community colleges are often young people who are getting \neducation to prepare them for the future. Very often they are people \nmidcareer who are going back for training to get the kind of skills \nSenator Coons talked about in a new career. The resurgence of \nmanufacturing in the United States and my State of Minnesota should \ninspire us to invest more in training more Americans for these good \nmanufacturing jobs.\n  I don't know what the focus of Umpqua is, but again I believe I speak \nfor everyone in this body that our hearts go out to all the victims and \ntheir loved ones. I don't know whether they are like some community and \ntechnical colleges in Minnesota preparing individuals for jobs in \nmanufacturing.\n\n\n                       National Manufacturing Day\n\n  Manufacturing jobs--we have heard my other colleagues talk about how \nthese are not the old manufacturing jobs. I have heard a manufacturer \nrefer to it as dark, dirty, and dangerous, and it is what a lot of \npeople think of.\n  I go to junior highs and high schools with manufacturers to talk \nabout the high skills and the high-paying jobs that go with today's \nmanufacturing. The most recent data available as of 2010, the average \nannual wage for a manufacturing job in the United States was over \n$56,000--about 22 percent higher than the average wage for all \nindustries. In Minnesota, manufacturing supports jobs for more than \n300,000 Minnesotans. That is about 13 percent of the jobs in our State, \nand manufacturing is responsible for 14 percent of the GDP. \nManufacturing is a huge driver in our economy. We manufacture great \nthings. We did the HVAC system for the new World Trade Center Freedom \nTower.\n  This is why I want to talk about one of the greatest problems our \nmanufacturing States have today; that is, the skills gap. Manufacturers \ncannot find enough skilled workers to help them compete in a global \neconomy. According to Enterprise Minnesota, an organization that \nsupports manufacturers in my State, there are over 6,500 open \nmanufacturing jobs in Minnesota waiting to be filled. My experience \ntalking with manufacturers confirms that they are desperate to hire \ngood people with the right skills for jobs that can support a middle-\nclass life for workers and their families.\n  In the words of just one manufacturer, Kimberly Arrigoni of Haberman \nMachine in Oakdale, MN:\n\n       We are still suffering from a skills gap. . . . For my \n     company specifically, it no longer is a capacity issue \n     because of equipment, but one with people. We are limited in \n     what we can produce and ship out the door because we don't \n     have enough master level machinists. . . . Imagine what this \n     very ripple effect is causing my State and our country as a \n     whole.\n\n  So how can we help our manufacturing industry meet this challenge? \nWell, we took a good first step last year when we passed the bipartisan \nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, WIOA. It was the first \nreauthorization of the Workforce Investment Act in over a decade--\nalmost two. It modernized our workforce development system and improved \ncoordination between workforce boards, education, training programs, \nand local businesses. I think we need to do more to go further, and \nthat is why I will be reintroducing legislation very soon to increase \nFederal investment in workforce training partnerships between employers \nand community and technical colleges.\n  I call it the Community College to Career Fund Act. It would create \ngrants that help businesses and community colleges train workers for \nhigh-skill, good-paying jobs. Businesses and community and tech \ncolleges across my State support the Community College to Career Fund \nAct because they know firsthand--and I have seen firsthand the \ndifferences that these programs can make. Under this program, community \ncolleges and businesses together would apply for grants based on how \nmany jobs their partnership would create, what the value of those jobs \nwould be to the community and, very importantly, how much skin in the \ngame the State, the community or the businesses have.\n  I hope my colleagues will take this up and pass it this year. This is \na great way to address a number of things such as the cost of college. \nI have talked to so many manufacturers who have hired someone who has \njust a credential from a community technological college, hires them \nand then pays them to go back to school while they are working, and \npays for their tuition to finish their associate's degree. They bring \nthem back and say: Go get your bachelor's degree. Go get your 4-year \ncollege degree while you are working, and I will pay for it. These \nare--time and time again, I have seen people, workers who have had \ntheir education paid for, no debt, a couple degrees, and a good job--a \nvery good job.\n  I would like to close with the words of John Johnston from States \nManufacturing in Golden Valley, CO. He writes:\n\n       When my son was young he used to say, ``My daddy works with \n     big machines that go boom, boom, boom.'' My son is now 17 \n     years old and planning a career in manufacturing. He grew up \n     around those machines that go boom.\n\n  Unfortunately, most students these days think manufacturing is not \nfor them. If they could only get in to see how remarkable it is to see \nhow things are really made, they would change their perspective.\n  He goes on:\n\n       Each night at dinner we talk about his ``high of the school \n     day'' and he is so excited to tell me about the new equipment \n     or his next project in manufacturing class. Now it is time to \n     light that fire inside of other students and show them \n     today's manufacturing companies are a great place to have a \n     career.\n\n  A great place to have a career. This story illustrates perfectly why \npromoting manufacturing careers with young people is so important. We \nhave a lot of advantages in this country because of natural gas. We \nhave cheap energy relative to the rest of the world. Because of the \nnature of manufacturing, the main cost now is the technology, and low-\nskilled wages are a much smaller piece. What this country needs are \nhigh-skilled wages. We need more people, more young people especially, \nto take advantage of the opportunities available in manufacturing so we \nwill continue to compete globally and expand as we compete globally.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The majority whip.\n\n\n                              Obstruction\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I continue to read in the newspaper and \nthe press--particularly that which covers our activities in Congress--\ntalk about the shutdown that was averted because we were able to pass a \ncontinuing resolution before the midnight end of the\n\n[[Page S7079]]\n\nfiscal year on Wednesday night. I would like to reflect just a few \nminutes on what the cause of this drama is and where the responsibility \nactually lies for all of this shutdown drama, which would be completely \nunnecessary if the Senate and the Congress were permitted to basically \ndo our job.\n  For example, just this afternoon our Democratic friends decided to \nfilibuster legislation that would help our veterans and our men and \nwomen in uniform because it would fund the full range of services to \nveterans and the construction of military facilities. If you think \nabout that for a moment, it becomes even more outrageous because the \nidea that in order to force this side of the aisle to the table, in \norder to spend more money and raise taxes, that you would hold our \nveterans and our military hostage is really remarkable, certainly \nnothing to be proud of, and something that needs to be called out and \nidentified for what it is.\n  The only reason we have had to go through this process on a \ncontinuing resolution--and, by the way, for those who are not familiar \nwith the continuing resolution, what that means is we are continuing \nfor a period of time now--until December 11--the current spending \npolicies of the Federal Government. That means we are side-stepping the \nAppropriations Committee, where outdated or obsolete programs are \ndiscarded or if there are multiple government programs that could be \nconsolidated that could be made more effective or efficient, or if, \nheaven forbid, we could actually save some money and apply it to \npriorities or maybe help reduce our deficit--that is where that should \nbe happening, but the obstruction of our friends across the aisle who \nare dead set on forcing us to the negotiating table so they can force \nthe Federal Government to spend more money is outrageous.\n  We have had two previous votes on the Defense appropriations bill, \nwhich is even more immediately directed to help support our families \nand the men and women in uniform, many of whom are serving in harm's \nway. It is amazing to me how many people will come to the Senate floor \nor in the other body, the House of Representatives, and talk about \ntheir devotion and dedication to our military and our veterans--and \nthey should. Our military and our veterans deserve our devotion and \nappreciation and every honor we can bestow on them. But the idea that \nyou would on one hand talk like that and then come to the floor and \nblock legislation that funds their paycheck or pays for their benefits \nif they are a veteran and keeps the commitment we have made to them--it \nreally is outrageous and is just another reason why the American \npeople--everybody outside of the beltway--hold Congress and Washington \nin such low regard. We are, after all, a self-governing people, and \nwhen people hold their government in low regard and lose confidence in \ntheir government, basically they lose confidence in themselves and in \nour country and in our ability to control our destiny or at least try \nto point us in a better direction.\n  Earlier on, I believe it was the senior Senator from New York who \ngave an interview to the New York Times. He talked about the fact that \nthe Democrats were going to have a ``filibuster summer,'' and now that \nhas sort of slopped over into a filibuster fall, apparently. Why? For \nwhat reason? What is the good reason? Well, it is not for a good \nreason, but it is for this reason: so they can force Republicans, the \nmajority, to the negotiating table to spend more money.\n  Then there is the White House. There is no leadership out of the \nWhite House on fiscal matters whatsoever. This morning the White House \nthreatened to veto this very bill, assuming it would pass the Congress. \nAgain, why? Well, because it complies with the current law and \nbudgetary restrictions under the Budget Control Act. You might ask, \nwell, why are they offended by that? Why is that a problem? Well, that \nis a good question, actually, because the President himself signed the \nBudget Control Act into law, and the very caps on spending that have \nkept discretionary spending at 2007 levels are caps he signed into law.\n  The idea that you would hold our troops and veterans hostage is \nincredible. Why? Because the President and the minority, the Democrats, \nrefuse to adhere to budget spending caps the President signed into law.\n  You know, we hear a lot of discussion about these caps and \nsequestration. These are the automatic spending caps on discretionary \nspending. They were actually proposed by the President and his team at \nthe White House in the first place. So it would require a certain \ndegree of cognitive dissonance or maybe willing suspension of disbelief \nto read over the White House's veto threat on this particular bill and \nto take it seriously.\n  We are going to continue to press our Democratic colleagues to return \nthis body to what we like to call regular order around here--in other \nwords, doing our job, what we were elected to do.\n  This whole idea of holding our troops and veterans hostage in order \nto force more government spending is beyond outrageous. With everything \nhappening in the world, I don't doubt it is hard for this message to \npenetrate, but the reason we continue to operate on continuing \nresolutions and temporary patches, such as the one that was just passed \nthat goes to December 11, is because of the obstruction on the other \nside of the aisle, these filibusters.\n  We have a lot of work cut out for us by that December 11 deadline. \nBefore that deadline, we have to deal with an expiring highway bill. We \npassed a multiyear highway bill here in the Senate and sent it to the \nHouse. My hope is that they will use this time up until October 29 to \npass a highway bill and that we can get to a conference and work out \nthe differences and settle that one important piece of business. I come \nfrom a big State. We need those resources in order to maintain and \nbuild our highway system, for public safety, for the environment, and \nfor the economy. So I hope we can get that done.\n  We are going to have another big drama here as a result of the \nDemocrats filibustering these appropriations bills called an Omnibus \nappropriations bill. In other words, what is set up to happen as a \nresult of the obstruction on the other side of the aisle by blocking \nall of these appropriations bills is we are going to have to consider \nall of the funding for the Federal Government for perhaps the next \nyear. We are going to have to vote on that one big bill--probably $1 \ntrillion or more--in December. That is a horrible way to do business. \nFirst of all, it is not transparent. Our constituents cannot hope to \nread that legislation and understand all of the ramifications of it and \nwhat it might mean. It also, frankly, is susceptible to being larded \nwith things that really aren't necessary, that would not pass under \nother circumstances but are put on a must-pass piece of legislation.\n  So you are going to hear more drumbeats--I will close with this--\nabout shutdowns and cliffs and the irresponsibility of Congress in not \nmeeting our basic obligations. There is one reason for that under the \npresent circumstances; it is because our Democratic friends have chosen \nto filibuster and to stop the Senate from doing its business the way we \nshould be doing our business in an orderly, transparent, responsible, \nand accountable sort of way. The way we do that is by taking up \nindividual appropriations bills and passing them. If we did it that \nway, there would be no government shutdown drama if one or two \nappropriations bills did not get passed for some reason, if there was \nsome delay. So this is really the source of all of this shutdown \ndrama--the obstruction of our Democratic colleagues, preventing us from \ndoing our basic business of governing and making sure we are doing what \nwe promised to do when each of us stood for election in front of our \nvoters.\n  I see the junior Senator from Montana is here. I know one of the \nthings that motivated many of our new Senators is the desire to come \nhere and put our fiscal house in order. We are not even talking about \ndoing some of the things we should do, some of the things we need to do \nto reduce the deficit--the difference between what we spend and what \ncomes in--much less the debt, which is in the $18 trillion range, which \nis unbelievable.\n  So these young men and women who are serving as pages--we are leaving \nbehind for them a financial burden which is simply immoral. It is just \nnot right. The promises that were made back when Social Security and \nMedicare were passed--that they would be\n\n[[Page S7080]]\n\nthere for you in your later years--I have not met a young person today \nwho thinks Social Security or Medicare is going to be there for them \nbecause, frankly, they are going to run out of money on the current \npath they are on.\n  So we have a lot to do. Believe me, the country is upset. People are \nangry. They are scared. They are worried about their families and about \ntheir future. They are worried about their security. When they look at \nthe TV set or read the newspaper and see how a willful minority can \nsimply shut down our ability to do our job and conduct the Nation's \nbusiness, their anger and their frustration and their fear are \njustified.\n  We can do better. I hope and pray we will.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                        Remembering Jean Turnage\n\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Jean \nTurnage, the former Montana Supreme Court chief justice and a State \nsenate president who passed away earlier this week.\n  Chief Justice Turnage was a true public servant who always put \nMontana and this Nation first. He is remembered as a fair and tolerant \njudge and a true gentleman legislator. As both a legislator and judge, \nhe had a genius for solving conflicts and bridging differences--a \nquality that is far too rare in public service.\n  Chief Justice Turnage was part of a dying breed of the ``greatest \ngeneration'' and was a true statesman. As a World War II veteran, a \nState legislator, and chief justice of the Montana Supreme Court, \nJustice Turnage truly exemplified our State's strong legacy of service. \nHis passing is a great loss for Montana.\n  On behalf of all Montanans, I wish to recognize Jean for his decades \nof service to Montana and to this Nation. Our thoughts and prayers are \nwith the Turnage family during this time of loss.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Grassley pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2123 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Religious Liberty\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, last week I came to the floor to speak on \nthe subject of religious liberty in America. I explained why religious \nliberty matters, why it is important, and why it deserves special \nprotection from government interference.\n  I also used my remarks to welcome Pope Francis to Washington and to \nrecognize the historic nature of his visit. I was struck by the Pope's \nemphasis on religious liberty while he was here and by his concern for \nthe state of religious liberty, not just around the world, but in the \nUnited States as well.\n  In his address at the White House, Pope Francis said that many \nAmerican Catholics are ``concerned that efforts to build a just and \nwisely ordered society respect . . . the right to religious liberty,'' \nand he called on all Americans to ``be vigilant . . . to preserve and \ndefend [religious] freedom from everything that would threaten or \ncompromise it.''\n  Before Congress, Pope Francis, spoke of the delicate balance required \nto combat violence and extremism while at the same time safeguarding \nreligious liberty. And in Philadelphia, he declared that the right of \nreligious exercise extends well beyond the church door. He said:\n\n       Religious freedom certainly means the right to worship God, \n     individually and in community, as consciences dictate. But \n     religious liberty, by its nature, transcends places of \n     worship and the private sphere of individuals and families.\n\n  Like Pope Francis, I too am concerned about threats to religious \nfreedom in the United States. Last week, I announced my intention to \ngive a series of speeches on the subject of religious liberty, and I \ncontinue with that purpose today by speaking about the history of \nreligious liberty in America.\n  As my remarks will show, concern for religious liberty has been a \ncritical feature of our Nation from the beginning. The desire to enjoy \nthe freedom to live one's faith was a motivating factor for many of our \nearliest settlers. Once here, they set about creating societies in \nwhich religion could have full room to flourish. At times they fell \nprey to the same sectarian narrowmindedness that bedeviled the nations \nof Europe, but on the whole our forebears enjoyed and permitted a \nbroader range of religious freedom than could be found most anywhere in \nthe world or the planet at that time.\n\n  As the heirs of their efforts, we have the obligation to continue \ntheir commitment to religious liberty. Freedom of religion is part of \nthe very fabric of our Nation. It is not only enshrined in the text of \nour First Amendment, it also permeates our history, our very identity \nas a nation. Protecting and promoting freedom of religion is at the \nheart of the American project.\n  Let's begin at the beginning. The first permanent European settlers \nhere in America were Pilgrims seeking to escape religious oppression. \nLeaders such as John Winthrop guided Puritans and other groups of \nPilgrims from Europe to the New World in search of a place where they \ncould practice their religious beliefs according to their own \nconscience.\n  The Pilgrims' journey to Massachusetts Bay is considered such an \nimportant part of the American story that a mural depicting the \nembarkation of the Pilgrims hangs in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol. \nThis great painting stands as a symbol and constant reminder of \nAmerica's place as a safe harbor for those seeking religious liberty.\n  Following the success of the Puritans, other religious minorities, \nincluding the Quakers, Congregationalists, Baptists, Jews, Methodists, \nPresbyterians, and a host of German and Dutch sects, came to the \nAmerican Colonies to practice their faith in peace. Unfortunately, many \nof these minorities did not find the religious tolerance they had hoped \nfor. The Massachusetts Bay Colony, for example, punished heretics and \nadopted the Old World view that nonadherence to the state religion was \na crime against the state. True to the American ideal, however, these \nreligious minorities did not give in. Instead, they pressed on in \nsearch of new locales where the promise of religious freedom could be \nfound full bloom.\n  Roger Williams, the founder of the first Baptist church in America, \nwas among the most notable dissenters from religious orthodoxy. \nWilliams believed that the church in Massachusetts was not sufficiently \nseparated from the church of England and openly questioned the \nlegitimacy of the Colony's charter.\n  Forced to flee his home in Boston for fear of being arrested, \nWilliams found refuge among the Natives. He went on to purchase land \nfrom the Massasoit tribe and established a new settlement that he gave \nthe rather auspicious name ``Providence.'' A few years later, \nProvidence and several other communities joined together to form the \nRhode Island Colony--the first Colony in the New World--to offer \nreligious liberty to all sects. Citizens in Rhode Island could attend \nthe church of their choice without fear of government reprisal.\n  Mr. President, we see in the founding of Rhode Island the seed of the \nidea that all people should be free to practice their faith. If \nMassachusetts represented the flight of persecution, then Rhode Island \nconstituted the next step in the path toward religious freedom--the \nextension of free exercise.\n  Rhode Island was not the only safe harbor in the New World for \nreligious minorities. There was also Pennsylvania, which was named for \nWilliam Penn, a Quaker. English authorities imprisoned Penn in the \nTower of London for writing pamphlets critical of the Church of \nEngland. After he was released, Penn established the Pennsylvania \nColony as a refuge for practitioners of his own Quaker faith.\n  Another example is the Dutch Colony of New Netherland, later known as \nNew\n\n[[Page S7081]]\n\nAmsterdam and today known as New York. When New Amsterdam was founded \nin 1625, its Articles of Transfer assured New Netherlanders that they \ncould ``keep and enjoy the liberty of their consciences in religion.'' \nNo city better symbolizes the religious diversity of America than New \nYork City, which should be unsurprising given that New York was one of \nAmerica's earliest havens of religious liberty and tolerance.\n  It bears mention that although many of the early American Colonies \naspired to provide religious liberty to all citizens, colonial America \noften fell short of this ideal. In 1689, for example, England's \nParliament enacted the Act of Toleration, which granted freedom to non-\nAnglicans to hold their own religious services provided they properly \nregistered their ministers and places of worship. However, the act did \nnot extend the right to hold public office to nonconformists and \nexplicitly excluded Catholics and Unitarians from all benefits provided \nby the act. Moreover, ministers of minority sects could be imprisoned \nfor failing to apply for licenses or for preaching outside of \nauthorized locations. In 1774, Virginia authorities imprisoned some 50 \nBaptist ministers for failing to heed the Toleration Act's \nrequirements.\n\n  That the trajectory of religious liberty in America has not always \nbeen a straight line, however, does not diminish the centrality of \nreligious freedom to the American ideal or to the history and growth of \nour Nation. Looking back centuries later, we rightly criticize colonial \nleaders for failing to give full freedom to religious practitioners. \nBut the initial failure of some colonial leaders to live up to the \nideal was ultimately overwhelmed by the success of later colonists and \nby the significance of religious liberty through the entire American \nproject.\n  As I said last week, our Nation exists because of religious liberty. \nThe freedom to practice one's faith was central to the founding and \ngrowth of the American Colonies. Furthermore, the guarantees of \nreligious liberty found in the colonial charters, coupled with the \nbreadth of religious diversity in pre-revolution America, are nothing \nshort of remarkable. As Stanford professor Michael McConnell--one of \nthe great constitutional experts in our country--has noted, in the \nyears leading up to the Revolution, America had ``already experienced \n150 years of a higher degree of religious diversity than had existed \nanywhere else in the world.''\n  I come now to the American Revolution and subsequent ratification of \nthe Constitution. It was through these crucial events that the ideal of \nreligious liberty had so long motivated the colonists to become part of \nour fundamental charter of government.\n  George Washington, while leader of the Continental Army, issued a \ncommand concerning religious liberty to the revolutionary troops: \n``[A]s far as lies in your power, you are to protect and support the \nfree exercise of the religion of the Country, and the undisturbed \nenjoyment of the rights of conscience in religious matters, with your \nutmost influence and authority.''\n  That was George Washington.\n  Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence, \nlikewise emphasized the centrality of religious freedom for our new \nNation. In 1786, the Virginia Legislature adopted a statute on \nreligious freedom written by none other than Thomas Jefferson. This law \nsaid that ``all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to \nmaintain, their opinions in matter of religion, and that the same shall \nin no wise diminish, enlarge or affect their civil capacities.''\n  Jefferson's words in the Statute for Religious Freedom had a profound \ninfluence on James Madison, whom we revere today as the father of the \nConstitution. Madison reflected Jefferson's vision in his own writings, \ndeclaring that ``[t]he religion of every man must be left to the \nconviction and conscience of every man to exercise it as these may \ndictate.''\n  The original Constitution, ratified in 1788, did not contain a bill \nof rights because the Framers believed the structure they had created \nwould effectively guard against tyranny. They also worried that \nenumerating rights could lead to mischief, as officials might argue \nthat any right not enumerated did not exist. But the Framers eventually \nreversed course, and a few years later Madison drafted and the States \nratified the first 10 amendments to the Constitution.\n  The first of these amendments formalized the guarantee of religious \nliberty already found in many State constitutions and deeply embedded \nin the fabric of American society. The words are familiar to all \nAmericans: ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of \nreligion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.'' The principle \nthat had motivated the initial settlement of America and that had grown \nand matured in concert with the growth and maturation of the Colonies \nthemselves had found expression in our fundamental charter.\n  Of course, ratification of the First Amendment is not the end of the \nstory. From the founding generation down to the present day, the \nimportance of religious liberty to the American ideal has continued to \nmanifest itself in a variety of ways.\n  Consider the experience of the Ursuline nuns of New Orleans. These \nFrench sisters were the first congregation of Roman Catholic nuns in \nthe United States. They came to America in the early 1700s and settled \nin New France, which later became Louisiana.\n  Following the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the sisters of the Ursuline \nConvent grew concerned that they would lose their rights to their \nproperty and mission now that their charter was under the jurisdiction \nof the United States.\n  The mother superior of the Ursulines petitioned President Thomas \nJefferson to ask that the sisters be allowed to keep their property in \nNew Orleans. President Jefferson responded powerfully, telling the \nSisters: ``The principles of the Constitution and government of the \nUnited States are a sure guarantee to you that [your property] will be \npreserved to you sacred and inviolate and that your institution will be \npermitted to govern itself according to its own rules, without \ninterference from the civil authority.''\n  President Jefferson spoke the truth. Indeed, the Old Ursuline Convent \nand Mission survives to this day. It is located in New Orleans' famous \nFrench Quarter and is the oldest building in the Mississippi River \nValley. The Old Ursuline Convent is an emblem of the vitality and \ncentrality of religious liberty in American life. A persecuted \nreligious minority, unpopular in its day and even reviled in some \nbackward segments of society, received a personal guarantee from the \nPresident of the United States that their rights and property would \nremain secure under the protection of the U.S. Government. Here we see \nreligious liberty not only as ideal but as reality.\n  To return to my earlier formulation, Massachusetts represented the \nflight from religious persecution, Rhode Island and other Colonies the \nextension of free exercise. Now in the Constitution we have the \nguarantee of religious liberty to all people in all places within the \njurisdiction of our great land.\n  The Constitution and its guarantee of free exercise is the \nculmination of the process that began when the Pilgrims first set foot \non the Mayflower way back in 1620. But the Constitution is only as \neffective as we, through our fidelity, make it. Regrettably, the \nguarantee of free exercise has at times been undermined or even \nabridged by narrowminded sectarianism or fear of new creeds. Such \ndivergence from the promise of religious liberty is not cause to \nquestion the continuing value of religion or to claim that the promise \nof religious freedom is a false promise. Rather, it is reason to \ndedicate ourselves to the ideal enshrined in our Constitution that all \nmen and women have an inalienable right to choose for themselves what \nthey believe and how they will practice their beliefs.\n\n  As many of my colleagues know, I am a descendent of the early Mormon \npioneers who, much like the Pilgrims of the Mayflower, fled persecution \nand discrimination by abandoning their homes for a new place of refuge. \nIn the case of the Mormon pioneers, they migrated, many by foot and in \nharsh conditions, in a mass exodus across the Great Plains over the \nRocky Mountains, and, finally, into Salt Lake Valley and other \nsettlements throughout the Intermountain West. Brigham Young was a \ngreat colonizer and sent people all over the West to settle the West. \nOne of the attributes of the Mormon pioneers that I admire most is\n\n[[Page S7082]]\n\nthat after having endured mob violence, the martyr of their prophet, \nthe burning of their homes and places of worship, and their forced \nflight into the American wilderness, they never lost their deep love of \nthe United States and our Constitution. I am very pleased the people of \nUtah remain a deeply patriotic people, with a profound respect and \nadmiration for our Constitution.\n  In more recent years, our leaders have continued to reaffirm the \nimportance of religious liberty in American life. In 1948, the United \nStates was one of the original signers of the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights, which proclaims that every person has the right to \nfreedom of religion, including the right to ``manifest his religion or \nbelief in teaching, practice, worship or observance.''\n  Four decades later, in 1990, Congress passed the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act, or RFRA, a crucially important piece of legislation \nthat prohibits government from substantially burdening a person's \nexercise of religion unless doing so is necessary to further a \n``compelling government interest.'' I was honored to be one of the \nprincipal authors of RFRA and count its passage of one of the greatest \nmoments of our time in this body. The bill passed the Senate 97 to 3 \nand passed the House without recorded opposition. An enormous coalition \nof groups from across the ideological spectrum--including the ALCU, the \nAmerican Muslim Council, the Anti-Defamation League, the Christian \nLegal Society, and the National Council of Churches--came together in \nsupport of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The breadth and depth \nof support for RFRA was a sign of the enduring importance of religious \nliberty in American life. Indeed, RFRA demonstrated that religious \nliberty is the rare issue that unites Americans of all stripes.\n  One other recent marker of the continuing significance of religious \nfreedom in America is found, interestingly enough, in a bill aimed at \nprotecting religious freedom in other countries. In 1998, Congress \nunanimously passed the International Religious Freedom Act, which \ncreated an ambassador-at-large for International Religious Freedom \nwithin the State Department and a bipartisan U.S. Commission on \nInternational Religious Freedom. The very first words of the act \nproclaim that ``[t]he right to freedom of religion undergirds the very \norigin and existence of the United States.''\n  This statement, approved by all 535 Members of Congress and signed \ninto law by the President, encapsulates the overarching theme of my \nremarks today. Freedom of religion is central to the American ideal and \nto the history and development of our Nation. From the earliest \nsettlers to the revolutionary generation, to the 19th century, to the \nmodern day, religious freedom has been a driving force in American \nlife. Without the quest for religious liberty, there would be no United \nStates, and without the continued guarantee of religious freedom, there \ncan be no American ideal. This is the fundamental rule in our society, \na fundamental maxim, a fundamental part of the Constitution, a \nfundamental belief for virtually everyone in America who has any \nreligious inclinations at all.\n  I am proud to be a citizen of this great Nation. I don't want to see \nreligious liberty infringed upon, abused, not tolerated or denigrated. \nWe have to stand up for it. We have to make sure everybody knows we are \nnot going to change one of the basic precepts of the American \nexperience--one of the basic precepts, from the beginning of this \ncountry until today.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Remembering James H. Gilliam, Sr.\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that today I rise \nto honor a friend and a true force for good in my home State of \nDelaware who recently passed away but whose impact will be felt for \nmany years to come. He was, first and foremost, a loving husband, \nfather, and grandfather. He was married to his wife Louise for 68 years \nand had always been the rock of his family. He was incredibly proud of \nthe many accomplishments of his son Jim, Jr., and his daughter Dr. \nPatrice Gilliam-Johnson, after instilling in them his own passion of \nservice to others. This man stood as a great leader in the First State. \nHe was a veteran, a trailblazer, a mentor, and to so many of us a \ntrusted adviser and friend.\n  It was Mr. James H. Gilliam, Sr.--or Mr. G., as he was known to so \nmany of us--who left our world early Wednesday morning on September 10, \nbut before he left us, he made a profound impact on thousands of \nDelawareans from every walk of life, as a teacher, as a mentor, and a \nleader. His 95 years on this Earth marked a life well lived. Whether he \nwas helping communities to heal and to grow together or helping to \nestablish local and national organizations committed to social justice \nand equity, advising Governors, Members of Congress or even the Vice \nPresident, he never wasted an opportunity to make the case for our \ncommunity.\n  Jim Gilliam, though, actually didn't grow up in Delaware. He was \noriginally raised in Baltimore and earned a bachelor's degree in \nsociology from Morgan State and a master's degree in social work from \nHoward University. From 1944 to 1948, he served his country with honor \nas a member of the Army's 92nd Infantry Division, the famed Buffalo \nSoldiers, where he became a decorated soldier during the Second World \nWar and beyond. He was actually recalled to duty again as a captain \nduring the Korean war, and for all his service, he received many \nawards, including two Bronze Star Medals and the Combat Infantryman \nBadge. I will never forget the opportunity I had last year when I was \nable to help him retrieve a number of his missing or, in several cases, \nnever awarded medals, and to reissue them to him in a public ceremony. \nHundreds of Delawareans from across our community came together at that \nevent--hundreds whose lives he touched, and I don't think there was a \ndry eye in the house.\n  Jim Gilliam didn't come to Wilmington for good until 1965, when he \nwas hired as director of neighborhood and housing services for the \nGreater Wilmington Development Council. Shortly after, in 1968, he was \none of the few trusted to walk the Wilmington streets promoting \nreconciliation during the riots in our city and the National Guard \noccupation that lasted too long after the assassination of Rev. Martin \nLuther King, Jr.\n  Mr. G. went on to hold positions of leadership with private and \npublic sector entities, including vice president of the development \ncompany Leon N. Weiner & Associates, working to build affordable, low-\nincome housing; or as the director of New Castle County's Department of \nCommunity Development and Housing, where he served for many years; or \nin 1970 when Governor Peterson asked him to overhaul a then-failing \nDelaware family court. He touched many lives through many institutions.\n  His constant involvement in the community led to many honors and \naccolades, but through it all he never rested on his laurels or slowed \ndown in his efforts to serve others. In 1999, at an age when most \nothers would have been beginning retirement, he spent 9 months raising \n$1 million and securing hundreds of political, business, and community \nsupporters to launch the Metropolitan Wilmington Urban League. The \nMetropolitan Wilmington Urban League quickly rose to prominence and 4 \nyears later received the National Urban League's highest honor. Since \nthat time, as MWUL chairman, Jim led countless efforts in educational \nopportunity, economic development, supplier diversity, fighting racial \nprofiling, and promoting equity in the arts. I was honored to be able \nto call him a mentor and an adviser.\n  Whether working with him 15 years ago when I was a newly elected \ncountywide official or in recent years as a U.S. Senator, I called on \nMr. G. time and again when making tough decisions. His counsel was not \nalways easy to receive. He pulled no punches, but he always gave advice \nkeeping the best interests of our community in mind. I consider myself \nhugely blessed for the many opportunities when he shared his knowledge \nand perspective of what we needed to do. But I am far from the only \nperson who long relied upon his advice.\n\n[[Page S7083]]\n\n  Mr. G. mentored countless young men and women from throughout the \nState and throughout his life and truly fostered an entire generation \nof civic and community leaders. One of them is Paul Calistro, the \nexecutive director of the West End Neighborhood House, whose \norganization has supported thousands youth in our city. A sentiment he \nrecently related to me was that ``Mr. G. was a man who could command \nthe entire room, but could also speak to you as if you were the only \none in the room.''\n  Another person whose career he helped launch was Jea Street. He is \nnow a county councilman, and for decades he was executive director of \nHilltop Lutheran--another important youth-serving organization in a \ntough neighborhood in our city. He was hired at the tender age of 22, \nsome 40 years ago, by Mr. G. to help in preparation for school \ndesegregation. Jea recently commented: He did not tell me it was a job \nfor life, but he helped me to do it and to stay on the battlefield for \njustice these many years.\n  Any elected official or civic community leader who sat down with Mr. \nG. also knew that he meant business. He wasn't shy about telling you \nwhat you needed to do, what you needed to do better, what you needed to \ndo to make an impact. Whether it was fighting crime or investing in \neducation or a growing opportunity, he was better than anyone I have \never known at delivering hard and pointed messages with a smile but \nwith an intensity that made you listen and made you want to be a better \nman. The News Journal, our home paper in Wilmington, recently said: \n``Mr. Gilliam's fight for racial justice, his efforts to correct the \nwrongs of our society and his willingness to mentor countless others, \nsent forth thousands of ripples of hope that have benefited us in the \npast and will serve us well in the future.''\n  I think that is exactly right. No problem was too small or \ninsignificant for him to embrace and to attend to and to set right. He \nwas Wilmington's pied piper, leading all kinds of people into a better \nplace. He was a natural leader, and everyone who knew him is better off \nfor it.\n  My good friend Dr. Tony Allen counted Mr. G. as his best friend. Tony \nput it this way:\n\n       He was the conscience of our community. He often said to me \n     that the great challenges of life are in the moments when it \n     is our turn. When there is an opportunity for us to speak up \n     or to be quiet, to rise up or to lie down, to take arms or to \n     take cover, most of us take the path of least resistance and \n     miss the moment to make a difference in our own lives and in \n     the lives of others. He taught everyone to never, ever miss \n     their moment to act, to do the right thing, and to make the \n     world a better place.\n\n  For 95 years, Mr. G. never missed the moments that required him to \nact and to lead. He acted, he led, and his legacy lives on not only in \nhis family but among so many other people and institutions throughout \nour State that he touched.\n  As for me, I will always remember Jim Gilliam as a man who challenged \nme to be better. He viewed himself as a servant to our community, but \nhe knew that his service alone wasn't enough. That is why his lasting \nlegacy will be in those whom he has inspired and whom he challenged to \ncontinue his work, to follow his example, to take our turn and our \nmoment to fight for justice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan wishes to be recognized, I presume.\n  Mr. PETERS. I do, indeed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n             Pipeline Improvement and Preventing Spills Act\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an issue that \nis of particular importance in my State of Michigan--preventing an \noilspill in the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes are a part of our way of \nlife in Michigan, supporting our multibillion dollar agricultural, \nshipping, and tourism industries. An oilspill on this precious resource \nwould be catastrophic for Michigan and for all surrounding Great Lakes \nStates. The Great Lakes are a critical drinking water source for 40 \nmillion people, and they contain 84 percent of North America's surface \nfreshwater. Vessels moving through the Great Lakes carry goods and \npassengers across the region, and tourists in Michigan, Minnesota, \nWisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York take in \ntheir beautiful coastlines each year. Unfortunately, Michiganders know \nall too well the devastating consequences of a pipeline break and what \nit can do to an economy and to its natural resources.\n  Five years ago we experienced one of the largest inland oilspills in \nU.S. history with a 6-foot break in the Line 6-B pipeline in Marshall, \nMI. Oil flowed for nearly 17 hours before it was eventually shut off, \nspilling more than 800,000 gallons of heavy crude, contaminating 35 \nmiles of the Kalamazoo River, and ultimately racking up a cleanup cost \nof $1.2 billion. An independent investigation after the spill concluded \nthat the pipeline operator's inadequate procedures, as well as ``weak \nFederal regulations,'' all played a major role in this disastrous \nspill.\n  The Kalamazoo disaster, along with several other devastating pipeline \nexplosions and spills, prompted a sweeping pipeline safety bill to be \nsigned into law in early 2012. Unfortunately, many of those rules and \nregulations have yet to be finalized by the Pipeline and Hazardous \nMaterials Safety Administration, or PHMSA.\n  I am very concerned about the potential for future spills in \nMichigan, especially from a pair of 60-year old pipelines carrying oil \nand natural gas liquids through the Straits of Mackinac, the place \nwhere Lake Michigan and Lake Huron meet. The Straits of Mackinac have \nbeen called the ``worst possible place'' for an oilspill in the entire \nGreat Lakes Basin. The strong currents in the straits tend to reverse \ndirection every few days, and they move water at a rate at over 10 \ntimes greater than the flow over Niagara Falls. A professor at the \nUniversity of Michigan used computer modeling to estimate that a worst \ncase scenario oil slick moving east through the Straits could reach the \nshores of Mackinac City and Mackinac Island--our number one tourist \nattraction--in just 3 hours.\n  Even more troubling is the fact that Coast Guard officials have \nacknowledged that current oilspill response techniques are not adequate \nfor open freshwater, let alone freshwater with heavy, thick ice--the \nice we find every season in the Straits of Mackinac.\n  To make matters worse, response plan requirements for pipelines \noverseen by PHMSA at the Federal level are seriously lacking. The \ninformation related to safety procedures, inspection reports, and worst \ncase scenarios are unavailable to the public. Even local emergency \nresponders have been left in the dark. That is why I, along with my \nMichigan colleague and good friend Debbie Stabenow, introduced the \nPipeline Improvement and Preventing Spills Act, which includes several \ncommonsense provisions to prevent pipeline accidents and protect the \nGreat Lakes from catastrophic crude oil spills. Our bill requires the \nU.S. Coast Guard and other agencies to independently assess oilspill \nresponse and cleanup activities and techniques for the Great Lakes, \nspecifically taking into account the cleanup response of an oilspill \nunder solid, thick ice or ice-choke waters.\n  My legislation requires the Department of Transportation and the \nNational Academies to examine risks associated with pipelines in the \nGreat Lakes and other waterways in the region, including an analysis of \nalternatives to the Straits oil pipeline. This bill would also increase \ntransparency by ensuring residents are notified about pipelines near \ntheir property and compels operators and regulators to make information \npublicly available.\n  My legislation will also expand safety features to pipelines in high-\nconsequence areas--creating jobs for pipefitters and other \nprofessions--while protecting dense population centers, drinking water, \nand environmentally sensitive areas. Finally, this bill will eliminate \nthe future risk of a disastrous crude oil spill from tanker vessels on \nthe Great Lakes.\n  Currently crude oil is not shipped by tankers on the Great Lakes. \nHowever, it is increasingly being looked at as an option. Given the \ndifficulty of cleaning\n\n[[Page S7084]]\n\nup heavy oil in open freshwater, my bill will take that option off the \ntable to ensure that we will not jeopardize our $7 billion Great Lakes \nfishing industry. The Pipeline Improvement and Preventing Spills Act is \nendorsed and supported by a number of groups, including the Michigan \nLeague of Conservation Voters; the Pipefitters, Plumbers and HVAC Techs \nLocal 111; Traverse City Tourism; the Great Lakes Fishing Commission; \nMichigan Steelhead and Salmon Fishermen's Association; National \nWildlife Federation; and the Alliance for the Great Lakes--to name a \nfew.\n  The Senate committee on commerce, which has jurisdiction over \npipeline safety, will be considering pipeline legislation in the next \nfew weeks. I look forward to building support for provisions in my \nbill. Our country continues to record record highs in domestic energy \nproduction, but we must remain vigilant when it comes to energy \ntransportation. Through strong oversight, leadership from the industry, \nand technological innovation, I firmly believe that we can and we must \ncontinue to meet our energy needs in the safest way possible while \npreserving treasures such as the Great Lakes for future generations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1624) to amend title I of the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act and title XXVII of the \n     Public Health Service Act to revise the definition of small \n     employer.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to a third reading, and was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the measure, \nthe bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the \nbill pass?\n  The bill (H.R. 1624) was passed.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider \nbe made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about the \nProtecting Affordable Coverage For Employees--or PACE--Act.\n  The PACE Act is smart legislation from my colleague, Senator Tim \nScott, and my Kentucky colleague over in the House, Congressman Brett \nGuthrie, that will help protect small- and medium-sized businesses that \nprovide health care to their employees. It would give States more \nflexibility to define what constitutes a small business for health \ninsurance purposes so as to protect health benefits for workers, lower \nhealth premiums, and reduce costs for taxpayers.\n  So let me repeat that. The PACE Act is a smart health care bill aimed \nat protecting workers' benefits, lowering premiums, and reducing costs \nto taxpayers.\n  I hope colleagues will join me in applauding the bill's lead \nsponsors, our colleague, Senator Tim Scott, and his counterpart over in \nthe House, Congressman Brett Guthrie, for their hard work in developing \nthis very important proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wish to join the majority leader in \ncomplimenting Senator Scott, a new Member of the Senate, on a \nsignificant accomplishment. It is not that easy to pass a bill in the \nHouse and in the Senate. It takes a lot of work, and there is good \nreason for that. We want to make sure that whatever passes in the \nSenate has a thorough amount of consideration.\n  Senator Scott has come to the Senate as a member of the HELP \nCommittee. He is one of its most diligent members. I am chairman of \nthat committee. He took this initiative on his own, working with \nMembers of the House, where he formerly served, and he has brought the \nbill to the Senate, and within a few days he has gotten its unanimous \napproval. To me, that suggests the kind of U.S. Senator that we need \nmore of--someone who is quiet, effective, scholarly, and gets results.\n  So Tim Scott today, on behalf of the people of South Carolina and \nthis country, has helped workers, has improved benefits, and has \nlowered premiums. He deserves our thanks. He has certainly earned my \nrespect and the respect of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle by \nthis significant accomplishment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I wish to thank my cosponsor, Senator \nShaheen, for working with me on the PACE Act, without any question. I \nalso would like to thank Senator Alexander for his kind remarks and \nspecifically thank our leader, Senator McConnell, for making sure this \nbill had an expeditious path to the floor of the Senate.\n  So often we hear in America that we can't get things done in the \nSenate, and because of your leadership, Senator McConnell, and because \nof the good work of Congressman Guthrie on the House side, as well as \nSenator Shaheen, we see we are going to have an opportunity to make \nsure that small business owners all across America are not more \nnegatively impacted by ObamaCare.\n  The decision we have made today to move this legislation forward \nactually will save, on average, about 18 percent--18 percent--of higher \npremiums that will not have to be paid by small businesses owners.\n  Senator McConnell, thank you for your leadership. Senator Alexander, \nthank you for working with us on this very interesting process to get \nit to the floor as expeditiously as we have been able to do.\n  With that, I thank both Senators for their hard work and dedication \nto this issue.\n  Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, I want to thank my friend and colleague \nSenator Scott for his leadership in protecting many Americans and small \nbusinesses from more needless suffering under ObamaCare. While I am \nglad for this outcome, a piecemeal approach to this terrible law is \nless valuable than a strategic approach. We must help the millions of \nother victims who are already suffering or will soon suffer from the \nlaw's flawed policies but lack an effective lobbying voice. In the \nfuture, we should set the stage for a serious repeal and replace debate \nby delaying Obamacare's onerous burdens, rather than merely working to \nmake a terrible law 12 percent less bad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/01/senate-section/article/S7084-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7084-S7090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016--CONFERENCE \n                           REPORT--Continued\n\n\n                     Remembering Officer Greg Alia\n\n  Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I rise to speak about one of South \nCarolina's most amazing heroes, Greg Alia. I am here today to recognize \nthat this young man--32 years young--lost his life yesterday. Yesterday \nmorning, Officer Greg Alia was killed in Columbia, SC.\n  I will tell my colleagues that Greg served his community with \ndistinction. Yesterday afternoon, I had an opportunity to talk with \nGreg's wife, Kassy. Kassy's strength, as she spoke with someone she has \nnever met about the love of her life--about her husband, the father of \nher little boy, Sal--was quite remarkable. Her thoughtfulness in this \ntragic time truly struck a chord with me and brought tears to my eyes \nas I listened to a wife describe the man she loves, a community leader, \nand someone who runs into danger when others are running away from \ndanger.\n  Greg was born and raised in Columbia, SC. He was a Columbia native. \nHe went to high school at Richland Northeast High School. He graduated \nfrom the University of South Carolina. If Greg were here, I would say \n``Go, Cocks'' because we understand and appreciate the importance of \nthe University of South Carolina, especially in the Columbia footprint.\n\n[[Page S7085]]\n\n  More importantly, after high school, Greg wanted to find out what \nlife was about. He had an opportunity to be a production assistant \nworking on movies such as the latest version of ``Indiana Jones,'' as \nwell as one of my favorite movies, frankly, ``Iron Man.'' Yes, ``Iron \nMan.''\n  Greg was offered a job with Marvel, the comic book folks. He had an \nopportunity to stay out of the State and do amazing things and have a \nlot of fun, but his heart was beating to come back home to South \nCarolina, to come back home to Columbia, so that he could serve the \npeople of South Carolina. He wanted to be a police officer. He wanted \nto help people. Kassy told me that Greg would have had no regrets.\n  To think about those words from his wife on the day her husband was \nmurdered, Greg would have no regrets because he was doing what he was \nmade to do: Protect people, serve people, sacrifice on behalf of \npeople.\n  Greg was the embodiment of bravery and heroism. Greg was doing what \nhe was wired to do. His wife was so clear and so passionate about his \ndesire to be the first on the scene, his desire to do everything \npossible to try to be helpful. Greg, like so many police officers \nacross this Nation and, without question, across the great State of \nSouth Carolina, loved serving people. And he did so. He did so with \ngreat integrity, with amazing character. He knew his place in the world \nwas making sure that his town, his city, our State, and our Nation are \nsafer because he put on the uniform every single day.\n  Today, we all stand in salute to Greg and make a promise to his wife \nKassy that we will be there with her as she raises her son Sal. Our \nprayers and our thoughts are with the family.\n  In closing, I would like to share a story that Kassy told me \nyesterday afternoon as I had the chance to speak with her. The story \nbrought a tear to my eye, and I hope as my colleagues hear the story, \nit may even bring a smile to their faces. Greg worked the night shift, \nand when he would come home in the morning--Sal was around 6 months old \nand he was learning to sit up, and in the morning when Sal heard the \npolice cruiser of his dad pull into the driveway, he would sit up and \nhe would start smiling. He was feeding, and the milk, because of his \nbig smile, would run down his face.\n  Think for just a moment of that young man, Sal. He should have the \nopportunity to walk when he hears the cruiser coming into the driveway. \nHe should have the opportunity to yell ``Daddy'' when he hears that \ncruiser coming into the driveway. So for that little boy and his mama, \nKassy, and for the Forest Acres community, I stand here today saying \nthank you for every single thing Greg has done to make our State and \nour Nation a better place to call home. I say thank you to Greg for \nmaking the ultimate sacrifice that will never be forgotten. And I say \nthank you to Kassy for being such a powerful and strong woman in this \namazing time of her need.\n  We should pray for Kassy and Sal.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I am glad I got to be here to hear Senator \nScott talk about that family and that hero and those who protect and \ndefend us. In Missouri we have had over the last year a number of \nchallenges on this front. I was recently meeting with a group of \nAfrican-American pastors, one of whom was a pastor in Ferguson, MO, and \ntalking about the hard work of being in law enforcement. He said: \nPeople who protect us, just like me, want to go home at the end of the \nday. And more than most of us, people who protect us leave every day \nwith them and their families having the No. 1 focus of getting home at \nthe end of the day. Thank God they are willing to step forward and \nprotect us, especially understanding that this is a challenging job at \na challenging time.\n\n\n                          Veterans Health Care\n\n  I wish to speak for a little while about veterans health care, \nanother challenge we face right now. We just, unfortunately, failed to \nmove to debate on a bill that would fund these programs, a bill that \nwould increase funding for our veterans in areas such as health care \nand benefit claims and processing claims, medical research, and \ntechnology upgrades. For whatever reason, we decided as a Senate--and I \ndon't think for a good reason--that no, we are not going to debate that \nbill because all of these bills somehow collectively don't spend enough \nmoney. But we have talked about that, and I talked about it earlier in \nthe day.\n  Right now I wish to speak for a few minutes about what we do need to \nbe figuring out for our veterans.\n  We learned a year ago that Veterans' Administration wait times were \nunacceptable. We learned it was likely that a number of lives had been \nlost and deaths had been caused because our veterans didn't get to see \nthe doctor they should have gotten to see; they didn't get the health \ncare they earned as veterans and deserved. This summer, after a year of \nworking to make this better, we found out that the wait list of people \nwaiting more than 30 days at the VA system to see a doctor was now 50 \npercent longer than it was last year. I thought about that a little bit \nand I thought, well, maybe it was just 50 percent longer than it was \nlast year, because one thing they found out was the wait-list wasn't \nreally reflective of the real wait-list. The kind of progress we hoped \nto have made we don't appear to be making yet.\n\n  Last year the Congress passed a law to give veterans more choice. It \nwas passed on a broad bipartisan basis. The Senate came together, the \nCongress came together to allow veterans to receive their health care \nin non-VA facilities if they couldn't get that first appointment within \n30 days or if they were more than 40 miles away from a facility. We \ntried this legislation this summer to put even more definition to that. \nClearly, what the Congress means is 40 miles from a facility that can \ndo what the patient needs to have done. If one needs to have a heart \nstint put in, just being 40 miles from a facility where they would take \nyour blood pressure isn't good enough. We will continue to work to \nchange veterans health care in a way that gives veterans more choices, \nI hope.\n  What we found out is that Alaskan care is just not acceptable. We \nhave to continue to keep focused on this. The bill we provided will \ncreate more choices.\n  Last week I had one of the best conversations I have ever had with \nanybody at the Veterans Administration when I talked to the Under \nSecretary of Health--a new person in that job--Dr. Dave Shulkin, who \nspent his whole life in health care in the private sector managing \nhospitals outside of the Federal Government. Dr. Shulkin should know \nwhat he is doing, and it certainly sounded to me as if he knew what he \nwas doing. He understood the kinds of things the Congress hopes to see \nfor our veterans and the VA system that need to happen.\n  We talked about the fact that Congress intends for veterans' choice \nto mean exactly that--not ways for the Veterans Administration to find \nobstacles to choice but veterans' choice. If you are a Federal \nGovernment health care provider, if you take Medicare patients, you \nought to be able to take veterans as patients. There shouldn't be some \nlong second process you have to go through to become qualified so that \nthe veteran can see a doctor the veteran wants to see, the veteran can \ngo to a hospital the veteran wants to go to, particularly if the VA \ncan't meet that need.\n  In fact, the conversation I had with Dr. Shulkin was so good that for \na little while, I thought maybe I had gotten the wrong number, that \npossibly I actually had not called the Veterans Administration, because \nI have never had a conversation like that where somebody at the \nVeterans Administration not only knew what needed to be done but wasn't \nafraid to compete to get the health care needs of veterans met.\n  I talked to all our veterans groups in Missouri, or many of them--\ncertainly the two big veterans groups--at their meeting this summer. I \nsaid: Many of you have had great experience with the VA.\n  There are a lot of people at the VA who want to do everything they \ncan to serve veterans in the best possible way.\n  I said: But that is not good enough. All of you need to have had the \nbest possible experience at the VA--not necessarily the best outcome \nbut the best possible outcome.\n  You know, all of our health care outcomes aren't what we would want \nthem to be, but they ought to be everything they possibly should be.\n\n[[Page S7086]]\n\n  Veterans shouldn't have to drive past non-VA facilities that are \nequally capable of providing their health care or more capable of \nproviding their health care, and we are going to continue to work to \nsee that that happens. Competition is a good thing. The best possible \nplace to go for your health care is a good thing.\n  I want to come back to that briefly in a moment, but before I get \nthere, I received a report on Tuesday from the Veterans \nAdministration's inspector general that frankly just said that the \nallegations about what was happening at the St. Louis facility, the \nJohn Cochran facility, were absolutely true, that a number of files had \nbeen changed to indicate that the consultation had been completed \nbefore it was ever had. I assume it does a lot for your performance \nnumbers if you check the ``completed'' box before you see the patient, \nand that appears to be what was happening. We learned that there is not \nenough oversight there. We learned that at least one psychiatrist had \nreceived performance pay based on productivity data. The only thing \nwrong with the productivity data was that it wasn't correct. I guess it \nis easy to look good if you are not backing that up with real facts. It \nis not acceptable. It is inexcusable.\n  Then we have a problem with leadership at these facilities. At the \nJohn Cochran hospital in St. Louis--the biggest hospital we have in our \nState--we have had seven temporary directors in 2 years. No matter how \ngood some of those may have been, having seven temporary directors is a \nlot like not having any director at all. If you know somebody is going \nto be there for 14 weeks, or however long they are going to be there, \nand you know somebody else is coming, that obviously is not going to \nproduce a good result, but that is happening. There are 30 veterans \ncenters that don't have permanent directors today. That is about 20 \npercent of all the facilities in the country. One in five of our VA \nmedical centers doesn't have a permanent director, and we need to do \nbetter.\n  Supposedly the new Administrator of the Veterans Administration came \nin because he was a great manager. So far, I don't see the results. If \nhe needs more help from the Congress to be a great manager, we ought to \nfigure out a way to give him more help.\n  I believe competition is a good thing. The VA should be good and \nreally better than anybody else at a few things. Nobody should be \nbetter than the VA in terms of dealing with post-traumatic stress. \nNobody should be better than the Veterans Administration when it comes \nto dealing with the results of these IED attacks, the improvised \nexplosive device attacks. Because of that, eye injuries should be \nsomething the VA deals with very well. And nobody should be better than \nthe VA at dealing with prosthetics or spinal cord injuries.\n  Frankly, the Presiding Officer, as a doctor, would appreciate this. I \ndon't really know why we wouldn't assume the VA would be the best place \nto specialize in almost anything else. And if it is not the best place \nto go, it shouldn't be the only place to go.\n  The VA is probably not likely to be any better or as good as anyplace \nyou would drive by to get your heart stint put in, to take care of your \ncancer problem, to work with your kidneys that are failing, to get even \nthe basic health care of getting your blood pressure checked. Our \nveterans deserve more choices.\n  There are lots of reasons the Congress should be and is concerned \nabout the way the Veterans Administration is working. It is clearly \ntime for the Veterans Administration to get focused not on what is good \nfor the Veterans Administration but on what is good for veterans. We \nowe it to our veterans.\n  The report I got this Tuesday unfortunately verifies almost every \nconcern that people have had, and we need to insist that that be \nbetter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                       Providing For Our Veterans\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I am pleased to follow my colleague and \nfriend from Missouri. I just want to mention--although I didn't come to \nthe floor to talk about what we are doing for veterans, let me take a \nminute or two to talk about what we are doing that we are actually \nproud of and then maybe touch on a couple of areas where we can do a \nbetter job.\n  I myself am a veteran, a Navy midshipman out of Ohio State who \nstudied economics for 4 years and went on to become a naval flight \nofficer. I served for 5 years in Southeast Asia as a naval flight \nofficer and then as a P-3 aircraft mission commander for another 18 \nyears until the end of the Cold War. I loved the Navy. I loved serving.\n  I got an education--undergraduate and graduate school--and feel very \nprivileged. I had the opportunity at the end of my Active-Duty tour to \nuse the VA hospital very close to Wilmington, DE, in northern Delaware. \nI remember the first time I went there. I was offered some dental \nbenefits, and my dentist--a young dentist who was right out of dental \nschool--told me the morale was pretty bad, and he said they didn't do \nvery good work. It was place where they had 16-bed wards. They didn't \ndo much in the way of outpatient surgery. The pharmacy was a mess.\n  I said: Wouldn't it be great to be in a position to do something \nabout that and transform this place so it can be a health care delivery \nfacility we can be proud of today?\n  Do they do everything perfectly? No, they don't.\n  We have two satellite operations in Delaware. We have one in the \nDover area, in the middle of our State, and we have another one in the \nsouthern part of the State, in Sussex County, which is Georgetown. I am \nvery proud of those health care facilities. We call them outpatient \nclinics, CBOCS.\n  The reason I mention that is because I was also eligible--coming out \nof the Vietnam war, along with other Vietnam veterans--to get an \neducation, to go to college, and in my case graduate school on the GI \nbill. In my generation, we received about $250 a month. At the time, I \nwas happy to have every bit of it. I continued to fly with my Reserve \nsquadron for another 18 years, and it was great to have that benefit.\n  A couple weeks ago, our congressional delegation--Senator Coons, \nCongressmen Carney, and Governor Jack Markell--sent 300 Delaware \nNational Guard men and women off to Afghanistan. We had a big sendoff \nceremony for them. Their families were there. We had about 1,000 \npeople. It was a big sendoff.\n  As they left, I told them: When you come back, you are going to be \neligible for a GI benefit that dwarfs what my generation received.\n  They won't get 250 bucks a month. If they serve a total of 3 years on \nActive Duty and serve in Afghanistan or Iraq for a period of time, here \nis what they will be eligible for: They can come back and go for free \nto the University of Delaware, Delaware City University, Wilmington \nUniversity--pretty much any public college or university in America; \ntuition, books, and fees paid for; and if they need tutoring, that is \npaid for as well. On top of all that, they get a housing allowance of \n$1,500 a month. We received a GI benefit of $250.\n  Not surprisingly, at the end of World War II, when my dad and my \nuncle served--in the Korean war, when my uncle served, and at the end \nof the Vietnam war, scam artists emerged to take advantage of the GI \nand tried to separate the GI coming back from combat--tried to separate \nthe GI cash value benefits from the GI and sometimes not to provide \nthem with a very good education but to take advantage of the GI and the \ntaxpayers.\n  In about 1952, something called the 85-15 rule was passed whereby at \nleast 15 percent of the students enrolled in a for-profit college or \nuniversity had to be there--their tuition paid for by some source other \nthan the Federal Government. As it turns out, the 85-15 rule became the \n90-10 rule, so that 90 percent of those who were enrolled were paid for \nby the Federal Government, but another 10 percent had to be paid for by \nsomeone else other than the Federal Government. Over time, that changed \nso that 90 percent of the revenues of a for-profit college or \nuniversity could come from the Federal Government but not the other 10 \npercent--except for the money that came from the GI bill to a college \nor university or from tuition assistance for people on Active Duty. \nThat didn't count against the 90 percent. At the end of the day, a for-\nprofit college or university could get 100 percent of its revenues from \nthe Federal Government. I don't think that is a good thing.\n  The system that was designed early on with the 85-15 rule and later \nthe 90-\n\n[[Page S7087]]\n\n10 rule was designed to try to make sure there were market forces that \nensured taxpayers and the GIs, the veterans would get a fair deal, get \na good education, make sure they were treated the way we would want \nthem to be treated.\n  There is a huge loophole in the 90-10 rule, and it is a loophole we \nneed to fix. We need to fix it.\n  My colleagues who talked here earlier today--including my colleague \nfrom Missouri--about the quality of VA health care--I want to say that \nwe are providing the best health care by far in the history of our \ncountry. For too long, a number of our for-profit colleges and \nuniversities and postsecondary-training programs have been taking \nadvantage of GIs, taking advantage of the taxpayers, and it should \nstop. It should stop.\n  Having said that, there are a number of for-profit colleges and \nuniversities and training programs that do a great job. They are not \nall bad actors. Some of them wear white hats. For them, good for you, \nand for those who are not, you need to change your ways.\n  I didn't come here to talk about that, but in the spirit of making \nsure we look out for our veterans, I thought I would mention that.\n\n\n                 Transportation Infrastructure Funding\n\n  Let's take a look at some of the posters here this afternoon.\n  The first one looks like my State. It probably also looks like the \nPresiding Officer's State. It could look like any of the States our \npages are from. But this is a traffic jam. It is a traffic jam that \noccurs almost every day, almost every business day, and frankly a lot \nof weekends on highways across America from coast to coast. We spend a \nlot of time sitting in traffic. It is actually quite a substantial cost \nthat inures to our Nation's economy. The cost this year is believed to \nbe about $160 billion, a hit on our national economy. I will talk in \njust a second about what that includes.\n\n  Part of the waste that is reflected in our Nation's economy is--you \nsee right here it says ``82 hours wasted in big city traffic.'' That is \nper person, per driver, on average, across the country, big cities, \npeople sitting--pretty much sitting in traffic. They could be in a \nminivan, they could be in a small car, a large car, they could be in a \ntruck, but we are talking about 82 hours a year just pretty much \nsitting in traffic.\n  The average across the country, when you take in the more rural parts \nof the country and suburban areas, is about 42 hours. That is a whole \nlot of time. Time is money. So just think about that.\n  Here is one with a sense of humor. This is not Delaware. I am not \nsure where this is, but for those who can't read this, it says--the \ntraffic sign that is up here says: ``You'll never get to work on time. \nHaha.'' It is some kind of construction program. You see the orange \ncones out there. Someone had a good sense of humor there. My guess is, \nthe folks who maybe were working on the project had a good sense of \nhumor. My guess is that for a moment it made the drivers smile but not \nfor long, especially if they sat in traffic long enough. Eighty-two \nhours a year, that is long enough.\n  Not only is it expensive, a waste of time and money for us as \nindividuals to sit in traffic for a long time, another part of the cost \nis caused by potholes and other problems with our roads. I think this \nis probably a bridge. It looks like it might be a bridge, but it is a \nconstruction project someplace. Here is a pothole. That is a bad \npothole. In other parts--not too much in Delaware--I have seen in other \nStates at least that bad and worse.\n  What is going to happen, vehicles will come along, they will hit that \npothole, and may damage their tires, they may have to replace a tire or \ntwo, they may have to get their front end realigned. That costs money. \nHow much? Actually, believe it or not, just like Texas A has actually \nfigured out on average we waste 82 hours a year as drivers, somebody \nelse actually spent the time to figure out how much we spend on our \ncars, trucks, and vans in order to fix them during the course of the \nyear because of potholes like this and other problems, whether it is \nthe surface of the roads we travel on or the surface of the bridges we \ntravel on. It is over $350. I have seen the range of anywhere from $350 \nper year to $500 per year. Let's say it is just $350 a year. That is a \nlot of money. That is part of the cost of the damage to our economy.\n  The other thing I would say, our economy today, as we all know, is a \n``just in time'' economy. I will give you a good example. We have a \nport in Wilmington that sits right on the Delaware River. As you come \nup the Delaware Bay, it becomes the Delaware River. The port that is \nclosest to the Atlantic is the Port of Wilmington. Ships are coming in \nand out of there throughout the day, nights, and weekends. The ships \ndon't come in and spend a week. Ships don't come into the Port of \nWilmington and spend a day. They may come in for 4 hours, they may come \nin for 6 hours, but they are there and then they are gone, because when \na ship is sitting in the Port of Wilmington or any other port, the \nshipper, whoever owns that boat, that ship cannot make any money. So \nthey want to be in and they want to be out. That is the way they do \ntheir business.\n  It is important for whoever is coming in using a truck to bring goods \nto put on that ship to send around the world, there may be a very short \nwindow of time to get there. If you are stuck in traffic, the kind of \ntraffic we saw early on, you may miss that window when the ship is in \nthe port, whether it is Wilmington or some other port. That is another \nreason why, in a ``just in time'' economy, these kinds of delays mean \ntime is money. Again, someone else with a sense of humor--if you cannot \nread this, it looks like a husband and wife driving along in their car. \nHis wife says: ``Finally someone fixed that pothole.'' Here is the \npothole. There is a car down there. The guy driving looks like he is \nhaving a bad day, not just a bad hair day, a very bad day.\n  A little humor there but not if you happen to be this guy, frankly--\nprobably not if you happen to be this guy, because if you are running \nover somebody else's car in a pothole like this, the guy is going to \nspend a lot more than 350 bucks to repair his car and get it going \nagain.\n  We are not making this stuff up. There is a national association, I \nthink it is civil engineers, people who spend their life's work on \ntransportation projects. Every year for years, they have given us a \ngrade on what kind of shape our roads, highways, bridges, and transit \nsystems are in. They could give an A, A-plus, A-minus, they could give \na B, B-plus, B-minus, they could give a C, C-plus, C-minus or they \ncould give a D-plus, D, D-minus. The last couple of years we have been \nright around D to D-plus. I think we are probably going down rather \nthan going up. So what everybody knows--just about anybody who drives \nin our country these days knows we are not investing in our roads, \nhighways, bridges, and transit systems the way we need to.\n  Look around the rest of the world, travel around the rest of the \nworld. You can see in a lot of countries we compete with that they do. \nOne of the components of certain investments we need to make in our \ncountry in order to strengthen our economy, to better ensure the jobs \nare going to be created or preserved--there a lot of things we can do \nto make sure businesses have access to capital, make sure the cost of \nenergy is affordable, make sure the cost of health care is affordable, \nmake sure we have public safety, make sure the people who are coming \nout of our schools can read, write, and have the skills that are needed \nin the workforce.\n  I know the big one is to make sure we have the ability to move people \nand goods where they need to go, when they need to go. Here is our \ncurrent plan. It is pretty well summed up in this sign. It is meant to \nbe funny. I suppose it is. But I like this part of the plan: ``Good \nluck.'' That is not a plan. That is not a plan that is going to get us \nwhere we need to go as a nation.\n  For those who may be unable to read this, there is a big traffic jam. \nA lot of people are saying--you see those little bubbles there--``I'd \npay to be anywhere but here.''\n  I was Treasurer of Delaware. I studied economics, got an MBA, and was \nTreasurer of Delaware when I was 29. I had a chance to serve in the \nhouse for a while and then as Governor. I was very much involved in the \nNational Governors Association in trying to make sure we invested in \nour transportation infrastructure across the country. In the Senate, I \nam on the Environment and Public Works Committee. The last time I was \nprivileged to serve\n\n[[Page S7088]]\n\nas chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure.\n  So I thought a fair amount about these issues. If you think about the \nway we pay for roads, highways, bridges, and transit, what we have used \nfor years is a user pay system. The people, the businesses that use our \nroads, highways, bridges, and transit systems, we pay for them. In some \nplaces, we have sort of gotten away from that. There is an \nunwillingness to ask people to pay for what they want to use. Everybody \nwants to have better transportation systems. There seems to be a lot of \nreluctance to pay for that.\n  When I was Governor of Delaware, three times I asked for modest--very \nmodest--increases, just a couple of cents in the fee for gas and diesel \ntax. I think out of three efforts, we succeeded one time. Not a whole \nlot was raised, but we cobbled together some other money from other \nuser fees and we were able to continue to fund transportation funding.\n  For a number of years in the Nation, we have had a transportation \ntrust fund. Most of the money for that transportation trust fund comes \nfrom user fees, and two primary user fees are a gas tax. It has been \nabout 18.3, 18.4 cents since, I think, 1993. It has been a little bit \nover 18 cents since 1993. It has not changed. The cost of concrete has \ngone up. The cost of asphalt has gone up. The cost of steel has gone \nup. The cost of labor has gone up. What has not gone up is the user fee \nwe are asking people to pay to have better roads, highways, bridges, \nand transit to get people off our roads, highways, and bridges. If we \ncan do that, we can save a lot of money.\n  We have a tax on diesel--a Federal tax. It has been about 24 cents \nper gallon. It has been at that level since 1993--since 1993. Again, \nconcrete, asphalt, steel, and labor have all gone up, but in 22 years \nwe have not changed the user fee, if you will, on diesel.\n  The money we collect from the gas and diesel tax does not go to pay \nfor health care, it does not go to pay for wars, it does not go to pay \nfor agriculture and other things. The money we collect from these user \nfees goes to pay for roads, highways, bridges, and to some extent for \ntransit systems, to get people off our roads, highways, and bridges so \nthe rest of us will have some extra room to maneuver.\n  I will go back in time. Thomas Jefferson said a lot of things that \nare worth remembering. My favorite Jefferson quote is this: ``If the \npeople know the truth, they won't make a mistake.''\n  If the people know the truth, they won't make a mistake. The truth \nis, we are not investing in our transportation infrastructure in this \ncountry the way our competitors are and the way we ought to be.\n  To do so does not mean we have to raise--in some places they have gas \ntaxes or diesel taxes that are $4 or $5 a gallon. We don't have that. \nIt is 18 cents, and 24 cents for gas and diesel combined. If we had \nincreased them by the rate of inflation in the past, the gas tax would \nbe not 18 cents; it may be even closer to twice that. The diesel tax \nwould not be 24 cents; it might be closer to twice that. But we have \nnot changed them.\n  Here is the way we pay for transportation improvements: We don't pay \nfor them. We don't raise anything, in some cases. We just simply go out \nand borrow money for the transportation fund from the Federal general \nfund. When the general fund runs out of money, we borrow money from \ncountries around the world like China and other places and replenish \nthe general fund, and use that to replenish the transportation fund.\n  I think that is pretty foolish, especially to be beholden to the \nfolks in China for our transportation system. It does not make a whole \nlot of sense to me, maybe it does not to you either. There are other \nthings we do--we have these--I call them cats and dogs, sort of sleight \nof hand. One of the more recent examples, we do something called \npension smoothing, where--I will not get into how that works, but it is \njust an awful idea to mess with, muck with people's pensions in order \nto be able to provide funds for road improvements. That does not make \nmuch sense.\n  Another thing we do is we maybe raise the TSA fees when people want \nto fly. Instead of using that to make our friendly skies safer, we put \na little of that money in roads, highways, and bridges or maybe we sell \nsome of the oil we have in our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We paid a \nlot of money several years ago to buy gas, to buy oil when it was \nexpensive. People think it would be a smart thing to sell that oil out \nof the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, when prices are low, to help pay \nfor roads, highways, and bridges. Remember the old saying ``buy low, \nsell high.'' Well, this is really buy high and then put that oil in the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve and then sell low. That is insanity.\n\n  We can do a lot better than this. For a number of years, some have \nencouraged us to do what we have been doing for years, to actually be \nhonest and pay for improvements to our roads, highways, and bridges. \nAnd that is to raise the user fees--not all at once, not by $1 or $2 or \nanything like that, but by 4 cents a year starting next year for 4 \nyears. Then after that index--then index the fees and the taxes on gas \nand diesel according to the rate of inflation.\n  If we did that, I think we would have a combined State and Federal \nuser fee, if you will, for gas. I think it would be at that time 53 \ncents. It would be about 53 cents. Compared to what? Compared to pretty \nmuch any other developed nation in the world, we would have the lowest \ncombined Federal, State, and local user fees on gas and diesel. It is \nthe lowest as far as I can tell. We can actually double that. We are \nnot going to do that. We could actually double it again--we are not \ngoing to do that--from 53 cents to $1.06 per gallon. Again, I don't \nsuggest we would do that, but if we did, we would still be among the \nlowest compared to the rest of the world.\n  Sometimes we say: Well, 16 cents--what could I buy with that? If I \ndidn't have to pay 4 years from now an extra 16 cents when I buy a \ngallon of gas, what would that add up to in a week for the average \ndriver?\n  I will tell you this--maybe brings it home--basically the price of a \ncup of coffee a week is the cost that would be incurred by the average \ndriver even after the full increase, the 4 cents times 4 years. That is \nwhat it is worth. That would be the out-of-pocket expense for the \naverage driver, the price of a cup of coffee a week.\n  We saw earlier from some of these charts that, on average across the \ncountry, people are sitting in traffic for 42 hours per year. We saw \nsome of the graphics with the pothole and were reminded that the cost \nof damage to our cars, trucks, and vans is anywhere from $350 to some \nestimates as high as $500. We are learning that for the price of a \nbasic cup of coffee, if we invest that money instead--people can still \ndrink coffee, but if we put that in our roads, highways, bridges, and \ntransit systems, we can have a transportation system we can be proud \nof. Those four pennies add up over time, and they add up over the next \n10 years to $220 billion to have for investments. So instead of having \nroads or potholes that look like the one I saw and the kinds of traffic \njams we see here from coast to coast, we can have a transportation \nsystem again in this country we can be proud of. We just have to have \nthe will to do it.\n  Again, Thomas Jefferson reminded us that things that are worth having \nare worth paying for, and if people know the truth, they won't make a \nmistake. Roads, highways, bridges, transit--that is what we are paying \nfor. The truth is, it doesn't have to break us. It doesn't have to \nbreak our banks or our budgets. We can have those roads, highways, and \nbridges again that we can be proud of. I hope we will do that.\n  Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois and I have introduced legislation to \nessentially do that, to raise the user fees by 4 cents a year for 4 \nyears, at a time when the price of oil is as low as it has been for \nsome time and is expected to stay low for the foreseeable future.\n  If the Iranians work with us and the other five nations that \nnegotiated the Iranian agreement in order to gradually lift sanctions \nfrom their economy, they will be able to start producing oil and \nselling it across the world as long as they agree not to create that \nnuclear weapon. We are going to make sure they don't.\n  But it turns out that Iran is the No. 4 nation in the world in oil \nreserves. Think about that. We live in a world that is awash in oil. \nVery soon, the Iranian oil will be added to the oil that is\n\n[[Page S7089]]\n\navailable to consumers to use on this planet of ours. All that oil will \nnot push up the price of oil or gasoline or diesel; it will push it \ndown--supply and demand. Let's keep that in mind.\n  With that, I have spoken for long enough. I see one of my colleagues \nhas been waiting patiently, and I will bid you all adieu. Have a good \nweekend. Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                     MILCON-VA Appropriations Bill\n\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about the bill \nthat we voted on this afternoon and put it into a broader context. This \nwas the bill to begin the vote and debate on the Military Construction \nand Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill, which passed out of the \nAppropriations Committee in a strong bipartisan vote.\n  There has been a lot of talk and a lot of stories in the media over \nthe last several weeks about the government running out of money, a \ngovernment shutdown. In a lot of those stories, the narrative talked \nabout the Republican Party being the one focused on a government \nshutdown. The media actually loves this narrative, but, like a lot of \nnarratives in the media, they are not always so accurate. So I wanted \nto give what I think is the much more accurate story, what is really \ngoing on here in the Senate.\n  Many of us are new Senators--the Presiding Officer and myself \nincluded--13 of us, actually. A lot of us came to Washington and a lot \nof us actually ran for the Senate because we were fed up. We thought \nthe American people were fed up; we knew they were fed up with the \ndysfunction of the Federal Government. There are a lot of examples of \nthat. You know many of them.\n  In the last several years we have run the debt of our Nation from $10 \ntrillion to $18 trillion. Think about that. Looking at these interns \nhere on the floor, that is going to be their responsibility if we don't \nget ahold of that--$18 trillion. An economy that can't grow is what we \ncall the new normal here in Washington, 1.5 percent, 2 percent GDP \ngrowth. No budget. The previous Senate was not even passing a budget--\nthe most basic function of government. Households do it, businesses do \nit, and States do it. The Federal Government was not even taking the \ntime to pass a budget. There were no appropriations bills, no spending \nbills out of the Appropriations Committee. These were all signs of a \nFederal Government that was not working, that was dysfunctional.\n  So we came with the new majority, new leadership committed to change \nthis. We meant to change this. We were very focused on changing this, \nand we have begun in a serious way to do that. What are we doing? \nFirst, we passed a budget. It hadn't happened in years, but we did \nthat. It was a lot of hard work. My hat is off to the Budget Committee. \nWe took what was the President's budget, 10-year budget, and slashed \nthat by $5 trillion to $7 trillion in terms of spending. We didn't \nraise taxes.\n  Then the next step--what the government is supposed to do--we started \nto work on appropriations bills in the Appropriations Committee. Again, \nthis was very hard work, very bipartisan work, and for the first time \nin years, the Appropriations Committee passed out 12 appropriations \nbills to fund our government.\n  Most of these were very bipartisan. Let me give you a few examples. \nThe Agriculture appropriations bill passed out of the Appropriations \nCommittee 28 to 2. It doesn't get much more bipartisan than that. The \nCommerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill passed 27 to 3; Energy and \nWater, 26 to 4. This is strong bipartisan work in the Appropriations \nCommittee with our government getting back to work.\n  The dysfunction that had previously existed here for many years--none \nof this was happening--was going away, and we were working. Very \nimportantly, in terms of appropriations bills, the Defense \nappropriations bill passed out of the committee 27 to 3, and the \nMilitary Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill, 21 to \n9.\n  So we passed a budget, passed appropriations bills--so far so good. \nThe Senate is working again. We are back to regular order. We are \nmoving forward in a bipartisan way--very bipartisan. We are doing the \nwork of government. It is what the American people wanted, asked for, \nand we are starting to deliver on that as part of our promises last \nfall.\n  So what is the next step? The next step is to take these \nappropriations bills and bring them to the Senate floor for a vote. It \nshouldn't be a problem, particularly because the bills I am talking \nabout are so bipartisan. They came out of committee with bipartisan \nnumbers and support, so that is what we are doing. That is what is we \nhave done. That is what we are supposed to do. That is what the \nAmerican people want us to do.\n  We started to prioritize. Where should we begin? Turn on the news. I \nthink most people know where we should begin--funding our military, the \nmen and women protecting us, the men and women risking their lives on a \ndaily basis for our freedom.\n  So we brought the Defense appropriations bill to the Senate floor. \nAgain, we certainly need that. One gets the sense that the world is \ncareening into chaos. We need a strong military. We need to fund our \nmilitary. It shouldn't be an issue. It passed out of committee with a \nstrong bipartisan vote. Everybody likes to make sure we have a strong \nmilitary.\n  So what happened? We brought it to the floor of the Senate and it was \nfilibustered, not one but two times. That is irresponsible--\nfilibustering the defense of our Nation, defunding the support for our \ntroops.\n  So that brings us to what we did today. We turn to another \nappropriations bill--Military Construction and Veterans Affairs \nappropriations--again, a very bipartisan bill. It is very focused, \nbuilding military infrastructure throughout our country, throughout the \nworld. One of the most sacred responsibilities of this body, of our \ngovernment is taking care of our veterans.\n  This is a huge issue for my State. Alaska boasts the highest number \nof veterans per capita of any State in the Nation, and we need to take \ncare of our best. So what happened today? It seems pretty \nnoncontroversial. The appropriations bill--a very nonpartisan bill--\ncame to the floor, and it was filibustered again.\n  In the past few weeks, we have had critical votes to fund our \nmilitary, to fund our troops, to fund our veterans, and we cannot move \nforward. What is going on here? I really don't know. It is hard to say. \nI sit on the Armed Services Committee. I sit on the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee. These are two of the most bipartisan committees in the \nSenate. I know all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle truly \nrespect, truly support our troops and our veterans, and truly want what \nis best for them. I recognize that.\n  Then why is the other side filibustering the funding of these \nincredibly important bills, in essence defunding our troops and \ndefunding our veterans? I think the American people deserve answers. I \nthink our veterans deserve answers. I think our troops in harm's way \ndeserve answers.\n  One thing for sure is the next time the media wants to write a story \nwith a narrative about a government shutdown, they ought to ask those \nwho voted against these bills--to even start debating them--why they \nare defunding these critical groups and veterans. They need to ask \nthose who are voting against these bills, filibustering these bills, \nwhy they are leaving our troops and our veterans in the lurch.\n  Mr. President, we are doing our job--what the American people asked \nus to do, demanded from us last November. They wanted us to pass a \nbudget like they do, even though we hadn't done that in years. We did. \nThey wanted us to pass appropriations bills and to work in a bipartisan \nmanner to get these bills through the committee--all 12 to fund the \ngovernment. We did. And they wanted us to prioritize our spending, our \nactivities, and our focus in terms of government funding on the things \nthat matter most--our military and our veterans. And we did.\n  I have no idea why our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nrefuse to move with us in terms of the next step. The American people \nwant the next step. They want the Senate to vote on these bipartisan \nbills that fund our military and fund our veterans. Today, once again, \nwe are seeing that is not happening. I think the American people need \nanswers, I think our troops\n\n[[Page S7090]]\n\nneed answers, and I think our veterans need answers on why it is not \nhappening.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last night, this body approved a resolution \nauthored by Senator Wyden and myself designating September 2015 as \nNational Kinship Care Month.\n  While many may not be aware, there are approximately 2,700,000 \nchildren living in kinship care around this country. That means \nmillions of grandparents, aunts, uncles, and other relatives are \nlooking after children in every urban, rural, and suburban county of \nthe United States.\n  These caregivers have stepped forward, often at great personal \nexpense, out of love and loyalty to care for children during times in \nwhich biological parents are unable to do so. They provide safety, \npromote well-being, and establish stable homes and environments for \nextremely vulnerable children during very challenging circumstances.\n  They serve in a time of upheaval and great change for these children, \nassisting them to recognize their self-worth and potential.\n  Kinship care also enables the children to maintain family \nrelationships and cultural heritage as they continue residence in the \nnative community of the child.\n  This resolution sends a clear message that the Senate is proud of and \nwishes to honor these everyday heroes, kinship caregivers, who \nthroughout the history of the United States, have provided loving homes \nfor parentless children.\n  It is my hope that National Kinship Care Month can provide each of us \nwith an opportunity to recognize and celebrate the sacrifice and \ndevotion of kinship caregivers. And while there is still a great deal \nof work we can do to ensure that all children have a safe, loving, \nnurturing, and permanent family, regardless of age or special needs, \nkinship care providers exhibit a template of care and sacrifice that \nshould be provided for every child in this great country.\n  I am very proud of this resolution and this acknowledgement, and I \nthank my colleagues for giving it their unanimous support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/01/senate-section/article/S7090-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7090-S7092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DAVID WOLK\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to recognize the \nachievements and contributions of a remarkable educator, a personal \nfriend, and a celebrated leader in my home State of Vermont.\n  For decades, David Wolk has successfully distinguished himself as an \neducator and public servant to the people of Vermont. Now in his 11th \nyear as president of Castleton University, formally known as Castleton \nState College, David likes to call Castleton ``the small college with a \nbig heart.'' As the longest serving president in its history, he has \nincreased the college's involvement in the community and has expanded \nthe university's commitment to civic engagement and service among \nstudents and faculty alike. His personal commitment to his hometown of \nRutland, VT, is evidenced through his service as a former State senator \nand current role as a local justice of the peace.\n  As David has emboldened Castleton's primary mission to serve \nVermonters, the institution has forged new partnerships and expanded \nits opportunities to reach far beyond its footprint in Rutland County. \nDavid's leadership is currently enabling the Castleton Polling \nInstitute, which conducts surveys for Vermont politicians and media \noutlets, to expand to a national audience. Meanwhile, the Castleton \nCenter for Schools continues to serve hundreds of Vermont educators by \noffering advanced continuing education opportunities each summer. Under \nhis leadership, Castleton athletics has expanded from 12 sports at his \ninauguration to 27 varsity offerings, enabling Vermont students to play \nDivision III sports. Most recently, David has provided the vision and \nguidance for Castleton to undergo its own transformation as the college \nseeks to grow its prestige and opportunities as newly named Castleton \nUniversity.\n  David held a distinguished career in education even before stepping \nfoot at Castleton. He served as chief of policy for former Vermont \nGovernor Howard Dean and as the Vermont commissioner of education. \nDedication to his native community of Rutland may also be witnessed by \nhis impressive resume as a school principal, superintendent of the \nRutland City Public Schools, a guidance counselor and teacher, and a \ncollege instructor. He has also served as a member of numerous boards, \nincluding the Vermont Business Roundtable, the Vermont Public Education \nPartnership, and the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation. In \nrecognition of these achievements, he received the 2009 Eleanor M. \nMcMahon Award for Lifetime Achievement from the New England Board of \nHigher Education.\n  If his career is not inspiration enough, David's commitment to family \nsurely is. The proud father of four children, David led his family \nthrough the celebration of the life and legacy of his wife, Diane, when \nshe passed away this summer, nearly a decade after being diagnosed with \nearly onset Alzheimer's. A lifelong educator herself, Diane and David, \ntogether, gave more to their community than most. And David's \ncompassion and commitment to Diane leaves a lasting impression on those \nof us who call him a friend. Marcelle and I admire him.\n  In recognition of David Wolk's service and resiliency, I ask \nunanimous consent that Terri Hallenbeck's article from the August 26, \n2015, edition of Seven Days be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From Seven Days, Aug. 26, 2015]\n\n          Resilient David Wolk Champions Castleton University\n\n       Between the playing fields that serve the Castleton \n     Spartans, a marble monument tells the story of the Greek king \n     Leonidas and how he bravely resisted an army of invaders.\n       David Wolk chose the 22,000-pound stone from a Rochester \n     quarry and had it polished and engraved in Barre. As \n     Castleton's longest-serving president and its cheerleader-in-\n     chief, he hoped the monument's message, titled ``Spartan \n     Pride,'' would inspire students. He installed it six years \n     ago, just after the college football team's inaugural season \n     in a brand-new stadium.\n       Players quickly made the monument the focus of a new \n     Castleton tradition, stopping to touch it on their way to \n     practices and games. It offers no guarantees of victory on \n     the field but is an apt symbol for the little college's \n     fighting spirit to survive--and make a name for itself--in \n     the increasingly competitive world of higher education.\n       For the past 14 years, Wolk has labored to transform \n     Castleton from a tiny, isolated college into a growing \n     university with adequate funding, marketable programs and \n     satisfied students. Last month, it got a new name: Castleton \n     State College became Castleton University.\n       ``Not a lot of colleges are planning on increasing their \n     enrollment these days,'' said Vermont State Colleges \n     chancellor Jeb Spaulding, who oversees Castleton and four \n     other state colleges. ``Dave's different. His plan is, `I'm \n     building something that's attractive.' ''\n       ``He's the pied piper of Castleton and Rutland County.''\n       Just as impressive is the fact that 62-year-old Wolk \n     managed to remake Castleton while he waged another, personal \n     battle. Beneath the engraved tale of the Spartan king, \n     there's a hint at that story, too. In small type at the \n     bottom of the rock, it reads, ``In honor of Dr. Diane Wolk.''\n       Wolk's life is so intertwined with his work at Castleton \n     that he brought in this monument, at his own expense, not \n     just to create a Castleton tradition, but as a tribute to his \n     wife. Diane Wolk was a longtime teacher, school principal, \n     chair of the State Board of Education and one-time director \n     of student teaching at Castleton. She was diagnosed with \n     early-onset Alzheimer's disease in 2007, on her 57th \n     birthday, four years after she first started noticing \n     symptoms.\n       David Wolk watched in awe as his wife accepted her fate and \n     even strove to demystify\n\n[[Page S7091]]\n\n     the cruel disease. In 2008, she rallied 400 friends to take \n     part in a ``Walk With Wolk'' Alzheimer's fundraiser, and, \n     while the disease had already started to affect her mind, she \n     addressed the crowd. Quoting Lou Gehrig, she said she felt \n     like the luckiest person in the world.\n       ``She just stood up and was very brave,'' Wolk recalled. \n     ``The monument is a testament to a woman who had a lot of \n     courage.'' Diane Wolk died last month.\n\n\n                         ``The Castleton Way''\n\n       Tony Volpone was the football coach for opposing Endicott \n     College when his team visited Castleton State College in \n     2013. Endicott defeated Castleton 43-7 that day, but the \n     ``losing'' side left an indelible impression on Volpone.\n       He saw a stately new stadium filled with an enthusiastic \n     crowd, a marching band, fans holding tailgate parties in the \n     parking lot, a bouncy house for kids. And at the end of the \n     game, the team locked arms and led the crowd in the singing \n     of the alma mater.\n       ``I was so impressed with what I saw,'' Volpone said. ``It \n     made me go, `Wow, I could really see myself here.' '' A year \n     later, he became Castleton's head coach. Volpone credits Wolk \n     for the scene that sold him.\n       For most of those home-game Saturdays, Wolk is in the \n     crowd, beaming, with his soon-to-be-96-year-old father, \n     Arthur. ``It's a beautiful thing,'' he said. It's what Wolk \n     envisioned when he became Castleton president in 2001 and set \n     in place a 10-year plan to boost the college's profile.\n       Wolk was uniquely positioned when he took the job running \n     the public college in his native Rutland County. The son of a \n     local pediatrician, he graduated from Rutland High School and \n     Middlebury College and went on to a career as a teacher, \n     principal and school superintendent. Wolk also represented \n     Rutland County for four years in the state Senate, made an \n     unsuccessful bid for lieutenant governor in 1992 and served \n     as chief of policy for governor Howard Dean before becoming \n     state education commissioner.\n       By the time he took over at Castleton, he had experience \n     navigating educational and political waters. Wolk also \n     brought boundless optimism and salesmanship to the job.\n       Zachary Devoid of St. Albans, a senior computer information \n     systems major and lacrosse player at Castleton, remembered \n     meeting Wolk at the start of his freshman year. The president \n     hosts a barbecue for new students every year at his on-campus \n     house. Later, when Devoid's lacrosse team was holding an all-\n     night fundraiser in memory of a student, Wolk came by with \n     pizza.\n       ``He eats in the dining halls. He goes to sporting \n     events,'' Devoid said. ``He's very personable.''\n       ``At orientation last year, he shook everybody's hand and \n     introduced himself. It was really cool,'' said Cassie \n     Papandrea, a senior English major from Orwell who was on \n     campus last month getting ready for this year's orientation.\n       Spaulding said he visited Wolk at Castleton recently and \n     went off on his own to the gym. When he returned to Wolk's \n     house, he said, ``I asked him, `How come all these students \n     look me in the eye and open the door for me?' He said, `It's \n     the Castleton way. They have to open doors for people, and \n     they have to pick up trash.' ''\n       In fact, there's no rule about acting responsibly, but \n     Devoid said the campus is so close-knit that people just do.\n       Wolk has created a campus atmosphere that makes students \n     want to stay, said Scott Giles, president of Vermont Student \n     Assistance Corp., whose organization administers college \n     loans and interacts with a wide variety of colleges. Although \n     its student-retention rate hasn't budged much in the last \n     decade--it's average, at 73 percent--Castleton's six-year \n     graduation rate has climbed by nearly 10 percent. Enrollment \n     has grown from 1,598 in 2000 to 2,183 last year. The goal is \n     to reach 2,500 by 2023.\n       Students, faculty and outsiders have noticed a difference.\n       ``Castleton has been one of the real success stories,'' \n     Giles said, likening its emergence to Champlain College's \n     transformation from a two-year to a four-year school a decade \n     and a half ago.\n       ``Dave has been really, really successful in taking an \n     institution that had a reputation as something of a suitcase \n     college--where you can get a solid degree but you leave to do \n     other things on the weekend,'' Giles said. ``What he's really \n     done is transform the campus. It's a community that meets a \n     student's full range of needs.''\n\n\n                              Double Duty\n\n       Not every faculty member was convinced Castleton needed \n     football, according to Louis ``Tersh'' Palmer, a union rep \n     and English professor. Some ``would like to see more emphasis \n     on academics,'' he said, and ``throw all the rest of that \n     stuff out.''\n       The football program has had some problems. In 2011, its \n     first coach was forced to resign after allegedly violating \n     National Collegiate Athletic Association rules by arranging \n     loans for an athlete. In 2013, six players were suspended \n     from the team following a scheme to steal sporting goods from \n     a store.\n       In both cases, Wolk publicly acknowledged the fumbles and \n     recovered the ball. ``We will stay positive and upbeat as we \n     move forward together as a family,'' he said in response to \n     the 2013 case.\n       He took the same approach to his wife's illness. Diane \n     Wolk, who'd been named the state's teacher of the year in \n     1984, was the popular principal of Rutland's Northeast \n     Primary School when Alzheimer's began to manifest itself. In \n     his Woodruff Hall office, Wolk keeps a photo of her 2006 \n     retirement; it shows his wife surrounded by smiling \n     children--a happy spin on a somber moment.\n       Wolk likes to focus on the positive. He hands out cards \n     printed in Castleton green that say, ``Keep smiling.'' And, \n     amazingly, it works.\n       He tried to follow his own advice during the nine-year \n     ordeal that Wolk calls the ``long goodbye.'' But he also \n     acknowledged it's been a roller-coaster ride. Asked how he \n     managed the double duties of handling his wife's illness and \n     raising the college's profile--two long but very different \n     journeys--Wolk said candidly, ``I didn't.''\n       He relied on his team at Castleton, he said, and there were \n     times he considered quitting to become his wife's full-time \n     nurse. But as the disease progressed, Wolk realized she \n     needed professional care. Diane had chosen to move to \n     Florida, where she could participate in Alzheimer's research \n     and access different levels of specialized care. Wolk said \n     his wife actually preferred being far away because it spared \n     her friends and colleagues the pain of watching her decline. \n     ``She didn't want to make them sad,'' he said with \n     admiration. But for Wolk, who visited many weekends, it was a \n     long haul.\n       ``I think it's been very difficult,'' said Spaulding, who \n     served in the state Senate with Wolk in the 1980s. ``But I \n     think Castleton University is part of his family. It's part \n     of what's enabled him to continue.''\n       Wolk confirmed that Castleton was his salvation during that \n     decade of decline. ``I was able to dive into the college,'' \n     he said. ``It gave new meaning to my life.''\n       Castleton had 12 athletic teams when Wolk arrived on \n     campus. It now has 27, which is more than any other Vermont \n     state college or the University of Vermont. The school is \n     providing Vermont students with an opportunity to play \n     college sports in their home state. And they're tuition-\n     paying students. Because it is Division III, Castleton \n     doesn't offer athletic scholarships.\n       The school has added a lot more than sports teams. It has \n     invested more than $75 million in new construction and \n     renovations to every building on campus. The college has gone \n     from offering one master's degree to 10, with plans to add \n     doctorates in education and nursing practice.\n       While some Vermont state colleges have endured layoffs, \n     Castleton has avoided them, according to Wolk. The college \n     does plan to cut one program next year, though: its \n     associate's degree in nursing, a program that Vermont \n     Technical College offers.\n       Wolk has also launched a variety of branded initiatives \n     that are generating revenue: The Castleton Polling Institute, \n     which conducts paid surveys for Vermont politicians and media \n     outlets, is expanding and going national; the Castleton \n     Center for Schools brought 800 Vermont teachers to campus \n     this summer for continuing education; the Castleton Downtown \n     Gallery showcases art--and the Castleton name--in downtown \n     Rutland. The university also owns the Spartan Arena at \n     Rutland's Diamond Run Mall, a public operation that gives \n     students real-world business experience. The college bought \n     the building to accommodate its men's and women's hockey \n     teams, which Wolk started in 2003. When they aren't \n     practicing or playing there, it's a rental rink and fitness \n     center.\n       The income-generating programs have been developed in \n     response to a shrinking pool of college-age students and \n     declining state funding. Vermont routinely ranks near the \n     bottom in state support for its public colleges. This year, \n     Vermont State Colleges will receive $24.4 million from the \n     state, which is split equally among the five colleges. \n     Castleton's allotment pays just 10 percent of its budget.\n       ``We're getting less money from the state this year than we \n     got in 2008 or '09,'' Wolk said, and he knows enough about \n     Vermont politics to realize that is unlikely to change \n     anytime soon.\n       The name change is also intended to counteract the lack of \n     state funding. Wolk said he hopes Castleton University will \n     attract more out-of-state students, who pay higher tuition. \n     Currently, 74 percent of its students are in-staters. By \n     2023, Castleton's goal is to have a 60-40 in-state versus \n     out-of-state split. Wolk said Castleton's main mission \n     remains to serve Vermonters but will reflect the reality that \n     there are fewer college-age students in the state. \n     Castleton's other programs within the community, including \n     the polling institute and the Spartan Arena, are examples of \n     other ways it's contributing to the public good.\n       Particularly for international students who equate the word \n     ``college'' with high school, the ``university'' designation \n     should send a clearer message. Castleton had 25 students from \n     other countries last year and expects 50 this year, Wolk \n     said. The college upped its overseas admissions efforts by \n     hiring a Chinese-American recruitment coordinator and making \n     two trips to China last year, he said. As part of a \n     residency, 13 Chinese scholars are due on campus this fall.\n       During the 15 years he's taught at Castleton, English prof \n     Palmer has seen enrollment and programs expand and the \n     quality of students grow. ``There really has been an \n     improvement in morale, in offerings,'' he said. Football, he \n     acknowledged, helped.\n\n\n                        What's in a Name Change?\n\n       As Vermont's colleges struggle with dwindling resources and \n     occasional layoffs, can\n\n[[Page S7092]]\n\n     the state afford to keep all five alive--plus the University \n     of Vermont? In a recent commentary, Hinesburg author Bill \n     Schubart took on the issue, arguing, ``Vermonters can't \n     adequately fund six colleges in a time of declining \n     enrollments.'' He contended that renaming Castleton was not \n     the answer.\n       ``I really doubt that their new name will do much to solve \n     the enrollment and cost challenges facing all our small state \n     colleges, to say nothing of our students,'' he said.\n       Spaulding, who took over as chancellor last year, said he's \n     heard all of those arguments before, but he sees no reason to \n     consolidate. ``We actually need the colleges we have,'' he \n     said.\n       Spaulding argued that Castleton's name change will be good \n     for all of them, adding that none of the other college \n     administrators objected.\n       Each of the state colleges has--and should have--its own \n     identity, Spaulding said. Lyndon has the largest percentage \n     of out-of-staters, a strong meteorology program and an \n     innovative electronic journalism program. Johnson is known \n     for external degrees for nontraditional students, social \n     service programs and the performing arts. The bread and \n     butter of Vermont Technical College is its two-year \n     engineering degree. Community College of Vermont offers an \n     affordable start for students of all ethnicities and \n     socioeconomic backgrounds.\n       Castleton's specialty is being less specialized. ``It's a \n     small university that has a robust graduate program combined \n     with broad academic programs,'' Spaulding said. ``It's the \n     only public higher ed institution in Vermont with a football \n     team, and it's got a very lively campus.''\n       Wolk acknowledged that the name change is really about \n     perception.\n       When Richard Stockton College of New Jersey became Stockton \n     University this year, the goal was to ``raise the school's \n     profile, helping it attract faculty, students--especially \n     graduate and international students--and raise funds,'' the \n     Philadelphia Inquirer reported.\n       Massachusetts state colleges changed their names in 2010, \n     though they retained the word ``state,'' so that Bridgewater \n     State College became Bridgewater State University.\n       Castleton students are buying into the idea that Castleton \n     University carries just a little bit more prestige. ``It \n     means we're expanding, we're growing,'' said Papandrea.\n       ``It's going to help the college bring in more students,'' \n     Devoid said. It might look a little jazzier on his resume, \n     too, he said.\n       For Wolk, the name change marks a major milestone for \n     Castleton, which has actually had seven other appellations \n     since 1787: It's been Rutland County Grammar School, Vermont \n     Classical High School, Castleton Seminary, State Normal \n     School at Castleton, Castleton Normal School and Castleton \n     State Teachers College. The Castleton State College \n     designation dates to 1962.\n       ``Modernizing our name reflects who we've become and who we \n     aspire to be,'' he said. ``It's a wonderful turning point for \n     a wonderful institution.''\n       The idea for the name change emerged two or three years ago \n     as Castleton administrators crafted Wolk's second 10-year \n     plan. Although he was a driving force behind it, the \n     visionary president had to miss some of the meetings that \n     made it happen, during which his staff pitched the idea to \n     the Vermont State College committees. In the last few months, \n     as his wife's health worsened, he spent more time in Florida \n     than Vermont. He was with Diane when she died there on July \n     4.\n       ``Our goal was that her death be peaceful and painless,'' \n     he said. ``It was that.'' In the weeks after, Wolk received \n     hundreds of messages from his wife's former students, \n     colleagues and friends telling him how much Diane had meant \n     to them.\n       ``Kids just loved her,'' said David Blow, a Castleton \n     journalism professor who had Diane as a first-grade teacher. \n     His mother, Lucille, who taught alongside her at Barstow \n     Memorial School in Chittenden, told her son that Wolk's was \n     the most difficult condolence card she has ever had to write.\n       When the full Vermont State Colleges Board of Trustees \n     gathered July 23 to make a final decision on the name change, \n     David Wolk traveled to Montpelier for the meeting. ``I just \n     wanted to be there, because it was historic,'' he said. The \n     vote was unanimous. Word went viral as Castleton spokesman \n     Jeff Weld announced the move on Twitter and Facebook, and the \n     university's website got more than 10,000 hits.\n       Afterward, Wolk continued on to Burlington to board a plane \n     for Florida, where two days later family gathered for a \n     celebration of Diane's life. In his eulogy, Wolk spoke about \n     his wife's courage.\n       ``Her life was full of teachable moments, and this was the \n     final one,'' he said.\n       Diane Wolk's family members divided her ashes for each to \n     scatter as he or she wished. The next week, Wolk returned to \n     Castleton. That Friday afternoon, he and two of their four \n     children went to the Spartan monument and spread her remains \n     at the base of the rock that honors and encourages brave \n     souls.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/01/senate-section/article/S7092-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING DOUG KENDALL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this past weekend, I learned of the \nuntimely passing of Doug Kendall, founder of the Constitutional \nAccountability Center. Doug was a true visionary who helped transform \nhow the American public views our Constitution. Despite a recent \nmovement to interpret our founding charter in a cramped manner that too \noften leaves our most vulnerable populations unprotected, Doug was able \nto serve as a forceful counterweight and guardian of an inclusive, \nprogressive, and faithful understanding of our National Charter, based \non both the text and history of the document.\n  Under his leadership, the Constitutional Accountability Center \nrevitalized the debate over the original understanding of the \nConstitution. Doug refused to cede the intellectual ground of \noriginalism and textualism to conservative advocates. Significantly, \nthe organization he founded was defined as much by its scholarship as \nits effective advocacy.\n  Doug made myriad contributions to the world of law and policy, but I \nwill point out just two. First, I asked him to testify in March 2010 \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee on the Supreme Court's decision \nin Citizens United v. FEC because I knew that no one could better \narticulate the harm that the decision would cause to our democracy. As \nhe eloquently testified before the Committee, ``Since the Founding, the \nidea that corporations have the same fundamental rights as `We the \nPeople' has been anathema to our Constitution. . . . Corporations do \nnot vote, they cannot run for office, and they are not endowed by the \nCreator with inalienable rights. `We the People' create corporations \nand we provide them with special privileges that carry with them \nrestrictions that do not apply to living persons. These truths are \nself-evident, and it's past time for the Court to finally get this \nright, once and for all.'' While the Court was unable to get it right \nin Doug's lifetime, I believe his views will come to be vindicated in \ntime.\n  Second, this past year, I introduced a joint resolution with Senator \nMike Lee of Utah, celebrating the sesquicentennial or the 150th \nanniversary of the 13th Amendment, which, along with the 14th and 15th \nAmendments, make up our Nation's ``second founding.'' The second \nfounding, which has served as the bedrock and inspiration to procuring \nequality for racial minorities and women, has too often been overlooked \nby the general public and constitutional scholars. Doug and his \norganization were the intellectual driving force behind advancing this \nimportant resolution. His contributions to the world of law and policy \nwill be sorely missed.\n  As accomplished as he was as an advocate and scholar, Doug was an \neven better person. My staff met with him countless times and always \ncame away inspired by his intellect and humanity. An article in the \nWashington Post from January 2008 about the historic endorsement that \nthen-candidate and Senator Barack Obama received from Senator Ted \nKennedy noted that Doug was there with his then 8-year old daughter, \nMiracle. Doug had pulled Miracle out of her elementary school that day \nso that she could experience the historic nature of the President's \ncandidacy and the bridge between former President Kennedy and future \nPresident Obama. He stated in the article that he wanted his daughter, \nMiracle, to be inspired. What she will come to know--if she does not \nalready--is that her father's life and his accomplishments have helped \nto inspire a new generation. Doug Kendall has reminded us about the \never-more inclusive story that is reflected in our Constitution. His \nlife was cut short, but his vision--like the Constitution itself--will \ncontinue to endure and inspire. The Nation has lost a true patriot with \nhis passing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/01/senate-section/article/S7092-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7092-S7093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING KING ARTHUR FLOUR\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, each year, it is with great pride that I \nparticipate in a reception here on Capitol Hill to showcase some of the \nbest products conceived, developed, and produced in Vermont. One such \ncompany featured at the annual Taste of Vermont event is King Arthur \nFlour, where, for 225 years, generation after generation has produced \nquality cooking and baking ingredients.\n  A firm that was born in Boston more than two centuries ago, in 1984 \nthen-owners Frank and Brinna Sands moved King Arthur Flour to Norwich,\n\n[[Page S7093]]\n\nVermont, and the company has become a staple in Vermont's business \ncommunity. In the 1990s, the Sands made the decision to sell their \ncompany to their employees. The returns have been considerable, and the \ncompany has seen growth ever since.\n  In ways that are typical of Vermont businesses, King Arthur Flour has \nevolved into a quality company offering quality products to its \ncustomers. The company's business model reflects one that is committed \nto its customers, its employees, the environment, and its community, \neven offering employees 40 hours of paid volunteer time to give back. \nThose commitments are backed up in its status as a certified B \nCorporation, a designation that independently recognizes the company's \nsocial sustainability and environmental performance standards.\n  From breads to cakes, cookies to pies, King Arthur Flour's products \nhave become staples in bakers' kitchens across the country, including \nin the Leahy kitchen, where Marcelle regularly shares her recipes with \nour grandchildren. In fact, many of our visits to the Upper Valley \ninclude a detour to King Arthur's terrific cafe where all of their \nsuperb products are available. It is yet another example of a tried and \ntrue Vermont-based company, revolutionizing and enticing the market \nwith its quality products.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an August 28, \n2015, article from the Burlington Free Press recognizing King Arthur \nFlour's ``225 years of baking history.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Aug. 28, 2015]\n\n             King Arthur Flour: 225 Years of Baking History\n\n                            (By Susan Reid)\n\n       Some 225 years ago George Washington delivered the first \n     State of the Union address in January. In February, the U.S. \n     Supreme Court met for the first time. Vermont itself wasn't \n     yet a state. According to King George, it belonged to New \n     York, despite also being known as the New Hampshire Grants.\n       In this world, miles away in Boston, a man named Henry Wood \n     started a company that imported flour from England. The brand \n     new United States of America numbered fewer than four million \n     souls. Wood correctly assumed this growing country was going \n     to need flour for baking, and his commitment to pure, high-\n     quality flour fueled a successful business.\n\n\n                          Enter John Low Sands\n\n       One of the early employees was John Low Sands, who joined \n     the firm in 1820. It was the beginning of generations of \n     Sands family association with, and eventual ownership of the \n     company. Also a clue to how the company came to be based in \n     Vermont, as you'll soon see. By 1853, the company was doing \n     well enough to buy a large building on the Long Wharf in \n     Boston. There, in the middle of one of the world's busiest \n     ports, the business continued to grow, taking on partners as \n     it expanded. In less than 10 years the city of Boston had \n     filled in the harbor around the wharf, and the company became \n     landlocked without ever having moved. It stayed in the same \n     spot, with the revised address of 172 State St. until 1904, \n     when the company moved up the street to the Custom House.\n       By 1895, the company was named Sands, Taylor, & Wood. The \n     third generation of the Sands family to be part of the \n     company, Orrin Sands, was its president. During this decade, \n     roller milling was developed in Hungary. As a result, it was \n     now possible to grind large quantities of wheat into flour \n     very quickly. This led to a boom in flour production, as well \n     as wild fluctuations in the quality of flour being produced.\n       At the same time, George Wood and his business partners \n     attended a musical play based on the story of King Arthur and \n     his knights. They left the theater inspired by the \n     realization that the values portrayed in the play exemplified \n     what their company stood for: quality, integrity, purity, \n     loyalty, strength, and dedication to a higher purpose. They \n     resolved to rename their new flagship product, their all-\n     purpose flour, after King Arthur. It was introduced at the \n     Boston Food Fair in September 1896, and became an immediate \n     success. The distinctive image of the medieval knight on his \n     horse adorned the tops of 196 pound barrels of flour for the \n     next four decades, until he started being printed on \n     newfangled paper bags.\n       In the 1920s King Arthur on his steed appeared on the back \n     of a flatbed calliope truck that roamed the streets of Boston \n     and New York. In later decades the company gave scholarships \n     to promising young professional bakers, inserted collectible \n     picture cards of American military ships, airplanes, and \n     weapons in its flour bags during World War II, and after the \n     war sponsored radio shows where ``New England's Food Expert'' \n     Marjorie Mills endorsed King Arthur Flour on the air.\n\n\n                          The move to Vermont\n\n       The Sands family became the sole owners of the company in \n     1932, and in 1984, Frank (a Dartmouth alum) and his wife \n     Brinna Sands moved the company to Vermont. Tired of lugging \n     bags of flour to the post office to mail to retirees in \n     Florida who couldn't buy King Arthur outside of New England, \n     Brinna started The Baker's Catalogue in 1990.\n       She also published the ``200th Anniversary Cookbook,'' \n     which has sold well over 100,000 copies to date.\n       In a pivotal move, Frank and Brinna decided to sell the \n     company to their employees, launching King Arthurs Employee \n     Stock Ownership plan. The company has seen steady growth \n     since then.\n       By 1999, the company officially changed its name to King \n     Arthur Flour, and the Baker's Catalogue was mailing six \n     million catalogues per year. Distribution of the flour to \n     grocery stores up and down the East Coast was well \n     established, and expanding steadily westward. In 2000, \n     Vermont Gov. Howard Dean was on hand to break an oversized \n     baguette in two to celebrate the opening of the bakery and \n     school in Norwich. In 2004 the company became 100 percent \n     employee-owned.\n       With all of these changes, the principles that the company \n     began with survived and thrived. In 2007, King Arthur Flour \n     was a founding and certified B Corp. Its bylaws reflect a \n     commitment to all stakeholders, including the community and \n     the environment, as well as shareholders and business \n     partners.\n       Now a national brand known for its quality, customer \n     service, and expertise in all things baking, King Arthur has \n     grown both the brand and its service programs. Bake for Good: \n     Kids teaches 8- to 12-year olds how to bake bread in a \n     curriculum-based program that provides a community service \n     component of giving a loaf back to someone in need. King \n     Arthur has long had a policy of giving 40 paid hours of \n     volunteer time to all employees, full- and part-time.\n       King Arthur's mission and personality is to be a resource \n     for all bakers. It maintains a robust social media presence \n     on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and on its blog, Flourish. \n     The website has thousands of tested recipes, and there's a \n     crew of baking experts on the Baker's Hotline ready to answer \n     any baking question, either by phone or via online chat.\n       King Arthur is poised to further the quest for honest, \n     homemade, local food, by providing everything one needs to \n     bake. Lucky for the company, and Vermont, that appetite is \n     timeless, and a good apple pie is never going to go out of \n     style.\n\n\n                        What's baking in Norwich\n\n       Baking classes: You can always come and take a class at the \n     Baking Education Center in Norwich (no dishwashing \n     required!).

Mr. President, I rise to address an important event that \noccurred this week at the United Nations, which is marking the 70th \nsession of the United Nations General Assembly, UNGA.\n  Over the weekend, over 150 world leaders gathered at UNGA to adopt \nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This new 2030 Agenda for \nSustainable Development is built on the progress achieved by Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, MDGs, which were\n\n[[Page S7094]]\n\nlaunched in 2000. The Millennium Development Goals brought together \nnations, businesses, international organizations, and foundations in a \nfocused and coordinated effort to reduce poverty and disease by 2015.\n  By any and every metric, the initial set of MDGs has resulted in \ntangible, concrete progress. One goal was to cut extreme poverty by \nhalf as measured by the proportion of people living on less than $1.25 \na day. That goal was met 5 years ahead of schedule. Meanwhile, maternal \nmortality was cut nearly in half. We've also made progress in global \neducation, with a 20 percent increase in primary school enrollment in \nsub-Saharan Africa and a nearly 50 percent decrease in the number of \nout-of-school children of primary school age. When it comes to \ncombating HIV/AIDS, we've made truly incredible strides over the past \n15 years. New HIV infections have dropped by 40 percent between 2000 \nand 2013, and the number of people living with HIV that were receiving \nantiretroviral therapy increased seventeenfold from 2003 to 2014.\n  In some areas, like gender equality, we still have a long way to go. \nBut we can cheer the fact that, in 90 percent of countries today, women \nhave greater parliamentary representation than they did just 20 years \nago.\n  So there is no doubt that we've seen real growth around the world. \nMillions of lives have been saved and enriched. But we still have more \nprogress to make.\n  The old Millennium Development Goals have laid the groundwork for the \n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which was adopted by the U.N. \nover the weekend. The new agenda sets out an ambitious global \ndevelopment framework that includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals.\n  These new goals were negotiated with strong engagement by the U.S. \ngovernment, business leaders, and civil society members over the last 3 \nyears. American and international corporations worked closely with the \nU.N. because many businesses leaders correctly believe that, to end \nextreme poverty and open new markets, we must increase government \ntransparency, root out corruption, and accelerate inclusive economic \ngrowth.\n  Many of these new goals focus on the areas where we hope to see \nadditional progress, such as maternal and child health, environmental \nsustainability, and gender equality. But they also focus on good \ngovernance and corruption.\n  I am particularly pleased at the addition of goal No. 16, which is to \n``promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, \nprovide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and \ninclusive institutions at all levels.'' Including that goal wasn't \neasy--it was met by resistance from many other countries--but no one \ncan ignore the fact any longer that good governance and anticorruption \nefforts are critical to development.\n  Truly sustainable and inclusive development depends on governments \nand institutions that are accountable and transparent and that respect \nhuman rights and deliver justice for everybody, not just some. The U.N. \nhas noted that ``lessons learned from MDG implementation showed the \nimportance of incorporating human rights, the rule of law and personal \nsecurity to ensure progress towards development goals. Effective and \ninclusive governance and robust institutional capacity are instrumental \nin achieving this.''\n  The necessity of incorporating good governance and strong \nanticorruption measures in sustainable development efforts is most \nevident when we look at resource rich countries in Africa and the \nextraordinary development challenges there. The Democratic Republic of \nthe Congo, DRC, for example, is a country rich in minerals, water \nresources, and agricultural potential. And it has experienced high \nannual economic growth in recent years. Yet most of its people continue \nto live in extreme poverty. DRC's progress on sustainable development \nis hindered by minimal central government control over large parts of \nthe national territory, poor transportation and electricity \ninfrastructure, the government's inability to manage and monitor \nextraction of its natural resources, and broad governance problems \nincluding endemic corruption and barely functional state institutions.\n  Without progress on justice and effective and accountable \ninstitutions, corruption will continue to infect governments around the \nworld, like the DRC, creating greater economic and political \ninstability, which often leads to violent conflict.\n  The DRC is just one example of why we need goal 16. The desperate \nrefugees streaming into Europe provide another sad example. Most of \nthese people are coming from places where ordinary people have \nexperienced long-term repression and other human rights abuses at the \nhands of deeply corrupt governments. Consequently, many of these \ncountries are now consumed by violent conflict. Most of the people \ncrossing the Mediterranean in rafts are fleeing wars in Syria, \nAfghanistan, Iraq, and Somalia.\n  The Syrians are the largest group. They are fleeing a deadly \ncombination of their own government's indiscriminate barrel bomb \nattacks on crowded markets, schools, and clinics; suffocating sieges; \nand atrocities committed by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, ISIS \nand other extremist groups. We know that only a minority of migrants \narriving in Europe are motivated solely by economic betterment.\n  As the world focuses on the wave of refugees and migrants arriving in \nEurope, we must not lose our focus on the roots of this crisis. We must \npay attention to why these desperate men, women, and children are on \nthe move. The misery of many of these refugees is the direct result of \nthe conflicts and human rights abuses of governments that are \nineffective or illegitimate, or both, and mostly likely corrupt.\n  The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals is remarkable for \nthe historic inclusion of goal 16. It acknowledges the centrality of \ngood governance and accountable and transparent institutions as \nprerequisites for sustainable development. If nations across the globe \ntruly embrace goal 16, I am convinced we will also witness far fewer \nmen, women, and children being forced to endure extraordinary misery, \nviolence, displacement, and exploitation as refugees. Surely, that must \nbe our collective goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/01/senate-section/article/S7094-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7094-S7095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRENAMING OF THE U.S. NAVAL ACADEMY ADMINISTRATION BUILDING FOR ADMIRAL \n                           CHARLES R. LARSON\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this Friday, October 2, 2015, the U.S. \nNaval Academy will honor ADM Charles R. Larson, class of 1958, by \nnaming the administration building in his honor. Coming just a week \nbefore the Naval Academy celebrates its 170th anniversary, this is \nfitting tribute to man who has made such immeasurable contributions to \nthis fine institution.\n  Chuck Larson grew up thousands of miles from the nearest ocean. \nHowever, the calling of the sea brought him to Annapolis and the start \nof a career dedicated to the service of this great Nation. It was at \nthe Academy where I had the distinct pleasure of getting to know this \ngreat man. Chuck's Academy experience was somewhat different than mine, \nwhere he would go on to become the brigade commander, president of the \nclass of 1958, and graduate near the top of the class. I finished some \ndistance behind that mark. Even though our paths were different, I \ncherished our friendship forged in those shared Academy experiences, a \nfriendship that would last a lifetime.\n  After graduation in the summer of 1958, Chuck would continue his \nexemplary career, eventually attaining the rank of admiral. He has led \nat every level from command at sea to theater command, as commander of \nthe 2nd Fleet, a Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, commander of the \nPacific Fleet, and finally as the commander of United States Pacific \nCommand. Impressive as this resume was, the two jobs Chuck cherished \nmost were his two tours as the Superintendent of the Naval Academy.\n  As the only two-time Superintendent of the Academy in its 170-year \nhistory, Chuck left an indelible mark on the institution he so loved. \nReturning from retirement in 1994 to lead the Academy after serious \nproblems left the institution with an uncertain future, Chuck focused \non character development and fundamental leadership training to return \nto the founding principles of the Academy. In 4 years, he returned the \ninstitution to greatness and, in the process, trained the officers that \nwould\n\n[[Page S7095]]\n\nbecome the leaders in the fight against terrorism that would define a \ngeneration.\n  As a result of Chuck's tireless efforts and the lasting initiatives \nhe put in place, today the Naval Academy consistently ranks among the \ntop schools in the Nation. His legacy of service to the Academy and the \nNation will be felt in the decades to come as graduates from the \ninstitution become leaders in the military, government, and corporate \nvenues. I can think of no better way to honor the legacy of Chuck's \nservice than with the rededication of the administration building as \nLarson Hall. It will stand as an ever present reminder to the \ndedication and the ideals of great naval officer, leader, and dear \nfriend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/01/senate-section/article/S7095-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL MANUFACTURING DAY\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I join with my colleagues, led by \nSenators Coons and Baldwin, to recognize the significant role \nmanufacturing plays in the United States and in my home State of Rhode \nIsland. According to facts compiled by the National Association of \nManufacturers, over 41,000 Rhode Islanders, nearly 9 percent of the \nworkforce, work in manufacturing. Those workers were responsible for \n$4.1 billion in economic output, just under 8 percent of the State's \ntotal output, in 2013. On average these workers brought in over $67,000 \nin annual compensation.\n  Manufacturing is a highly technical and innovative industry that \ncreates good-paying jobs for skilled workers. It is also an industry \nthat is expanding; in Rhode Island manufacturing jobs have increased by \n1,100 compared to a year ago. And just last week I joined a Rhode \nIsland advanced manufacturer, Yushin America, Inc., to celebrate a \nribbon cutting for its $2 million expansion.\n  This sort of expansion is representative of the type of highly \ntechnical growth we see in manufacturing. Moreover, these good-paying, \nhighly-skilled, middle-class jobs are what will help further support \nwidespread economic growth. That is why I look forward to celebrating \nNational Manufacturing Day with the mayor of Providence and my \ndelegation colleagues on Monday and continuing to work to advance \nmeasures that support manufacturers and job creation back home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/01/senate-section/article/S7095-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7095-S7096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JEFFREY F. PANIATI\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to an outstanding \ncivil servant and constituent, Jeffrey F. Paniati, executive director \nof the Federal Highway Administration, FHWA, who is retiring after 32 \nyears of Federal service.\n  Jeff Paniati received his master of science degree in civil \nengineering from the University of Maryland. He joined FHWA in 1983 as \na highway engineer trainee and rose through the ranks to join the \nSenior Executive Service in 2000 and eventually became executive \ndirector in April 2008. The executive director, the number three \nofficial in FHWA, is the only civil service position in the agency that \nrequires the approval of the President. As executive director, Jeff \nassists the Federal Highway Administrator and Deputy Administrator in \nestablishing policies, programs, and priorities for the $40 billion \nannual Federal aid highway program. As FHWA's chief operating officer, \nhe oversees a workforce of approximately 2,900 transportation \nprofessionals and an annual operating budget of $400 million.\n  One of the biggest challenges Jeff faced came just months after he \nbecame executive director. The economic collapse in the fall of 2008 \nbrought the country into the worst recession since the Great Depression \nof the 1930s. On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act, ARRA, into law. ARRA, also known as the \nstimulus act, authorized $26.6 billion for road and bridge projects \nthat would create construction jobs to help the economy recover while \nproviding transportation facilities to make our communities safer, \ngreener, more livable, less congested, and economically stronger. This \nfunding was in addition to the regular $40 billion a year Federal aid \nhighway program.\n  At the time, Jeff was the highest ranking FHWA official because the \nPresident had not yet nominated a new Federal Highway Administrator or \nDeputy Administrator. It fell to Jeff, serving as acting Deputy \nAdministrator, to ensure the agency was able to absorb the additional \nfunds, deploy them to State and local officials for shovel-ready \nprojects, ensure proper oversight of record numbers of projects, and \nhelp deliver the jobs the country so desperately needed. The result was \nmore than 13,000 highway and bridge projects across the country that \nput tens of thousands of people to work, in addition to the thousands \nof projects and jobs resulting from regular program funds. All of this \nwas accomplished within ARRA's deadlines, without any increase in staff \nby FHWA but with the full cooperation of State and local transportation \nofficials under the familiar Federal-State partnership of the Federal \naid highway program.\n  President Obama remarked that there has never been a program of this \nscale, moving at this speed, enacted as effectively, and meeting such \nhigh standards of transparency and accountability. The stimulus \nprovided by implementation of the Recovery Act paved the foundation for \nthe economic growth that has continued to this day. Many people deserve \ncredit for this outstanding accomplishment, including FHWA employees \naround the country, especially Jeff Paniati.\n  Throughout Jeff's earlier career in FHWA, he accumulated a diverse \nrange of experience in helping to make America's transportation systems \nwork safely and efficiently. He served as chief of the safety design \ndivision, a research office helping to advance the state of the art in \nhighway safety. As program manager for Intelligent Transportation \nSystems, ITS, he led the more than $100 million annual Federal ITS \nprogram. He directed day-to-day operations of the ITS Joint Program \nOffice, which focuses on bringing advanced communication and \ninformation system technologies to the management and operation of our \nNation's surface transportation system. At the time of his appointment \nas executive director, he was FHWA's associate administrator for \noperations; in this capacity, he provided national leadership in system \nmanagement and operations, ITS deployment, and freight management. \nThroughout Jeff's career, he has worked closely with the Transportation \nResearch Board, the American Association of State Highway and \nTransportation Officials, and ITS America--to name just a few of FHWA's \nmany partners and stakeholders.\n  Jeff's extensive experience throughout the agency gave him the \nbackground to move FHWA forward. He oversaw the successful \nimplementation of the many program changes required under the Moving \nAhead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, MAP-21, in 2012. Perhaps \nthe most significant change was that MAP-21 shifted FHWA to risk-based \nstewardship and oversight that redefined FHWA's role in working with \nits State and local partners. It also gave FHWA the leadership role in \ntransitioning with its partners to a transportation performance \nmanagement focus that emphasizes a strategic approach by using data to \nmake investment and policy decisions to achieve national performance \ngoals. These dramatic changes in operation of the Federal aid highway \nprogram required extensive outreach, which Jeff coordinated, to explain \nthe shifts to FHWA's partners and gain their support for them.\n  Jeff played a leadership role in advancing U.S. interests and \nbolstering international cooperation under the auspices of the World \nRoad Association, where he served as U.S. first delegate and chair of \nthe strategic planning commission. He led an international team in \noverseeing the work of the association's 15 technical committees and \nthe development of its next strategic plan. He also facilitated efforts \nto advance special reports on the importance of road maintenance and \nhelped produce a climate change adaptation framework. Jeff's \ninvolvement in the association enabled the U.S. to further enhance our \ninternational leadership and expertise in the design, delivery, and \noperation of highway and road networks.\n  Closer to home, Jeff never forgot the importance of giving all FHWA \nemployees the opportunity to advance in their careers. He listened to \nemployee feedback, administered a strategic\n\n[[Page S7096]]\n\nworkforce assessment, established a formal mentoring program, developed \nthe leadership for innovation decisionmaking program and expanded the \nLeadership Development Academy, and instilled in leadership ranks \nthroughout the FHWA the value of expanding opportunity. Initiatives of \nthis type are valuable to employees and their families, but are also \ncritical to ensuring the FHWA can meet the challenges of the future by \nhelping the agency to recruit and retain the best public servants our \nNation has to offer. Through these and other initiatives, Jeff helped \nmake FHWA successful not only in accomplishing its vitally important \nmission, but in making the agency a better place to work. Among \nagencies of its size, FHWA has ranked in the top 10 best places to work \nin the Federal Government among agency subcomponents for the past 3 \nyears. Under Jeff's leadership, FHWA moved from No. 33 in 2009 to No. 5 \nin 2013, an impressive achievement in a short period of time.\n  Jeff will be retiring this month after 32 years of Federal service to \nbecome president and chief executive officer of the Institute of \nTransportation Engineers. After his long career and especially his 7\\1/\n2\\ years as executive director, Jeff leaves FHWA a better place, which \nis good for America. I am proud to represent Jeff and so many other \nFederal workers. I believe our Federal workforce is the best in the \nworld. We are fortunate to have dedicated, talented, creative, hard-\nworking, and patriotic public servants like Jeff. I ask my colleagues \nto join me in thanking Jeff for serving the American public with such \ndistinction and devotion and wishing him much success as he leaves \nFederal service. We also need to thank his wife, Kim, and his children \nChris and Lauren for supporting him in his public career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/01/senate-section/article/S7096-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SYLVIA OLIVER\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, there are many people who work behind the \nscenes to help the Senate function. We tend to take them for granted, \nbut we shouldn't. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge \none such Senate staffer, Sylvia Oliver, who is leaving at the end of \nthis week. I won't say that Sylvia is retiring because there is a \nchance we can coax her into returning at some point. But she is leaving \nher job as coordinator of the Congressional Record in the Office of the \nOfficial Reporters of Debates because she wants to spend more time at \nhome with her daughter, Lily, who is a senior in high school. That is a \ncompletely understandable and laudable desire.\n  Few people appreciate that even though the Office of the Official \nReporters of Debates has embraced the latest information technology, \nproducing the Congressional Record remains a painstaking, labor-\nintensive process. Even fewer people appreciate that the officials and \nemployees like Sylvia who are responsible for its production typically \nhave to work for several hours each night after the Senate has \nadjourned making sure the Record is accurate and complete before \nsending it to the Government Publishing Office. We take for granted \nthat a printed copy of the Record, one of the most important documents \nin our Nation, will be delivered to our offices the next morning. There \nare many people who work late into the night without fanfare or \naccolades to make this possible. They are an invaluable part of what I \ncall the Senate family.\n  Sylvia is a Vermont native and graduated from the University of \nVermont. She still visits her mother, Betty Reid, in Barre as often as \npossible and is close to her siblings, John Reid, Betsy Reid, David \nReid, and Sarah Schroeder. She started her congressional service on the \nHouse side in 1988 working for then-Representative Jim Jeffords of \nVermont. She came with him to the Senate in 1989. She returned to the \nHouse for a few years, working as an executive assistant to the House \nSergeant at Arms. Then, she came back to the Senate in 1993, where she \nworked as a scheduler and executive assistant for Senator Byron Dorgan \nof North Dakota and the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs before \nassuming her current job with the Office of the Official Reporters of \nDebates. She is unfailingly professional and polite. We will all miss \nher, but I know her colleagues in the Office of the Official Reporters \nof Debates will miss her the most because she is such a kind and gentle \nand pleasant person.\n  I am proud to have Sylvia as a constituent. She lives near Annapolis; \nand, true to the rural roots of her Vermont upbringing, she has made \nher home atop a converted barn. Even though she works long hours in the \nSenate, she has usually done more each morning before she arrives here \nthan most people accomplish in a week. She maintains a small farm and \nlooks after three horses whose names are Conge, Chance, and Love It. \nShe starts most mornings by mowing acres of pasture, hauling dozens of \nbales of hay, and feeding the chickens. She also has a small pumpkin \npatch. But that is not enough for Sylvia--she has a number of bee hives \nto look after, too.\n  Lily Oliver, who has graciously shared her mother with us, has said, \n``My mom is the most beautiful person I know. She makes the world a \nbetter place by always treating those around her with compassion and \npatience. I am so fortunate to have such a strong, genuine, \nresourceful, mother to emulate throughout life.'' Well, we have been so \nfortunate to have Sylvia in the Senate family for the past 20-plus \nyears. The American people are so fortunate to have talented and \ndedicated public servants like Sylvia. I truly believe our Federal \nworkforce is the best in the world.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Sylvia Oliver for her \nexemplary service and wishing her well as she begins the next chapter \nin her life with the most important family of all, her own.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/01/senate-section/article/S7096-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ROBIN TRIPOD PATTEN\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN.

Robin serves as Director of Social \nServices at Arkansas Methodist Medial Center, AMMC, in Paragould, AR. \nOne of her many responsibilities in this position includes coordinating \nadoptions.\n  Being a bereaved parent herself, Robin offers a unique perspective to \nthe adoption process because she understands the pain of giving birth \nand leaving the hospital without a baby. She provides emotional support \nto both the birth mother and the adoptive parents and assists new and \nprospective parents in navigating complicated legal matters when \ncontemplating adoption.\n  Robin is a Licensed Master Social Worker, LMSW, and dedicates her \nlife to children. She is a mandated child abuse reporter who directs \ncare of infants whose birth mothers had illegal substances in her \nsystem during pregnancy. For 11 years, she has served on the Greene \nCounty multidisciplinary child abuse task force working to ensure no \nchild is overlooked or forgotten.\n  I am proud of Robin for her dedication to adoption services and for \ninvesting in the lives of families in northeast Arkansas and am glad to \nrecognize Robin as an Angel in Adoption for her efforts to connect \nchildren to permanent families. I commend her for her service and ask \nmy colleagues to join me in honoring her and the many other advocates \nwho continue to selflessly work to ensure that all children grow up in \nsafe, healthy, and loving homes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/01/senate-section/article/S7096-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7096-S7097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nOBSERVING THE 250TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE REPUDIATION OF THE BRITISH STAMP \n                                  ACT\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to honor the actions of ``12 \nimmortal justices'' of the Frederick County Court in Maryland who \nrefused to discharge the British Stamp Act on November 23, 1765. This \nfirst official act of defiance against the British Government's \n``taxation without representation'' in the Thirteen Original Colonies--\n8 years before the Boston Tea Party--helped set the stage for the \nAmerican Revolution that would lead to a free and independent United \nStates of America.\n  The Stamp Act the British Parliament passed in early 1765 exacted \nrevenue from the Colonies by imposing a stamp duty on newspapers and \nlegal and commercial documents. Colonists\n\n[[Page S7097]]\n\nin Maryland quickly realized that the Stamp Act and other new taxes \nwould severely impede trade in the Colonies and hinder their economic \ngrowth. Jonas Green, the publisher of the Maryland Gazette at the time, \nused his platform as the only news outlet in the colony to stir \nopposition to the actions of the British Parliament among Marylanders. \nAs protests turned to revolts, plans to distribute stamped paper were \ndelayed, which made stamped paper in Frederick County and Western \nMaryland unavailable. When the county's clerk of the court refused to \ncarry out the business of the court without stamped paper, Frederick \nCounty's 12 justices responded by holding him in contempt and \nunanimously passing the resolution that would come to be known as the \nRepudiation Act, allowing business to continue without the use of \nstamped paper and effectively nullifying the act of Parliament. The \ntext of the Repudiation Act stated: ``that all proceedings shall be \nvalid without the use of stamps . . . and ordering all sheriffs, \nclerks, counsellors, and officers of the Court to proceed with their \nseveral avocations as usual, without delay occasionded from the want of \nstamped paper, parchment or vellum.'' The justices took this action at \ngreat peril to their livelihood and even their lives.\n  Since 1894, Repudiation Day has been marked by the Maryland General \nAssembly as an official bank half-holiday in Frederick County and by \nthe Frederick Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution with \ncelebratory events. This year, which marks the 250th anniversary of \nthis courageous act of defiance by 12 Maryland justices, will be \nparticularly special with a parade, dedication of an interpretive \nplaque, educational presentations, and public display of the original \ncourt act. In addition, Frederick's Brewer's Alley has collaborated \nwith the Sergeant Lawrence Everhart Chapter of the Sons of the American \nRevolution on the release of the 250th Anniversary Commemorative \n``Twelve Immortals Ale'' inspired by the beers of the 18th Century.\n  I commend the Daughters of the American Revolution, the Sons of the \nAmerican Revolution, Brewer's Alley, the Tourism Council of Frederick \nCounty, the city of Frederick, and everyone else involved in the effort \nto honor the brave actions of these 12 Marylanders and encourage every \nAmerican to commemorate the 250th anniversary of an event that sparked \nthe first flames of liberty in the American Colonies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/01/senate-section/article/S7097-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SALLY ASCHIM\n\n Mr. DAINES.

Mr. President, with great pleasure and pride, \nI wish to recognize the 125th anniversary of Carnegie Hall in New York \nCity. At the ceremonial laying of the cornerstone of Carnegie Hall in \n1890, Andrew Carnegie declared: ``It is built to stand for ages, and \nduring these ages it is probable that this Hall will intertwine itself \nwith the history of our country.''\n  The Hall has intertwined itself with the history of the United States \nbut also with the history of the world. Today Carnegie Hall is the \nworld's most recognized performing arts center and is a global symbol \nof artistic excellence. For 125 years the Hall has defined and shaped \nthe future of music, and it continues in that leadership role today.\n  The Hall has hosted world leaders, American presidents, authors, \nactivists and intellectuals. The Hall's greatest influence, however, is \nthrough sound. Carnegie Hall's three performance centers project all \nforms of music to listeners around the world. Musicians from all \ncorners of the globe strive to perform at Carnegie Hall. The Hall is a \nbeacon inspiring and attracting the world's finest musicians in all \ngenres.\n  Less known but equally important, Carnegie Hall's Weill Music \nInstitute produces an extraordinary range of music education and \ncommunity programs that extend far outside the physical walls of its \nconcert halls. Its music education in New York City schools serves as a \nlaboratory of best practices for performing arts centers in major urban \nareas. Carnegie Hall provides and supports a partnership curriculum for \n81 orchestras throughout the United States and abroad to work with \nlocal school students in urban, suburban, and rural settings. Its \nhighly acclaimed National Youth Orchestra of the United States--\nrecently returned from a tour of China--helps build the next generation \nof musicians into lifelong community leaders and contributors. In the \n2015-2016 season these programs will reach millions people in New York \nCity, across the United States, and around the globe.\n  In the spirit of Andrew Carnegie and of bold endeavors to tackle \ncontemporary challenges, Carnegie Hall has recently initiated work to \neliminate the music education ``access gap'' in schools throughout our \nnation. Carnegie Hall's leadership, from volunteers, trustees, to staff \nat all levels, are committed to quality and to equity of opportunity \nregardless of circumstance.\n  Carnegie Hall's 125th opening night will occur on October 7th. I rise \nto commend the Hall's leadership, volunteers, contributors, performing \nartists, and staff. Carnegie Hall is a global icon symbolizing artistic \nexcellence, achievement, and the power of music to feed our souls and \nbring people together. Congratulations, Carnegie Hall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/01/senate-section/article/S7097-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7097-S7098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING ALICIA REBAN\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today, I wish to congratulate \nAlicia Reban on receiving the Ambassador of the Year award from the \nLand Trust Alliance. It gives me great pleasure to see her receive this \nnational award recognizing her years of hard work within the Nevada \ncommunity.\n  Throughout her 17 years working at the Nevada Land Trust Alliance, \nMs. Reban has been a shining example of someone who dedicated her \ncareer to the betterment of her community and Nevada's open spaces. In \n2000, she led a successful campaign on a ballot initiative focused on \nimproving Washoe County's parks, libraries, and trails. Additionally, \nin 2002, she served on the campaign executive committee for Nevada's \nState Question 1 for clean water, parks, and wildlife, the largest \nconservation bond measure in Nevada history.\n  Throughout her tenure, Ms. Reban has demonstrated professionalism, an \nunwavering commitment to conservation, and dedication to the highest \nstandards of the Nevada Land Trust Alliance. I have been fortunate \nduring my time in Congress to work with Ms. Reban on federal \nlegislation, the Conservation Easement Incentive Act, S. 330, which \nmakes the Federal enhanced conservation easement income tax deduction \npermanent. This important policy would provide Westerners with \nimportant tools to preserve our proud tradition of ranching, fishing, \nhunting, and other outdoor recreational activities. She has been a \ntireless advocate and an invaluable ally on this effort.\n  Alicia's advocacy on behalf of Nevada's vast natural resources and \nwildlife is unmatched, and I am thankful for all of the work that she \nhas done for our great State. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating Nevada Land Trust Co-Executive Director Alicia Reban on \nreceiving this award. I look forward to continuing to work with her on \nconservation issues important to our State.\n\n[[Page S7098]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/01/senate-section/article/S7098-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                     CONGRATULATING STEVE TETREAULT\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today, I wish to congratulate Steve \nTetreault on his incredible career, bringing Nevada in-depth political \nnews coverage from our Nation's Capital. It gives me great pleasure to \nrecognize Steve for his unwavering dedication to the people of Nevada \nand for showcasing journalistic integrity and excellence throughout his \ntenure. Though he will be greatly missed by Nevada journalism and the \nLas Vegas Review-Journal, his future with the United States Department \nof Energy will be of great service to our country.\n  Throughout my time serving Nevada in the United States Congress, \nSteve has been there to convey accurate and truthful news stories to \nthe people of Nevada. From covering my very first experiences in the \nUnited States House of Representatives to writing about the most recent \nevents in the United States Senate, Steve was there to capture both \nsides of the argument, bringing fair coverage from the entire Nevada \ndelegation. Our relationship operated with a great amount of respect \nand understanding, and I am grateful for his professionalism. However, \nhis jealousy of my impeccable beard-growing skills prompted him to also \ngrow one of his own.\n  Steve's insatiable appetite to cover important news stories and bring \nNevadans pertinent political information made him an incredible \njournalist. He was always one step ahead, ready to share breaking \npolitical news, and had a genuine interest in painting the most \naccurate story for his readers. He will always be remembered for his \ntop tier work at the Las Vegas Review-Journal.\n  The insight and knowledge he gained throughout his career could never \nbe replicated. He truly left his footprint in Nevada journalism, \nspecifically at the Las Vegas Review-Journal, where he served as the \nWashington bureau chief. His writing has given the Silver State a \ndetailed archive of Nevada's delegation throughout his years in \nWashington, a truly unique piece of our State's history.\n  Steve has demonstrated absolute dedication to excellent reporting, \nbringing pertinent political news stories outside of the walls of the \nUnited States Capitol to audiences across Nevada. I am both humbled and \nhonored by his hard work and am proud to call him a friend. Today, I \nask all of my colleagues to join me in congratulating Steve Tetreault \non his long and meaningful career at the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

A bill to reform sentencing laws and correctional \ninstitutions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                 SENTENCING REFORM AND CORRECTIONS ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce, along \nwith a broad bipartisan group of colleagues, a truly landmark piece of \nlegislation.\n  It is the result of months of hard work and thoughtful deliberations. \nIt is the largest criminal justice reform bill in a generation.\n  This bill represents a consensus among my colleagues and me.\n  There are elements of the criminal justice system that we agree can \nand should be improved. We all agree that statutory mandatory minimum \nsentences can serve an important role in protecting public safety and \nbringing justice to crime victims, and this bill will preserve the \nprimary mandatory minimums to keep some certainty and uniformity in \nFederal sentences and to encourage criminals to cooperate with law \nenforcement. We even add two new mandatory minimums for crimes \ninvolving interstate domestic violence and supplying weapons or other \ndefense materials to prohibited countries or terrorists, but our \ncurrent system has produced some specific instances of severe and \nexcessive sentences.\n  So we all agree that we need to lower some of the harshest enhanced \nmandatory minimums, and we all agree that we can do a better job of \ntargeting those enhanced mandatory sentences to the most serious \nviolent and repeat offenders.\n  This bill does just that. It even expands some of those enhanced \nmandatory minimums to criminals with prior violent felonies and State \ncrimes involving the unlawful use of firearms. That will be a big help \nin cities across the country who face rising homicide rates from \nviolent offenders who have been released from prison.\n  We also all agree that our current system could benefit from giving \njudges a bit more discretion in sentencing. That is why we are \nexpanding the current safety valve.\n  We also create a second safety valve so that nonviolent offenders who \nhave minor criminal histories or play low-level roles in drug \norganizations are not improperly swept up by mandatory minimums.\n  Finally, we all agree that we must improve our prisons and stop the \nrevolving door. Those of us introducing the bill have agreed to give \nlower-risk inmates a chance to return to society earlier and with \nbetter prospects to become productive, law-abiding citizens.\n  There are other parts of this bill that are also important, but I \nwill not go into them at this time. As I said, this is the biggest \ncriminal justice reform in a generation.\n  Instead, I wish to end with the idea that this bill is about the \nSenate. Senators from both sides of the aisle and Senators with very \ndifferent perspectives have come together to solve an important problem \nfacing the United States. This is how the U.S. Senate can work, should \nwork, and I am pleased to be a part of it and the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Finally, I extend my sincere thanks to my colleagues who joined me in \nthis effort: Senators Durbin, Cornyn, Whitehouse, Lee, Graham, Schumer, \nBooker, and Scott, and my friend Ranking Member Leahy.\n  I close by again thanking the ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Leahy, for the great help that he has been, not only \nas my friend, but also for his work on this piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 2125. A bill to make the Community Advantage Pilot Program of the \nSmall Business Administration permanent, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Small \nBusiness Lending and Inequality Reduction Act of 2015.\n  It is a simple bill with a straightforward goal: to increase economic \nactivity in underserved communities to help create jobs and reduce \neconomic inequality. We must help low and moderate income communities \ngrow by partnering with organizations that can channel expertise and \nresources to these communities. The bill I am introducing today would \nassist community development institutions provide more funding to small \nbusinesses.\n  This bill would increase their ability to lend in underserved \ncommunities and promote development and economic growth. The more \nlending they can offer to underserved communities, the more those \ncommunities can prosper.\n  One example of this process can be found from CDC Small Business \nFinance, an organization that has created more than 165,000 jobs and \nfunded more than 10,000 small businesses. In Anaheim, CA, for example, \nthey provided $178,000 in financing to help Gretchen Shoemaker and her \nfamily successfully launch a restaurant based on Gretchen's \ngrandmother's Southern-style cooking in an historic area of Anaheim.\n  Another example is Leatherby Family Creamery, an ice-cream parlor in \nSacramento that opened in 1982 with the goal of creating a family-\nfriendly community gathering place. They received a loan backed by the \nSmall Business Administration that allowed them to modernize and expand \ntheir business. Leatherby's now has three locations and has sustained \nitself for over 30 years despite bumps in the economy. It is truly \ndedicated to its communities as well, donating to over 180 \nassociations, schools, and organizations in 2015 alone.\n  Overall, it should be clear: these loans provided real dividends back \nto the communities.\n  With more access to financial services--which my bill would provide--\nthere will be more improvements to businesses, nonprofits, and our \ncommunities.\n  The bill I am introducing today would do two main things: First, it \nallows community development institutions to increase their lending by \nproviding them access to loans backed by the Small Business \nAdministration.\n  It would do this by authorizing and making permanent an existing \npilot program run by the Small Business Administration and raising the \nmaximum loan amount so that small businesses have access to additional \nfunding. There are currently over 95 approved\n\n[[Page S7105]]\n\nlenders in the pilot program, which has approved over $214 million in \nover 1,650 loans.\n  Small businesses eligible for loans under the program include small \nbusinesses located in areas of high poverty and unemployment; small \nbusinesses that have more than 50 percent of employees living in low- \nor moderate-income communities; and Small businesses owned by veterans.\n  Second, this bill would expand the ability of Community Development \nFinancial Institutions to access funding from the Federal Home Loan \nBank System, which in turn allows them to provide more loans to low-\nincome communities.\n  These are two simple actions that can have a significant impact on \nsmall businesses and communities in California and across the country.\n  I am proud to say that the Opportunity Finance Network, which is an \nassociation of community development financial institutions, supports \nthis bill.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation and am \nhopeful that this Congress will move it forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/01/senate-section/article/S7105-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 273--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n   NEED FOR RECONCILIATION IN INDONESIA AND DISCLOSURE BY THE UNITED \n STATES GOVERNMENT OF EVENTS SURROUNDING THE MASS KILLINGS DURING 1965 \n                                AND 1966\n\n  Mr. UDALL submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 273\n\n       Whereas, on October 1, 1965, 6 Indonesian Army generals \n     were killed by military personnel, including members of \n     Indonesia's Presidential Guard, and these killings were \n     blamed on the Indonesian Communist Party and labeled an \n     ``attempted Communist coup d'etat'';\n       Whereas this alleged coup was used to justify the mass \n     killing of alleged supporters of the Indonesian Communist \n     Party, with estimates of the number of dead ranging from \n     500,000 to 1,000,000 killed;\n       Whereas the targeted individuals were predominantly unarmed \n     civilians, and often included members of trade unions, \n     intellectuals, teachers, ethnic Chinese, and those involved \n     in the women's movement;\n       Whereas these killings and the imprisonment of up to \n     1,000,000 targeted individuals were done without due process \n     of law;\n       Whereas the targeted individuals were subject to \n     extrajudicial execution, torture, rape, forced disappearance, \n     forced labor, and forced eviction;\n       Whereas the United States Central Intelligence Agency, in a \n     1968 research study, described the period as one of the worst \n     mass murders of the twentieth century;\n       Whereas the United States Government provided the \n     Indonesian Army with financial, military, and intelligence \n     support during the period of the mass killings, and did so \n     aware that such killings were taking place as recorded in \n     partially declassified documents in the Department of State \n     history, ``Foreign Relations of the United States'', \n     pertaining to this period;\n       Whereas, within months of military leader Suharto's \n     assumption of the Presidency following the mass killing, the \n     United States Government began sending economic and military \n     support to Suharto's military regime, and played an \n     indispensable role in its consolidation of power;\n       Whereas aid to the Suharto government continued for more \n     than 3 decades, despite on-going crimes against humanity \n     committed by the Suharto government, including mass killing \n     and other gross violations of human rights during the \n     invasion and subsequent 24-year occupation of East Timor;\n       Whereas perpetrators of the 1965 and 1966 mass killings \n     have largely lived with impunity, and the survivors and \n     descendants of the victims suffer continuing economic \n     discrimination and had limited civil and political rights for \n     decades, as noted in the 2012 report by the Indonesian \n     National Commission on Human Rights;\n       Whereas the United States Government has not yet fully \n     declassified all relevant documents concerning this time \n     period, and full disclosure could help bring historical \n     clarity to atrocities committed in Indonesia during 1965 and \n     1966;\n       Whereas the United States Government has recently supported \n     the declassification and release of documents in support of \n     truth and reconciliation efforts following periods of \n     violence in countries such as Chile and Brazil;\n       Whereas open dialogue about alleged past crimes against \n     humanity and past human rights violations is important for \n     continued efforts to reconcile populations of Indonesia and \n     to ensure a stable, sustainable peace that will benefit the \n     region and beyond;\n       Whereas, Indonesia has undergone a remarkable democratic \n     transition over the last 2 decades, and is the world's third \n     largest democracy with the largest Muslim population in the \n     world;\n       Whereas through free and fair elections, the people of \n     Indonesia have elected new leaders who now have the \n     opportunity to establish a culture of accountability in \n     partnership with the country's vibrant civil society, press, \n     academia, and human rights activists;\n       Whereas the relationship between the United States and \n     Indonesia is strong and involves many shared interests, as \n     reflected in the 2010 United States-Indonesia Comprehensive \n     Partnership, including democracy and civil society, \n     education, security, climate and environment, energy, and \n     trade and investment;\n       Whereas the economic relationship between the United States \n     and Indonesia is strong, with bilateral goods trade exceeding \n     $27,000,000,000 and with major United States companies making \n     significant long-term investments in Indonesia;

and\n       (B) to work to mend differences and animosity that remain \n     after the mass killings during 1965 and 1966; and\n       (4) calls on the Department of State, the Department of \n     Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency, and others involved \n     in developing and implementing policy towards Indonesia \n     during this time period to establish an interagency working \n     group--\n       (A) to locate, identify, inventory, recommend for \n     declassification, and make available to the public all \n     classified records and documents concerning the mass killings \n     of 1965 and 1966, including records and documents pertaining \n     to covert operations in Indonesia from January 1, 1964, \n     through March 30, 1966;\n       (B) to coordinate with Federal agencies and take such \n     actions as necessary to expedite the release of such records \n     to the public;

Res. 274\n\n       Whereas more than 22,000,000 people of the United States \n     served in the Cold War by supporting the efforts to bring \n     military, economic, and diplomatic pressure to bear in the \n     defense of Germany and the West, and ultimately helping more \n     than 400,000,000 people gain freedom from the bondage of \n     communism in the Soviet Bloc;\n       Whereas the United States supported the promulgation of the \n     Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, under which \n     Germany was eventually reunited;\n       Whereas the United States created the Reconstruction Loan \n     Corporation, which, under West German leadership, became the \n     Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau that invested in the \n     reconstruction of West Germany and lay the economic \n     groundwork for the reunification of Germany;\n       Whereas on November 4, 1989, more than 1,000,000 people \n     gathered in Alexanderplatz in East Berlin and 40 other cities \n     and towns in East Germany to demand free elections and basic \n     civil rights, such as freedom of opinion, movement, press, \n     and assembly;\n       Whereas on November 9, 1989, East German politbureau member \n     Guenter Schabowski announced that the Government of East \n     Germany would allow ``every citizen of the German Democratic \n     Republic to leave the GDR through any of the border \n     crossings'' and East German leader Egon Krenz promised \n     ``free, general, democratic, and secret elections'';\n       Whereas thousands of people in East Berlin immediately \n     flooded the border checkpoints at the Berlin Wall and \n     demanded entry into West Berlin, causing the overwhelmed \n     border guards of East Germany to open the checkpoints to \n     allow people to cross into West Berlin;\n       Whereas in the days following the fall of the Berlin Wall \n     on November 9, 1989, hundreds of thousands of people from \n     East Germany freely crossed the border into West Berlin and \n     West Germany for the first time in more than 28 years;\n       Whereas German Chancellor Helmut Kohl demonstrated \n     leadership and vision when he\n\n[[Page S7106]]\n\n     announced a 10-point program calling for the 2 Germanys to \n     expand mutual cooperation with the view toward eventual \n     reunification on November 28, 1989;\n       Whereas in March 1990, East Germany held free elections for \n     the first time and those elections led to the defeat of the \n     Party of Democratic Socialism and demonstrated the desire of \n     the East German people to reunify Germany and rejoin the \n     world community, which led to the May 1990 treaty on \n     monetary, economic, and social issues and the signing of the \n     Unification Treaty on August 31, 1990;\n       Whereas on October 2, 1990, President George Herbert Walker \n     Bush told the German people: ``The United States is proud to \n     have built with you the foundations of freedom, proud to have \n     been a steady partner in the quest for 1 Germany, whole and \n     free. America is proud to count itself among the friends and \n     allies of free Germany, now and in the future.'';\n       Whereas on October 3, 2015, the people of Germany will \n     celebrate in Frankfurt and across Germany, the 25th \n     anniversary of the reunification of Germany; and\n       Whereas the reunification of Germany demonstrated the end \n     of the division of Europe and the triumph of democracy over \n     communism: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) with the people of the former communist countries and \n     Western Europe, celebrates 25 years of a united Germany, free \n     from the oppression of communism;\n       (2) honors the courage and sacrifice of the people of \n     Germany, the United States, and other countries who served in \n     the Cold War to bring freedom to Central and Eastern Europe;\n       (3) recognizes the importance of the alliance between the \n     United States and Germany in--\n       (A) common defense;\n       (B) an enduring shared commitment to the free and unified \n     Europe; and\n       (C) an expanding and deepening economic prosperity under \n     the rule of law throughout Europe;\n       (4) expresses to the people of Germany an appreciation for \n     the commitment of the people of Germany to the promotion of \n     freedom through leadership in providing international \n     assistance, support for peacekeeping and international \n     security efforts, and acceptance of refugees, including \n     efforts by the people of Germany in Afghanistan, Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina, Kosovo, Lebanon, Sudan, and Ukraine; and\n       (5) reaffirms the deep and historical friendship between \n     the Government and people of the United States and the \n     Government and people of Germany.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/01/senate-section/article/S7106-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 275--CALLING ON CONGRESS, SCHOOLS, AND STATE AND \n  LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO RECOGNIZE THE SIGNIFICANT EDUCATIONAL \nIMPLICATIONS OF DYSLEXIA THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED AND DESIGNATING OCTOBER \n             2015 AS ``NATIONAL DYSLEXIA AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Mr. CASSIDY (for himself and Ms. Mikulski) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Res. 276\n\n       Whereas the well-being of the United States requires that \n     the young people of the United States become an involved, \n     caring citizenry of good character;\n       Whereas the character education of children has become more \n     urgent, as violence by and against youth increasingly \n     threatens the physical and psychological well-being of the \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas, more than ever, children need strong and \n     constructive guidance from their families and their \n     communities, including schools, youth organizations, \n     religious institutions, and civic groups;\n       Whereas the character of a nation is only as strong as the \n     character of its individual citizens;\n       Whereas the public good is advanced when young people are \n     taught the importance of good character and the positive \n     effects that good character can have in personal \n     relationships, in school, and in the workplace;\n       Whereas scholars and educators agree that people do not \n     automatically develop good character and that, therefore, \n     conscientious efforts must be made by institutions and \n     individuals that influence youth to help young people develop \n     the essential traits and characteristics that comprise good \n     character;\n       Whereas, although character development is, first and \n     foremost, an obligation of families, the efforts of faith \n     communities, schools, and youth, civic, and human service \n     organizations also play an important role in fostering and \n     promoting good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages students, teachers, parents, \n     youth, and community leaders to recognize the importance of \n     character education in preparing young people to play a role \n     in determining the future of the United States;\n       Whereas effective character education is based on core \n     ethical values, which form the foundation of a democratic \n     society;\n       Whereas examples of character are trustworthiness, respect, \n     responsibility, fairness, caring, citizenship, and honesty;\n       Whereas elements of character transcend cultural, \n     religious, and socioeconomic differences;\n       Whereas the character and conduct of youth reflect the \n     character and conduct of society, and, therefore, every adult \n     has the responsibility to teach and model ethical values and \n     every social institution has the responsibility to promote \n     the development of good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages individuals and organizations, \n     especially those that have an interest in the education and \n     training of the young people of the United States, to adopt \n     the elements of character as intrinsic to the well-being of \n     individuals, communities, and society;\n       Whereas many schools in the United States recognize the \n     need, and have taken steps, to integrate the values of their \n     communities into teaching activities; and\n       Whereas the establishment of ``National Character Counts \n     Week'', during which individuals, families, schools, youth \n     organizations, religious institutions, civic groups, and \n     other organizations focus on character education, is of great \n     benefit to the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning October 18, 2015, as \n     ``National Character Counts Week''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States and \n     interested groups--\n       (A) to embrace the elements of character identified by \n     local schools and communities, such as trustworthiness, \n     respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship; \n     and\n       (B) to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, \n     programs, and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/01/senate-section/article/S7106-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7106-S7107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      committee on armed services\n\n  Mr. BLUNT.
