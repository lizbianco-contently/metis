Mr. President, President Obama regularly calls on \nRepublicans and Democrats to work together to advance the priorities of \nour Nation, and we certainly agree.\n  Our top priority is our national security, and Congress worked \ntogether on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis to pass the National \nDefense Authorization Act. So while Americans were surprised to learn \nthe President announced he would veto that bipartisan bill, they must \nbe shaking their heads in disbelief now that they have learned the \nPresident will not only veto the bill, he is going to brag about it--\nnot only going to veto the bill, but he is going to brag about it in a \nphoto op today down at the White House.\n  Remember what it is the President will veto today. This bipartisan \nbill will attack bureaucratic waste and authorize pay raises and \nimproved quality-of-life programs for our soldiers, sailors, airmen, \nand marines; it will strengthen sexual assault prevention and response; \nit will help wounded warriors and heroes who struggle with mental \nhealth challenges; and it will equip the men and women who serve with \nwhat they need to defend this Nation.\n  This is the worst possible time for an American President to veto a \nnational defense bill and especially to do so for arbitrary partisan \nreasons. Republicans and Democrats in Congress worked so hard to pass \nthis important legislation, legislation that authorizes the exact \namount--the exact amount--the Commander in Chief requested. So now we \nwill have to work together again, this time hopefully to override the \nPresident's veto.\n  The President should be highlighting his signature on this bipartisan \nlegislation that supports the men and women who defend our Nation. \nInstead, with our servicemembers facing threats and instability in \nseveral theaters, he will be bragging--bragging--about using his veto \npen. Our allies are seeking leadership and stability, not indecision. A \npartisan veto of this bipartisan bill is simply unacceptable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/senate-section/article/S7427-6", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CYBERSECURITY INFORMATION SHARING BILL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Americans know that cyber attacks are \nattacks on their privacy and their property. No one wants to think \nabout a stranger riffling through their medical records. No one wants \nto think about a criminal stealing their credit card information. That \nis why we have this bipartisan cyber security bill before us in the \nSenate.\n  This bipartisan legislation will help protect Americans' most private \nand personal information by sharing information between the private and \npublic sector on cyber threats. Experts say the tools in this bill can \nhelp prevent future attacks in both the public and private sectors. It \ncontains important measures to protect civil liberties and individual \nprivacy, and it has been carefully vetted and scrutinized by Senators \nof both parties. No wonder this bill passed through committee with \nnearly unanimous bipartisan support, 14 to 1.\n  The House already voted to protect the privacy of Americans by \npassing cyber legislation. With a little cooperation, the Senate can as \nwell. That is why I urge all Members to vote today to move forward on \nthis bipartisan bill, which will set up votes on amendments from both \nparties. With continuing cooperation, we can take an important step \ntoward protecting the privacy of our constituents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/senate-section/article/S7427-7", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7427-S7428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the day before yesterday I surprised some by \nsaying nice things about Congressman Paul Ryan, and they said nice \nthings about him. Since then, a handful of people have demanded to know \nwhy we would ever say nice things about a man who has attacked \nMedicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, as he has done in recent \nhistory. The answer is very simple. Democrats need, our country needs, \nresponsible Republican negotiating partners if Congress is to avoid \ntwin challenges facing us in the coming weeks: avoiding the first-ever \ndefault in the full faith and credit of the United States and \npreventing another government shutdown. We need someone to deal with. \nWe must avoid the self-inflicted wounds that have typified the rule of \nHouse Republicans and certainly Senate Republicans.\n  In spite of our ideological differences, in my view, Congressman Ryan \nis the only House Republican, whom I am aware of, with real potential \nto impose a basic modicum of order in the House of Representatives and \nwork with us to avoid default and another government shutdown. He has \nhelped in the past, and I am confident he could in the future if he \nchooses to.\n  To my allies, rest assured that I will continue to oppose Congressman \nRyan's plans to privatize Medicare and slash Social Security. I have \nsaid the Ryan budget would lead to a ``Kochtopia,'' and I believe that \nto be truer now than ever before.\n  Congressman Ryan also coauthored the Murray-Ryan budget compromise. \nThat was good work. House Chairman Ryan and Senate Chair Murray, Budget \nchairs, did a very good job. He appears to be supportive of \ncomprehensive immigration reform, and he joined Democrats in saying \nAmerica's auto industry and financial system should be saved.\n  Maybe the problems are too deep to resolve any time soon. I hope not. \nI am concerned that we have already seen Congressman Ryan prove \nincapable of reining in members of the so-called Freedom Caucus. I hope \nthat is not a sign of things to come, but with the stakes as high as \nthey are, we owe it to the American people to pursue the most \nresponsible path, and that will be it. Now is the time to rebuild a \nsystem where ``compromise'' is no longer considered a dirty word and \nwhere Republicans and Democrats work side-by-side to address the \nchallenges our government faces. However, one of the conditions \nCongressman Ryan has given House Republicans is that he doesn't want to \nwork weekends. Well, if he gets the job, I hope he will not take \nweekends off until we do something to solve the debt crisis and to fund \nthe government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/senate-section/article/S7428-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7428-S7430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLOCKING NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Congressional Republicans continue to govern \ndestructively during this 114th Congress. After nearly a year in \ncontrol of the Senate, what do Republicans have to show for it? \nShutdown threats, lapsed laws, vital programs expired, and an abiding \nsense of uncertainty. Instead of looking for opportunities to govern \nconstructively, Republicans appear to be bent on mayhem. They are doing \neverything they can to appeal to their extreme rightwing without regard \nto the consequences.\n  It seems that every day that is a bad day for government, we have a \nlarge segment of the Republican caucus cheering that it is great. \nAnything that is bad for government is a good day for us, is what they \nare saying. Instead of looking for opportunities to govern \nconstructively, they are doing everything they can to not do things \nconstructively. They are doing everything they can to appeal to, I \nguess, the extreme rightwing, to phrase it, without regard to the \nconsequences, but consequences are very significant.\n  This afternoon we are finally confirming Ambassadors for several \nAfrican nations, but to view the confirmation of four individuals a \nsuccess would be a mistake, when we consider that Senate Republicans \nare doing everything they can to stop these nominees.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, the junior Senator from Arkansas announced his \nintention to hold up our Ambassadors to Sweden, Norway, and the \nBahamas. At a time when American leadership is needed abroad, these \nposts sit empty because the junior Senator from Arkansas is blocking \nthem. Why is Senator Cotton blocking these nominees? He has admitted \nhis hold has nothing to do with the nominees' qualifications--nothing. \nIndeed, all were reported out of the Foreign Relations Committee with \nbipartisan support months ago. Instead, the junior Senator from \nArkansas is holding these nominees hostage until he gets information \nfrom the Department of Homeland Security. That is right. He is holding \nup State Department nominations to get a response from Homeland \nSecurity. Blocking important Ambassadors to get information from a \ncompletely different agency makes zero sense. That is akin to having \ntwo fighters in a ring and one fighter is going for the referee instead \nof the other boxer. That is about what we have here. The sad part about \nthis is that the junior Senator from Arkansas is not alone in blocking \nqualified nominees. The Republican caucus is obviously supporting him. \nWhy?\n  I have spoken before about the crucial need to confirm Gayle Smith as \nAmbassador to the U.S. Agency for International Development. She would \nbe a good Administrator. I talked to one of my staff yesterday who has \na relative who works for this Agency. It is terrible. There is nobody \nleading the Agency. It has affected the whole department. That is \nwrong.\n  Why is this nomination important? The Agency for International \nDevelopment, better known as USAID, plays a central role in our \nNation's foreign policy. How? By administering humanitarian and \ndevelopment aid to nations of people in need. A person only needs to \nwatch the nightly news to see that help is needed across the globe--the \npictures of the huddled masses of men, women, and children now with the \nweather turning in Europe. There are millions of people trying to get \nout of Syria, trying to get out of the Middle East because of what is \ngoing on there, with blankets--wet blankets--over their bodies. Little \nkids are being protected by their mothers, as much as they can be, and \nby their dads. Victims of civil wars, disease outbreaks, and natural \ndisasters depend on the aid and compassion of the American people. To \nour credit, we try our best to help as much as possible.\n  Let's take one example: the Syrian refugee crisis. It is the worst \nhumanitarian crisis since World War II. That says a lot. Millions--not \nthousands, millions--of Syrians have been displaced because of the \ncountry's civil war. Thousands are fleeing to Europe to escape the \nviolence. Because of that civil war, it is estimated that there are 4 \nmillion displaced people in Syria alone. Millions have been displaced \nin Iraq. The whole Middle East is in turmoil. The United States has an \nobligation to assist--a humanitarian obligation to assist. We are the \nsingle largest donor of humanitarian aid for the Syrian crisis. But how \ncan we help if Senate Republicans are hamstringing this Agency? They \nare doing that.\n  Gayle Smith, an experienced public servant, has been nominated to \nlead this Agency. This good woman can't even get a vote in the Senate. \nSenator Cruz has been blocking her nomination for months. Why? Is there \nanything that is wrong about her? Of course not. The word is it is \nbecause he doesn't like the Iran nuclear agreement. Remember what the \nIran nuclear agreement was? It was an effort by the international \ncommunity, including Russia and China, to stop Iran from getting a \nnuclear weapon. That is what it was all about. I guess Mr. Cruz, in his \nattempt to become President--1 of 15 Republicans running for \nPresident--thinks this would be a good issue for him, blocking the \nperson this government has chosen to lead this Agency.\n  Gayle Smith has extensive experience in African affairs. She worked \nat this Agency during the Clinton administration. She is exactly the \ntype of leader our country needs to confront this crisis in Europe. \nEven the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, the junior \nSenator from Tennessee, said he was ``glad the executive branch has \nnominated someone who has the kind of experience [Smith] has.'' Her \nnomination has won support from prominent Republicans, including Bill \nFrist who was one of my predecessors as the majority leader in the \nSenate, and from Richard Lugar, the distinguished Republican, former \nchair of the Foreign Relations Committee in\n\n[[Page S7429]]\n\nthe Senate, a man who has expertise in foreign relations. They both see \nher as the person to do the job. But that does not affect the junior \nSenator from Texas.\n  We know how others feel about him. Former President Bush gave his \nopinion of the junior Senator from Texas 2 days ago. There is \nwidespread support for her nomination--if only the Republican leader \nwould bring it to the floor. Yet Republicans continue to hold Ms. Smith \nand other important foreign policy nominations as ransom to exact \npolitical prices from the White House while our diplomacy suffers.\n  I am disappointed that the junior Senators from Arkansas and Texas \nwould hold up these proud Americans who only want to serve their \ncountry. But I am far more disheartened by the actions of Republicans \nwho should know better. Why do other Republicans support these callous \nactions? Republicans have blocked nominees to other ambassadorships for \nyears. Now they are even blocking career Foreign Service officers. \nThese are people who simply receive a promotion they have earned and \nserve our Nation regardless of the President. Foreign Service officers \nare not Democrats. They are not Republicans. They do our country so \nmuch good.\n  I have had the good fortune to travel the world. When I travel I \nalways meet with the Foreign Service officers, not just the \nAmbassadors. I get everybody together. I tell them what a wonderful job \nthey do for our country. They go to the most remote outposts in the \nworld, representing the interests of America. They are career people. I \nalso try to visit with the Peace Corps volunteers.\n  But I am so disappointed--and I have talked to him--in the senior \nSenator from Iowa for holding up a list of 20 career Foreign Service \nofficers. He has held them up for months until he gets answers from \nSecretary Hillary Clinton's aide Huma Abedin. What does this have to do \nwith these Foreign Service career officers? Nothing. He sent nine \nletters to the State Department demanding things regarding this woman \nand some emails from Hillary Clinton. Haven't we heard enough about \nemails for Hillary Clinton?\n  As we talk, she is over there before this great committee of the \nHouse that even the majority leader of the House said is nothing more \nthan--I am paraphrasing--a political witch hunt. The Republican \nCongressman from New York said basically the same thing. A person who \nworks over there in that committee was fired because he thought it was \nwrong that they were going after Hillary Clinton when the purpose of \nthe whole hearing was supposed to be to find out what happened in \nLibya.\n  There has been a concerted effort for more than 2 years to try to \nembarrass Hillary Clinton. Huge amounts of money have been spent on \noutside groups, and the House of Representatives, which is supposedly \nso frugal--the Republican House of Representatives--doesn't want to \nspend any money that shouldn't be spent--$5 million on this worthless \ncommittee wasting time.\n  Listen to these people who are being held up, being denied a well-\ndeserved promotion and rank by the senior Senator from Iowa. This is \nimportant. These people serve for decades. They work hard, and they get \na promotion once in a while--not with the help of the senior Senator \nfrom Iowa. He will hold them up because he wants to try to embarrass \nHillary Clinton, who is running for President of the United States. \nHere is who he is holding up: the Deputy Director for East Africa \nOperations in Kenya, an education officer in Honduras, a deputy \ncontroller in El Salvador, a regional Food for Peace officer in \nEthiopia, the Director of the Food for Peace Program in South Sudan, \nthe Democracy and Governance Director in El Salvador. There are others.\n  What could the senior Senator from Iowa possibly have against the \nDeputy Director for East Africa Operations in Kenya? Or an education \nofficer in Honduras? Or the regional Food for Peace officer in \nEthiopia? They have absolutely nothing to do with Senator Grassley's \nconcerns, and these individuals have no ability to respond to any of \nhis requests. I have spoken with him. I told him I think it is a \nmistake to target these career people. Career diplomats are some of the \nfinest people who work for our government. They are not partisans. They \nhave committed their lives to public service under Democratic and \nRepublican administrations. The Foreign Relations Committee reported \nthese nominations unanimously. They hail from Texas, Florida, Michigan, \nArizona, Virginia, New Mexico, and a few other States. Like other \nForeign Service officers across this great world, these fine \nindividuals wake up tomorrow ready to serve on the frontlines of \nAmerican diplomacy in hotspots throughout the world--places such as \nIraq, Afghanistan, and Libya, where we lost four.\n  Denying them a promotion they have earned will affect their career \nadvancement and retirement, and it has real consequences for the \nfamilies. This is not anything that is going to hurt President Obama. \nIt affects our country. These are people who have families. They have \nchildren. They are being held up, stopped for this little promotion \nthey get once in a while. We shouldn't be singling out these \nnonpartisan officers and putting their careers on hold because the \nsenior Senator from Iowa is not getting the answer to nine of his \nletters that have nothing to do with these people.\n  Promotions for military officers and our Foreign Service Officer \nCorps have traditionally moved through the Senate without political \ninterference. They shouldn't now be subjected to political gamesmanship \nbecause people are concerned that Hillary Clinton may be elected \nPresident. Senators Grassley and Cotton have also placed holds on a man \nnamed Brian Egan to serve as the State Department's Legal Adviser, a \nlawyer--a position that has been vacant for 2\\1/2\\ years. The senior \nSenator from Iowa stated that his hold is not intended to question the \ncredentials of Brian Egan in any way, but is instead related to Clinton \naide Huma Abedin. That says it all.\n  He continues to hound the State Department. He sent nine different \nletters, including requesting Ms. Abedin's sensitive private employment \ninformation. Not only does Senator Grassley want emails and timesheets, \nbut he wants access to any and all information related to her maternity \nleave. She had a baby. I wonder if he thinks she faked that. This is \nnothing more than a transparent attempt to drag this good woman through \nthe mud. For what? Let's be clear. This isn't about her. This is about \nHillary Clinton's Presidential campaign. Congressional Republicans are \ndesperate to find something--anything--to embarrass this good woman--a \nwoman who served as First Lady of this country, served as a Senator \nfrom the State of New York, and served with distinction as our \nSecretary of State. They will do anything they can to embarrass her.\n  They are in the process of doing it across the Capitol Complex now. \nThey have told her to be ready: We have 8 hours of questioning. \nRemember, their questions are dealing with issues that have nothing to \ndo with what happened in Libya.\n  This is their frantic attempt to damage her politically. I say to my \nfriend from Iowa: Stop this nonsense. Have some dignity. Stop this \nobstruction for politics' sake. For whatever sake, it is wrong. She is \nno longer Secretary of State. She hasn't been for a long time. John \nKerry is. Secretary Kerry has been there a long time now. Stop trying \nto undermine the State Department, and instead give it the resources \nand people it needs to work for the American people.\n  I suggest to my Republican colleagues, if they seek expedited \nresponses to their inquiries, it would make more sense to confirm the \nLegal Adviser, who can advise on these issues and respond to their \nquestions--they don't have a lawyer down there--rather than to block \nthese nominations so that he can't assist anyone.\n  Senate Republicans are holding Ambassadors captive over an issue that \nhas absolutely nothing to do with the State Department. They are \nholding up career Foreign Service officers. The Senate Republicans are \nblocking promotions for a group of career people over an issue that has \nnothing to do with them, that they possibly can't resolve. They can't \ndo anything about it. They are blocking the person who would be running \nour Agency for International Aid because they don't like the Iran \nagreement--an issue that the nominee does not handle.\n\n[[Page S7430]]\n\n  Finally, Senate Republicans are blocking the nomination of the Legal \nAdviser of the State Department, the person who would be best able to \nanswer their legal questions if he were confirmed. Thanks to the \nRepublicans' failure to govern--now I am not making this up. It has \nbeen determined by political scientists in our country that this \nCongress is the most unproductive Congress in the history of the \ncountry. Thanks to the Republicans' failure to govern, we are still far \nbehind recent historic norms in confirming nominees, and innocent \npublic servants are caught in the middle of this do-nothing Congress \nled by the Republicans. It is not right, and it is not fair. I hope \nadult voices in the Republican caucus will say enough is enough. \nSometimes enough is enough. People have to rise up against these people \nwho are giving Republicans such a name. The brand is not so good. I \nhope the Presiding Officer understands that. Partisanship should not \nextend beyond the borders of our Nation.

Under the previous order, the time until 11 \na.m. will be equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2548, as Modified\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, after my years of growing up in Nevada, I \nappreciate the values that make Nevadans distinct, fiercely \nindependent, and very diverse--in fact, as diverse as the terrain is in \nNevada. But what never ceases to amaze me about Nevadans is our passion \nfor protecting America's privacy from the intrusion of the Federal \nGovernment. It is a value that is shared across the entire State and \none that I have sworn to uphold. But many Americans have lost faith \nthat their government will uphold their civil liberties.\n  It is Congress's responsibility to ensure that every piece of \nlegislation passed by this body protects the privacy and liberties of \nall Americans, and I will not accept attempts to diminish these \nnonnegotiable rights. That is why I am on the floor today to continue \nprotecting Americans' and Nevadans' privacy by pushing for my amendment \non the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act.\n  To begin with, I wish to commend my colleagues, both Chairman Burr \nand Ranking Member Feinstein, for recognizing the need to address the \nserious issue of cyber security. As ranking member of the commerce \ncommittee's consumer protection subcommittee in the last Congress, I \ndelved into these issues and understand the impact of data breaches and \ncyber threats. It is an economic concern as well as a national security \nconcern for our country.\n  I share the desire to find a path forward on information sharing \nbetween the Federal Government and the private sector as another tool \nin the cyber security toolbox, but these efforts cannot come at the \nexpense of personal privacy. The bill, including the substitute \namendment that I see today, does not do enough to ensure that personal, \nidentifiable information is stripped out before being shared, and that \nis why I have offered this simple fix.\n  Let's strengthen the standard for stripping out this information. \nRight now, this legislation says that the Federal Government only has \nto strip out personal information if they know it is not directly \nrelated to cyber threat--that word being ``know.'' My amendment No. \n2548, as modified, will ensure that when personal information is being \nstripped out, it is because the entity reasonably believes it is not \nrelated to cyber threat. That is the change--from knowing to reasonably \nbelieving. This distinction creates a wider protection for personal \ninformation by ensuring that these entities are making an effort to \ntake out personal information that is not necessary.\n  Frankly, I am proud of the support I have from Senators Leahy and \nWyden, both great advocates in the Senate for privacy. However, I am \ndisappointed that my amendment was not included in the substitute \namendment that we see today.\n  The supporters of this bill talk about how this legislation upholds \nprivacy but couldn't accept a reasonable amendment that complements \nthose privacy provisions.\n  Our friends over in the House of Representatives already agree that \nthe private sector should be held to this standard, which is why they \nincluded this language in the cyber security bill they passed. I guess \nthe question is, If this is good enough for the private sector, \nshouldn't it be good enough for the government sector?\n  Furthermore, DHS has publicly acknowledged the importance of removing \npersonal, identifiable information because it will allow an information \nsharing regime to function more efficiently.\n  What this has come down to is our Nation's commitment to balancing \nthe needs for sharing cyber security information with the needs to \nprotect Americans' personal information. Like many in the tech \ncommunity have already stated, security should not come at the expense \nof privacy. In fact, that was said a couple hundred years ago by \nBenjamin Franklin. Security should not come at the expense of privacy. \nI believe my amendment No. 2548 to hold the Federal Government \naccountable strikes that balance, and I hope this simple fix can be \nincorporated into the legislation.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this commonsense effort to \nstrengthen this bill and keep our commitment to upholding the rights of \nall U.S. citizens.\n  I appreciate Senators Burr and Feinstein's willingness to work with \nme on this amendment and look forward to continuing this debate.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n[[Page S7431]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada and say to \nhim generally that we tried to put everything in the managers' \namendment that we could, and the threshold was that we had to have \ntotal agreement. I know my colleague understands that it is difficult, \nbut we have done everything we can to protect the rights of every \nindividual Member to bring an amendment to the floor, to debate the \namendment, and to have an up-or-down vote--even for the ones that were \nnot germane. It is unfortunate that one amendment on both sides will be \nkicked out because they have to happen before the cloture vote, and \nthat was not allowed to take place.\n\n\n                Measure Placed on the Calendar--S. 2193\n\n  Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at the desk that is \ndue for its second reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title for \nthe second time.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2193) to amend the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act to increase penalties for individuals who illegally \n     reenter the United States after being removed and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, in order to place the bill on the calendar \nunder the provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The bill will be placed on the calendar.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, in just shy of 25 minutes, the Senate will \nhave a procedural vote on the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of \n2015. The committee worked diligently for most of this year in a \nbipartisan way to achieve a balance of great policy and reported that \nbill out on a 14-to-1 vote.\n  I say to my colleagues: We have reached a very delicate balance. \nThere have been bending and twisting and giving and taking, and we have \ndone it not only within the Senate of the United States and within the \ncommittee, we have done it with stakeholders all around the country.\n  I will remind my colleagues that this bill we are attempting to get \nthrough the Senate is a voluntary information sharing bill, and the \nmere fact that it is voluntary means we have to have in place certain \nincentives that provide a reason for companies to participate.\n  I commend Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Carper. Their committee \nand staff have worked with us side by side to try to incorporate their \nthoughts and the thoughts of all the agencies and also worked with \nstakeholders around the country.\n  I am pleased to tell my colleagues today that we received this \nmorning a notice from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and it says: ``The \nChamber urges the United States Senate to pass CISA expeditiously. \nThere is overwhelming support.''\n  When the vice chair and I ventured into this, we also made a \ncommitment to lock arms because we thought we found the right balance. \nAlthough it may be enticing for Members to support amendments that \nmight come up, there is a reason we didn't incorporate them in the \nmanagers' amendment. It may have been due to the differences the vice \nchair and I had or maybe it was because it would have killed the \nsupport we had with the stakeholders around the country. We will have \none of those amendments today, and it is going to be inviting for \npeople to do it, but let me say to my colleagues, if do you it, \ninformation sharing is over with, and the effort is dead. It has been \ntried for 3 years, yet we continue to see attacks happen, and massive \namounts of personal data go out of the system to be used for criminal \nor espionage reasons.\n  This is really our last chance. The vice chairman and I have reached \nwhat we think is the absolute balance that provides the buy-in of those \nwho will be asked to voluntarily turn over this data and to help \nminimize the loss of data in our entire economy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the cloture motion that will happen \nat 11 a.m. We will have a short debate, and then we will take up an \namendment, and the vice chair and I at that time will ask our \ncolleagues not to support that amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to waive the mandatory quorum \ncalls with respect to the cloture motions on amendment No. 2716 and S. \n754.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing Senators on the Democratic side be permitted to speak for 5 \nminutes each on our time: Feinstein 5 minutes, Wyden 5 minutes, and \nCarper 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, after many years of effort, the Senate \nis about to take its first vote to move forward on important cyber \nsecurity legislation. As I stated in my remarks yesterday, this \nsubstitute makes 20 changes to the underlying bill. It includes 14 \namendments offered by other Senators to improve privacy protections and \nensure better cyber security for emergency services, the health care \nindustry, and the Federal Government. As the chairman just said, we \nhave been listening and we have tried to incorporate a substantial \nnumber of amendments in the managers' package.\n  This is a good bill. It is a first step. It is not going to prevent \nall cyber attacks or penetrations, but it will allow companies and the \ngovernment to share information about the cyber threats they see and \nthe defensive measures to implement in order to protect their networks.\n  Right now--and this is important--the same cyber intrusions are used \nagain and again to penetrate different targets. That shouldn't happen. \nIf someone sees a particular virus or harmful signature, they should be \nable to tell others so they can protect themselves. That is what this \nbill does--it clears away the uncertainty and concern that keep \ncompanies from sharing this information. It says that two competitors \nin a market can share information on cyber threats with each other \nwithout facing antitrust lawsuits. It says that companies sharing cyber \nthreat information with the government for cyber security purposes have \nliability protection.\n  The bill is completely voluntary. I don't know how to say that over \nand over more times than I have. If you don't want to participate, \ndon't. If a company wants to take the position that it can defend \nitself and doesn't want to participate in real-time sharing with the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, that is its right.\n  I thank my colleagues who came to the floor in support of this bill \nand this managers' amendment yesterday: Senators McConnell, Reid, \nGrassley, Nelson, McCain, King, Thune, Flake, Senator Carper in \nparticular, Senator Blunt, and others. They have all described the need \nfor this bill, and I so appreciate their support.\n  I urge my colleagues to support cloture on this substitute managers' \npackage so that we can start moving on to other amendments that are \npending.\n  I also thank Senator Burr and his staff. Over the past couple of \ndays, they have been going through comments, proposing technical \nchanges, and perfecting changes to the substitute. It is my \nunderstanding that Chairman Burr will ask a unanimous consent agreement \non that perfecting amendment shortly.\n  I also thank Senator Collins for agreeing to changes in her \nprovision, section 407, to start to address concerns that were raised \nby its inclusion.\n  I also want to thank Senators Whitehouse, Leahy, and Wyden for \nreaching an agreement on text that Senator Whitehouse very much wanted \nto include, and I am pleased we were able to include it in this \nunanimous consent package.\n  So I appreciate the support of my colleagues. I urge a strong ``yes'' \nvote on the cloture vote to allow us to proceed to this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak against cloture on the \nsubstitute. This substitute would not have stopped the Target hack, the \nAnthem hack, the Home Depot hack, or the OPM hack. When it comes to \nreal privacy protection for millions of Americans with this substitute, \nthere is simply no ``there'' there.\n  We see that by looking at page 17 of the substitute. Companies have \nto remove only personal, unrelated information if they know that it is \npersonal\n\n[[Page S7432]]\n\nand unrelated. How would they know under this amendment? Under this \namendment, they are required to virtually do no looking. It is the most \ncursory review. That is why the Nation's leading technology companies \nhave come out overwhelmingly against this legislation. They are not \nsatisfied by this substitute.\n  The sponsors of the bill have been pretty vociferous about attacking \nthese companies for coming out against the legislation. These companies \nknow a lot about the importance of protecting both cyber security and \nindividual privacy. These tech companies that are being attacked now \nhave to manage that challenge every single day. The challenge gets \nharder all the time with things such as the EU ruling that I opposed. \nThese companies know that customer confidence is their lifeblood, and \nthe only way to ensure customer confidence is to convince people that \nif they use their product, their information is going to be protected \nboth from malicious hackers and from unnecessary collection by the \ngovernment.\n  The fact is, we have a serious problem with hacking and cyber \nsecurity threats. The fact is, information sharing can be good, but a \ncyber security information sharing bill without real and robust privacy \nprotections that this amendment lacks--I would submit millions of \nAmericans are going to look at that, and they are going to say this \nisn't a cyber security bill, this is yet another surveillance bill.\n  With this amendment, colleagues, the Senate is again missing another \nopportunity to do this right and promote both security and liberty. \nJust because a proposal has the words ``cyber security'' in its title \ndoesn't make it good. But that is, of course, why the leading \ntechnology companies in this country--companies that make a living \nevery single day by being sensitive to cyber threats and privacy--have \ncome out overwhelmingly against this bill.\n  I know my colleagues have tried to improve this issue, and I \nappreciate that. But the core privacy protections that America deserves \nin a bill like this are still lacking, and that is why I oppose \ncloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I wish to respond very briefly to what our \ncolleague from Oregon has said.\n  Senator Feinstein shared with me a copy of the actual text of the \nmanagers' amendment. I would maybe make two points. One, if a private \ncompany elects to share information--they don't have to, but if they \nelect to share information, as Senator Feinstein has said, it is their \ncall. But if they do, there is a requirement under the law that they \nscrub it. The reporting entity which is submitting the indicator--in \nthis case to DHS, the Federal entity--has to scrub it. They have the \nresponsibility, whoever is initiating this, to scrub and remove that \npersonally identifiable information. If for some reason they don't, the \nway the legislation comes before us today, in order for a company that \nchooses to submit threat indicators to the Federal Government, in order \nto get help on the liability protection they are looking for, they have \nto submit it through the Department of Homeland Security, through the \nportal of the Department of Homeland Security, which is literally set \nup to do privacy scrubs. It is literally set up to do privacy scrubs, \nand then to share information it wants with other relevant Federal \nagencies. Very, very infrequently--very infrequently--will there be \nsome reason to--the threat indicators coming through the portal at DHS, \nmaybe less than 1 percent of the time, there might be a need to take a \ncloser look at that information and make sure there is nothing that is \npersonally identifiable or problematic. I think with the compromise \nthat has been worked out, the issue that our colleague has raised has \nbeen addressed.\n  Let me just go back in time. Why is this important? We know the \nsituation is grim. When the Secretary of Defense has his emails hacked \nby an entity, and we know not who, when we have 22 million personal \nrecords and background checks hacked by maybe the Chinese or maybe \nsomebody else, that is not good. When companies such as DuPont in my \nown State and universities all over the country are having their R \ninformation--their intellectual seed corn upon which our economy is \ngoing to grow--stolen, and presumably stolen for bad reasons, so that \nthey can beat us to the bunch in terms of economic opportunity, that is \nnot good.\n  What are we going to do about it? It turns out we did quite a bit \nabout it in the last Congress. Two Congresses ago, Senator Feinstein \nproposed comprehensive cyber security legislation, the whole kit and \ncaboodle. We tried very hard, as she knows, for a year or two to get \nthat enacted. We couldn't get it done. Finally, we gave up at the end \nof I think the 112th Congress. We gave it up, and we started again in \n2013.\n  Tom Coburn was the ranking member on Homeland Security. I was \nprivileged to be chairman. He and I partnered with people on our \ncommittee and, frankly, with a lot of folks outside of the committee, \nto do three things: To strengthen the capability of the Department of \nHomeland Security to do its job, a much better job of protecting not \njust the Federal Government but the country as a whole against cyber \nattacks. We passed three pieces of legislation. They are helpful; they \nare not the whole package, but they are three very helpful bills to \nmake DHS a better, more effective partner.\n  This year, the Intel Committee, under the leadership of Senator Burr \nand Senator Feinstein, came forward with their proposal. The \nadministration, the President, came forward with an information sharing \nproposal as well. We took it up in a hearing in the committee on \nhomeland security, looking at the President's proposal, trying to \nfigure out what we should retain and what we should change to make it \nbetter, and we did. We changed it and we made it better. I introduced \nit as a standalone bill. The Intel Committee reported out their \nlegislation 14 to 1.\n  We have been working with Senator Burr and Senator Feinstein and \ntheir staffs ever since to try to infuse the elements of the \nPresident's proposal, modified by us on homeland security, to make a \nmore perfect--not a more perfect union, but a more perfect bill. Is it \nperfect? No. Is it better? Sure, it is better. I think it is going to \nenable us to do a much better job protecting that which needs to be \nprotected.\n  The last thing I will say is this: On this floor I have said more \nthan a few times I love to ask people that have been married a long \ntime, what is the secret to a long marriage? The best answer I have \never received is the two C's--communicate and compromise. I would add a \nthird C, which is also important for a vibrant democracy. The third C \nis collaborate.\n  This legislation is a great example of communicating, talking with \nown another, with stakeholders on Capitol Hill, off Capitol Hill, \nacross the country and around the world, but at the end of the day to \nfigure out how to compromise and to do so by collaborating.\n  I think we have come up with a very good piece of legislation. At the \nend of the day, if an entity or business wants to share information--I \nhope they would, we need them to do that. If they want to share \ninformation with the Federal Government, the idea is to get liability \nprotection and share it through the portal of the Department of \nHomeland Security; that information is scrubbed--cyber security \nscrubbed, piracy scrubbed. Share with other Federal agencies as \nappropriate after it has been dutifully scrubbed, and then we are in a \nbetter position to defend against those attacks in the future.\n\n  I think when people send us to work on big problems--and this is a \nbig problem for our country--they want us to work together. They want \nus to get stuff done. We have been talking about this for 3 or 4 years, \nand now we have an opportunity to get something done. Let's pass this \nand accept this managers' amendment, and then let's take up some other \namendments, and pass this bill and send it to the House. When they have \ndone their work, let's go to conference.\n  Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to support the Cybersecurity \nInformation Sharing Act, long overdue and vital legislation designed to \nreduce our Nation's vulnerability to cyber attacks.\n  I want to commend the ranking member of my committee, Senator\n\n[[Page S7433]]\n\nTom Carper, and Senator Burr and Senator Feinstein, for their \ncollaborative effort. This is an example of when we actually seek to \nfind the areas of agreement that unify us versus exploit our divisions, \nthen we can actually accomplish some pretty good things. This bill is \none of those examples.\n  The cyber threat we face today is real and it is growing. \nSophisticated nation-state adversaries such as China and North Korea \nare constantly probing American companies' and Federal agencies' \ncomputer networks to steal valuable and sensitive data. International \ncriminal organizations are exploiting our networks to commit financial \nfraud and health fraud. Cyber crime is so pervasive that the former \nDirector of the National Security Agency described it as the ``greatest \ntransfer of wealth in human history.'' Cyber terrorists are trying to \nattack cyber-connected critical infrastructure, thereby threatening our \nvery way of life.\n  We have already experienced the impact of this threat. Within the \nlast year and a half alone, more than 20 top American companies and \nFederal agencies have experienced major breaches. A breach of the \nOffice of Personnel Management allowed a foreign adversary to steal \n19.7 million Federal employees' background checks, over 5 million \nfingerprint files, and 4 million personnel records. A breach at IRS \nallowed cyber criminals abroad to access over 330,000 taxpayer \nfinancial records. A destructive cyber attack from North Korea on Sony \nPictures resulted in the destruction of thousands of computers and \ntheft of the company's most valuable intellectual property. Data \nbreaches at both Anthem and JP Morgan resulted in the theft of 80 \nmillion health care subscribers' personal data and 83 million banking \ncustomers' personal information. Even the White House is not immune \nfrom attack. Six months ago, foreign adversaries breached White House \nnetworks, compromising the President's nonpublic schedule.\n  Federal agencies are neglecting to protect Americans' data and \nFederal law is preventing companies from defending their networks. \nCongressional oversight, including hearings held by my committee, the \nSenate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, has \nshown agencies are not doing enough to protect their sensitive data. \nOur committee's oversight hearings of the IRS and OPM data breaches \nrevealed that basic cyber security hygiene and best practices would \nhave stopped attackers in their tracks had they been in place at these \nagencies. The Department of Homeland Security has not yet fully \nimplemented the cyber security programs we need to protect Federal \nagencies' networks.\n  Meanwhile, current law hinders private companies from sharing \nindicators that can be used to detect and stop attacks against their \nnetworks. To be effective, cyber threat indicators must be shared very \nquickly. The 2015 Verizon data breach investigation report revealed \nthat 75 percent of attacks spread within 24 hours, and 40 percent \nspread within just 1 hour. Yet our current network of anti-trust and \nwiretap loss hampers companies from sharing that information quickly, \ncreating a threat of lawsuit and prosecution for sharing that the \ninformation companies can use to identify and stop attacks.\n  There is no easy solution, but there are things Congress can do to \nimprove cyber security that might make cyber attacks more difficult. \nThat is why I am proud to have worked with Senator Burr and Senator \nFeinstein to create the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, which \ntakes a significant first step in addressing both of these issues.\n  First, it enables information sharing to improve cyber security \nwithin private companies.\n  Second, it improves cyber security at Federal agencies.\n  I especially appreciate the collaboration of Senator Carper in \nworking with me to help craft title II of the bill--the Federal \nCybersecurity Enhancement Act--which was unanimously reported out of \nour committee. This bill will put Federal agencies on track to \nimplement commonsense cyber security solutions already in use in many \ncompanies, thereby improving the security of Americans' data at the \nFederal agencies.\n  The Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act will achieve four key \ngoals.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. First, it will mandate deployment and implementation of \na government-wide intrusion detection and prevention system for Federal \nnetworks.\n  Second, it will require OMB to develop an intrusion assessment plan \nso government agencies can hunt down and eradicate attackers already in \ntheir networks.\n  Third, it requires agencies to implement specific cyber security \npractices, such as multifactor authentication and encryption of \nsensitive data, which would have stopped previous attacks.\n  Fourth, and finally, it will give the Secretary of Homeland Security \nand the Director of the Office of Management and Budget the authority \nthey need to oversee cyber security across the Federal Government.\n  In short, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, with the \ninclusion of the Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act, will \nsignificantly improve our cyber security posture. This bill will not \nsolve all of our cyber security woes, but it is an important step in \nthe right direction, and I am glad to support it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional \nminutes before we move to the cloture vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I believe I have a couple of minutes \nleft after the chairman speaks that I would like to use.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I am happy \nto extend the debate for a couple of minutes for each side, but I think \nit does need, in the interest of fairness for the proponents and \nopponents, to have equal time for the purposes of wrapping up, if my \ncolleagues want to go further.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, let me modify my request. I ask unanimous \nconsent for 2 additional minutes on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, just so the record is clear, I was \ntold I did not utilize my entire 5 minutes, and I want to make a very \nbrief closing statement on my 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BURR. May I modify my request further? My unanimous consent would \ngrant me 2 additional minutes and would grant the vice chair 2 minutes \n45 seconds.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I don't want to prolong this. Reserving the \nright to object--do I have any additional time? I wasn't sure I had \nused my full 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon has 45 seconds \nremaining in his time from before.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that each side be \ngiven 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am about to object. Let's get going here.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I withdraw my request for my 5 minutes, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from North Carolina for 2 additional minutes for each side?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for allowing me the \ntime.\n  Very quickly, it was said that this bill will not prevent and would \nnot have prevented the attacks that took place at American companies. \nIt is, in fact, right. The vice chair and I have never portrayed that \nthis was a prevention bill. We said it is not a prevention bill. It is \na bill designed to share information to minimize the loss of data.\n  As it relates to personal data, my colleague from Oregon forgets that \nthe managers' amendment strengthens by making sure on the government \nside that they only draw in the fields that\n\n[[Page S7434]]\n\nthe entire government collaborative group agrees need to be used for \nforensic purposes over and above what Senator Carper pointed out are \nthe responsibilities of the private sector companies.\n  It was said that the vice chair and I have been critical of \ntechnology companies that oppose this bill. I don't think we have been \ncritical. We have been confused--confused that the companies that hold \nthe most personal data on the American people in the country want to \ndeprive every other business in America from having the ability to \nshare their information when they are hacked. So I am not critical. I \nam challenged to figure out why they would take that position, but I \nhave come to the conclusion that there are some questions in life that \nhave no answers, and I have now reached one of those.\n  Given that we are at the end of this debate, let me once again thank \nChairman Johnson and Ranking Member Carper for the unbelievable \ncontribution that both of them individually made in their committee, \nand on behalf of the vice chair and myself, I would urge our colleagues \nto support cloture and allow this process to move forward so we could \nconference with the House.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  I just want to urge people to vote yes on cloture. We have been at \nthis for 6 years. This is the third bill. We have been bipartisan. The \nbill is considered. This is a complicated and difficult arena. The bill \nis all voluntary. The moaning and groaning of companies, I say, if you \ndon't want to participate, don't participate, but I can give you \nhundreds and thousands of companies that are desperate to participate \nto be able to protect themselves without a lawsuit, and this enables \nthat. It is a first-step bill.\n  I particularly wish to thank the chair and ranking on the Homeland \nSecurity Committee. I very much appreciate this support and know that \nSenator Burr, I, and others will continue to work as we recognize this \nmost serious threat on our economy and the privacy of individuals. To \ndo nothing now is to admit that we cannot come up with a bill, and, in \nfact, we can. Please vote yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I hope colleagues will vote no. I have \nthree quick points. No. 1, the chairman of the committee--and we work \ntogether often--acknowledged that this substitute would not have \nprevented these major hacks that we are all so concerned about. No. 2, \nonce again we have heard an attack on the country's major technology \ncompanies. All of them, all of them, colleagues, are opposed to this \nlegislation. We are talking about Apple and Dropbox and Twitter. The \nlist goes on and on. Why? Because these companies have to be concerned \nabout both cyber security and protecting their employees and their \ncustomers privacy. Unfortunately, this legislation does very little to \nprotect cyber security, which has now been acknowledged by the lead \nsponsor of the legislation and has major problems with respect to \nprotecting the liberty of the American people. I urge colleagues to \nvote no.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, are we out of time on the Democrats' side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty seconds remain.\n  Mr. CARPER. Colleagues, keep in mind, EINSTEIN 1 and EINSTEIN 2 are \nalready effective to detect but not block these intrusions. EINSTEIN 3, \nauthorized by our legislation, puts a new player on the field--a \ndefensive player--to be able to block these intrusions. This is new and \nrequires these agencies to implement that. For no other reason than \nthat, it is a good reason to support this proposal.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on amendment No. \n     2716 to S. 754, a bill to improve cybersecurity in the United \n     States through enhanced sharing of information about \n     cybersecurity threats, and for other purposes.\n         Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, Johnny Isakson, Richard \n           Burr, John McCain, Shelley Moore Capito, Orrin G. \n           Hatch, John Thune, Chuck Grassley, Pat Roberts, John \n           Barrasso, Jeff Flake, Lamar Alexander, Bill Cassidy, \n           Deb Fischer, Susan M.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on \namendment No. 2716, offered by the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. \nBurr, to S. 754, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

On this vote, the yeas are 83, the \nnays are 14.\n  Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2564, as Modified\n\n  There will now be 10 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a \nvote in relation to amendment No. 2564, offered by the Senator from \nNorth Carolina, Mr. Burr, for Mr. Paul.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I wish to say to my colleagues that there is \n10 minutes of debate in between these votes, so those Members who have \nconversations, I wish they would take them off the floor. If they are \nnot going to have conversations, stay and listen to the debate.\n  Mr. President, from the floor, I have said to my colleagues that the \ninformation sharing bill is a very delicately balanced piece of \nlegislation.\n  What we have attempted to do is to create a voluntary program that \ncompanies around this country can choose to participate in or not. Some \nhave already expressed their opposition to it, and I would say that is \nvery easy--pass the bill, and they just won't participate.\n  There are going to be amendments, though, that change the balance. I \ndon't want to get into the details of every amendment. Let me just say \nto my colleagues that if we change the balance we have reached not just \non both sides of the aisle but with the comfort level of businesses \nacross this country to where they believe they can no longer \nparticipate in it, then we won't have a successful information sharing \nbill.\n  I think every Member of this body and every American knows that cyber \nattacks are not going to go away. They are going to continue, they are \ngoing\n\n[[Page S7435]]\n\nto become more numerous, and we are going to be on the floor debating \nsomething that is probably much more specific in the future. I wish we \ncould prevent it, but right now our only tool is legislation that \nvoluntarily asks companies to participate to minimize the loss of data.\n  I encourage my colleagues, as the vice chair and I have--we are going \nto oppose all the amendments that come up. We have gone through all the \namendments, and those which we could accept and which we felt embraced \nthe balance we had achieved and could still hold together the support \nacross the country--we incorporated those in the managers' amendment, \nand that managers' amendment will be voted on when we come back on \nMonday or Tuesday.\n  With that, I yield the floor to my vice chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask the Senate to vote no on this \namendment, and I would like to explain why. This amendment would create \nan exemption to the bill's narrowly tailored liability protections for \ncompanies that take responsible actions to look for cyber threats and \nshare information about them if a company ``breaks a user or privacy \nagreement with a customer, regardless of how trivial it may be.''\n  The underlying cyber bill has been carefully drafted to ensure that \nit is totally voluntary and that activities can only be conducted on a \ncustomer's behalf with express authorization.\n  Let me read the language in the bill. The bill reads:\n\n       Nothing in this title shall be construed--\n       (1) to amend, repeal, or supersede any current or future \n     contractual agreement, terms of service agreement, or other \n     contractual relationship between any entities, or between any \n     entity and a Federal entity.\n\n  There is tremendous objection to the Paul amendment that is coming in \nfrom the chamber of commerce, various companies, and the health \nindustry. They understand what is in our bill. This amendment would \nactually fatally disturb what is in the bill, which is clear and \nconcise.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, this cyber security bill attempts to enhance \nsecurity for transactions on the Internet but I think actually weakens \nprivacy in the process. The bill would grant legal immunity to \ncompanies that, in sharing information, actually violate your privacy.\n  Most companies have a privacy agreement. You see it when you get on \nthe Internet. It is supposed to guarantee that your information, \nindividual choices, and consumer choices on the Internet are not \nrevealed to anyone. This bill says that if the company violates it in \nsharing your information, there will be legal immunity for that \ncompany. I think that weakens privacy. It makes the privacy agreement \nnot really worth the paper it is written on.\n  I think privacy is of great concern to Americans. The government \ndoesn't have a very good record with privacy. In the news today, a \nteenager is now reading the email of the CIA Director. It doesn't sound \nas though the government is very good at protecting privacy. I am not \nreally excited about letting them have more information.\n  The government revealed 20 million individual records of their \nemployees, private records of their employees. This is the same \ngovernment that now says: Trust us, and let's give everybody involved \nimmunity so the consumer has no recourse if their privacy is breached. \nThis is the same government that allowed the ObamaCare Web site to be \nhacked and looked at. This is a government that doesn't have a lot of \nconcern or ability to protect privacy. We are now asked to entrust this \ngovernment with volumes and volumes of personal information sent across \nthe vastness of the Internet. There is good reason that many of our \nlargest technological companies oppose this legislation.\n  My amendment will give companies and Internet users clarity on what \ninformation is shared with the government, and it will protect the \nprivacy agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to respond to that \nbecause we have been told that for the industries that support this \nbill, this amendment is a bill killer, and the opposition to it has \ncome in far and wide. We have 52 industrial associations in business, \nfinance, banking, petroleum, waterworks, railroads, public power, real \nestate, and retail--52 associations that are on your desk--supporting \nit. In particular, the health industry has weighed in against this \namendment.\n  We accomplished the purpose in our bill in a way that is acceptable. \nPlease vote no.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, let us be clear that most of the high-tech \ncompanies that have anything to do with the Internet and anything to do \nwith information sharing oppose this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I think everybody would like to vote, but I \nwill say one last thing to my colleagues.\n  Any company in America--any company in America--that chooses not to \nparticipate, doesn't have to. If for some reason they find there is \nsomething in this piece of legislation they are uncomfortable with or \nthey are concerned about with regard to the transfer of any personal \ndata, it is very simple: They do not have to participate. But to deny \neverybody who would like to participate is wrong.\n  I would encourage my colleagues to defeat the amendment and support \nmoving on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2564, as modified.\n  Mr. PAUL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from South Carolina (Mr. Graham), the Senator from Florida (Mr. \nRubio), and the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 32, nays 65, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 282 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--32\n\n     Baldwin\n     Barrasso\n     Bennet\n     Booker\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Coons\n     Crapo\n     Cruz\n     Daines\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Heinrich\n     Heller\n     Leahy\n     Lee\n     Markey\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Paul\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sullivan\n     Udall\n     Warren\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--65\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Blumenthal\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Burr\n     Capito\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Cassidy\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Cotton\n     Donnelly\n     Ernst\n     Feinstein\n     Fischer\n     Flake\n     Gardner\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heitkamp\n     Hirono\n     Hoeven\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kaine\n     King\n     Kirk\n     Klobuchar\n     Lankford\n     Manchin\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moran\n     Murphy\n     Nelson\n     Perdue\n     Peters\n     Portman\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rounds\n     Sasse\n     Schatz\n     Scott\n     Sessions\n     Shaheen\n     Shelby\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Tillis\n     Toomey\n     Warner\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Graham\n     Rubio\n     Vitter\n  The amendment (No. 2564), as modified, was rejected.\n  Ms. COLLINS.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S7436]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Debt Ceiling\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise to give voice to concerns about \nthe pending battle over what is referred to as the debt ceiling. We \nhave been told that the ability of the United States to pay its bills \non time and its interest on bonds will expire on November 3, which is \nonly about a dozen days from now--less than 2 weeks.\n  This is of grave concern to Americans. In fact, if it hasn't been a \nconcern to someone, it should be because it touches almost every \nAmerican household. This is all about the question of whether we are \ngoing to pay a bill that is due for previous spending on time or not. \nThis is all about whether we are going to pay the interest that will be \ndue on Treasury bills on time or not.\n  Great Nations don't pay their bills late. They are expected to be \norganized and competent and have their act together, but there is also \na tremendous incentive to pay on time because when you pay late, the \ninterest rate on your debt goes up because you become less \ncreditworthy. Many folks in this Chamber say we should operate like a \nfamily and think about family values when it comes to finance. Here is \nthe connection with how families operate: They know if they don't pay \ntheir mortgage or insurance or their Target bill on time, then their \ncost of credit is going to go up and their credit score will go down.\n  Sometimes families simply don't have any possible way of paying a \nbill when it comes up, and they struggle to get the funds together, \nknowing the more cases that fail, the worse it is for their credit \nscore, which means if they borrow money to buy a car, a house, or for \nany reason, the interest rate is going to be much higher, and they will \nhave to pay a lot more and will not get anything more than they would \nhave gotten before.\n  Families understand they have to pay their bills on time. That is \nfiscal responsibility. But some may have forgotten that this lesson is \nnot just anchored in theory, this is in practice. In 2011, when we \ndillydallied over paying our bills on time, the United States credit \nrating was taken down a notch, which meant that we had to pay a higher \ninterest.\n  How about 2013--just 2 years ago--when we failed to act responsibly \nand the government shut down and it cost us not only 120,000 jobs, but \nit also cost us, by our best estimates, about $70 million more in \ninterest that we wouldn't have otherwise had to pay because interest \nrates went up. Not paying your bills on time is fiscally irresponsible \nand, to put it more directly, it is a ``Dumb and Dumber'' tax on every \nAmerican family. I am not sure why it is that advocates in the House \nand Senate are advocating for a ``Dumb and Dumber'' tax. The worst tax \nis when it costs money and you buy nothing, but that is what happens \nwhen you don't pay your bills on time.\n  We know the cost of paying more on Treasury bonds doesn't just affect \nthe U.S. Government. We also know that the Treasury bond rate is used \nas an index for items, such as home mortgages and car loans. So our \nfamilies have to pay more because of the irresponsibility of the \nRepublican ``Dumb and Dumber'' tax on America. It is irresponsible, and \nit is damaging to our country and to our families.\n  It is not often that I turn to Ronald Reagan for insight, but in this \ncase he had it absolutely right. Ronald Reagan said that fiscal \nresponsibility is paying your bills on time. There were a number of \ntimes when he spoke to Congress and said, don't do a ``Dumb and \nDumber'' tax.\n  To put it in his own words when he was at a radio address in 1987, he \nsaid:\n\n       This brinksmanship threatens the holders of government \n     bonds and those who rely on Social Security and veterans' \n     benefits. Interest markets would skyrocket. Instability would \n     occur in financial markets, and the federal deficit would \n     soar.\n\n  He continued and said, ``The United States has a special \nresponsibility to itself and the world to meet its obligations.''\n  At another time he wrote a letter to the majority leader of the \nSenate and said:\n\n       The full consequences of a default--or even the serious \n     prospect of default--by the United States are impossible to \n     predict and awesome to contemplate.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       Denigration of the full faith and credit of the United \n     States would have substantial effects on the domestic \n     financial markets and the value of the dollar in exchange \n     markets. The Nation can ill afford to allow such a result. \n     The risks, the costs, the disruptions, and the incalculable \n     damage lead me to but one conclusion: the Senate must pass \n     this legislation before Congress adjourns.\n\n  Let us listen to the voice of reason on fiscal responsibility to pay \nour debts on time. Let us not adopt the Republican ``Dumb and Dumber'' \ntax of failing to pay our bills that extracts huge costs, as President \nReagan recognized, both on our Nation and on our families.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n Pioneer Spirit of Colorado and 100th Anniversary of Farmers Implement \n                                Company\n\n  Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, in the 1800s, Colorado found itself at \nthe center of a nation--gold rushes and silver rushes, cattle barons \nand sheep barons, range wars pitting the rancher against the sod \nfarmer. It is a State that, as it does today, had a little bit of \nsomething for everyone--a whole lot of space, breathtaking vistas, and \npioneer dreams abound.\n  The 1860s ushered in the land rush across the country, extending to \nColorado a few years later by the 1880s. People from the east looking \nfor that relief valve of western expansion were drawn to the high \nplains of Colorado with its fertile valleys, peaks and plateaus, places \nwhere the rain followed the plow, and the landsmen knew no limit to the \nsale of aridity.\n  It was in the 1880s that one Raimond von Harrom Schramm, a wealthy \nbaron, was moving his belongings from east to west when the train he \nwas riding on derailed in a small eastern Colorado town. Detecting \nDivine providence at work--or most likely scared to get back on the \ntrain--he decided to stay put, declaring the site of the derailment was \nwhere God intended him to be.\n  He went on to build the first multistory brick buildings in that town \nbefore the town's fathers decided against naming him the mayor. That \nthe town council would subject such a man of possession to the humility \nof an election was too much for Baron Schramm, promptly causing him to \nmove his brick buildings to a more aptly named town--you guessed it--\nSchramm, just down the road. It is 100 years later, and there are no \nbrick buildings in his namesake town, just a nice feedlot bearing the \nname Schramm.\n  In the town he left behind, hardscrabble businesses continued, \nsqueezing just enough moisture out of the ground to provide pastures \nfor the cows. Soon enough fortune and luck built up to break the sod on \nthe eastern plains to begin Colorado's long romance with high-plains \nfarming. It surely wasn't easy. Families crammed into tar paper houses, \nstaking their claim on a patch of ground that knows only shades of \nbrown and green.\n  It was around 1915 when three men came together to start an implement \nbusiness--Roy Chilcoat, Jack Tribbett, and another partner--selling \nfarm equipment. Steel-studded wheatland machinery, cream separators, \nand corn shellers tilled sandhills whose only previous disruptions were \nantelope, buffalo, and the crossing paths of the plains Indians.\n  It was no easy feat to be a pioneer in agriculture. There was an old \nsaying at the coffee shop in that small town: How do you make a small \nfortune in agriculture? You start with a large one. The people there \nlived in sod houses, getting ice from ponds in the winter to store over \nthe summer--if there was enough moisture for the pond. They endured \nsandstorms and dust bowls that were described in books and movies for \ngenerations to come.\n  These hardy men and women didn't leave when the hard times continued \nbecause they had made this their home. To survive was to succeed and to \nsucceed was something that every American aspired to. Their wealth was \nmeasured in friends, family, and in the miles of prairie and the \nconsistency of the windmills turning the lifeblood of the plains, their \nwater. Perhaps nothing else has changed the face of Colorado or Western \nStates more than the\n\n[[Page S7437]]\n\napplication of water to dry land. They are what make Colorado today--\nboundless spirits of pioneers driven to succeed.\n  During the Great Depression, it was devastating for everyone. \nNeighbors saw neighbors' soil drive unrelentingly across the darkened \ncountry sky, carried by the wind borne atop the rain-deprived \nlands. People like Chilcoat and Tribbet knew they had to survive for \nthemselves, their families, and their small, struggling community. They \nhad to survive so that others in the community could survive too.\n\n  So they found ways to do it--diversifying the business; trading wheat \nfor tractors; giving a price for the wheat that was at two or three \ntimes the money the wheat was actually worth just to keep families on \ntheir farms; storing the wheat, hoping that it would someday be worth \nmore than the loss they had incurred. They gave tractors to poor \nfarmers knowing they couldn't pay for them but knowing that without \nthem, those family farms wouldn't make it; knowing that someday--or \nholding hope above fear--their neighbor would make good on it and pay \nwhat they could.\n  Businesses in these small towns scraped through the Depression, on to \nWorld War II when its sons and daughters left to fight for freedom in \nlands many had never heard of before, rationing, sacrificing, and \ndedicating new faces to the workforce, forever changing the landscape \nof small and big towns alike.\n  Eventually, businesses like Roy's and Jack's and their partners would \npass on to a new generation--Howard Crowley and a new partner--and then \nagain to a new generation still. That business still stands today as \nFarmers Implement Company. Chilcoat and Tribbet were joined by my \ngreat-grandfather, known as Daddy Bill, who would eventually sell their \ninterests to my grandfather, Paul Gardner, and my father, John Gardner.\n  I spent years working there, trying to learn values, the business, \nbut learning more about relationships--people and a way of life--than \nselling parts. In fact, based on how many wrong parts I sold, I am \npretty sure that was one of the least of things I learned about. But I \nwatched as generations of customers came through the door. I watched my \ngrandfather refuse to sell something they could make money on in the \ndealership, but he knew the person who wanted it couldn't afford to buy \nit. Why did he do it? Because he wanted them to survive--a new \ngeneration of survivors continuing their fight to make a living on the \nwindswept plains of eastern Colorado.\n  Tomorrow, Farmers Implement will celebrate its 100th anniversary as a \nfamily-owned farm implement business. I am proud of the values that \ndealership represents and honored to be a part of a great rural family \nheritage and our little town of Yuma. Congratulations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              Highway Bill\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, last Friday the House Transportation \nand Infrastructure Committee released the bipartisan 6-year highway \nbill proposal. If everything goes as expected, the House transportation \ncommittee will mark up its legislation this week. From what I \nunderstand, House leadership is committed to taking up this crucial \nlegislation in the coming weeks.\n  As many of you know, passing a long-term transportation bill has been \none of my goals as a Member of this body. In fact, since my time in the \nNebraska unicameral, I have made transportation infrastructure funding \na top priority. Two of my signature accomplishments in the unicameral \nled to increased investment for Nebraska's infrastructure and helped \nlocal communities move forward with starting and completing vital \ntransportation projects.\n  This August I welcomed our U.S. Transportation Secretary, Anthony \nFoxx, to Lincoln, NE, where we convened a roundtable at the University \nof Nebraska-Lincoln's Transportation Research Center. We were joined by \nlocal transportation stakeholders representing railroad, highway \nconstruction, trucking, passenger automobiles, and the aviation \nindustry. At this important meeting, as well as at my listening \nsessions this summer throughout the State, the message from Nebraskans \nwas loud and clear: Our businesses, consumers, workers, and families \nwant a long-term highway bill.\n  Throughout the process of developing this bill, I worked with local \nstakeholders in Nebraska, including our State department of roads, \nhighway builders and project managers, and transportation and community \nleaders.\n  Infrastructure is a wise investment. It keeps our country competitive \nin today's global marketplace. The safety of our traveling public \ndepends on robust and reliable transportation infrastructure. That is \nwhy we passed a bipartisan multiyear highway bill here in the Senate. \nThe DRIVE Act provides States and communities with 6 years of certainty \nfor that highway funding without raising taxes on middle-class \nfamilies.\n  As an active member of the Environment and Public Works Committee and \nthe Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, I am proud of the \nwork we have accomplished together. Our bill enhances safety, proposes \nmuch needed regulatory reforms, and it increases investment in our \nNation's infrastructure.\n  The DRIVE Act also includes significant reforms to accelerate highway \nproject construction. The bill does so by advancing key provisions that \nensure that local infrastructure projects in Nebraska and all across \nthis country will move forward with a better and a more defined process \nfrom the very onset.\n  The meaningful changes that I championed will provide better \ncoordination between the Federal Highway Administration and States by \nstreamlining environmental permitting and reviews, as well as \nprogrammatic agreement templates when initiating new infrastructure \nprojects.\n  Specifically, the bill will establish new procedures based on a \ntemplate developed by the Secretary of the Department of \nTransportation. This will allow our States, in addition to the Federal \nGovernment, to determine which State or Federal agencies must be \nconsulted prior to beginning that infrastructure project.\n  In addition, the bill provides technical assistance to States that \nwant to assume responsibility for the reviews of categorical exclusion \nprojects, which are a category of projects that don't have a \nsignificant impact on the environment, triggering a less arduous level \nof environmental review. Rather than wasting time and taxpayer dollars \nwaiting on the Federal Government to provide an assessment, my \nprovisions would help States provide their own categorical \ncertification regarding the appropriate level of environmental review \nof certain projects.\n  Given Nebraska's challenges with starting and completing \ninfrastructure projects, these elements of the DRIVE Act offer a major \nstep forward for transportation projects in my State.\n  The DRIVE Act also includes major components of a bill that I \nintroduced earlier this year called the TRUCK Safety Reform Act. The \nlegislation offers serious regulatory reforms to the Federal Motor \nCarrier Safety Administration. Additionally, the bill encourages \nstronger regulatory analysis, more transparency, and wider public \nparticipation in the regulatory process.\n  The bill also provides regulatory relief to agricultural producers in \nNebraska, reforms research at the Department of Transportation to \nreduce duplication across the modal administrations, and addresses the \nchallenges of the Compliance Safety and Accountability truck scoring \nprogram.\n  I am pleased that the DRIVE Act establishes a new freight program \nthat will prioritize, increase efficiency, and lower the costs for \nmoving freight imports and exports throughout our Nation. The DRIVE \nAct's freight program will designate a national freight system and \nprovide guaranteed dollars to Nebraska to enhance freight movement \nthroughout our State on our railways and highways. The freight program \nwill also help America's transportation system continue to facilitate \nexpanding\n\n[[Page S7438]]\n\nU.S. trade flows. The freight program is crucial to our Nation's \neconomic competitiveness, especially as international trade continues \nto increase.\n  The DRIVE Act further incorporates performance-based regulations into \nour Nation's transportation system. Performance-based measures will \noffer States more flexibility in meeting the goals of infrastructure-\nrelated regulations, something that I have strongly advocated as \nchairman of the surface transportation subcommittee.\n  In totality, I believe the Senate produced a thoughtful, \ncomprehensive, and well-drafted highway bill. I greatly appreciate the \nHouse moving forward with a long-term highway bill, and I am eager to \nseek passage of this vital legislation so we can move to a joint \nconference committee.\n  I am also pleased to see that the House bill offers several critical \nprovisions, including regulatory reform of the FMCSA and the CSA \nProgram, hair testing for commercial drivers, a freight program, and \nstreamlined permitting to initiate local highway projects at a faster \npace. Ultimately, the House's legislative activity this week \nsurrounding the highway bill is a strong step toward achieving a \nmultiyear highway bill--one that will move our economy forward, create \njobs, and strengthen safety on our roads, highways, and bridges all \nacross America.\n  In the coming weeks I look forward to working with Chairman Inhofe, \nChairman Thune, Senator Boxer, and Chairman Shuster to produce a \nreform-oriented compromise that enhances the efficiency, reliability, \nand safety of our Nation's transportation system.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Request--S. Res. 224\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, on October 15, 2015, Senators Dianne \nFeinstein and Patrick Leahy released the following statement marking \nthe 5-year anniversary of the arrest of Liu Xia, the wife of Chinese \ndemocracy activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo:\n\n       This week marks the five-year anniversary that Liu Xia was \n     placed under house arrest in China. She has never been \n     charged with a crime and remains confined to her apartment \n     because her husband, respected democracy activist Liu Xiaobo, \n     won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010.\n       Over the past five years, Liu Xia's health has sharply \n     deteriorated. She suffers from anxiety, depression, severe \n     back pain and had a heart attack last year. Her repeated \n     requests to leave the country for medical treatment have been \n     denied.\n       We urgently request the Chinese government allow Liu Xia to \n     seek medical treatment abroad and release Liu Xiaobo, the \n     world's only jailed Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Such action \n     would be a welcome humanitarian gesture.\n\n  I could not agree more with the very wise sentiments expressed by \nSenator Feinstein and Senator Leahy. That is exactly right. The United \nStates should speak with one voice in support of human rights and \nagainst the disgrace that China has jailed this Nobel Peace Prize \nlaureate.\n  My resolution, following in the tradition of legislation that renamed \nthe street in front of the Soviet Embassy in honor of the heroic \nRussian dissident and Nobel laureate Andrei Sakharov in 1984, would do \nthe same, it would rename the street in front of the People's Republic \nof China Embassy to be ``Liu Xiaobo Plaza'' after the equally heroic \nChinese dissident and Nobel laureate who had been brutally imprisoned \nby the PRC since 2009 for peacefully advocating for basic political \nfreedom.\n  I would note that the original legislation naming the street in front \nof the Soviet Embassy in honor of Mr. Sakharov was introduced by my \ncolleague the senior Senator from Iowa who is on the floor with me \ntoday to support me in this request.\n  As I noted when I first asked unanimous consent for this legislation \non September 24 on the eve of President Xi's visit to Washington, I, \nfor one, think as Americans we should not be troubled by embarrassing \nCommunist oppressors, and this issue is not abstract to me.\n  My family, like Dr. Liu, has been imprisoned by repressive regimes. \nMy father as a teenager was imprisoned and tortured in Cuba. He had his \nnose broken. He had his teeth shattered. He lay in the blood and grime \nof a prison cell.\n  In Cuba, my aunt--my Tia Sonia--was a few years later imprisoned and \ntortured by Castro--my father by Batista, my aunt by Castro--imprisoned \nand tortured by an oppressive Communist regime.\n  The United States has a long history of standing with dissidents and \nspeaking out for human rights. When this body acted to rename the \nstreet in front of the Soviet Embassy ``Sakharov Plaza,'' that was a \npowerful statement that helped bring condemnation of the world on the \nSoviet Union's repressive human rights record. We should show the same \nbipartisan unanimity with regard to Communist China, standing together \nwith a wrongfully imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate. We should say \nto the wrongfully imprisoned dissidents across the world: America hears \nyou and we stand with you.\n  Some years ago I visited with Natan Sharansky in Jerusalem. He \ndescribed how the prisoners in the Soviet gulag would pass notes from \ncell to cell: Did you hear what President Reagan said? Evil empire, ash \nheap of history, tear down this wall.\n  What this body does makes a difference. What this country does makes \na difference, and we should not forget our core values.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committee be discharged from further \nconsideration of and the Senate now proceed to the consideration of S. \nRes. 224; I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I \nwish to make a couple of remarks as to why.\n  Senator Cruz, believe it or not, I have actually played a role--\nparticularly in the 1990s--in helping dissidents be released by the \nGovernment of China and had some success. We did that by talking to the \ngovernment.\n  I think to do this in this way will set back the cause and actually \nbe deleterious to the release of these people, so I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I intend to continue pressing this \nresolution because I believe we have a moral imperative to speak for \nfreedom. It is one thing to put out press releases, it is another thing \nto act. I agree with every word in the press release that was issued by \nSenator Feinstein and Senator Leahy, and my request is simply to put \naction to those words.\n  I tell you, when I visit with Chinese Americans in my State of Texas, \nI don't want to have to look them in the eyes and tell them I stood \nwith the Chinese Communist Government, the oppressors, instead of \nstanding with Dr. Liu, instead of standing with a Nobel Peace Prize \nlaureate, for fear of embarrassing their oppressors.\n  There are few things more powerful than embarrassment, than public \nsunshine. When Ronald Reagan stood before the Brandenburg Gate and said \n``Tear down this wall,'' he didn't listen to the voice of timidity say: \nNow that is going to embarrass the Soviets.\n  I would note in the White House that the staffers repeatedly crossed \nout that line of his speech. They said: No, no, no, no, no. That will \nupset the Soviets. That will set us back diplomatically--the exact same \nargument, sadly, the senior Senator from California just presented. And \neach time President Reagan wrote that line back in with his own hand, \nexplaining to those staffers: You don't understand, that is the entire \npoint of giving the speech. That is why I am there because when we \nspeak the truth, the truth has power.\n  This body--Democratic Senators in this body and Republican Senators \nin this body--should not be aiding and abetting the oppression of the \nChinese Government. We should be standing\n\n[[Page S7439]]\n\nand speaking for truth and for freedom, and we should be following the \npattern that was successfully demonstrated by Senator Grassley in \nintroducing the resolution naming ``Sakharov Plaza'' in front of the \nSoviet Embassy.\n  With that, I yield to my colleague, the senior Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I appreciate my colleague bringing up \nthe history of Andrei Sakharov Plaza. A lot of people wonder whether \nthis makes much of a difference, what the Senator is attempting to do \nin the case of the Chinese Embassy. I can tell you it made a big \ndifference. All you have to do is measure the opposition as we were \nconsidering the one I introduced several years ago. When the State \nDepartment fights hard not to embarrass the Russians, when the city of \nWashington, DC, fights very hard not to rename a street, then you know \nyou are on the right track, when you have those sorts of people in \nopposition to you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Such \n     strategy shall address--\n       (1) gaps in research, including with respect to--\n       (A) the most appropriate treatment of pregnant women with \n     opioid use disorders;\n\n[[Page S7440]]\n\n       (B) the most appropriate treatment and management of \n     infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome; and\n       (C) the long-term effects of prenatal opioid exposure on \n     children;\n       (2) gaps, overlap, or duplication in--\n       (A) substance use disorder treatment programs for pregnant \n     and postpartum women; and\n       (B) treatment program options for newborns with neonatal \n     abstinence syndrome;\n       (3) gaps, overlap, or duplication in Federal efforts \n     related to education about, and prevention of, neonatal \n     abstinence syndrome; and\n       (4) coordination of Federal efforts to address neonatal \n     abstinence syndrome.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the \n     Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House \n     of Representatives a report concerning the findings of the \n     review conducted under subsection (a) and the strategy \n     developed under subsection (b).\n\n     SEC. 3. DEVELOPING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PREVENTING AND \n                   TREATING PRENATAL OPIOID USE DISORDERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall conduct a study and \n     develop recommendations for preventing and treating prenatal \n     opioid use disorders, including the effects of such disorders \n     on infants. In carrying out this subsection the Secretary \n     shall--\n       (1) take into consideration--\n       (A) the review and strategy conducted and developed under \n     section 2; and\n       (B) the lessons learned from previous opioid epidemics; and\n       (2) solicit input from States, localities, and Federally \n     recognized Indian tribes or tribal organizations (as defined \n     in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act \n     (25 U.S.C. 450b)), and nongovernmental entities, including \n     organizations representing patients, health care providers, \n     hospitals, other treatment facilities, and other entities, as \n     appropriate.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall make available on \n     the appropriate Internet Website of the Department of Health \n     and Human Services a report on the recommendations under \n     subsection (a). Such report shall address each of the issues \n     described in subsection (c).\n       (c) Contents.--The recommendations described in subsection \n     (a) and the report under subsection (b) shall include--\n       (1) a comprehensive assessment of existing research with \n     respect to the prevention, identification, treatment, and \n     long-term outcomes of neonatal abstinence syndrome, including \n     the identification and treatment of pregnant women or women \n     who may become pregnant who use opioids or have opioid use \n     disorders;\n       (2) an evaluation of--\n       (A) the causes of, and risk factors for, opioid use \n     disorders among women of reproductive age, including pregnant \n     women;\n       (B) the barriers to identifying and treating opioid use \n     disorders among women of reproductive age, including pregnant \n     and postpartum women and women with young children;\n       (C) current practices in the health care system to respond \n     to, and treat, pregnant women with opioid use disorders and \n     infants affected by such disorders;\n       (D) medically indicated uses of opioids during pregnancy;\n       (E) access to treatment for opioid use disorders in \n     pregnant and postpartum women; and\n       (F) access to treatment for infants with neonatal \n     abstinence syndrome; and\n       (G) differences in prenatal opioid use and use disorders in \n     pregnant women between demographic groups; and\n       (3) recommendations on--\n       (A) preventing, identifying, and treating the effects of \n     prenatal opioid use on infants;\n       (B) treating pregnant women who have opioid use disorders;\n       (C) preventing opioid use disorders among women of \n     reproductive age, including pregnant women, who may be at \n     risk of developing opioid use disorders; and\n       (D) reducing disparities in opioid use disorders among \n     pregnant women.\n\n     SEC. 4. IMPROVING DATA AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE.\n\n       The Secretary may continue activities, as appropriate, \n     related to--\n       (1) providing technical assistance to support States and \n     Federally recognized Indian Tribes in collecting information \n     on neonatal abstinence syndrome through the utilization of \n     existing surveillance systems and collaborating with States \n     and Federally recognized Indian Tribes to improve the \n     quality, consistency, and collection of such data; and\n       (2) providing technical assistance to support States in \n     implementing effective public health measures, such as \n     disseminating information to educate the public, health care \n     providers, and other stakeholders on prenatal opioid use and \n     neonatal abstinence syndrome.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee-reported substitute amendment be agreed to; that the bill, as \namended, be read a third time and passed; that the committee-reported \ntitle amendment be agreed to; and that the motions to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S7440, October 22, 2015, in the middle column, the \nfollowing language appears: The PRESIDING OFFICER. Mr.President, I \nask . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. \nPresident, I ask . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 799), as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading, was read the third time, and passed.\n  The Committee-reported title amendment was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       Amend the title so as to read: ``To address problems \n     related to prenatal opioid use.''.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I was pleased to see the Senate pass by \nunanimous consent just now the bipartisan Protecting Our Infants Act. \nAs prescription drug abuse and heroin use have increased in Kentucky \nand other States across the Nation, no demographic, socioeconomic \nstatus, age, or gender has been left untouched.\n  As the father of three daughters, particularly concerning to me is \nthe increase in prenatal opiate abuse, which has resulted in a \nstaggering 300-percent increase in the number of infants born suffering \nfrom withdrawal symptoms since 2000.\n  To address this crisis, I introduced the Protecting Our Infants Act, \nalong with my colleague Senator Bob Casey. The bill would direct the \nHealth and Human Services Secretary to conduct a departmental review to \nidentify gaps in research and any duplication, overlap, or gaps in \nprevention and treatment programs related to this issue. It would also \ndirect the Secretary to work with stakeholders on recommendations to \naddress the problem. Furthermore, this measure would encourage the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention to work with States in an \neffort to help improve their public health response to this epidemic.\n  Also, I want to acknowledge the outstanding work of the Senator from \nNew Hampshire, Ms. Kelly Ayotte. I know that one of the things New \nHampshire and Kentucky actually, unfortunately, share is that this has \nreached epidemic proportions. Nobody has been more involved in this \nissue than the Senator from New Hampshire. She has been on top of it \nfrom the very beginning. She shares the concerns of others, obviously, \nwho have States that are suffering from this enormous problem.\n  I would also like to thank Representatives Katherine Clark and Steve \nStivers for leading the effort to advance a similar message in the \nHouse of Representatives. I look forward to the House taking up this \nbill and it being sent to the President for his signature.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I want to thank our leader and thank \nSenator Casey for introducing and pushing to pass this very important \nlegislation. This legislation, the Protecting Our Infants Act, of which \nI was proud to be an early sponsor, will help address the increasing \nnumber of newborns born with opioid dependency. I thank the additional \nMembers, including the chairman of the HELP Committee and Ranking \nMember Murray, for helping get that through this important committee.\n  New Hampshire is facing a public health epidemic. In fact, the heroin \nand prescription drug addiction crisis is the single most urgent issue \nfacing my State right now. So many families who have lost children have \ncome to me. The other day, I was buying something, and the woman behind \nthe counter said to me: Keep working on this issue. I asked her why. \nShe said: I lost my granddaughter.\n  Too many families are experiencing losing their loved ones, their \nfamily members who are struggling with addiction. Our first responders \nare inundated. They are saving lives with lifesaving drugs such as \nNarcan. Public health and safety officials in our State--this is truly \nsomething on which we all need to work together to address.\n  One of the tragic results of this growing opioid abuse epidemic--it \nhas often been overlooked--is the increasing number of infants who are \nborn dependent on opioids and suffering from withdrawal.\n  Researchers estimate that almost every hour in this country, there is \nan infant being born who is suffering from withdrawal symptoms or born \nwith dependency symptoms from opioid addiction.\n  This is an issue which I am so glad is being addressed in this bill, \nthe Protecting Our Infants Act. How we treat our children and our \ninfants is so much a reflection of who we are. That is why I was proud \nto cosponsor this bipartisan legislation which will call for the \ndevelopment of recommendations to prevent and treat prenatal opioid \nuse, including neonatal abstinence syndrome.\n\n[[Page S7441]]\n\n  This bill would also ask the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention to assist States in data collection and increased \nsurveillance to better monitor the prevalence and causes of neonatal \nabstinence syndrome so that we can work on more support for prevention, \ntreatment, and recovery to help mothers get support and get into \ntreatment so that we don't have infants who are born with opioid \ndependence and withdrawal symptoms.\n  As the leader said, across the Nation the number of infants diagnosed \nwith newborn withdrawal has increased 300 percent since 2000. In my \nhome State of New Hampshire, in May of this year, I visited the \nCatholic Medical Center in Manchester and heard directly from medical \npersonnel there and first responders who have been treating and \nresponding to cases of newborn withdrawal. Catholic Medical Center \nofficials reported that 7 percent of newborn babies at that hospital \nwere born with neonatal abstinence syndrome. That is a significant \nincrease from last year. According to officials at Catholic Medical \nCenter's Pregnancy Care Center, close to half of the mothers cared for \nare struggling with addiction.\n  I thank the leader. I thank Senator Casey. Today's passage of the \nProtecting Our Infants Act is one very important step to address the \ncrisis of opioid abuse seen in New Hampshire and across this country. \nNow that we have passed this in the Senate, I want to thank those \nMembers in the House who have led this effort. I hope the House quickly \npasses this and sends it to the President of the United States.\n  I hope the Senate will continue to focus on this public health \nepidemic because there are many solutions that are bipartisan. One is \ncalled the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. This is a bill I \nhelped introduce with Senator Whitehouse, Senator Portman, and Senator \nKlobuchar. This is a bill which will deal with prevention so that we \ncan make sure we get that message out to prevent people from overusing \nand misusing prescription drugs and also turning to heroin. It is so we \ncan have more support for treatment and recovery where there is a big \ngap in my State and so we can support our first responders and make \nsure they have access to the lifesaving drug Narcan.\n  One experience I had recently was I went on a ride-along with our \nlargest police department, and I had previously gone on a ride-along \nwith our largest fire department. Within half an hour of the fire \ndepartment ride-along, we went to a heroin overdose. I watched the \nemergency personnel--police, fire, emergency first responders--bring \nsomeone back to life using Narcan. When I did the police ride-along, \nwithin an hour and a half, we went to two heroin overdoses. Again, \nfirst responders saved those two individuals' lives.\n  I have to tell you, I was a murder prosecutor. I saw a lot of tough \nthings when I was attorney general. But I couldn't breathe when I was \nsitting in that room and watching that second individual, a young man, \non the ground, the first responders doing everything they could, \nanother dose of Narcan--I thought he was gone. This is what our first \nresponders are dealing with every single day.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I naively thought that my State was uniquely afflicted \nwith this scourge--we had the drug czar come down to Northern Kentucky, \nwhich is a part of my State, a suburb of Cincinnati--only to find that \nit is a problem all over the country. I was curious as to how this \nrates with the people of New Hampshire as one of the things they are \nconcerned about.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Leader, I will tell you, Director Botticelli came to New \nHampshire as well, and he testified at a field hearing Senator Shaheen \nand I had in New Hampshire. For the people of New Hampshire right now, \nthis is a crisis. It is a public health epidemic. I did a townhall last \nnight, and the single biggest issue I got asked about was this because \nI believe this is one of the top issues, if not the top issue on the \nminds of people in New Hampshire because they see their friends and \nfamily being impacted by this. Every socioeconomic group is being \nimpacted by, unfortunately, prescription drugs and then heroin, which \nis so cheap on our streets right now, also sometimes mixed with a \ndeadly drug called Fentanyl. In fact, we had a 60-percent increase in \ndrug deaths. There were 320 drug deaths last year.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Now we are losing more to drug overdoses and heroin \noverdoses than we are losing in car accidents. Is that true in New \nHampshire as well?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. It is the exact same thing in New Hampshire. In our \nState, more people are dying from heroin, Fentanyl, and abuse of \nprescription drugs than car accidents, which is staggering when you \nthink about it. This is a national epidemic. That is why I appreciate \nthe bill that was passed today. I think there is more that we in this \nbody could do that would benefit the Nation and would benefit our \nStates of Kentucky and New Hampshire to help give tools to the first \nresponders, the public health officials, treatment providers, those \nsupporting recovery and helping prevent this in the first instance. It \nis something that would obviously help address this crisis but also \nsomething that is a public health issue we should all care about.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for her \noutstanding work on this important issue. I have a feeling we will be \ngrappling with this in all of its various forms for many years to come.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank the leader for this bill today, which I am glad \nwas passed, and I look forward to working on additional legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/senate-section/article/S7441-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7441-S7445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CYBERSECURITY INFORMATION SHARING ACT OF 2015--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                      The Budget and Debt Ceiling\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to address the \nbudget standoff we are in and the looming debt ceiling issue we are \nfacing. I wish to address this briefly. There will be more to say about \nthis in the near future.\n  The administration tells us that November 3 is the date after which \nthe extraordinary measures they have been taking run out, and they say \nthat on that date, they will need to start borrowing more money. As we \nknow, we have temporary legislation that funds the government through \nDecember 11, I think it is, after which we have not yet resolved how we \nkeep the government operating. I would like to address this a little \nbit.\n  First of all, the fundamental problem we have on the debt ceiling \nincrease is we are spending too much money. We are running annual \ndeficits, and we have to borrow money to make up the shortfall. That is \nwhat is happening. That is why we reached the debt ceiling, and that is \nwhy and the administration wants to borrow more. What is particularly \nproblematic is the President's position that we ought to increase the \ndebt ceiling and allow him to borrow a lot more money without even so \nmuch as having a discussion on--much less actually addressing--the \ngross fiscal mismanagement that is requiring us to borrow all of this \nmoney in the first place.\n\n  Let's go back to a recent occasion in which we had this debate. In \n2011, we reached the debt limit and had a big debate about how we \nshould proceed, and what happened was Congress insisted on--and the \nPresident resisted but eventually agreed to--some very modest spending \ncuts. They established caps, or limits, on discretionary spending, \nwhich consist of 37 to 38 percent of all Federal spending that Congress \ncontrols through the annual appropriations process.\n  So some caps were put in place, and the idea was that for every \ndollar that we raised the debt ceiling, or for every new dollar of debt \nwe would impose on the American people, we would at least cut one \ndollar of spending over the next 10 years, so that even though we were \nmaking a bad situation with our debt load worse by increasing the debt, \nwe would at least be improving the underlying dynamic by diminishing \nthe total spending so that in the future our deficits would be smaller. \nAt least that was the idea.\n  If you take a look, there was actually a lot of progress in the \ncategory of Federal spending--the discretionary spending. We have a \ngraph that shows the increase in Federal spending. This red line shows \na huge surge that happened when the President insisted on that\n\n[[Page S7442]]\n\nmassive stimulus spending bill. That is the big spike. It dropped off a \nlittle bit because that single, individual gargantuan bill wasn't \nreplicated the next year. Then, a short time thereafter, we reached \nthis agreement with the President where Congress said: Mr. President, \nyou get the debt ceiling increase, but in return for that, let's reduce \nour discretionary spending over time, and then we will allow it to grow \nat the rate of inflation after a certain number of years. That was the \nnature of the agreement. The idea was to address the underlying problem \nof overspending that is requiring all of this debt.\n  As this chart demonstrates, this black line shows where we are today. \nWe have made some progress. There is a gradual, modest decline. This is \nthe big surge that came from that gigantic stimulus bill, but after \nthat, there is a gradual, steady, modest decline, so that in this \ncategory of discretionary spending--as I said, almost 40 percent of the \nFederal budget--we actually limited that. It is the first time, that I \nam aware of, in years--maybe even decades--when we have had several \nconsecutive years in which the Federal Government has actually spent \nless each year than the year before in discretionary spending.\n  By way of full disclosure, I voted against this overall agreement \nbecause I knew then, as I know now, that while this makes some \nprogress, it doesn't solve the underlying problem. One could argue that \nit moves in the right direction, but it does not fix the huge debt \nproblem that we have, and this chart illustrates that.\n  This chart shows that in recent years we have had a slight decline in \nthe size of our deficits. If we go back further, we would see that the \ndeficits were even higher earlier. We have made some progress. The \nannual deficit, which is the red line, is corresponding to each year \nsince 2014. We can see that it has come down a little bit. This year \nthe deficit will be $426 billion. It is still too big of a number, but \nit is less than it was in recent years.\n  Here is the problem: There are people around this town who talk as \nthough we have this problem solved. A few years ago, the deficit was $1 \ntrillion, and today it is $426 billion; so everything is OK. Take a \nlook at where this line is going. This isn't OK. This isn't 100 years \nfrom now. This is 5 years from now. This is 10 years from now. What is \nhappening is our deficits are going to explode.\n  This isn't just my projection. This is the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the nonpartisan CBO. By the way, their numbers are wildly \noptimistic. I will give three examples of assumptions they make, and \nyou can judge whether you think these are reasonable assumptions or \nnot.\n  First of all, as to the whole package of tax extenders, the \nindividual tax cuts that we renew every year, they assume that we \nstopped renewing them and so there will be this surge of revenue that \nwill come into the Federal Government every year thereafter, and that \nis all baked into these numbers. They also assume that we are going to \nstick to the spending caps that I illustrated in the previous chart. In \nthis body we all know that negotiations are underway right now to bust \nthose spending caps, and the President is insisting on it.\n  In fact, the President has gone so far as to say that he is vetoing \nthe National Defense Authorization Act in part because we haven't yet \nagreed to bust the caps on nondefense spending. Despite that, these \nnumbers assume that the caps are all complied with. Finally, the \nCongressional Budget Office makes extremely optimistic assumptions, in \nmy view, about economic growth going forward in the next several years, \nand that means they are making optimistic assumptions about how much \nrevenue the Federal Government is going to be taking in. Despite that, \nas we can see, deficits are set to explode, and when deficits explode, \nthe corresponding debt total goes right along with it.\n  This is our debt. This is the gross Federal debt, and the gross \nFederal debt is exactly a function of how much we borrow every year. \nThe annual deficit is the shortfall between revenue and spending, and \nwe make up the shortfall by going out and borrowing, and that adds to \nthe borrowing from previous years, and the total is our debt.\n  If we go back to 1980, it was practically zero. The gross Federal \ndebt was a very modest number. Now it is about $18 trillion, and it is \nset to just continue rising. This is totally unsustainable. No country \nhas been able to rack up debt on this scale and have it end well. It \ndoesn't end well.\n  My point this afternoon is really a simple one. We have a choice \nbefore us. We are up against the debt limit, and the President says: \nJust give me more debt, and I don't even want to have a conversation \nabout the underlying cause or what we might do differently to solve \nthis issue. At the same time, they are saying: By the way, let's \nincrease the rate at which we rack up this debt by busting the spending \ncaps and abandoning the one element of spending discipline that we \nhave been able to achieve in this town in I don't know how many years.\n\n  I think most Republicans--and I know this Republican Senator--think \nit would be a very bad idea to just rack up even more debt and do \nnothing at all about the underlying cause of it and bust the spending \ncaps without finding some offsetting way to save money in other places.\n  By the way, when President Obama was Senator Obama, he thought it was \na bad idea then too. In 2006, he said:\n\n       The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's \n     debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. Increasing \n     America's debt weakens us domestically and internationally.\n\n  Two years later, then-Senator Obama said in 2008: ``Adding $4 \ntrillion in debt is irresponsible, it's unpatriotic.''\n  Isn't it a little bit ironic that under President Obama we added $8 \ntrillion in debt and now he wants more? He wants more, and as I said \nbefore, his insistence is that we can't even have a discussion about \ndealing with the underlying problems. It is not clear to me why this \nPresident should be one of the only Presidents, if not the only \nPresident, who gets a debt ceiling increase without even having a \nconversation about underlying reforms.\n  In 1984, Gramm-Rudman-Hollings was a major, important budget deal \nthat was done in the context of a debt ceiling increase.\n  In 1990, the Budget Enforcement Act imposed some spending discipline \nin return for a debt ceiling increase.\n  In 1997, we had the Balanced Budget Act, which actually achieved a \nbalanced budget within a short period of time. That came up in the \ncontext of a debt ceiling debate.\n  In 2011, as I mentioned at the beginning of my comments, we \nestablished spending caps because we wanted to do something about the \nunderlying problem at the same time we increased the debt ceiling. \nUnfortunately, as I said, the administration seems unwilling to even \nhave the discussion.\n  There are two charges that I hear from this administration which are \ncompletely untrue, and I want to dispel this. One is this notion that I \nhear all the time, that raising the debt limit merely enables us to pay \nthe bills that have already been incurred. They tell us how \nirresponsible we are for not raising the debt limit. After all, these \nbills have already been incurred. That is nonsense. It is completely \nuntrue. However many times they repeat it doesn't make it true.\n  I can prove it very simply. If we started running balanced budgets \ntomorrow and kept running balanced budgets, we would never need to \nborrow any more money. It is as simple as that. If we didn't spend any \nmore than we took in, we wouldn't need to borrow more money, and we \nwouldn't need to increase the debt limit.\n  The precise reason you need to raise the debt limit is because you \nneed to borrow more money because you intend to spend more than you are \ntaking in. That is what the President is planning. That is what he \nwants to do. That is what his budget calls for. We haven't committed to \nany spending going forward. We don't even have an appropriations bill. \nWe don't have an omnibus. We don't have a CR. We haven't done that yet. \nHow can it be that this is paying for bills that have already been \nincurred? It is not.\n  The second issue is that if we don't raise the debt ceiling by \nNovember 3, it is implied--they don't say it this way--that we will \nhave a devastating and disruptive default in the markets and will not \nbe able to pay our Treasury debts. That is ridiculous. It is never \ngoing to happen.\n\n[[Page S7443]]\n\n  Ninety percent of all the money the government is going to spend \ncomes in the door in the form of taxes. It is the other 10 percent that \nis the shortfall that we have to go out and borrow. Ninety percent of \neverything that the government is going to spend comes in the form of \ntaxes. You know how much goes out in debt service? About 7 percent. For \nevery $1 of government spending about 7 cents is service on our debt at \nthe moment, and 90 cents comes in from taxes. And you are going to \ndefault on the debt? You would have to willfully choose to do that, and \nI don't think even this administration would do that.\n  I will conclude by saying that I hate the idea of raising the debt \nceiling because we already have too much debt, but I understand that it \nwould be very difficult and not realistic to get from where we are to a \nbalanced budget overnight. I get that. So I would be willing to raise \nthe debt ceiling, and I think the obvious thing to do here is to tie it \nto some structural reforms, even if they are just modest reforms. I \nknow the President is not willing to consider the kind of architectural \nchanges to the entitlement programs that it will take to actually solve \nthe problem, but could we at least make progress on the problem? Could \nwe at least go after the low-hanging fruit?\n  There are dozens of reforms that would at least modestly improve this \nfiscal imbalance--the size of these annual deficits. We could have more \nmeans testing of Medicare. In other words, very wealthy Americans could \ncontribute more to the cost of their Medicare. We could save tens of \nbillions of dollars a year if we did that.\n  We could reduce some of the subsidies that go to big corporations, \nincluding big agricultural corporations. We spend many tens of billions \nof dollars a year on corporate welfare. Why don't we wipe that out?\n  We have green energy research, which is another way of forcing \nAmericans to pay for inefficient production of electricity. We spend \n$18 billion over the next several years on that.\n  Medical malpractice liability reform would save the Federal \nGovernment $50 billion a year. These are not my numbers. This is \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Maybe we could reduce the size of the Federal workforce. Between the \nDepartments of Energy, Agriculture, and Commerce, we have 163,000 \nemployees. How much energy do they produce? How many crops do they \ngrow? How much commerce do they really generate? I think we could \nprobably do with a few less. There are hundreds of billions of dollars \nthat could be saved.\n  We could slow down the growth of the entitlement programs for future \nbeneficiaries. These would be reasonable things. Many of these \nsuggestions have had some level of support by the President at one time \nor another. I am not looking for something radical. I am looking to \nmake some progress. But I think it is completely unreasonable for the \nPresident to insist that he simply have the opportunity to saddle us, \nour kids, and our grandkids with even more debt without even addressing \nthe underlying problem that is causing us to rack up this debt in the \nfirst place.\n  I will have more to say about this next week. I think this will not \nget resolved between now and then. When it does get resolved, one way \nor another, I hope we will find offsets to any spending increase that \nwe incur relative to the levels we have agreed upon in the spending \ncaps of the 2011 agreement. If the debt ceiling increase occurs, I hope \nit will occur in the context of some improvement to the underlying \nsituation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                            Social Security\n\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about some \ndisappointing news. For only the third time in 40 years, Social \nSecurity beneficiaries will not receive a cost-of-living adjustment, or \nCOLA, this year. This news will impact the nearly 60 million American \nretirees, dependent survivors, and disabled workers who rely on Social \nSecurity to make ends meet.\n  Social Security is the most effective anti-poverty program in U.S. \nhistory. Without Social Security, about 44.1 percent of America's \nseniors would be living in poverty.\n  In Hawaii, one in six residents depends on Social Security to help \npay their bills and keep a roof over their heads. It is the only source \nof income for 25 percent of our seniors in Hawaii.\n  We live in a world where wages just aren't rising fast enough, and \nreal pensions are disappearing. More and more workers are working \nlonger and harder with less to show for it when they retire.\n  According to a 2014 Federal Reserve study, nearly 1 in 37 respondents \nreported having no retirement savings or pensions whatsoever, pointing \nout once again that Social Security benefits are essential to millions \nof working Americans and retirees.\n  For many who are already struggling to make ends meet, Social \nSecurity is all they can rely on. Absent a COLA, too many beneficiaries \nwill see no increase in their primary source of income, making it \nharder to afford basic necessities, especially medical care.\n  One of my constituents from Wahiawa wrote to me recently and said:\n\n       I find it incredible that there are people who actually \n     believe that Social Security is too generous. The average \n     Social Security benefit is a whopping $14,000 a year and \n     we've only seen an average 2 percent COLA over the past five \n     years. I can assure you my health care costs have far \n     exceeded that tiny increase.\n\n  Another constituent from Honoka'a was more direct in her concerns. \nShe wrote:\n\n       I have worked very hard my entire life and have planned to \n     retire in a few years. My worry is that I will not have \n     enough money to live. I also may have to continue to work due \n     to this deficit. My question is what are you going to do \n     about it and what is your game plan? Year after year no one \n     has done anything about it and has passed it down to the next \n     person entering the Senate office or Congressional office. It \n     is a problem that must be addressed immediately. Please help \n     me and the rest of my baby boomer generation.\n\n  Congress needs to listen to these voices and act to responsibly \nstrengthen and expand Social Security before it becomes yet another \nfiscal crisis.\n  That is why I introduced the Protecting and Preserving Social \nSecurity Act with Representative Deutch of Florida. Our bill does two \nkey things that will help seniors now as well as help to ensure the \nstrength of Social Security for decades to come.\n  First, our bill would help Social Security recipients by having basic \nCOLAs on a more accurate formula of what seniors actually purchase. \nThis formula is called the Consumer Price Index for the Elderly, or \nCPI-E. The CPI-E more accurately recognizes the rising costs for \nseniors and gives them a benefit boost.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, if we were using the \nCPI-E right now, seniors would be getting a 0.6 percent COLA increase \nin 2016. That is about $100 more in benefits for the average person on \nSocial Security next year. And while small, seniors tell me that every \nbit counts. Changing to the CPI-E will mean increases in Social \nSecurity benefits to more accurately reflect the rising costs that our \nseniors experience.\n  Second, our bill will pay for this benefit increase by requiring \nmillionaires and billionaires to pay the same rate into the Social \nSecurity trust fund that everybody else pays. Few know that this year, \nonce workers earned above $118,500, they stopped paying the payroll tax \nto support Social Security. In other words, Social Security \ncontributions are capped for these high-wage earners.\n  But most workers, as we know, earn far less than $118,500. So with \nevery paycheck, all year, most workers pay into Social Security. This \nis not fair. It is not fair that millionaires and billionaires get a \nSocial Security tax loophole.\n  A corporate CEO could earn $118,500 in just one pay period and not \ncontribute a single additional cent in payroll taxes for the rest of \nthat year.\n  Our bill would gradually phase out the cap on payments into the \nSocial Security trust fund over 7 years. That way, whether you earn \n$50,000 or $500 million a year, you keep paying at a fair rate to \nsupport Social Security in every paycheck all year long.\n  The Protecting and Preserving Social Security Act is a fair way to \nstrengthen Social Security for decades to come, and it would give \ncurrent seniors and beneficiaries a much-needed boost right away.\n  Social Security is one of the cornerstones of the middle class and \nthe lifeline for millions of seniors. We must do\n\n[[Page S7444]]\n\nall we can to protect and improve it for not just the current \nrecipients but for those who will rely upon it in the future.\n  This bill is supported by groups such as Social Security Works, the \nStrengthen Social Security Coalition, and the National Committee to \nPreserve Social Security and Medicare.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in letting seniors in Hawaii and all \nacross the country know that you are on their side by cosponsoring the \nProtecting and Preserving Social Security Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                          9/11 Health Program\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, two days ago another victim of the \nSeptember 11 attacks died in New York. He is the eleventh first \nresponder to die since this year's anniversary of the attacks.\n  His name was Sergeant Gerard Beyrodt. He served for decades in the \nNew York Police Department. His entire career was devoted to serving \nhis community and keeping the people around him safe, and when we were \nattacked on September 11, 2011, Sergeant Beyrodt didn't waver. He \nbanded together with thousands of first responders from around the \ncountry--from every single State--and he rushed to Ground Zero to help.\n  These heroic men and women ran into the burning towers to try to save \nanyone they could. When the Twin Towers collapsed, our first responders \nworked day and night to clear the pile, breathing in toxic, poisonous \nfumes the entire time. These men and women were heroes. They refused to \nabandon their community in a time of terrifying confusion and intense \ngrief.\n  But now, because of the poisonous fumes they were exposed to at \nGround Zero, the burning metal and the toxic smoke, these men and women \nare sick. Many of them have cancer, and many are dying, and far too \nmany have already died.\n  More than 14 years later, the terror attacks on September 11, 2001, \nare still claiming American lives. In the 6 weeks since the most recent \nanniversary of the attacks, we have lost 11 more responders to diseases \nthat can be traced directly back to the work at Ground Zero.\n  I wish to take a moment to actually speak their names now: John P. \nMcKee, Reginald Umpthery, Kevin Kelly, Thomas Zayas, Paul McCabe, Ed \nGoller, Joseph Fugel, Ronald Richards, John Cedo, Dennis Needles, and \nGerard Beyrodt.\n  The death toll is not going to stop rising. So what is Congress \nwaiting for?\n  The bill authorizing funding for the \n9/11 health program has already expired. It has expired. But these 9/\n11-related illnesses never expire. Neither should their health care. \nMore than 33,000 first responders and survivors have an illness or \ninjury caused by the 9/11 attacks or their aftermath. More than 1,700 \nhave passed away from 9/11-related illnesses. More police officers have \ndied from 9/11-related diseases than those who died on 9/11 itself.\n  The participants in the 9/11 health program live in every single \nState. Every Senator in this Chamber has constituents who are sick and \nare registered in the 9/11 health program.\n  The first responders we have lost leave behind families, spouses, and \nchildren. They leave behind bills, mortgages, car payments, and college \ntuition payments. These 9/11 illnesses not only rob families of their \nloved ones but leave them to face expenses without, in many cases, \ntheir family's primary bread winner.\n  If Congress doesn't act now, how many more first responders and their \nfamilies are going to suffer because we didn't do our job and \nreauthorize the program?\n  On the most recent anniversary of the attacks, many of my colleagues \nhere released statements and made posts online to commemorate the \nanniversary and remember the victims of \n9/11. Well, if you are a Senator and that is all you are doing--if all \nyou are doing is just talking about the heroism, the courage, and what \nhappened on 9/11--then we are not actually doing our jobs. If we are \nSenators and all we are doing is tweeting about 9/11 and the \nresponders, then we are not fully fulfilling our duty as Senators.\n  There is a bill right here, right now, waiting for a vote. The \nmajority of this Chamber already supports the bill as cosponsors. It is \nwidely bipartisan, and not one person is opposed to it. So what are we \nwaiting for? We must reauthorize and make permanent the World Trade \nCenter Health Program and the Victim Compensation Fund. We must finish \nour job.\n  Let's truly never forget. Our 9/11 heroes deserve and desperately \nneed this health care. So let's do our job. Let's vote on this bill. \nLet's pass it. The clock is ticking.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Export-Import Bank\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nExport-Import Bank and to encourage my colleagues in the Senate to take \nup and pass bipartisan legislation scheduled for consideration in the \nHouse next week that would reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank until September \n30, 2019.\n  The Export-Import Bank helps American companies export their goods \nand services across the globe, helping businesses grow and creating \nmore demand for American manufactured goods and agricultural products. \nOver its 80-year history, the Ex-Im Bank has provided loans to help \nbusinesses start exporting, open new markets, and access new customers. \nThe Bank provides insurance to help businesses protect their bottom \nlines if a foreign buyer fails to pay and works with private lenders to \nfill gaps in financing that helps close deals that simply would never \nhappen without its support. Most importantly, the Ex-Im Bank does all \nof this at no cost to the taxpayers. In fact, it makes money. Just last \nyear, the Bank generated a $675 million surplus to help reduce the \ndeficit.\n  The Ex-Im Bank helps level the playing field for American companies \nin a tough global market. Last year it supported more than $27.4 \nbillion in U.S. exports and 164,000 jobs. More than $10 billion of that \ntotal--nearly 40 percent--represented exports by small businesses. The \nEx-Im Bank is dedicated to serving small businesses in Michigan and \nacross the country. Ninety percent of its overall transactions directly \nsupported small businesses, including many that served suppliers for \nlarge companies.\n  In 2013, I was proud to attend the opening of Ex-Im Bank's regional \nexport finance center in Detroit with Governor Snyder and my colleague \nSenator Stabenow and Congressman John Dingell. In Michigan alone, the \nBank has supported 229 exporter businesses selling $11 billion worth of \ngoods to places such as Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and Canada. This support \nis particularly important for our manufacturing industry, including \nmotor vehicles and parts, machinery and chemicals--all vital sectors to \nour economy.\n  Over the summer, I had the opportunity to visit a Michigan business, \nMill Steel Company in Grand Rapids, which works with the Ex-Im Bank to \nexport its products. Mill Steel is one of North America's premier flat-\nrolled steel companies. It is also a family-owned business that wanted \nto make Michigan products and hire Michigan workers. Mill Steel sells \nand ships its steel to auto suppliers in Mexico and Canada. The loan \nguarantees provided by the Ex-Im Bank reduce Mill Steel's risk when \nexporting to foreign buyers, providing certainty and allowing them to \ncontinue hiring new employees and providing good-paying jobs in \nMichigan.\n  Unfortunately, over the summer, despite bipartisan support for \nreauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank, a small, ideologically driven minority in \nCongress allowed the charter for the Export-Import Bank of the United \nStates to expire, risking billions of dollars in exports, hundreds of \nthousands of American jobs, and putting our country at an economic \ndisadvantage in a competitive global marketplace while also increasing \nthe Federal deficit. The failure of Congress to act on this commonsense \nFederal program endangers jobs in Michigan and is simply unacceptable. \nGeneral Electric has a plant in Michigan that employees 1,400\n\n[[Page S7445]]\n\nMichiganians. Over the summer, GE announced that it plans to relocate \nover 300 jobs from Wisconsin to Canada as a result of the Ex-Im Bank \nclosing its doors. When this happened, my office was flooded with \ninquiries from a number of constituents concerned about what would \nhappen to their communities and their own job security if a similar \ndecision was made in Michigan. In the months since Ex-Im Bank's \nauthorization has lapsed, GE has signed deals with export credit \nagencies in competitor foreign nations, creating jobs abroad instead of \nright here in the United States.\n  As a Senator from a State with world-class engineering and \nmanufacturing talent, I am frankly appalled by these developments, \nespecially when we have already seen the benefits that the Bank has \nproduced for Michigan's economy and workers in my State as well as \nacross the country.\n  The work done by the Ex-Im Bank is especially critical to Michigan \nmanufacturers who fight to compete with countries using extreme and \nunfair measures such as direct subsidies or currency manipulation to \nboost their own manufacturing sectors. According to Ex-Im Bank's most \nrecent annual report, there are 85 other competing foreign-sponsored \nexport credit agencies helping their own domestic companies better \ncompete on the global stage. Other countries, including China, Japan, \nSouth Korea, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany, use their own \nexport credit agencies to boost their country's exports.\n  China, in fact, provided more financing through its export credit \nagency in the last 2 years--approximately $670 billion--than our own \nEx-Im Bank has offered in its entire 81-year history. These export \nfinancings are expected to significantly increase in coming years, \nwhich means that American firms and workers could fall further behind \nif we do not act now.\n  Without our own Export-Import Bank, American businesses will struggle \nto compete overseas and our economy will suffer. As global competition \nintensifies, it simply makes no sense to engage in unilateral \ndisarmament. We must stop the self-inflicted wounds on our economy. We \nmust pledge to our constituents that we will first do no harm, and we \nmust stop letting ideology impair our economic growth.\n  I am pleased that a bipartisan, bicameral group of Senators and \nRepresentatives are saying that enough is enough, and are working to \nmove a reauthorization forward. I am looking forward to working with \nthem to get this done as soon as possible. Too much time has already \nbeen wasted, and too many jobs have already been jeopardized. We have \nto get back to the business of working together to find commonsense \nsolutions to help, not hamper, our economic growth in America. Passing \na long-term reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank is a great way to \nstart.\n  Once the House passes the reauthorization next week, I urge my \ncolleagues in the Senate to schedule a vote as soon as possible. We \nknow we have the votes. The legislation the House will soon consider is \nidentical to an amendment passed by the Senate with a vote of 64 to 29 \nin July while considering the long-term highway bill. We should do this \nnow because there is not a moment to lose. American jobs hang in the \nbalance.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are apparently pressing another deadline \nwith regard to the statutory debt limit. I am reminded of the old \nparadoxical proverb: ``The more things change, the more they stay the \nsame.''\n  We have dealt with the debt limit here in Congress on numerous \noccasions, and while there are significant differences this time \naround, there are some things that just don't change, particularly when \nwe are dealing with the Obama administration.\n  One thing that is different is that our national debt is higher than \nit has ever been before, more than $18 trillion--an astronomical \nnumber, when you think about it. That is $57,000 of debt for every U.S. \ncitizen--every man, woman, and child from age 1 to 101. Just for the \npeople in my State of Utah, which has a relatively small population, \nthat means $167 billion of debt.\n  As a share of our GDP, the debt is higher now than at almost any time \nwith the exception of a brief period surrounding World War II. Yet, \neven though our debt has gotten further and further out of hand under \nthis President, the administration's approach has not changed. As we \nall know, Treasury Secretary Lew recently sent a series of letters \nurging Congress to raise the debt limit. In his latest communication, \nhe projected that on November 3, the Treasury will begin to run \ndangerously low on cash, creating an unacceptably high risk of having \nto delay payments.\n  Of course, we don't have an ability to verify that projection. \nTreasury has long been uncooperative in Congress's efforts to get more \ninformation as to how they arrive at those specific dates. Don't get me \nwrong, I take the November 3 date very seriously. I think we all \nshould, but given the lack of hard data shared by the Treasury \nregarding those projections and the fact that the date has in just the \nlast few weeks moved around a little bit, I do understand why some \npeople appear to believe this latest best guess from the Treasury is \nfungible.\n  In addition to providing the November 3 deadline, the latest debt \nlimit letter from Secretary Lew includes what has become a stale set of \ntalking points punctuated by the admonition that ``only Congress can \nextend the nation's borrowing authority.'' I know no one wants to hear \na civics lesson, but given the administration's repeated attempts to \nassign all responsibility relating to the debt limit to Congress, it \nmeans that a short refresher about how a bill becomes law might be \nhelpful.\n  No one disputes that Congress must act to extend the government's \nborrowing authority, but the President can also sign or veto any debt \nlimit legislation we pass. The same is true of any legislation \nauthorizing or appropriating spending increases or reductions. Congress \nwrites and passes. The President signs legislation into law, and \nhopefully he does his best to enforce it. In other words, both Congress \nand the executive branch share responsibility with regard to the debt \nlimit and our Nation's overall fiscal health. Unfortunately, rather \nthan trying to work with Congress on these issues, the Obama \nadministration has repeatedly chosen to try to deflect responsibility \nwith misleading statements about the various burdens borne by the \nseparate branches of government.\n  Sadly, the Treasury Secretary's tired arguments with regard to the \ndebt limit are not the only problem. In fact, when you examine this \nadministration's record, you will find that the problems are much worse \nthan most want to admit. I am talking, of course, about the massive \naccumulation of debt we have seen under this administration, as well as \nthe lack of leadership and willingness to work with Congress to address \nwhat we know are the main drivers of our debt.\n  As the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has repeatedly made \nclear, the main drivers of our debt are unsustainable promises in the \nSocial Security benefit programs and unsustainable spending on the \nFederal Government's major health care programs, Medicare, Medicaid, \nhealth insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, and others.\n  True enough, we have seen some deficit reduction in recent years. \nThese days, the President and his allies are always quick to point that \nout. Of course, we know that these temporary reduced deficits have \nresulted predominately from increased tax receipts and only modest \nspending restraint. Still, even with these reduced deficits, our\n\n[[Page S7446]]\n\ndebt remains well above the historic average and is expected to grow \neven more in the near future as, according to CBO, our deficits will \nstart to go back up in the next few years.\n  Our deficit this next year has been brought down but I would have to \nsay mainly because of the work that we have done in the Congress to \nrestrain the growth, the reconciliation act. Had we not done that, this \nadministration would not have done anything. We would be in worse shape \nthan we are.\n  Simply put, no one in this administration should be bragging about \nsupposed fiscal responsibility. Under this administration, the \noutstanding public debt has risen by more than an astounding $7.5 \ntrillion, a 71-percent increase just since this person has become \nPresident. Once again, as a share of the economy, our current debt \nremains at levels that, with a very narrow and understandable \nexception, are heretofore unseen in modern U.S. history.\n  According to CBO, by 2025, Federal debt felt by the public will be \nroughly twice the average of the past 5 decades. As CBO says, ``Such \nhigh and rising debt would have serious negative consequences both for \nthe economy and for the Federal budget.'' Given this risky path of debt \naccumulation, CBO also warns on increasing risks of a Federal fiscal \ncrisis. Unfortunately, those dire warnings have been ignored by this \nadministration. Instead, the administration seems to believe that a \ntemporary lull in deficits is a good time to accelerate spending, even \nthough spending grew well above growth in the economy last fiscal year, \nall while they continued to ignore the growing crisis in our \nentitlement programs.\n  We still have approximately one-half trillion dollars of debt. They \nare bragging about that. When he was serving in the Senate and a \ndifferent party controlled the White House, President Obama famously \nargued that an increase in the debt limit was a sign of leadership \nfailure. Now his definition of leadership is to assign all \nresponsibility to Congress for the debt limit.\n  When he was running as then-Presidential candidate Obama, he pledged \nnot to kick the can down the road on reforming entitlements, \nparticularly Social Security. Now, he shirks responsibility and his \nproposed solution to the most immediate problem with Social Security--\nthe Disability Insurance Trust Fund--is to kick the can much further \ndown the road without any changes or reforms to the program. We are \njust going to borrow from the already dysfunctional general Social \nSecurity fund to pay for Social Security disability insurance. My gosh, \nwhen does it stop?\n  I believe that the debt limit has and can play a role in promoting \nfiscal discipline. Historically, debates over the debt limit have \nprovided opportunities to reexamine our fiscal outlook and, where \nnecessary, make corrections. Debt limit votes give a voice to Members \nof Congress who do not serve on committees that make the spending and \ntax decisions.\n  Unfortunately, as we contemplate another debt limit increase, \nPresident Obama does not see the need to even talk to Congress about \nour fiscal future. In fact, the administration won't even take a clear \nposition on how much of an increase it believes is appropriate or how \nlong it should last.\n  Common sense would indicate that the President would like Congress to \nextend the debt limit past next year's election. That would be a debt \nlimit hike of about $1 trillion, and $1 trillion would mean more than \n$3,000 per person in the United States just to get us through next \nyear. Utah's share of that would be about $9 billion. Yet while the \nPresident undoubtedly wants at least that much of an increase, he \nrefuses to make any such desire known.\n  Instead, we have gotten vague demands that borrowing authority be \nextended by certain dates and threats to veto any such extension that \ncomes with even modest spending reforms. Essentially, President Obama's \nposition is it's my way or the highway, but oddly enough, he does not \nwant to explicitly define what his way is, and he repeatedly argues \nthat he plays absolutely no role and bears no responsibility in getting \nus there. It is absurd, absolutely absurd.\n  Make no mistake, I don't want to see a default. Default on U.S. \nTreasury securities and failure to pay Federal obligations, which, by \nthe way, are two separate things, is not a desirable or acceptable \noutcome. Ultimately, I don't believe Congress should shirk its \nresponsibilities, even if President Obama refuses to acknowledge his.\n  Let's be clear. Neither the administration's uncompromising stance on \nfiscal reforms nor its selective use of information about our Nation's \ndebt are productive. The President's refusal to work with Congress on a \npath forward and to share information about our Nation's finances is \nirresponsible brinksmanship. I want to talk about that information \nsharing for a few minutes because it is an important part of this \ncontinual impasse between Congress and the administration when it comes \nto the debt limit.\n  When we talk about our Nation's debt, there are other policy matters \nin play besides the periodic actions taken to raise the debt limit. The \nadministration is charged with managing the debt in a responsible and \neffective manner. Toward that end, it has the obligation to preserve \nthe integrity of Treasury securities markets. Congress has the duty to \nexercise oversight of these activities. As chairman of the Senate \ncommittee with jurisdiction over these issues, I have to say that when \nit comes to accountability and transparency on these matters, a great \ndeal of improvement is necessary. That is putting it kindly.\n  For example, each time the debt begins to approach the statutory \nlimit, the administration makes a lot of noise about how it is \ndifficult to deal with delayed payments on Treasury securities. Please \nnote that I am talking about payments on securities, not general \npayment obligations of the Federal Government for spending programs, \nwhich is all together a separate matter. A number of scenarios could \ngive rise to delayed payments on Treasury securities.\n  One of those scenarios is a debt limit impasse between Congress and \nthe administration, but there are others, including weather events, \ncyber or terrorist attacks, or any number of known risks, that \nresponsible debt managers must take into account. We know for a fact \nthat the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve have developed \ncontingency plans for these types of risks.\n  The existence of such plans has been made public in minutes of the \nFederal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee and in minutes of \nmeetings involving Fed and Treasury officials and representatives of \nlarge financial firms. However, the administration has flat out--flat \nout--refused to share those contingency plans with Congress or to even \nopenly acknowledge their existence.\n  I have been the lead Republican on the Senate Finance Committee since \nJanuary 2011. I have been asking to see those plans since the summer of \n2011. Over more than 4 years and through multiple requests for \ninformation, I have been told a number of things, usually stories that \nend with the claim that, even though plans have been discussed, nothing \nhas ever been formalized.\n  So there are really only two plausible conclusions to be drawn: \nEither the administration is being dishonest with Congress and they \nhave contingency plans in place, or the administration is being \nirresponsible by failing to account for the obvious potential risks. \nApparently, they are comfortable with Congress, not to mention the \nAmerican people, reaching either one of those conclusions if it means \nthey don't have to share more information.\n  Simply stated, there is no reason for Treasury and the Fed, along \nwith large financial firms participating in the Treasury securities \nmarkets, to formulate contingency plans for these markets without \nreporting them to Congress or sharing them with the Senate Finance \nCommittee--no reason whatsoever. Yet here we are. Sadly, this lack of \ntransparency does not end with obviously needed contingency plans. As I \nalluded to earlier, Treasury also shares very little information with \nCongress concerning cash forecasts, particularly as we approach the \ndebt limit. I have asked for detailed, contemporaneous updates of cost \nforecasts in order to, among other things, properly verify Treasury's \ndebt limit projections. In response, Treasury officials have told me \nthat those projections are ``highly market sensitive'' and, at times, \ncannot be shared with Congress. Yet I have\n\n[[Page S7447]]\n\nto assume that a number of officials at Treasury and probably the Fed \nhave access to this sensitive data.\n  I am not aware of any special security clearance assigned to these \nindividuals. It is evidently the position of the administration that \nthere are times where it is neither Congress's nor the American \npeople's business to know how much cash Treasury expects to have in the \nFederal till. This needs to change. Given my oversight responsibilities \nas chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I am always interested in \npreserving the integrity and efficiency of markets for Treasury \nsecurities.\n  Unfortunately, under our laws, regulatory and oversight authority \nwith respect to those markets spreads far and wide with \nresponsibilities spanning across the Treasury, the Fed, the Securities \nand Exchange Commission, the Commodities Future Trading Commission, and \nan alphabet soup of other groups. As we saw with the most recent \nfinancial crisis, this type of balkanization of authority inevitably \nleads to ineffective oversight and regulation.\n  When problems arise, all the various parties point their fingers at \neach other. Everyone has authority, yet no one ends up being \naccountable.\n  Unfortunately, the so-called Dodd-Frank legislation did not fix any \nof these problems. In fact, I would argue, all it did was give existing \nregulators yet more authority and of course added a few more acronyms \ninto the mix.\n  All of this is relevant to current discussion about the debt limit \nbecause it speaks to the overall management of our Nation's debt and \nthe lack of transparency among all these agencies. I can cite numerous \nexamples where a lack of communication and accountability has been \nproblematic. For now, I will briefly mention three such instances.\n  First, in 2013, Treasury began auctioning something called a \n``floating rate note,'' the first new Treasury security since inflation \nprotection securities were introduced more than 15 years ago. This was \na significant debt management decision. Yet very little information was \nshared with the Senate Finance Committee, even though Treasury had many \ndiscussions about the new note with representatives from large \nfinancial firms.\n  Second, Treasury recently decided again--after several meetings with \nlarge banks--that an average cash balance for the Federal Government of \naround $50 billion per day was too low and that going forward the \nbalance would need to be $150 billion or more. Once again, prior to \nthat decision being finalized, there was no communication from Treasury \nto the Senate Finance Committee.\n  Third, on one particular day in October of 2014, there were unusual \nand difficult-to-explain events in markets for Treasury securities. \nWhile all the various regulators and interest groups have issued staff \nreports and have held meetings and seminars relating to the apparent \nvolatility demonstrated by these events, I am not aware of any outreach \nor information sharing with the members or staff of the Senate Finance \nCommittee.\n  Again, these are just three examples. There are certainly others, and \nall of them demonstrate that this administration is far too often \nunwilling to even provide simple updates about its debt management \npolicies--all while insisting that Congress repeatedly raise the debt \nlimit without asking questions or attaching reforms. This also needs to \nchange. If the administration is going to continue to demand that \nCongress act to increase the debt limit, then it should, at the very \nleast, be more forthcoming about its policies and decisionmaking when \nit comes to managing our debt.\n  While I agree we cannot and should not risk defaulting on our debt or \nobligations, it is essential that Congress receives a complete picture \nfrom the administration about its debt management policies. Therefore, \nI want to make clear to Treasury--and other agencies with \nresponsibilities in this area--that there is an imminent need for \nimproved communication and increased transparency on these matters.\n  As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I intend to do all I can \nto ensure greater accountability. That may include more hearings with \nofficials brought before the committee or legislation to require more \ninformation flows between the administration and Congress. Ultimately, \nwhat specific actions we take will depend on the administration's \nability to cooperate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, as we speak--as I am speaking on the floor \nof the Senate--in an act of stunning partisan politics, President \nObama, the Commander in Chief of the U.S. Armed Forces, has decided he \nwill veto the National Defense Authorization Act. He is choosing to \nhold our military hostage for a domestic political agenda, and he is \ndoing so at a time when the crises we face around the world have never \nbeen greater, when U.S. leadership has never been weaker, and when our \nmen and women in uniform need vital resources to defend and secure the \nNation.\n  As I said, in an act of stunning partisan politics, President Obama, \nthe Commander in Chief, has decided he will veto the national defense \nauthorization bill, and he is right now in the act of doing so--holding \nour military hostage for his domestic political agenda.\n  I have been in the Senate and the House for a long time. I have never \nseen an act of blatant partisanship with disregard for the men and \nwomen who are serving in the military than what the President is doing \nas we speak. For 53 years, Congress has fulfilled its constitutional \nduty to provide for the common defense by passing the National Defense \nAuthorization Act. For 53 consecutive years, both bodies have passed, \nand the President has signed into law, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act. In all my years, I have never witnessed anything so \nmisguided, cynical, and downright dangerous as vetoing the Defense \nauthorization for reasons that have nothing to do with defense--nothing \nto do with defense.\n  Presidents throughout history--Republicans and Democrats alike--have \nrecognized the importance of this bill to our national defense. In the \nmore than 50 years since Congress has passed an NDAA, a National \nDefense Authorization Act, the President of the United States has only \nvetoed the act four times. In each case, the President objected to an \nactual provision in the bill, and each time the Congress was able to \nfind a compromise that earned the President's signature.\n  Let's be clear. The President's veto of this year's bill is not over \nany of its policies, it is over politics. In the President's case, \npolitics has taken precedence over policies, and when we are talking \nabout the lives of the men and women who are serving this Nation in \nuniform--disgraceful. For the first time in history, the Commander in \nChief will sacrifice national security for his larger domestic \npolitical agenda.\n  This veto will not resolve the spending debate; it will not stop \nsequestration. That is something that can only be done through the \nappropriations process, not a defense authorization bill.\n  Our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines have answered the call to \nprotect our Nation. They want and need support. They don't care what \nbudget category that support comes from. I wish to point out we \nauthorized exactly the amount of money the President requested.\n  This is a Washington game. All the men and women who are serving in \nthe military care about is that their mission is fully resourced. With \nthis veto, their mission will not be fully resourced. We will put their \nlives in greater danger because of this political game of the \nPresident--holding the military men and women hostage for his agenda to \nfund the IRS and the EPA.\n  The legislation the President vetoed today authorizes the overall \namount for defense that he requested, every single dollar of it.\n  By making clear that he will ``not fix defense without fixing non-\ndefense\n\n[[Page S7448]]\n\nspending,'' the President of the United States puts defense and the men \nand women in the military on the same level as the IRS. The President \nis using our military--using our military--as leverage to fight a \nbattle that the Defense authorization bill cannot accomplish.\n  At a time of mounting threats around the world, it is disgraceful. It \nis disgraceful the President would refuse to authorize for our troops \nthe resources they need to prepare for and engage in vital missions \naround the world and that deliver some of the most significant reforms \nto the Pentagon in more than 30 years.\n  By vetoing this legislation, the Defense authorization bill, let's be \nclear what the President is saying no to. He is saying no to pay \nincreases and more than 30 types of bonuses and special pays for \nservicemembers, saying no to more portability of military health plans \nand greater access to urgent care facilities for troops and their \nfamilies, saying no to enhanced protection against military sexual \nassault, saying no to significant reforms to a 70-year-old military \nretirement system that would extend retirement benefits to over 80 \npercent of servicemembers, saying no to the most sweeping reforms to \nour defense acquisition system in nearly 30 years, saying no to a ban \non torture once and for all, saying no to $300 million in lethal \nassistance for the Ukranians to defend themselves against Russian \naggression, and saying no to countless other important provisions that \nare greatly needed to combat the growing threats we see around the \nworld today.\n  Perhaps, most importantly, the President of the United States is \nrefusing to sign a bill at a time when--as our top military commanders \nand national security experts have testified before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee--the world has not seen greater turmoil since the \nend of World War II.\n  So, my friends, here is the context. Thanks to the President's failed \npolicies, the results of leading from behind, the results of a policy \nof ``Don't do stupid stuff,'' we now see a world in a state of \nturmoil--the likes of which we have not seen since the end of World War \nII.\n  On a bipartisan basis, we passed a defense authorization bill that \nhas monumental consequences to the future security of this Nation, the \npresent security of this Nation, and the welfare and ability of the men \nand women who are serving this Nation and their ability to defend this \nNation, and the President--because he wants an increase in domestic \nspending, has vetoed it.\n  Never have I seen such irresponsibility on the part of a Commander in \nChief. There have been Presidents I have disagreed with. There have \nbeen Presidents I have had spirited debates with--but never ever in \nhistory has there been a President of the United States who abrogated \nhis responsibilities, his constitutional responsibilities, as Commander \nin Chief. I say shame on him today, and this is a shameful day.\n  The House will vote to override this veto on November 5. I strongly \nurge my colleagues to reverse this dangerous action and put the \ninterests of our military and national security ahead of politics. Our \nmen and women serving around the world, many still in harm's way, \ndeserve nothing less.\n  I spend a lot of time with the men and women who are serving in the \nmilitary, including members of my own family, and they are not \nuninformed. They are very intelligent. They watch what we do--we, their \nelected representatives. Their voters trust us to defend them, care for \nthem, to give them the weapons they need, the benefits they need, and \nthe care they need when the wounded come back. They rely on us. They \nare going to see, as we watch Vladimir Putin on the march, as we watch \nthe success of ISIS, as we watch Ukraine being dismembered, as we watch \nChina commit more aggression in the South China Sea and fill in \nislands--and now? Now this Commander in Chief decides that this is a \ntime to veto an authorization bill because he doesn't think there is \nenough domestic spending. It is a sad day, a very sad day. It is a sad \nday for America but most of all it is a very sad day for the men and \nwomen with whom we entrust our very lives and our security. It is a sad \nday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, next month our Nation will pause to honor \nthe millions of men and women who have fought for our freedom and \nworked to advance peace around the world.\n  Veterans Day is our annual way to say thank you and to honor those \nwho have sacrificed so much on our behalf. While I would like to stand \non the floor and say our country is doing everything we can for the \npeople we owe the most to, that we are fulfilling the promise we made \nto them when we sent them off to fight for us, unfortunately that is \nnot currently the case because our Nation is falling far short of its \ngoal of honoring our veterans when it comes to VA care.\n  Despite a sweeping bill intended to tackle some of the most pressing \nproblems and give the VA new tools and a change at the top of the VA \nmore than a year ago, I continue to hear from veterans across my home \nState of Washington about care that is inconsistent, outdated, and \noften downright dismissive of individual needs. I have heard from a \nnumber of veterans in my home State of Washington who are waiting on \nsurgeries, MRIs, oncology appointments, mental health screenings--you \nname it--and far too often they say they are told it will be months to \nsee a doctor or a specialist.\n  I bring their stories today, to this ``other Washington,'' to \ncontinue to make clear this kind of outdated, inefficient care is \nunacceptable.\n  This is a pivotal time for our VA, and the demands on the system will \nonly go up as wars continue to wind down and the Vietnam-era veterans \ncontinue to seek more care for the injuries and illnesses they suffer \nfrom. As the daughter of a World War II veteran, I refuse to let \nsubstandard care be the status quo. I won't accept long wait times, \nredtape, and understaffed hospitals as a reality for our veterans. I am \nnot going to stop fighting to make sure we have a system that works no \nmatter how long it takes, no matter how many obstacles we face, and no \nmatter who is in charge at the VA.\n  The law we passed to give veterans more options for care has now had \nan opportunity to go into effect. We can see what is working, what is \nnot, what we can build on, and what we need to tear apart.\n  Last year I supported the inclusion of an independent assessment of \nthe VA health system in the Choice Act, and recently that assessment \nvalidated what we have been telling the VA for years: There is growing \nbureaucracy, and there are problems with leadership and staffing, and \nmassive capital costs. While the independent assessment identified some \nbright spots in the VA system, it also found that care and patient \nexperiences differ widely across the system and that best practices and \nimportant policies are not instituted across the country. That means we \nall have more work to do because we have a responsibility to our \nveterans.\n  Here is what we are up against. The VA still has multiple non-VA care \nprograms, none of which talk to each other, none of which are \ncoordinated. They all have different eligibility criteria, different \nprocedures for patients and providers, and different reimbursement \nrates.\n  I hear frequently from veterans in my home State of Washington about \nhow difficult the Choice Program has been. From VA staff who don't \nunderstand the program, to confusion about eligibility, to getting the \nrunaround from contractors, veterans are sick and tired of having to \nfight just to get an appointment.\n  I hear how frustrating some of the bizarre rules and restrictions on \nChoice are. For example, an authorization for care only lasts 60 days. \nWell, if you are a woman veteran and you are pregnant, you are going to \nneed more than 60 days of care.\n  At the VA, we are still hearing that the wait times are far too high. \nBut with long wait times in the private sector and the burdensome \nprocess to even get into the Choice Program, veterans are finding they \nactually would have gotten care sooner if they had stuck with the VA. \nIf the solution to the wait time problem takes longer than going to the \nVA, it is not working.\n\n[[Page S7449]]\n\n  It is no wonder that veterans and providers alike turn their backs on \nthe VA. The system is so complicated, it is impossible to get good \nhealth care.\n  It is time for the VA to implement one--one--non-VA care program for \nthe future. As we now approach the end of this trial period for the 2-\nyear Choice Program, the VA has to use this opportunity to finally get \nit right on non-VA care. It needs to design a new system that truly \nmeets the needs of our veterans.\n  I believe that system must have five fundamental characteristics:\n  First of all, it has to be veteran-centered, with clear eligibility \nrules so veterans know what they can do and what they can expect and \nwhere they can go for what care and how that system works. It also \nmeans the experience for veterans trying to use the system has to \nimprove. For example, veterans should never be turned away with a \ndismissive ``We are not taking new patients.''\n  Secondly, it has to be easy for our providers, with simple and \nconsistent procedures for them to deliver care, report back to the VA, \nand get reimbursed quickly. The contracting system needs to be simple \nand clear so that private providers can step in where the VA cannot.\n  Third, a new system must provide high-quality care that includes \neffective care coordination, and that requires that electronic medical \nrecords be returned to the VA. That includes oversight of the quality \nof care being delivered in the private sector. We have to know our \nveterans are being appropriately cared for.\n  Fourth, the new system has to be flexible enough to compensate for \nlocal needs, types of care where VA is deficient, or locations where \nthe VA does not have a presence. Whether working with community \nproviders to increase certain specialty appointments or seeing where \nthe VA needs to move resources to hire more VA staff, the system has to \nmaintain flexibility to adjust to new trends and new needs.\n  Finally, it has to be cost-effective for the VA and not shift the \ncost of care onto our veterans. Earlier this year, the VA nearly ran \nout of money, and they threatened to shut down the health care system. \nWell, we should invest whatever we need to to make sure our veterans \nare getting care. The new non-VA care system must be more efficient, \nand the VA needs to be clear with Congress about what it needs. Without \na change, I would not be surprised if next year we don't find ourselves \nin the same position where we have underfunded the VA and need to come \nin and transfer funding to keep the VA operating. I will work with \nanyone and stand behind no one when it comes to getting veterans the \nfunding they need.\n  Perhaps most important, when implementation begins, it simply must be \nbetter than what we saw with the Choice Program. VA staff have to be \ntrained and proficient, and third-party administrators in charge of the \nnetworks of private providers have to be efficient and responsive. \nVeterans deserve a system that works, not one that is torn apart and \nweakened over time.\n  So the answer isn't just to dismantle the VA and leave veterans to \nfend for themselves, as some proposals would do; the solution starts, \nfinally, with a real conversation about what is going on at the VA, \nwhat the problems are, and then pursues an ``all of the above'' \napproach that finally strengthens the VA system, uses community \nproviders to fill in the gaps where the VA cannot get the job done, and \ncontinues to make the best use of other Federal help programs, such as \nDOD and federally qualified health centers--all in an effort to truly \nbuild a veteran-centered VA health care system.\n  I stand ready to work with anyone to do this, and I hope my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me and not make this a \nDemocratic or Republican issue. Veterans issues have never been \npartisan, and, in my mind, there is no place for that when we sit at \nthe table to solve a complicated problem. I hope the administration is \nready to fundamentally reshape this program. I hope bureaucrats who \nspend more time defending the broken system are ready to get to work \nimplementing solutions built around the needs of our veterans. And I \nhope providers--those who work with the VA and DOD and TRICARE, as well \nas those who currently do not provide care to veterans--play a role to \nimprove veteran care.\n  The wars may no longer lead the nightly news, but that doesn't mean \nthe cost of these wars is gone too. Our veterans are still there, they \nstill need health care and services, and we will not forget them.\n  I expect the VA to do better. Our veterans have already sacrificed so \nmuch. They should not have to come back and fight the VA to get the \ncare they have earned. Let's act and let's do something that truly \nhonors our Nation's heroes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Washington \nfor her very thorough and passionate explanation of the problems with \nthe VA. It is time we got it straightened out. We have a new director \nbecause there was a problem. We gave them more money because there was \na problem. We did the Choice Act because there was a problem. I think \nthe VA is kind of fighting the Choice Act because they want to make \nsure they keep it within their own clutches. But it is time that we got \nit straightened out and that we got some action.\n  All of us are getting calls from veterans we should never get. We \ncould go into a variety of them. But I would like to work with the \nSenator, and I appreciate the comments she just made. I thought they \nwere very bipartisan and very much needed.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/senate-section/article/S7449-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7449-S7450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     GROWTH IN FEDERAL REGULATIONS\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, it is often said that there are two \nconstants in life--death and taxes--but I would like to add one more \nfor your consideration: regulations. We often talk about the threat \nthat America's growing debt poses to our economy and to our future, but \nthe growth in Federal regulations also poses a serious threat to our \nNation's long-term job creation and economic growth.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, the potential \ngrowth rate of our economy--or the rate of growth that is possible \ngiven the education of our workers, the quality of capital equipment, \nand the business formation rate--averaged 3.3 percent for the period \nfrom 1950 through 2014. However, CBO expects that annual rate to fall \n2.1 percent in the period of 2015 through 2025. That is a 36-percent \nreduction in the potential growth rate of the economy. Why is this so \ncritical? According to the President's own Office of Management and \nBudget, a 1-percent increase in the economy's growth rate will yield \nmore than $400 billion in new revenues without raising taxes. Yes, that \nis according to the President's own Office of Management and Budget. A \n1-percent increase in the economy's growth rate--we are talking about \nthe private sector, not the government sector; the private sector is \nwhere the revenues come from--would yield more than $400 billion in \nrevenues without raising taxes.\n  We are always talking about the need for more revenues, but we are \ndoing the opposite. The administration is doing the opposite of what it \ntakes to get that growth to happen. When the growth rate falls, when we \ngrow more slowly than we could and aren't meeting our full potential, \ngovernment revenues also fail to keep up with budget projections. If we \nreduce by 1 percent, we lose another $400 billion in revenues. So what \nhappens when the government revenue comes up even shorter in the face \nof growing overspending? That results in more borrowing, and it results \nin bigger overspending and in expanded debt.\n  Senators from the Western States know all too well the economic \neffects of regulations coming out of bureaucracy-bloated agencies such \nas the Environmental Protection Agency. Today I want to focus not just \non the impact of recent regulations on my home State of Wyoming's \neconomy but the drag they are creating on the economy nationwide. And \nat the same time, they are hiring ad agencies at billions of dollars to \nimprove their image. They can improve their image just by doing their \njob without putting more burdens on the American people and eliminating \njobs.\n\n[[Page S7450]]\n\n  The State of Wyoming is the largest coal-producing State in the \nNation. Coal represents almost 40 percent of our share of electricity \ngeneration across the United States. My county provides 40 percent of \nall of the coal in the United States. It is abundant, it is affordable, \nand it is stockpilable. It is the only energy that is stockpilable. \nThis is an energy source which has the potential to power our country \nfor hundreds of years, to support jobs for thousands of people, and \ndoesn't put us at the mercy of unstable regimes overseas, but this \nadministration continues to denigrate and regulate coal out of \nexistence.\n  Since 2012, two EPA rules--the mercury and air toxic standards rule \nand the ozone rule--are estimated to have cost in the tens of billions \nof dollars.\n  Let me talk just about the mercury and air toxic standards. That is \nsupposed to help save, with benefits--without seeing any scientific \nevidence where these benefits come from--over a period of years, maybe \n$500 million. What is the cost? The cost is $73 billion a year. Why \nwould anyone go for that small of a benefit at that big of a cost?\n  We are an inventive country. If we put incentives of just a couple \nbillion dollars out there, people will solve the problem and get those \nbenefits permanently for a very small number, not $43 billion to $73 \nbillion a year. Those two rules don't include the billions of dollars \nlost to thousands more rules imposed by the EPA and other agencies \nevery year.\n  If all those rules weren't onerous enough, in August the EPA doubled \ndown on its war on coal when it released the final rule on the Clean \nPower Plan. With an estimated price tag of at least $366 billion, this \nrule will not only devastate the coal industry by mandating unrealistic \ncarbon reductions, it will also distress American families by causing \ndouble-digit electric rate increases in more than 40 States.\n  The coal industry in Wyoming is feeling the impact. The coal industry \nand businesses and the people who work there and rely on it are facing \nhigher regulatory costs at the same time as energy producers are seeing \na tougher market than they have in years. This is a bad combination for \neconomic growth and job creation. At the end of July, Wyoming had 15 \npercent fewer energy industry jobs than it did a year earlier, and \nthese are good-paying jobs. That is according to the U.S. Department of \nLabor and Bureau of Labor Statistics. Most of those lost jobs are in \ncoal, oil, and gas, and the businesses that rely on them. We forget \nabout that ripple effect. Given that close to half of Wyoming's GDP \ncomes from this sector, and that nearly half of our State is federally \nowned and much is removed from development activity, we have always \nbeen concerned about any unnecessary government intrusion in our \neconomic livelihood.\n  Why do we provide 40 percent of the Nation's coal? It is because it \nis a cleaner coal, lower in sulfur and other chemicals, than any other \nState in the Nation. We ship coal to other coal States so they can mix \nit with their coal to meet the clean air standards. But that is not \ngood enough.\n  The economic impact of the EPA and other Federal regulations is not \njust hurting Wyoming's economy and costing my State jobs. They are a \nmajor reason why the economy nationwide is not operating at its full \npotential for economic growth, and it has been stuck around 2 percent \nsince the beginning of the so-called economic recovery. We are doing it \nto ourselves. Remember, a 1-percent reduction in the gross national \nproduct is $400 billion less in taxes.\n  The onslaught of Federal regulations targeted directly at the coal \nindustry are not just concerns; they are real threats to people's \neconomic livelihood--the ability to support their families, the ability \nto support education in most of these States, and the ability to \nsupport entire communities across the country. With our $18 trillion in \ndebt, we can't afford to accept the notion that we are in what some are \ncalling a new normal of economic anemic growth. We need to help our \neconomy reach its potential, which will help each and every American. \nThis cannot be done if the number and cost of significant Federal \nregulations continues to rise.\n  The Obama administration continues to push Federal regulations, such \nas the waters of the United States rule, which significantly expands \nFederal authority under the Clean Water Act. That rule has been taken \nto three courts already, and in each of those cases, it has been ruled \nillegal.\n  They are still pursuing other avenues. The recent National Labor \nRelations Board rulemaking redefined the meaning of an employer.\n  These regulations, taken by themselves, have the potential to impose \nbillions of dollars in economic costs--on family farms, ranches, and \nparticularly small businesses--which hinder the growth of America's \nentrepreneurial spirit, not to mention the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau. It sounds like a great entity, but in banks alone, \nthey have had to hire twice as many people to do paperwork as they used \nto have to have, just to keep from getting fined by an agency that has \nno control. I tried to get an inspector general to be over the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau. After we got him, he said: You know, I \ndon't have any authority to look at any of this stuff.\n  Where are the fines going?\n  We don't know. We are not allowed to see that.\n  That is because they get their money from the Federal Reserve before \nthe money from the Federal Reserve comes from the U.S. Government. We \nshouldn't have anything as out of control as that.\n  I was meeting with some community bankers. I said: Well, my wife is \nkind of interested in expanding our kitchen in Gillette, and I was \nthinking maybe we ought to get a loan and do that. The house is all \npaid for. I was wondering how long it would take.\n  They said: Well, about 78 days, and then you get 1 week. In case you \ndon't like the deal you made, you can rescind it. I remember the last \ntime we needed to do something in the house before it was paid for. I \nhad to get a second mortgage, and I got it in a matter of a couple of \ndays. They could just write the check so I could go ahead and do it. \nNow it is 78 days plus another week. That is what government \nregulations are doing. That doesn't speed up the economy. There isn't a \ncontractor that can go to work until they get an assurance of being \npaid.\n  Over the next few months and weeks, I am going to share with my \ncolleagues new information from leading economists that shows there is \na real relationship between the growth of regulations and our \nstruggling economy. This is a relationship that is clear to the people \nwho experience the difficulties of complying with more and more \nregulations that make it harder to succeed. I hope that what is clear \nto business owners, to their employees, and to the communities across \nthe country can be understood here in Washington.\n  I will share new statistics and data showing the lost income and jobs \ndue to Federal regulations, the effects of regulation on key \nindustries, the breakdown of how specific Federal agencies are \nimpacting our economy, and the regulatory burden the Federal Government \nhas placed on hard-working Americans in economic sectors in every \nState. It is crucial for lawmakers and hard-working Americans to \nunderstand the true cost of the regulations that are being issued by \nthis administration. Shining a light on these regulations and the \nburden they impose on each and every American is the only way to hold \ngovernment accountable and to begin the process of reining in out-of-\ncontrol agencies so we can halt the flood of regulations choking our \neconomy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, I left for Greece with a \nSenate delegation that included Dick Durbin from Illinois, Amy \nKlobuchar from Minnesota, and Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts. In \nmy capacity as lead Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations \nSubcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation, I was honored \nto head our delegation. We were there to witness firsthand the plight \nof refugees arriving by sea on the island of Lesbos. In Greece and \nlater in Germany, we received indepth\n\n[[Page S7451]]\n\nbriefings on the refugee crisis and Europe's response to it. In Kiev, \nwe conferred with the Ukrainian Prime Minister and President about \ntheir country's struggle to create a stable democracy in the face of \nongoing Russian aggression.\n  Nearly a quarter of a million Syrians have been killed during the \ncurrent conflict in the Middle East. An estimated 8 million Syrians \nhave been displaced internally. Another 4 million have left the \ncountry. They are fleeing hunger, unspeakable violence, and a land that \nno longer offers any hope for their children. They have endured barrel \nbombs, chemical attacks, indiscriminate shelling, the barbarity of \nISIS, and now a military offensive sponsored by Russia and Iran.\n  To reach Europe, these refugees have been preyed upon by traffickers \nand other criminals, some selling refugee children for sex, for \nslavery, or for organs. The refugees have risked drowning at sea and \nsuffocation in locked vans, and they will soon confront the freezing \ntemperatures and snows of winter.\n  While we were traveling, we heard accounts from the refugees of \npaying smugglers thousands of dollars to get on small boats with motors \nthat barely work, boats built for a few but loaded with 40 to 50 \nrefugees. I use the term ``boats'' loosely. What I am talking about are \nrubber rafts that were built to hold maybe 10 to 15 people and were \nloaded with 40 to 50 refugees. The Greek Coast Guard told us that \nrefugees pay exorbitant prices for life preservers that are more like \nthe children's inflatables that you see at swimming pools. When \nrefugees set off from Turkey across the Aegean to Lesbos, they are \ninstructed by the smugglers to puncture their raft with a knife if they \nencounter the Greek Coast Guard so that the Greeks will be forced to \nrescue them.\n  I was profoundly moved by my conversations with refugees from Syria \nand other conflict zones in the Middle East. It is one thing to hear \nabout millions of Syrian refugees fleeing the war; it is something else \nentirely to actually meet and talk with individual refugees, including \nchildren who have been separated from their parents.\n  I was struck by the fact that many of these refugees have endured \nextreme hardship for weeks, if not years. Their future is filled with \nextreme uncertainty. Yet so many of them were filled with optimism and \nhope. In Athens, we met a 6-year-old Afghan boy who had made the trip \nto Greece with his 13-year-old cousin. This boy proudly gave us all \nsticks of gum. In Germany, we met young men from Syria--a former \nEnglish teacher, a Ph.D. student, and an engineer. One young man looked \nahead to a brighter future and said one day he wanted to be the \nPresident of Syria. These refugees were weary and they were anxious, \nbut they were also deeply grateful and hopeful about their future lives \nin a safe, secure Europe.\n  Altogether, we met and talked with a couple dozen refugees. They are \nmen, women, and children who are no different from loved ones in our \nown families and citizens in our own communities. They aspire to the \nvery same things, including a decent life for their children. They told \nus about the desperation and despair they left behind in Syria, Iraq, \nand other conflict areas. Multiply these desperate stories by countless \nthousands of refugees--up to 10,000 entering Europe daily and more than \n1 million so far this year. It adds up to a humanitarian crisis of \nstaggering dimensions.\n  Now, to be sure, Europe is being challenged, but this crisis also \nchallenges the United States and the world. At critical moments in \nhistory, the international community has faced similar challenges: Jews \nseeking refuge from persecution and later genocide in Nazi Germany; \nfamine killing millions in Biafra in the late 1960s; the genocides in \nCambodia, Rwanda, Darfur, and Bosnia. Faced with these crises, the \nworld confronted a stark choice: to turn away or to engage.\n  The United States cannot turn away from the refugee crisis unfolding \nin the Middle East and Europe. On Lesbos last week, we talked with \nGreeks who operate small businesses that depend on tourism, which has \ndried up because of the crisis. They said that the refugees must be \ntheir first priority, that Greeks must help people who are in need.\n  In Athens, we visited a facility for refugee children run by a group \ncalled Praxis. Praxis workers told us about Afghan children being sold \nin Europe as sex slaves for as much as $10,000. Praxis and scores of \nsimilar organizations are doing everything possible, with very limited \nmeans, to meet the refugees' desperate needs.\n  In Germany, we met with officials at the Finance Ministry and the \nChancery, as well as people in and out of government who are rising to \nthe challenge of the refugee crisis. Chancellor Angela Merkel has \ndemonstrated extraordinary moral leadership in addressing this crisis. \nMillions of ordinary German citizens--indeed, people all across \nEurope--have mobilized to meet the needs of the refugees.\n  However, it was clear to me and to the other Senators in our \ndelegation that these noble efforts are not enough. The refugee crisis \nis too big; the scale of human suffering and needs is overwhelming.\n  President Obama has offered to take in 10,000 refugees over the next \nyear. But Germany is taking in as many as 10,000 refugees in a single \nday--day after day, week after week, with no end in sight. My State of \nNew Hampshire has been welcoming to refugees fleeing conflict, as have \nother States. I think people are eager to do more across this country. \nTurkey needs to secure its borders, and it needs to crack down on \nsmugglers and criminal gangs exploiting and trafficking in refugees. \nFrontline countries, including Greece and Italy, need more resources to \nhelp process and register refugees. In fact, the same is true of \nTurkey, Jordan, and Lebanon, which have taken in millions of refugees.\n  As I said, Germany has earned our admiration for its leadership, \noffering to take in as many as 1 million refugees this year. But for \nall its resources, Germany can't do this alone. It is already reaching \na point where its communities can't keep up with the influx.\n  We are confronting the greatest humanitarian crisis of our time. \nEurope is responding. The European Union will use the coming winter \nmonths, when the flow of refugees will slow, to come up with a more \neffective plan to share the burden and address this challenge. However, \nEuropean nations, Turkey, Jordan, and other frontline states, such as \nLebanon, can't meet this challenge alone. The international community \nmust give more generous support to humanitarian efforts by the World \nFood Program and others. By all means, the United States, as leader of \nthe Atlantic Alliance, must play a more robust role in addressing the \nrefugee crisis.\n  I am heartened by the bipartisan bill that is sponsored by Senator \nGraham of South Carolina and Senator Leahy of Vermont, which would \nprovide $1 billion in assistance to meeting the needs of refugees. The \nObama administration has proposed taking in 10,000 Syrian refugees over \nthe next year. That is a start. It is not enough given the scale of \nthis crisis. We have the resources to safely vet and process more \nrefugees for asylum in the United States, even as we need to do so more \nefficiently.\n  As Senator Graham said recently, ``I don't see how you can lead the \nfree world and turn your back on people who are seeking it.'' To turn \naway families fleeing violence, says Senator Graham, is to ``take the \nStatue of Liberty and tear it down . . . because we don't mean it \nanymore.''\n  We also need to deal with the root of the problem, the violence in \nSyria. We must redouble our diplomatic efforts as well as our campaign \nagainst the Islamic State in both Syria and Iraq. Unfortunately, there \nis a new dimension to the chaos and conflict in Syria. In recent weeks, \nRussia has sent combat planes, heavy armor, and military personnel to \nsupport the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Russia is threatening to send \nthousands of so-called volunteer troops to Syria to fight on the \nfrontline.\n  A newly aggressive and reckless Russia is a problem not only in the \nMiddle East but also in Ukraine, where our Senate delegation visited \nafter leaving Greece. The Ukrainians are struggling to fight corruption \nand build a stable democracy. But those efforts have been severely \nundermined by Russian subversion and aggression. President Putin was \nnot content to invade and annex Crimea. He has also sponsored the \nestablishment of Russian-controlled provinces in eastern Ukraine.\n\n[[Page S7452]]\n\nThis conflict in the east of Ukraine is designed by Russia to \ndestabilize democratic Ukraine and to drain its resources.\n  While in Kiev, our delegation met with senior government officials, \nincluding Prime Minister Yatsenyuk and President Petro Poroshenko. We \nwere briefed on Russia's efforts on many fronts to destabilize the \ncountry. We were also briefed on Ukraine's efforts to boost its economy \nand to root out corruption in the country's government and \ninstitutions.\n  The European Union and the United States are standing by Ukraine, and \nthis solidarity is making a difference. It appears to have moderated \nRussia's ambitions, at least for now. The countries of Western Europe \nand the United States have demanded that Russia fully implement the \nMinsk II agreement to contain the conflict, and we heard some \nencouraging signs. Elections in the breakaway provinces--elections that \nmight have led to succession--have been delayed. Russia is redeploying \nlight armor away from the region. But, of course, this is not adequate.\n  Sanctions on Russia must remain in place until President Putin and \nthe rebels he backs fulfill all of their obligations under the Minsk II \nagreement. I left Ukraine with a strong sense that despite living under \nan ever-present threat from Russia, this is a nation that continues to \nstand strong and move forward. It was an honor to personally reaffirm \nto Ukraine's leadership and citizens that the United States is an ally \nand partner and that we strongly support the government's agenda of \nreform and modernization.\n  Our European allies are confronting an array of challenges \nunprecedented since the end of the Second World War: not only the \nrefugee crisis but also rising threats from Russia, economies that \ncontinue to be held back by debt and austerity, and a resurgence of \nnationalistic and nativist political parties. However, our delegation \nwitnessed firsthand a creative and resourceful Europe that is capable \nof meeting these challenges. Europe needs and deserves American support \nand partnership, beginning with a more robust U.S. response to the \nrefugee crisis, which is the greatest humanitarian challenge of our \ntime. I hope we in this Chamber and in Congress will rise in response \nto that challenge to do our part.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the \nIntelligence Committee bill we are currently debating, the \nCybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, or CISA.\n  This Chamber sees its fair share of disagreements, so it is worth \nnoting when there is something we can all agree on, and I think we can \nall agree on the need for congressional action on cyber security. We \nface ever-increasing cyber attacks from sophisticated individuals, \norganized crime syndicates, and foreign regimes. These attacks pose a \nreal threat to our economy and to our national security. It is clear \nthat we must respond to these new threats because the cost of \ncomplacency is too high, but it is critical, in deciding how we protect \nour information networks, that we also continue to protect the \nfundamental privacy rights and civil liberties of Americans. In short, \nthere is a pressing need for meaningful, effective cyber security \nlegislation that balances privacy and security. Unfortunately, as it \nnow stands, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act falls short.\n  Since this legislation was first introduced, I and a number of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle have raised serious concerns \nabout the problems the bill presents for Americans' privacy and for the \neffective operation of our Nation's cyber defense. My colleagues and I \nare not alone. Serious concerns have been raised by technologists and \nsecurity experts, civil society organizations from across the political \nspectrum, and major tech companies, such as Apple, Dropbox, Twitter, \nYelp, salesforce.com, and Mozilla. Neither the Business Software \nAlliance nor the Computer & Communications Industry Association \nsupports CISA as written.\n  In a letter I received from the Department of Homeland Security this \nsummer, the agency--which has a leading role in cyber security for the \nFederal Government--expressed concern about specific aspects of CISA. \nDHS explained that under the bill's approach, ``the complexity--for \nboth government and businesses--and inefficiency of any information \nsharing program will markedly increase.'' The letter explained that \nCISA would do away with important privacy protections and could make it \nharder, not easier, to develop ``a single, comprehensive picture of the \nrange of cyber threats faced daily.''\n  Senator Burr and Senator Feinstein, the bill managers, have worked \nvery hard over the last months to improve various aspects of the bill, \nand their substitute amendment offers a significantly improved version \nof CISA. I really appreciate their efforts, but it is clear to me and \nothers that the improvements did not go far enough. Major concerns \nraised in the letter from DHS and voiced by security experts, privacy \nadvocates, and tech companies still have not been resolved. Let me \nbriefly describe three of them.\n  First, the bill gives companies a free pass to engage in network \nmonitoring and information sharing activities, as well as the operation \nof defensive measures, in response to anything they deem a ``cyber \nsecurity threat,'' no matter how improbable it is that it constitutes a \nrisk of any kind.\n  The term ``cyber security threat'' is really the linchpin of this \nbill. Companies can monitor systems, share cyber threat indicators with \none another or with the government, and deploy defensive measures to \nprotect against any cyber security threats. So the definition of \n``cyber security threat'' is pretty important, and the bill defines \n``cyber security threat'' to include any action that ``may result in an \nunauthorized effort to adversely impact'' cyber security. Under this \ndefinition, companies can take action even if it is unreasonable to \nthink that security might be compromised.\n  This raises serious concerns about the scope of all of the \nauthorities granted by the bill and the privacy implications of those \nauthorities. Security experts and advocates have warned that in this \ncontext, establishing the broadest possible definition of ``cyber \nsecurity threat'' actually threatens to undermine security by \nincreasing the amount of unreliable information shared with the \ngovernment.\n\n  I have written an amendment, which is cosponsored by Senators Leahy, \nWyden, and Durbin, which would set the bar a bit higher, requiring that \na threat be at least ``reasonably likely'' to result in an effort to \nadversely impact security. This standard gives companies plenty of \nflexibility. They don't need to be certain that an incident or event is \nan attack before they share information, but they should have at least \ndetermined that it is a plausible threat.\n  The definition of a cyber security threat isn't the only problematic \nprovision of the bill. This brings me to the second concern that I \nwould like to highlight. The bill provides a blanket authorization that \nallows companies to share information ``notwithstanding any other \nprovision of law.'' As DHS explained this past summer, that statutory \nlanguage ``sweeps away important privacy protections.'' Indeed, it \nmeans that CISA would override all existing privacy laws, from the \nElectronic Communications Privacy Act, ECPA, to HIPAA, a law that \nprotects sensitive health information.\n  Moreover, this blanket authorization applies to sharing done with any \nFederal agency. Companies are free to directly share with whomever they \nmay choose, including law enforcement and military intelligence \nagencies. This means that, unbeknownst to their customers, companies \nmay share information that contains customers' personal information \nwith NSA, FBI, and others. From a security perspective, it also means \nwe are setting up a diffuse system. I want to emphasize this. This is \nsetting up a diffuse system that, as DHS's letter acknowledged, is \nlikely to be complex and inefficient, where it is\n\n[[Page S7453]]\n\nactually harder for our cyber security experts to connect the dots and \nkeep us safe.\n  These are all reasons why privacy experts, independent security \nexperts, and the Department of Homeland Security have all warned that \nCISA's blanket authorization is a problem.\n  Earlier this year, the House avoided this problem when they passed \nthe National Cybersecurity Protection Advancement Act by a vote of 355 \nto 63. That information sharing bill only authorizes sharing with the \ngovernment through a single civilian hub at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity--a move toward efficient streamlining of information that is \nalso good for privacy. But understand that this is the House of \nRepresentatives, 355 to 63, saying: Let's make this easier for the \ngovernment to have all the information in one place.\n  Finally, CISA fails to adequately assure the removal of irrelevant \npersonal information. This, of course, is a major concern. The bill \nallows personal information to be shared even when there is a high \nlikelihood that the information is not related to a cyber security \nthreat. Combined with the bill's overly broad definition of ``cyber \nsecurity threat,'' this basically ensures that private entities will \nshare extraneous information from Americans' personal communications. \nIf companies are going to receive the broad liability protection this \nbill provides, they should be expected to do better than this.\n  Senator Wyden has offered an amendment, which I am proud to be the \ncosponsor of, which would require companies to be more diligent and to \nremove ``to the extent feasible'' any personal information that isn't \nnecessary to identify a cyber security threat. The ``extent feasible'' \nis a crucial improvement, but it is hardly novel; in fact, it is \nbasically the same standard that is in place today when information is \nshared between private companies and the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. There is no justification for lowering that standard in CISA, \nespecially because the bill also provides companies with significant \nliability protection.\n  Mr. President, the amendments I have talked about today, as well as a \nnumber of other pending amendments, would make CISA a better deal, one \nthat is significantly more protective of Americans' privacy and more \nlikely to advance cyber security. I want to encourage my colleagues to \nsupport these amendments. Without them, I fear that, however well \nintentioned, CISA would do a disservice to the American people.\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would just note that the Presiding \nOfficer and I are on the same schedule, because I come here a couple of \ntimes a week, but you are here more often than not when I am speaking. \nI am sorry. This is cruel and unusual punishment, I suspect, for you. \nBut I welcome the opportunity. Thank you for showing up. Otherwise, I \nwould not have a chance to share these thoughts today with the folks \nthat are in the Chamber and anybody else who might have tuned in.\n  Earlier this year, the Senate actually took up legislation that was \nreported out of the Environment and Public Works Committee, which was a \n6-year Transportation authorization bill. A lot of people who don't \nwork here don't realize that for us to spend money--taxpayer money--in \nmost cases we have to authorize a program at certain funding levels. \nThen we have to come back and do a second step, and that is to actually \nappropriate the money to spend that has been authorized.\n  Usually, if we are authorized to spend $100 in a program, we cannot \ncome in and just appropriate a lot more money than that. We have to do \nit within the levels set by the authorization bill.\n  Well, we took up on the floor of the Senate the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee's 6-year Transportation bill, coauthored by \nSenator Inhofe and Senator Boxer, Republican and Democrat, and reported \nout of the committee unanimously. Most people think we fight about \neverything. Well, we don't. Environment and Public Works Committee \nSenators Boxer and Inhofe have been very good at working together on \nthese authorization bills.\n  Now, the authorization bill does not contain the funding, but it \nsays: These are our transportation policies, and this is the level that \nwe think is appropriate. But it does not actually fund a dollar to go \nto those programs.\n  Well, over in the House of Representatives today, they got in the \nact. As I understand it, the House transportation committee has \nreported out--I think on a voice vote--their own 6-year authorization \nbill. This is good. It has not passed the House yet, but at least it is \nout of committee, with apparently a fair amount of broad support, which \nis good.\n  This is the Senate-passed bill called the DRIVE Act, reported out by \nthe committee a couple of months ago and passed the Senate here more \nrecently. As you know, we have names for our bills, such as the names \nfor cars. But the DRIVE Act, the Senate-passed bill, the Surface \nTransportation Reauthorization and Reform Act, has a number--3763. It \nis a 6-year authorization for transportation programs.\n  Do these bills have any good ideas in them? Well, they really do. As \nit turns out, there is a fair amount of common ground that these two \npieces of legislation share, the Senate-passed bill and the bill out of \nthe House committee.\n  One of them is that there is a new focus on making freight \ntransportation more reliable, more affordable, and more efficient. When \nyou look at an outfit called McKinsey & Company, a big international \nconsulting firm, they have an entity, an appendage of McKinsey, that is \ncalled the Global Institute. A year or so ago, they opined that a fully \nfunded, robustly funded transportation program in the United States \nwould provide 1.8 million new jobs in this country--1.8 million new \njobs in this country--and that it would grow GDP, gross domestic \nproduct, by 1.5 percent per year--not just one time, but per year. \nThose are pretty amazing numbers, actually, for me.\n  Well, one of the things that actually drives the increase in \nemployment and the growth in GDP is a more efficient freight \ntransportation system and one that actually focuses--as in this \nlegislation--on freight, and not just moving our cars, trucks, and vans \nbut actually figuring out how we move freight from place to place in a \nmore efficient way.\n\n  The second area where there seems to be some agreement is that both \npieces of legislation prioritize--especially the Senate version--bridge \nsafety and large facilities of national importance. Think big bridges; \nthink big tunnels. We have a bunch of bridges in this country--I forget \nwhat the percentage is--that are substandard, not safe--maybe one out \nof every nine. So take your choice for the bridges you are going over. \nThink about that. One in nine is deemed to be essentially unsafe.\n  Both of those bills say: Well, that ought to be a priority and we \nwould like to authorize higher spending for that. These bills focus on \nclean air funding and toward some of the most dangerous sources of \nemissions--diesel emissions. A lot of it comes from roadbuilding--road \nand highway--and bridgebuilding equipment that is diesel powered and \nputs out harmful emissions.\n  Actually, our bill in the Senate does some good things to reduce \nthose emissions while we go about building these transportation \nprojects. One of the things that I especially like about our bill is \nthat it says that eventually we ought to have an approach to funding \nroads, highways, and bridges.\n  Maybe it should be something that reflects vehicle miles traveled. We \ndon't have that kind of magical system now. In Oregon, they have been \ntrying to do it for 10 years. They call it RUC, a road user charge. \nThey have maybe 5,000 families that are actually using this. But it is \na long way from 5,000 families in Oregon to having a national system \nthat we can use to come up with money to pay for roads, highways, \nbridges, and transit.\n  But our Senate-passed bill establishes research to develop \nalternative user fees to replace, maybe eventually, the gas and diesel \ntax somewhere down the line--not next year, probably not this decade, \nbut somewhere down the line. I think that should be a growing part of \nthe source of revenues to pay for transportation.\n\n[[Page S7454]]\n\n  The Senate bill even increases--bumps up not hugely but bumps up a \nlittle bit--the baseline funding and funding for transportation. I wish \nit had been more, but at least it is an effort to do that. Our next \nchart is one of my favorite charts. I have a friend from Montana, a \nformer attorney general, former Governor, former chairman of the \nRepublican National Committee, whose name is Marc Racicot. Folks from \nhis State like to talk about cowboys who really are not cowboys.\n  They have a saying out there. They say: All hat, no cattle. In this \ncase, we can have all the transportation authorization bills until the \ncows come home, but unless we actually fund them, they are just words \non a piece of paper, and we don't build a road or a highway or a bridge \nor do anything on the transit side unless we actually fund them. I \ndon't know who this guy is, but I love this poster. All hat, no cattle. \nThat is where we are right now because we don't have agreement on how \nwe are really going to pay for robustly funding transportation \nprojects.\n  There is an idea out there that goes beyond lousy pay-fors. I think \nthe kind of stuff goes like this: We steal money for 10 years out of \nTSA, instead of making our skies safer, and we put that money of 10 \nyears of revenues into 3 months of helping to fund transportation \nprojects. That is not too smart, but we do that. Instead of making \nborder crossings in this country safer, where folks are trying to get \ninto our country, we use Customs fees for that purpose. But instead of \nusing it to make our border crossings safer and our ports of entry \nsafer, we put 10 years of Customs fees collected into 3 months or so of \ntransportation projects.\n  We look at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, for which we bought the \npetroleum. We try to buy it low and not use it very much. But we will \nsee what we spent in the last couple of years buying and refilling our \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve, at $80, $90, maybe $100 a barrel, and now \nwe are selling it at basically half of that price.\n  You are supposed to buy low and then sell high. That is where you end \nup making your profits. What we are doing with our Strategic Petroleum \nReserve is to buy high, sell low, and use whatever money we realize to \nhelp pay for some transportation projects--not a real smart investment \nstrategy.\n  What Senator Dick Durbin and I have introduced is something we called \nthe TRAFFIC Relief Act. It is an acronym. Tax Relief and Fix the Trust \nFund for Infrastructure Certainty Act of 2015. Here is the real thing \nwe need to know about. It raises $220 billion over the next 10 years. \nWe raise $220 billion in the next 10 years to go into the \ntransportation trust fund.\n  If we just want to go, frankly, not to a level of spending that \nactually addresses the problem, then, in fact, we have our roads, \nhighways, and bridges get a D-plus. Civil engineers across the country \nevery year evaluate our transportation infrastructure. They give us a \nD-plus. ``D'' as in ``dog.'' ``D'' as in ``dangerous.'' ``D'' as in \n``degraded.'' That is when you spend $90 billion a year, which is maybe \ncontemplated in the authorization legislation--maybe a little bit more. \nWe don't really make much of a dent in the work that needs to be done.\n  What we propose in our legislation is $220 billion, and we would have \n$130 billion for new investments in repairs and upgrades. I should be \nable to do some new projects and make a bigger dent in the ones that \nneed our attention.\n\n  Let's see what we have in our next chart. I think there is a fair \namount of support for doing that from what I hear. Let's take a look.\n  We looked at a couple of recent editorials that basically say what \nday--I think from these newspapers are from coast to coast, from North \nto South, East to West. Believe it or not, they say we ought to pay for \ntransportation--roads, highways, and bridges. It should be that the \nuser pays to use the roads, highways, and bridges. They ought to pay \nfor them. It is what we have done for years. If we raise the gas and \ndiesel tax from 1993--22 years ago, about 18 years ago for the gas tax, \n23 cents for the diesel tax--in today's purchasing power, adjust for \ninflation. So the gas tax is worth less than a dime, not 18 cents, but \nless than a dime. The diesel tax is not worth 23 cents, but less than \n15 cents--probably closer to 12 cents.\n  Here is what some of the people say. The New York Times says: \n``Highways Need a Higher Gas Tax.'' They are essentially saying restore \nthe purchasing power of the gas and diesel tax. All right? Not add $1, \nnot add 50 cents or 25 cents, but restore the purchasing power.\n  USA TODAY says: ``Raise the gas tax: Our view.'' They also add: \n``Highway funding hijinks: Our view''--which actually coincides with \nmine.\n  Let's see if we have any others. The Washington Post says, and this \nis a very recent one: ``Highway Transportation Fund needs a permanent \nand simple fix.'' Even more recent, editorial board said: ``Congress \nrecklessly refuses to top up the Highway Trust Fund.'' Then even more \nrecently: ``Congress should fix the gas tax.''\n  Again, restore the purchasing power of the gas and diesel tax, not to \nuse it for extraneous stuff, not to use it for foreign aid, not to use \nit for Afghanistan or other places around the world, not to use it for \nhealth care, not to use it for education, but to use it to take these \nroads, highways, and bridges that are deteriorating and actually put \nthe money, any extra money we generate, into those. Bangor, ME: ``The \nnation's highway fund doesn't have to continue to lose ground.''\n  The Register-Guard--I am trying to remember where that is. I am not \nsure where the Register-Guard is, but it said ``Just raise the gas \ntax'' in an editorial in July.\n  Again, the Washington Post opined the same message earlier in January \nof this year. Let's look at that one again. They said: ``With oil \nprices low, now's the perfect time for Congress to raise the gas tax.'' \nThat is what they said in January of this year.\n  As it turns out, we did some checking. We found out last week, at \n29,000 gas stations across the country, they are selling gas for less \nthan $2 a gallon. Think about that: 29,000 gas stations across America. \nThe gas station in my neighborhood is at $2.09, and the Washington Post \nopined 7 months, 8 months, 9 months ago that ``With oil prices low, \nnow's the perfect time for Congress to raise the gas tax.'' Actually, \ngas prices are about half a dollar lower now than they were then.\n  If the Iran agreement is fully implemented, Iran--which now produces \nabout 200,000 barrels of oil a day--a year from now they are going to \nbe producing about 1 million barrels a day. This suggests to me that a \nworld already awash in oil might actually continue to be awash in oil \nfor a while, so with the low oil prices, I think there is reason to \nbelieve they are not going to spike back up any time soon.\n  There are more editorials and headlines. The Miami Herald: ``Fix our \nroads.'' Akron Beacon Journal, Akron, OH: ``Raise the gas tax and make \nbetter policy.'' The JournalStar, which is in Nebraska: ``Follow the \nlogic on gas tax.''\n  Those are major newspapers across the country. We have also had some \npolling done, not by us, but by the American Road & Transportation \nBuilders Association and also by Mineta. Some of us remember Norman \nMineta, former mayor of San Jose, the Secretary of Transportation who \nworked in both the Republican Bush administration and the Clinton \nadministration. In these two recent nationwide surveys, clear \nmajorities have indicated support for increasing fuel taxes as a fair \nway to invest in transportation projects.\n  This is from the American Road & Transportation Builders Association:\n\n       A Strong Majority Supports Payments to Keep Up With \n     Inflation\n       By more than a 2:1 margin, voters support increased \n     payments directed to upkeep of the nation's infrastructure, \n     given the need to keep up with inflation. About 68 percent to \n     70 percent support, strongly support, or somewhat support \n     doing that. We have another recent poll, and these are just \n     representative samples. There are others that are coming out \n     almost weekly now.\n\n  The Mineta Transportation Institute Poll--there is one that gives a \nvariety of different options in gas tax, sales tax, and vehicle-miles-\ntraveled fee. The one that actually gets the most support is a 10-cent \nincrease with revenue used just for transportation--not for any other \npurpose, just for transportation--71 percent. I was surprised it was \nthis high. People want us to fix their roads, highways and bridges. \nThey are tired of paying for repairs to their vehicles.\n\n[[Page S7455]]\n\n  The next quote is from the Philadelphia Inquirer today. They are \ntalking to people who read their paper. ``The next time your axle snaps \nor a tire rim is bent on a bumpy highway, consider delivering the \nbroken car parts to your congressional representatives''--your \nrepresentatives in Congress, your House Members, and your Senators.\n  The average amount of money that we spend on repairs of cars, trucks, \nand vans every year that is related to bad roads and bad bridges is \nanywhere from $350 a year to as much as $500 per year. That is the \nrange there.\n  I wish to close with sometimes people say you can't vote--we can't \nvote here to do this stuff. None of us will ever get reelected.\n  Well, wait a minute. How about the 12 States where in the last 2 \nyears they actually voted to do this stuff. State highway \ntransportation departments get about half of their money from the \nFederal Government, and they raise about half of their money locally. \nTheir major sources of revenues locally are taxes and user fees on gas \nand diesel.\n  In 12 States in the last 2 years they voted to do this. These are \nmostly red States because there are more red States, at least with \nlegislatures and Governors, than blue. But 95 percent of the Republican \nlegislatures voted to raise user fees on gas and diesel in their \nStates; 95 percent of them were reelected last fall. They won their \nprimary; they won their general. They were reelected.\n  Who wasn't elected as much? The people who voted against doing that. \nSo the folks who actually voted to raise the user fees actually were \nreelected more than the people who voted against it.\n  On the Democratic side, in the States where they voted to raise the \nuser fees to pay just for transportation--not for anything else--90 \npercent of the Democrats were reelected. More legislators were \nreelected than did not get reelected. So just keep that in mind.\n  I have said enough. The majority leader is waiting, and I thank him \nfor his patience, but here is the long story short: There is a need out \nthere. The American people expect us to do something about it. They \nwant us to work together. We need not just to have a hat. This can't be \nall hat; there has to be some cattle. Where is the beef? Where is the \nmoney to pay for all of this stuff?\n  I will be back next week to talk about it some more, and I thank the \nmajority leader for his patience.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/senate-section/article/S7455-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7455-S7456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 BURMA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on November 8, just a few weeks away, \nthe people of Burma will hold national elections. This promises to be a \nmomentous event for a country many of us have studied and followed for \na very long time--in my own case for over 20 years. This is going to be \na momentous election for at least two reasons.\n  First, for Burma's citizens--or for many of them, at least--this \nelection represents a chance to finally choose their own leaders, which \nis, indeed, a rare occurrence in recent Burmese history. That is \nsignificant in itself, but there is another reason these elections are \nso important, because the manner in which they are conducted will serve \nas a key indicator of the progress of reform in that country.\n  There are some encouraging signs that the election will be freer and \nfairer than what we have seen in the past. Unlike recent Burmese \nelections, for example, international election observers have been \npermitted into the country. That is an important departure from the \npast, and it is encouraging. At the same time, there have been \ntroubling signs during the election cycle. Allow me to share a few of \nthem with you now.\n  First, the Constitution was not amended prior to the election. As \nmany of my colleagues will recall, the Burmese Constitution \nunreasonably restricts who can be a candidate for President, a hardly \nsubtle attempt to bar the country's most popular opposition figure from \neven standing for office. That is certainly worrying enough, but the \nBurmese Constitution goes even further, ensuring an effective military \nveto over constitutional change--over, for instance, amendments about \nrunning for the Presidency by requiring more than three-fourths \nparliamentary support in a legislature where the Constitution also \nreserves--listen to this--more than one-fourth of the seats for the \nmilitary. So in order to change the Constitution, you have to get some \nmilitary votes and obviously, so far, that hasn't happened.\n  Allowing appropriate constitutional changes to pass through the \nParliament would have represented a tangible demonstration of the \nBurmese Government's commitment to both political reform and to a freer \nand fairer election this November. But when the measures were put to a \nvote on June 25, the government's allies exercised the very \nundemocratic power the Constitution grants them to stymie the effort.\n  So what kinds of messages do these actions send us? They bring the \nBurmese Government's continued commitment to democracy into question. \nIf you were truly committed to democracy, why would you continue a \nprovision like that, which to most of the world is simply quite \nlaughable or outrageous?\n  They also raise fundamental questions about the balloting this fall, \nincreasing the prospect of an election being perceived as something \nother than the will of the people, even if its actual conduct proves to \nbe free and fair. It is hard to see how that is in anybody's interest.\n  The second deeply troubling consideration is the apparent widespread, \nif not universal, disenfranchisement of the Rohingya population. For \nall the ill treatment the Rohingya have had to endure in their history, \nat least they had once been able to vote and run for office in Burma. \nThey voted and fielded a candidate for office in both the 2010 election \nand the 1990 election, but, alas, no more.\n  Reports indicate that otherwise eligible Rohingya, more than half a \nmillion of them, have been systematically deprived of the right to vote \nand the right to stand for election. That poses another serious \nchallenge to next month's elections being seen as free and fair, and \nthere is another serious challenge I would note as well.\n  Finally, while media activity in Burma is far more open than it was \nbefore 2010, there have been troubling signs that indicate a recent and \nworrying backslide. In fact, just a few days ago, news circulated of \nindividuals being arrested for Facebook postings.\n  These are very disturbing reports. Campaigns can be conducted only \nwhen a free exchange of ideas is permitted. Arresting citizens for free \nexpression runs directly counter to that idea. It is at odds with \nnotions of free speech and democracy, and it seems designed to send \nchilling signals to the Burmese people.\n  It is clear that Burma faces substantial challenges. From the \nundemocratic elements in Burma's Constitution, to the \ndisenfranchisement of the Rohingya, to troubling incidents regarding \nthe curtailment of citizens' basic rights, these challenges are \nsignificant. They need to be addressed.\n  At the same time, we should not allow these things to completely \novershadow what Burma has accomplished. It has actually come a long way \nin recent years. There are many positive things to be built upon as \nwell. In short, there is still hope for Burma's upcoming election.\n  Thein Sein's government has an opportunity to make these last few \nweeks of campaigning as free and as fair as possible. The Burmese \nGovernment can still hold an election that, despite the troubling \nthings I mentioned, can be embraced by Burmese citizens and the \ninternational community alike.\n  That will mean ensuring these final weeks of campaigning are as free \nand as fair as possible. That will mean ensuring freedom of expression \nis protected.\n  These are the kinds of minimum goals that Burmese officials must \nstrive toward in the final weeks of the campaign season. If the Burmese \nGovernment gets this right, if it ensures as free and fair an election \nas possible, with results accepted by competing parties, the \ngovernment, and the military, that would go a long way toward \nreassuring Burma's friends around the globe that it remains committed \nto political reform and progress in the bilateral relationship. Indeed, \nboth the government and the military have committed to standing by the \nelection results.\n\n[[Page S7456]]\n\n  Now, let me be clear. While I have always approached this \nrelationship and the role of sanctions realistically, this election is \na test the government must pass. Simply holding an election without \nmass casualties or violence, while vitally important, isn't good \nenough. Let me say that again. Just holding an election without mass \nviolence is not enough. It has to do a lot more than just have the \nabsence of violence.\n  As I stated on the Senate floor earlier this year, if we end up with \nan election not accepted by the Burmese people as reflecting their \nwill, it will make further normalization of relations--at least as it \nconcerns the legislative branch of this government--much more \ndifficult. It would likely hinder further enhancement of U.S.-Burma \neconomic ties and military-to-military relations. It would likely erode \nconfidence in Burma's reform efforts. It would also likely make it more \ndifficult for the executive branch to include Burma in the Generalized \nSystem of Preferences Program or to enhance political military \nrelations.\n  Those of us who follow Burma want this country to succeed. We want to \nsee the government carry out an election that is as free and as fair as \npossible. We are prepared to continue doing what we can to encourage \nmore positive change in that country, and we will be realistic about \nwhat is possible.\n  As I just mentioned, that is the kind of approach I have always tried \nto take--a hopeful but still realistic one when it comes to this \nrelationship, not just on the role of sanctions but also on the \npossible steps toward closer relations and on the individual programs \nand policies that would aid Burma's development and capabilities.\n  So we are hoping the Burmese Government gets this right. This is a \nbig opportunity to send a signal to the rest of the world that Burma \nhas indeed truly changed. We are hoping the Burmese people continue \nmoving along the path of greater freedom and greater reform, but \nwhatever the result, Burmese Government officials should be assured \nthat Burma's partners in the United States and in the international \ncommunity will be watching intently to see what happens in the coming \nweeks with a realistic assessment in what Burma can achieve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/senate-section/article/S7456-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            IN RECOGNITION OF THE LEESBURG ``STOLEN GIRLS''\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, it is with a sense of solemnity that I \nrecognize a low moment during the civil rights movement in my home \nState of Georgia 52 years ago.\n  During the height of the movement, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was \narrested for protesting racial segregation in Albany, GA, on December \n16, 1961, and held in the Sumter County jail. The arrest galvanized the \ncommunity and Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, SNCC, efforts \nto establish the Sumter County movement. Largely comprised of preteen \nand teenage students, the movement repeatedly challenged segregation \nfrom 1963 to 1965. On July 15, 1963, a number of school-aged girls were \narrested, transported to a jail in Dawson, GA, and held overnight. \nEarly the next morning, they were transported to Leesburg, GA, without \nparental consent. The girls were held 20 miles from their homes in a \nCivil War-era stockade following their arrest for protesting, and they \nwere not released until mid-September 1963.\n  After a SNCC photographer revealed the terrible, unsanitary, and \ndangerous conditions, the young girls, dubbed the ``Stolen Girls,'' \ngained national attention. However, the incident has not received the \nattention it deserves.\n  The young ladies who were jailed are ready to tell the stories of \ntheir untold mistreatment after 52 years. I encourage my fellow \nGeorgians and Americans to learn more about the civil rights movement \nso that all might find healing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/senate-section/article/S7456-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HEAD START AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation to the \nstudents, parents, staff, and alumni of the Head Start Program and to \njoin them in celebrating Head Start Awareness Month. The dedicated \nindividuals at Head Start have served our Nation's most vulnerable \nchildren and families for 50 years.\n  Since its founding in 1965, this program has provided comprehensive \nsocial and emotional development services to children from birth to age \n5. Because of Head Start, many young parents have been able to get the \nsupport they need during the crucial first years of their child's life.\n  These services go far beyond what any parenting book could ever \nachieve. Head Start staff provides real-life guidance for young parents \nwho, for example, may need the name of a local dentist or help finding \nadequate housing to keep their families healthy and safe.\n  In Oregon, we have 336 program locations that enrolled more than \n13,000 individuals and families last year. You can find a Head Start \nlocation anywhere from Clatskanie, OR, all the way to Chiloquin. \nEarlier this month, Clatsop County celebrated Head Start's anniversary \nby holding simultaneous block parties at the county's three locations. \nThese Head Start and Early Head Start centers are helping Oregon \nfamilies who want to see their children reach their full potential.\n  The Head Start Program fosters literacy and prepares Oregon's \nchildren for success in school. Early learning through Head Start can \nput children on a path toward high school graduation and a better \nfuture. In my view, the Head Start Program is a critical investment in \nthe development of our Nation's youngest children.\n  I speak today to honor those who are working to make a difference for \nour young people at all the Head Start locations in Oregon and across \nthe country. I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to \ncontinue to support early childhood education programs like Head Start.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/senate-section/article/S7456-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7456-S7459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL FOREST PRODUCTS WEEK\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has \ndesignated this week as National Forest Products Week to recognize the \nimportant contribution of forest products to our economy and \nenvironment. This week means a great deal to industries and employees \nin the State of Idaho and citizens nationally.\n  In Idaho alone, forestry, logging, wood products, and pulp and paper \nproduction support more than 10,600 jobs, contribute over $430 million \nto the local economy through wages, and produce a value of shipments of \nover $2.6 billion. The industry continues to grow and is taking on new \nand innovative projects like the development of tall wood buildings. \nOver the past several years, a number of tall wood projects have been \ncompleted around the world, demonstrating successful applications of \nnext generation lumber and mass timber technologies. Today, the concept \nis gaining traction in the U.S.--with more architects opting for a \nsustainable solution for attaining safe, cost-effective, and high-\nperforming tall buildings in urban dense settings.\n  Years of research and real-life experience have proven that wood \nbuildings can withstand the effects of major wind and seismic events. \nThese structures, when properly designed and constructed, protect lives \nand preserve building function. Wood buildings are durable and can be \ndesigned to last a lifetime. For example, a mass timber system was used \nin the 1974 rebuild of the nine-story Butler Square Building in \nMinneapolis. Heavy timber post and beam construction provided an \nadaptable solution and has allowed the building to stand strong since \n1900.\n  As we celebrate forest products this week, let us all thank and \ncongratulate those in the industry for their considerable contributions \nto economies the world over and their development of cutting-edge \ntechnologies that create better, stronger, and greener buildings.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, during National Forest Products Week, I am \nglad to join my colleagues in highlighting the important role that the \nforest products industry plays in Oregon and nationwide.\n  Many rural communities throughout Oregon were founded on the success \nof the forest products industry. With fresh innovations and a focus on \nsustainability, the industry continues to bolster these communities \nyear after year. In Oregon, the industry supports more than 37,000 \njobs, pumping over $2 billion in wages directly into local economies. \nOverall, the industry produces a combined product value of over $7.8 \nbillion. By encouraging a sustainable forest products industry in \nOregon\n\n[[Page S7457]]\n\nand across the country, we can help strengthen markets for wood \nproducts, both here and abroad, and continue to ensure the success of \nrural economies.\n  When harvested in a sustainable manner, wood can reduce carbon \nemissions, and new state-of-the-art technologies using wood as a \nbuilding material have made timber more fire resistant and stronger \nthan ever. Wood has the potential to contribute vastly to a low-carbon \neconomy by locking up the carbon that trees draw out of the atmosphere \nwhen they grow. Wood products like cross laminated timber also bring \ndown construction costs for multiple story buildings in large cities.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture has already recognized a project \nin my hometown of Portland that will demonstrate the unique benefits of \ntimber as a building material for a new age. I'm proud that the \nAgriculture Department gave one of two Tall Wood Building Prize \nCompetition awards to Portland, OR, and I'm looking forward to seeing \nthe 12-story wood building as a new addition to the Portland skyline.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, as we come together to celebrate National \nForest Products Week, I want to highlight the impacts and contributions \nof the forest products industry to my home State of Oregon. In my \nState, the forest products industry produces over 37,000 jobs; \ncontributes over $2 billion in wages to local economies; and produces a \ncombined product value of nearly $8 billion.\n  Oregon has forest land that covers over 29 million acres. We have 72 \nsawmills, millwork, and treating facilities, 49 engineered wood and \npanel products facilities, and 11 other types of wood products \nfacilities, combining to make a total of 132 wood products facilities \nin the State of Oregon. Forest products produce $262 million annually \nin tax payments to support the rural and local economics in the State \nof Oregon.\n  Forest products provide a clear value both for our economy and for \nthe environment. Currently, America's forests store 2.5 trillion metric \ntons of carbon and capture nearly 13 percent of total U.S. CO2 \nemissions annually. One-half of the dry weight of wood is carbon; and \nthe lumber, wood products, and the wood used in buildings each provide \na carbon storage system. With advanced technologies, we are seeing \ntaller and stronger buildings made of wood--buildings that will last \nfor generations and help move us towards a more sustainable future.\n  In closing, I would like to express my support for the forest \nproducts industry and their ongoing efforts to positively contribute to \nthe environment and submit these comments as part of this year's \nNational Forest Product's Week.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, in support of National Forest Products Week, \nI would like to recognize the nearly 18,000 hard-working men and women \nemployed by the forest products industry in the great State of Maine.\n  Maine is home to about 40 wood products and paper manufacturing \nfacilities, which contribute over $900 million to the economy through \njobs and wages and over $4 billion in industry shipments of products, \nmaking the forest products industry one of the largest manufacturing \nsectors in the State.\n  Our Nation's forests are an essential element of our urban and rural \nlandscape. Covering more than 750 million acres across America, they \ncreate opportunities for recreation and habitats for wildlife, and \ntheir products play an integral role in our daily lives.\n  As the only renewable building material, wood requires less energy to \ntransport, construct, and produce in comparison to alternative building \nmaterials. By increasing the use of wood products in construction, we \nhave the opportunity to reduce greenhouse emissions and improve the \nenvironmental performance of buildings. Design and building \nprofessionals are increasingly recognizing wood's environmental \nattributes and helping to create strong markets for wood products.\n  The industry continues to grow and is taking on new and innovative \nprojects like the development of tall wood buildings. Over the past \nseveral years, a number of tall wood projects have been completed \naround the world, demonstrating successful applications of next \ngeneration lumber and mass timber technologies. Today, the concept is \ngaining traction in the U.S., with more architects opting for a \nsustainable solution for attaining safe, cost-effective, high-\nperforming tall buildings.\n  Even with the advances of digital communications, paper also \ncontinues to play a valuable role in our daily lives: from enhancing \neducation through written communications to capturing and preserving \nlife's most memorable moments. In my State, I continually hear from men \nand women for whom paper is not only a preference, but for some, a \nnecessity. Forty-one percent of Americans over 65 years of age do not \nuse the internet. Eliminating paper as an option for vital government \ncommunications--like the IRS tax instruction manual--impedes access to \ncritical information every citizen has a right to receive.\n  Thank you for the opportunity to recognize the hard-working men and \nwomen employed by the forest products industry in Maine. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in celebrating National Forest Products Week and \nreflect on the positive economic, social, and environmental impacts \npaper and forest products have on our everyday lives.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the important role of \nthe forest products industry as we celebrate National Forest Products \nWeek.\n  Montana's forests are a treasured part of our State's heritage which \nmany of us hold so dear--not only are Montana's forests where we hunt, \nfish, explore, and live, but our forest products industry provides \nthousands of jobs for Montana families and a boost to our State's \neconomy.\n  Sadly, many forest products jobs in Montana have been lost this year \nin large part due to an insufficient supply of logs from Federal lands. \nI'm fighting for commonsense reforms to restore active management \nacross Montana so we can get more Montanans back to work, improve \nforest health, increase access to public lands, and provide much-needed \nsustainable revenues to our forested counties. These reforms must give \nthe Forest Service the tools and resources it needs to increase \nresponsible timber harvests and protect their work from obstructionist \ntactics that continue to encumber a substantial portion of the timber \nvolume from Montana's national forests. Congress should enact these \nreforms swiftly.\n  Further, as we seek to improve the performance of our buildings, we \nshould encourage the use of wood in the construction of Federal and \nother commercial buildings. Montana is home to approximately 5 \nengineered and panel products facilities and 12 sawmills, millwork, and \ntreatment facilities that employ several thousand people across the \nState. These facilities are working to advance innovative new \ntechnologies, for example, cross laminated timber. I am proud to have \nSmartLam, Inc., the very first and only manufacturer of cross laminated \ntimber, CLT, products in the U.S. located in the great State of \nMontana.\n  CLT products are creating opportunities in the U.S. to build taller \nwood buildings. Advancements in new technology utilizing engineered \n``mass timber'' panels are creating new possibilities for wood. This \nconcept is gaining momentum in the U.S. as many successful \ndemonstration projects have been built and proven to be a safe and \ncost-effective solution in urban dense settings. With more than 17 tall \nwood buildings of seven stories or more having been built around the \nworld serving as demonstration projects, building officials, designers, \ncontractors, and consumers are increasingly confident in the safety of \nthese buildings.\n  I want to thank the individuals in the forest products industry for \ntheir important contributions to my home State and for their efforts to \nexpand tall wood building projects across the Nation.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleagues in support \nof the 55th National Forest Products Week and to recognize the more \nthan 26,000 hard-working men and women that work in the forest products \nsector in Michigan.\n  Forests in Michigan and nationwide help keep our air and water clean, \nprovide wildlife habitats, and places for recreation. These forests \naren't just an environmental treasure; they are an economic powerhouse. \nMichigan is home to nearly 200 businesses that manufacture everything \nfrom office paper to wood pellets for home heating.\n\n[[Page S7458]]\n\nNationwide, our forests provide more than 900,000 jobs, creating almost \n$240 billion in economic output every year.\n  This economic activity leads to new opportunities in rural \ncommunities around the country. That's one reason why, as chairwoman of \nthe Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, I worked \nwith a bipartisan group of lawmakers to ensure the 2014 farm bill \nstrengthened forestry programs and helped bolster rural economic \ndevelopment.\n  Forest product companies are also leaders in the effort to increase \nrecycling. Today, 96 percent of all communities across the country have \naccess to curbside or drop-off paper recycling programs. On top of \nthat, the millions of Americans who recycle at home, work, and school \nhave helped recover more than 60 percent of the paper consumed in the \nU.S. in each of the last 3 years. Picture this: each day our paper \ncompanies around the country recycle enough paper to fill a 15-mile-\nlong boxcar train.\n  That type of leadership is great news for our planet and has some \nserious economic savings as well. Already more than 110 mills around \nthe country are making paper using only recovered materials. And \nefforts are on track to recover more than 70 percent of all paper used \nby 2020. At the same time, paper can only be recycled a limited number \nof times, so it's important that steps are taken to ensure sustainable \nproduction of paper and forest products from our renewable forest \nresources.\n  Forest products can also help us become more energy independent. \nManufacturers across the industry now use carbon neutral biomass that \ncomes from forest waste--materials like bark, wood scraps, byproducts, \nand other unusable products--to help power their plants, reduce \nemissions, and save energy.\n\n  For all these reasons, I am proud to serve as co-chair of the Paper \nand Packaging Caucus with my colleague from Arkansas, Senator Boozman.\n  Thank you for the opportunity to recognize the hard-working \nprofessionals of the forest products industry in the great State of \nMichigan. I would urge my colleagues to join me in celebrating National \nForest Products Week and applaud the thousands of hard-working \nAmericans who are working hard every day to keep America as the leader \nin forest products.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I would like to recognize National Forest \nProducts Week and the many women and men in Arkansas who rely on \nforestry and the forest products industry.\n  As co-chair of the Paper and Packaging Caucus, I am glad to work with \nmy fellow co-chairs--Senator Debbie Stabenow and Representatives Reid \nRibble  and Gwen Graham--to highlight the role that this vital industry \nplays in our country.\n  About 25,000 Arkansans are directly employed in the forestry and \nforest products sector. Arkansas is home to over 100 wood products, \npaper, and packaging manufacturing facilities that make nearly $7 \nbillion in products each year. Large and small employers dot the \nArkansas landscape. I regularly hear from and meet with Arkansas \nfamilies who earn a living and make great products at places like Green \nBay Packaging, Domtar, Deltic Timber, and Georgia-Pacific. Every year, \nI meet with family tree farmers and small business operators who rely \non our forestry sector to build a successful future. And I track and \nsupport efforts to responsibly manage and utilize our renewable Federal \nforest resources. According to the University of Arkansas, the forest \nand forest products industry produces $2.3 billion in wages that are \npumped into the Arkansas economy each year. This economic activity \ncreates and supports countless other jobs.\n  I also serve as the co-chair of the Senate Recycling Caucus. In this \ndual capacity, I have seen the forest products industry's success in \npairing economic growth with respect for the environment. The industry \nis making great strides in promoting sustainability and energy \nconservation, especially by using carbon neutral biomass, which meets \nabout two-thirds of the industry's energy needs. Other successes \ninclude boosting exports and encouraging recycling. Paper recycling \nprograms now reach 96 percent of the American people, and the industry \nis on target to recover and recycle about 70 percent of its products in \nthe next few years.\n  At the same time, the industry is facing challenges--from problems \nwith our transportation policies and infrastructure to a regulatory \nmaze that is too difficult and costly to navigate. Here in Congress, we \nneed to solve these challenges together, through common sense, \ncooperation, negotiation, an open process, and a clear-eyed analysis of \nthe facts.\n  We also need to support the industry as it transitions. While more \ninformation is available digitally, paper and packaging products are \nstill indispensable to our modern economy. For example, many Americans, \nparticularly those in rural settings or with limited resources or \ncomputer skills, have difficulty accessing information digitally. \nThat's why in general, and particularly at government agencies, the \nformat of information should be a consumer choice.\n  In conclusion, paper, packaging, and other wood products are at the \nheart of modern life and a modern economy. I am glad to join my \ncolleagues in celebrating National Forest Products Week. These \nrecyclable and renewable resources make our lives better, and forestry \nis truly an Arkansas success story--and an American success story. \nThank you.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I would like to join Senator Crapo and \nmy colleagues in recognizing National Forest Products Week and in \nrecognizing the men and women of the forest products industry for their \ncontributions to our Nation and, in particular, my home State of \nWashington.\n  The forest products industry employs nearly 30,000 people in \nWashington, contributing $1.9 billion dollars in jobs and wages. \nEmployees work both in wood products facilities and in paper \nmanufacturing; and these facilities, and the jobs and wages they \ncreate, have been a dynamic part of our economy.\n  I would like to commend the industry for its recent technological \nadvances and for continually looking toward the future. Forest products \nhave contributed greatly to improvements in energy efficiency in \nbuildings and their overall environmental performance. I am \nparticularly excited about new ``mass timber'' technologies, such as \ncross laminated timber, CLT, that are now opening an entirely new suite \nof opportunities. New technologies create new markets for wood and \nhealthy working forests.\n  Throughout our State, there is great interest in CLT. We are already \nseeing this new product bringing innovation to the design and \nconstruction of buildings. Tall wood buildings are now being built \naround the world. The U.S. market is ripe for applying this new \ntechnology to new construction. I appreciate the support that the \nadministration is providing for builders that want to use CLT. I expect \nto see an increase in the use of CLT and an increase in the number of \nfacilities that create it.\n  Our forests and forest products play an important role in \nsequestering and storing carbon. The use of wood in buildings provides \na great opportunity to make our buildings more environmentally and \nenergy efficient. This is a great example of the use of forest products \ncreating a healthier economy and environment.\n  Even though I have talked so much about CLT, I would like to commend \nthe men and women who comprise this industry for their many \ncontributions in Washington and around the U.S.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to recognize \nthe men and women of the forest products industry as we celebrate \nNational Forest Products Week. These folks represent a critical part of \nmy State's outdoor heritage and economy.\n  The forestry and forest products industries support nearly 5,000 jobs \nin Montana and generate approximately $22 million in State and local \ntaxes. Today, Montana is home to 20 facilities that rely on forest \nproducts, from sawmills to engineered wood and panel production sites. \nIn a time of increased global competition, when the U.S. Forest Service \nhas to spend over half its budget on wildfire costs instead of managing \nour forests, the men and women who work in this industry deserve our \nsupport. These are the folks who cut trees, transport them from the \nforest to mills, process lumber, and make a wide variety of products \nthat\n\n[[Page S7459]]\n\nwe use every day. I remain committed to pursuing sound forestry and \ntrade policies that will ensure this important industry can compete \nfairly, contribute to sustainable forest management, and continue to \nprovide good jobs in Montana.\n  The forest products industry is also looking forward to find new ways \nto put our wood fiber to good use and create additional value for local \neconomies in Montana. In Whitefish, SmartLam, Inc. is the first \nmanufacturer of cross laminated timber, CLT, products in the Nation. \nThis Montana company is on the cutting edge of engineered-wood \ntechnology for building construction materials. SmartLam is producing \nmore than a million board feet of CLT products a month and hopes to \nopen a new facility due to increasing demand. These products can aid in \nthe construction of taller, more fire-safe wood buildings and help \nreduce the carbon footprint of the construction process. Innovative \nwood construction systems are flexible and can be easily combined with \nother building materials, offering alternatives for construction in \nurban areas while supporting sustainable development in rural \ncommunities.\n\n  In addition to providing good jobs, the forest products industry \nplays a key role in the sustainable management of the more than 25 \nmillion acres of forests in Montana. Most of the forested lands in \nMontana are managed by the U.S. Forest Service. We have seen industry \ncome together with a wide array of stakeholders in Montana to develop \ncollaborative recommendations for projects aimed at supporting local \neconomies, improving forest health, reducing wildfire risks, and \nrestoring watersheds. On private lands, industry has partnered with \nconservation organizations to keep forested lands forested as \ndevelopment pressures have grown.\n  In addition to National Forest Products Week, this week also marks \nthe fifth annual Montana Forest Products Week. There is no better time \nto say thanks to the folks who work in Montana's forest products \nindustry.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak today about the \nmany contributions of the forest products industry, as we recognize \ntheir important work during National Forest Products Week.\n  Wood products play a significant role in our economy. The U.S. wood \nproducts industry employs more than 548,000 people in manufacturing and \nforestry, and U.S. private forest owners support 2.4 million jobs and \n$87 billion in payroll. In Maine, there are a number of wood products \nmanufacturing facilities, including sawmills, millwork, and treatment \nplants, engineered wood and panel product facilities, and paper mills.\n  The environmental benefits associated with wood products--from \nrenewability to responsible forest practices to a light carbon \nfootprint--are helping to strengthen markets for wood products, in turn \nstabilizing the wood industry's ability to create jobs and support \nlocal economies. Moreover, sustainable forest management practices in \nthe United States maintain important forest values such as biodiversity \nand wildlife habitat. Strong markets for wood products provide a \nfinancial incentive for landowners to invest in their forests and keep \nthem healthy for future generations.\n  Design and building professionals are increasingly recognizing wood's \nenvironmental attributes and helping to create strong markets for wood \nproducts. Over the past several years, a number of tall wood projects \nhave been completed around the world, demonstrating successful \napplications of next generation technologies. Today, the concept is \ngaining traction in the United States where more architects are opting \nfor a sustainable solution for attaining safe, cost-effective, high-\nperforming tall buildings, particularly in urban dense settings. As the \nonly renewable building material, wood requires less energy to \ntransport, construct, and produce than other building materials.\n  In closing, I encourage my colleagues to support policies that \nmaintain and grow strong markets for wood products. As we celebrate \nNational Forest Products Week, I thank the employers and employees of \nthe forest products industry for their contributions to Maine and the \nNation.\n  Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, in support of National Forest Products \nWeek, I would like to recognize the more than 25,000 hard-working men \nand women employed by the forest products industry in the great State \nof South Carolina. With an annual payroll of almost $1.7 billion and an \nestimated value of products manufactured in the State exceeding $9 \nbillion, the forest products industry is among the largest \nmanufacturing sectors in my State and the largest valued agricultural \ncrop.\n  This is the 55th consecutive year that we are recognizing the forest \nproducts industry for its contributions to our economy and to \nsustainable manufacturing. The world has changed a lot since the first \nNational Forest Products Week in 1960 and so has the industry.\n  Over the last few years, with new advancements in lumber and mass \ntimber technologies, the U.S. has begun innovative projects to build \ntall wood buildings. Over 17 tall wood buildings with over seven \nstories or more have been built around the world, which served as \ndemonstration projects. Due to the success of these tall wood \nbuildings, contractors and consumers are more confident than ever in \nthe safety and high performance of these buildings. Additionally, with \nthe right safety measures, tall wood buildings can be designed to meet \nand exceed fire safety requirements.\n  Wood buildings are durable and can be designed to last a lifetime. \nYears of real-life experiences and research have shown that wood \nbuildings can also withstand effects of major wind and seismic events. \nWhen designed and constructed properly, these structures are high \nperforming and provide the necessary strength and ductility to preserve \nbuilding function and provide life safety protection.\n  Similarly, paper and packaging products have grown with the demands \nof a 21st century global economy. Made from a recyclable and renewable \nresource, paper and paper-based packaging transport food, medicine, and \nmanufactured goods faster, further, safer, and more environmentally \nfriendly than ever before.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating National Forest \nProducts Week and reflect on the sustainable uses of America's forests \nand the important contributions they make to our economy and our \nnational life.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I wish to honor National Forest Products \nWeek. I would simply like to express my support for newly available and \ncontinuously evolving opportunities to build with wood.\n  In the State of Idaho, the forest products industry makes significant \ncontributions to our local, State, and national economies. In Idaho \nalone, we have 19 sawmills, millwork, and treating facilities and 4 \nfacilities making engineered wood and panel products. These products \nare increasingly used in buildings all around the globe.\n  As we all know, U.S. and global populations are rapidly growing. Over \nthe past several years, a number of tall wood projects have been \ncompleted around the world, demonstrating successful applications of \nnext generation lumber and mass timber technologies.\n  Today, the concept is gaining traction in the United States. More \narchitects are opting for a sustainable solution to attain safe, cost-\neffective, high-performing tall buildings in urban dense settings--many \nof these projects already do or will use engineered wood products.\n  With more than 17 tall wood buildings of seven stories or more having \nbeen built around the world serving as demonstration projects, building \nofficials, designers, contractors, and consumers are more confident \nthan ever in the safety of these buildings.\n  Thank you for this opportunity to recognize the many forest products \nfacilities and employers in my home State that are helping make these \ntall wood building projects become a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/senate-section/article/S7459-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7459-S7460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO OTTO MERIDA\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today, I wish to congratulate Otto \nMerida on his retirement after nearly 40 years of service to the Las \nVegas Latin Chamber of Commerce. It gives me great\n\n[[Page S7460]]\n\npleasure to recognize his years of hard work and dedication to Las \nVegas' Hispanic business community. I am proud to call Otto a friend.\n  Otto was born in Havana, Cuba, and came to the United States in the \nearly 1960s through a historic U.S. mission in Cuba known as Operation \nPeter Pan. He attended high school in Wilmington, DE, and received an \nassociate degree from North Florida Junior College and a bachelor's \ndegree in political science from the University of Florida. After \ngraduating, he worked with Volunteers In Service to America, VISTA, in \nMassachusetts as a community organizer and social worker. He then left \nVISTA and worked for the Fitchburg Chamber of Commerce.\n  He later came to Las Vegas in 1974 and began working for Nevada's \nDepartment of Education and the Comprehensive Employment and Training \nProgram. As someone who has traveled to Cuba and spent time with the \npeople, I recognize the importance of normalizing some relations with \nthis country. This is why I support lifting travel restrictions to and \nfrom Cuba. I am proud to see Otto represent his country in such a \npositive manner within our Nevada community. Beginning in 1976, Otto \nhelped organize Las Vegas' Latin Chamber of Commerce, LCC, and in 1978 \nbecame the executive director. In 2005, he was named president and \nchief executive officer of the LCC and the LCC Community Foundation. \nThis successful body now has over 13,000 members and is the premier \nLatin chamber serving the great State of Nevada. I am grateful that our \nState has had someone like Otto leading this incredible organization \nfor so many years. He is one of a kind and will be missed.\n  Without a doubt, Otto's work has had a great impact on Las Vegas' \nHispanic businesses both large and small. Through his unwavering \ncommitment, the Hispanic business community continues to grow and \nprosper. Otto has not only worked to build Las Vegas' Hispanic \nbusinesses in times of economic stability, but also helped to keep \nhard-working southern Nevada businessowners on their feet in times of \ngreat downturn. Along with his work to support local businesses, he has \nalso focused on philanthropic work, helping foster young Hispanic \nleaders through the Latino Youth Leadership Conference since 1993. In \naddition, he has contributed greatly in helping to grow scholarship \nfunds to go towards higher education for Las Vegas' Hispanic youth. \nThis community is fortunate that Otto has served as an ally and leader \nfor decades. To say he has had a positive impact on Las Vegas' Hispanic \nbusiness community would be an understatement. The strong foundation he \nhas built will be felt for years to come.\n  I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in thanking Otto for \nhis dedication to both Las Vegas' Hispanic business community and the \nLCC and in congratulating him on his retirement. He exemplifies the \nhighest standards of leadership and service and should be proud of his \nlong and meaningful career. I wish him well in all of his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/senate-section/article/S7460-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO WALTER GALVIN\n\n Ms. McCASKILL. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize \nand thank Walter Galvin for his years of service with Emerson, a great \nemployer for 125 years in the State of Missouri. Walt joined Emerson in \n1973 and has had an enormous impact on the company and the St. Louis \ncommunity.\n  Walt's service with Emerson began as the controller at the Ridge Tool \nsubsidiary. In 1993, he was named chief financial officer of Emerson \nand served in this role for 17 years. During his time as CFO, he served \nas a management member of Emerson's Board of Directors and as vice \nchairman. Walt retired from Emerson in February of 2013, but worked for \nEmerson for another 2 years to lend his expertise and knowledge to the \nnext generation of company leaders.\n  Walt's experience working at Emerson provided him with the insight \nnecessary to influence positive change in U.S. lawmaking. In 2004, he \nwas directly involved in the passage of the American Jobs Creation Act, \nwhich included many provisions intended to incentivize and expand \ndomestic manufacturing. He appeared as a witness many times before \ncommittees in the House and Senate, shedding light on the struggle \nAmerican companies face in such a competitive international environment \nand lending his expertise to discussions of our Tax Code and \ncomprehensive tax reform.\n  He served as a member of the Board Of Directors of the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce and as vice chairman and later, chairman of the Chamber's \ntax committee in Washington, DC. He also served on the board of the \nNational Association of Manufacturers, NAM, and, for a time, as the \nchairman of NAM's tax committee. Other companies such as Ameren \nCorporation, F.M. Global Insurance, and Aegion Corporation also count \nWalt as a director.\n  In addition to his service to Emerson and broader policy discussions, \nWalt was active in charitable endeavors in the St. Louis community. He \nserved on the board of Interco Charitable Foundation, the United Way of \nGreater St. Louis, and is the past president of the Saint Louis Zoo \nAssociation and Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital.\n  St. Louis and the entire State of Missouri are very lucky to have \nsuch a dedicated community leader making a difference on a local, \nState, and national level. I ask all of my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing Walter Galvin's impact on American businesses and leaders \nnationwide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/senate-section/article/S7460-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:04 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 3116) to extend \nby 15 years the authority of the Secretary of Commerce to conduct the \nquarterly financial report program.\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 10:46 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 3116.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania urging the United States \n     Congress to take all necessary action to prohibit any force \n     structure changes, to prohibit any transfer of AH-64 Apache \n     helicopters from the National Guard, and maintain the Army \n     National Guard at 350,200 soldiers until the National \n     Commission on the Future of the Army has reported its \n     findings to Congress in February 2016; to the Committee on \n     Armed Services.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 149\n\n       Whereas, The United States Army plans to transfer all \n     National Guard AH-64 Apache helicopters to active duty as \n     part of the United States Army's Restructuring Initiative; \n     and\n       Whereas, The United States Army has marked Pennsylvania's \n     55th Armored Brigade Combat Team (ABCT) for inactivation; and\n       Whereas, The 55th ABCT is headquartered in Scranton, \n     extends over the eastern portion of Pennsylvania and \n     approximately 3,500 Pennsylvanians serve with the 55th ABCT; \n     and\n       Whereas, Congress established the National Commission on \n     the Future of the Army, which is tasked with completing an \n     independent study on the proper size, force mixture and force \n     generation requirements for the army, and this commission is \n     required to report its findings during February 2016; and\n       Whereas, This comprehensive assessment will provide \n     Congressional members the opportunity to review and legislate \n     in response to the commission's recommendations; and\n       Whereas, There are 24 AH-64 Apache helicopters authorized \n     for the Pennsylvania Army National Guard (PAARNG) with a \n     significant portion of the allotment stationed at the John \n     Murtha Johnstown-Cambria County Airport; and\n       Whereas, Transferring the Apache helicopters would result \n     in the loss of 350 part-time personnel from the 1-104th \n     Attack Battalion and the stationing of PAARNG is an important \n     economic driver in the Johnstown area with an estimated \n     impact of nearly $45 million; and\n       Whereas, The economic necessity and the maintenance of \n     critical national defense units in the Johnstown area, \n     including the 1-104th Attack Battalion PAARNG and its \n     complement of Apache helicopters, dictates that the United \n     States Army reverse its decision to redeploy the helicopters; \n     and\n       Whereas, Units from the 55th ABCT have deployed multiple \n     times since 9/11, including deployments to Kosovo, Kuwait, \n     Egypt, Iraq and Afghanistan and units from the brigade have \n     earned multiple Navy Unit Commendations and Meritorious Unit \n     Commendations; and\n       Whereas, The army's current force proposals reduce the \n     total Army National Guard end strength from 350,200 to \n     342,000 during fiscal year 2016, and further, from 342,000 to \n     335,000 during fiscal year 2017; and\n       Whereas, Since 2000, the army has cut the Army National \n     Guard by 14 Brigade Combat Teams and increased the active \n     army by 12 Brigade Combat Teams, which have resulted in a \n     shift from the majority of force structure residing with the \n     Army National Guard to the majority of the force structure \n     contained within the active army; and\n       Whereas, The geographical location of Pennsylvania in \n     relation to the entire northeast corridor places the \n     Pennsylvania National Guard in a strategically accessible \n     position that can effectively respond at the Federal and \n     State level when needed for domestic emergencies or armed \n     conflicts; and\n       Whereas, The National Guard represents the best economic \n     value for the United States validated by the Department of \n     Defense stating in 2013 that a drilling guardsman is about \n     15% the cost of an active component soldier; and\n       Whereas, When Title 10 mobilized duty, a national guard \n     soldier only cost 80 to 95% as much as an active component \n     soldier: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved (the House of Representatives concurring), That \n     the General Assembly urge the United States Army to reverse \n     its decision to deactivate the 55th Armored Brigade Combat \n     Team and to reverse its decision to transfer any National \n     Guard AH-64 Apache helicopters to active duty; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the General Assembly urge Congress to take \n     all necessary action to prohibit any force structure changes, \n     to prohibit any transfer of AH-64 Apache helicopters from the \n     National Guard, and maintain the Army National Guard at \n     350,200 soldiers until the National Commission on the Future \n     of the Army has reported its findings to Congress in February \n     2016; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the Secretary of Defense \n     and to each member of Congress from Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-79.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California relative to the Armenian Genocide of \n     1915-1923, and calling upon the President of the United \n     States and the United States Congress to formally and \n     consistently reaffirm the historical truth that the \n     atrocities committed against the Armenian people constituted \n     genocide; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 2\n\n       Whereas, Armenians have resided in Asia Minor and the \n     Caucasus for approximately four millennia, and have a long \n     and rich history in the region, including the establishment \n     of many kingdoms, and despite Armenians' historic presence, \n     stewardship, and autonomy in the region, Turkish rulers of \n     the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Turkey subjected \n     Armenians to severe and unjust persecution and brutality, \n     including wholesale massacres beginning in the 1890s; and\n       Whereas, The Armenian nation was subjected to a systematic \n     and premeditated genocide officially beginning on April 24, \n     1915, at the hands of the Young Turk Government of the \n     Ottoman Empire from 1915-1919 and continued at the hands of \n     the Kemalist Movement of Turkey from 1920-1923 whereby over \n     1.5 million Armenian men, women, and children were \n     slaughtered or marched to their deaths in an effort to \n     annihilate the Armenian nation in the first genocide of \n     modern times, while thousands of surviving Armenian women and \n     children were forcibly converted and Islamized, and hundreds \n     of thousands more were subjected to ethnic cleansing during \n     the period of the modern Republic of Turkey from 1924-1937; \n     and\n       Whereas, During the genocides of the Christians living in \n     the Ottoman Empire and surrounding regions, which occurred \n     during the first one-half of the 20th century, 1.5 million \n     men, women, and children of Armenian descent, and hundreds of \n     thousands of Assyrians, Greeks, and other Christians, lost \n     their lives at the hands of the Ottoman Turkish Empire and \n     the Republic of Turkey, constituting one of the most \n     atrocious violations of human rights in the history of the \n     world; and\n       Whereas, These crimes against humanity also had the \n     consequence of permanently removing all traces of the \n     Armenians and other targeted people from their historic \n     homelands of more than four millennia, and enriching the \n     perpetrators with the lands and other property of the victims \n     of these crimes, including the usurpation of several thousand \n     churches; and\n       Whereas, In response to the genocide and at the behest of \n     President Woodrow Wilson and the United States State \n     Department, the Near East Relief organization was founded, \n     and became the first congressionally sanctioned American \n     philanthropic effort created exclusively to provide \n     humanitarian assistance and rescue to the Armenian nation and \n     other Christian minorities from annihilation, who went on to \n     survive and thrive outside of their ancestral homeland all \n     over the world and specifically in this state; and\n       Whereas, Near East Relief succeeded, with the active \n     participation of the citizens from this state, in delivering \n     $117 million in assistance, and saving more than one million \n     refugees, including 132,000 orphans, between 1915 and 1930, \n     by delivering food, clothing, and materials for shelter, \n     setting up refugee camps, clinics, hospitals, and orphanages; \n     and\n       Whereas, The Armenian nation survived the genocide despite \n     the attempt by the Ottoman Empire to exterminate it; and\n       Whereas, Adolf Hitler, in persuading his army commanders \n     that the merciless persecution and killing of Jews, Poles, \n     and other people would bring no retribution, declared, ``Who, \n     after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the \n     Armenians?''; and\n       Whereas, On November 4, 1918, immediately after the \n     collapse of the Young Turk regime and before the founding of \n     the Republic of Turkey by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1923, the \n     Ottoman Parliament considered a motion on the crimes \n     committed by the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP): ``A \n     population of one million people guilty of nothing except \n     belonging to the Armenian nation were massacred and \n     exterminated, including even women and children.'' The \n     Minister of Interior at the time, Fethi Bey, responded by \n     telling the Parliament: ``It is the intention of the \n     government to cure every single injustice done up until now, \n     as far as the means allow, to make possible the return to \n     their homes of those sent into exile, and to compensate for \n     their material loss as far as possible''; and\n       Whereas, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk made a historic admission in \n     an interview published in the Los Angeles Examiner on August \n     1, 1926: ``These leftovers from the former Young Turk Party, \n     who should have been made accountable for the lives of \n     millions of our Christian subjects who were ruthlessly \n     driven, en masse, from their homes and massacred''; and\n       Whereas, The Parliamentary Investigative Committee \n     proceeded to collect relevant documents describing the \n     actions of those responsible for the Armenian mass killings \n     and turned them over to the Turkish Military Tribunal. CUP's \n     leading figures were found guilty of massacring Armenians and \n     hanged or given lengthy prison sentences. The Turkish \n     Military Tribunal requested that Germany extradite to Turkey \n     the masterminds of the massacres who had fled the country. \n     After German refusal, they were tried in absentia and \n     sentenced to death; and\n       Whereas, Unlike other people and governments that have \n     admitted and denounced the abuses and crimes of predecessor \n     regimes, and despite the Turkish government's earlier \n     admissions and the overwhelming proof of genocidal intent, \n     the Republic of Turkey inexplicably and adamantly has denied \n     the occurrence of the crimes against humanity committed by \n     the Ottoman and Young Turk rulers for many years, and \n     continues to do so a full century since the first crimes \n     constituting genocide occurred; and\n       Whereas, Those denials compound the grief of the few \n     remaining survivors of the atrocities, desecrate the memory \n     of the victims, cause continuing pain to the descendants of \n     the victims, and deprive the surviving Armenian nation, both \n     on individual and collective levels, of their ancestral land, \n     property, culture, heritage, financial assets, and population \n     growth; and\n       Whereas, The Republic of Turkey has escalated its \n     international campaign of Armenian Genocide denial, \n     maintained its blockade of Armenia, and increased its \n     pressure on the small but growing movement in Turkey \n     acknowledging the Armenian Genocide and seeking justice for \n     this systematic campaign of destruction of millions of \n     Armenians, Greeks, Assyrians, and other Christians upon their \n     biblical-era homelands; and\n       Whereas, Those citizens of Turkey, both Armenian and non-\n     Armenian, who continue to speak the truth about the Armenian \n     Genocide, such as human rights activist and journalist Hrant \n     Dink, continue to be silenced by violent means; and\n       Whereas, There is continued concern about the welfare of \n     Christians in the Republic of Turkey, their right to worship \n     and practice freely, and the legal status and condition of \n     thousands of ancient Armenian churches, monasteries, \n     cemeteries, and other historical and cultural structures, \n     sites, and antiquities in the Republic of Turkey; and\n       Whereas, The United States is on record as having \n     officially recognized the Armenian Genocide in the United \n     States government's May 28, 1951, written statement to the \n     International Court of Justice regarding the Reservations to \n     the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime \n     of Genocide, through President Ronald Reagan's April 22, \n     1981, Proclamation No. 4838, and by congressional legislation \n     including House Joint Resolution 148 adopted on April 9, \n     1975, and House Joint Resolution 247 adopted on September 12, \n     1984; and\n       Whereas, Even prior to the Convention on the Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the United States has a \n     record of having sought to justly and constructively address \n     the consequences of the Ottoman Empire's intentional \n     destruction of the Armenian people, including through United \n     States Senate Concurrent Resolution 12 adopted on February 9, \n     1916, United States Senate Resolution 359 adopted on May 11, \n     1920, and President Woodrow Wilson's November 22, 1920, \n     decision entitled, ``The Frontier between Armenia and \n     Turkey,'' which was issued as a binding arbitral award, yet \n     has not been enforced to this date despite its legally \n     binding status; and\n       Whereas, President Barack Obama entered office ``calling \n     for Turkey's acknowledgment of the Armenian Genocide'' and on \n     April 24, 2013, and similarly on April 24, 2014, he further \n     stated, ``A full, frank, and just acknowledgment of the facts \n     is in all of our interests. Peoples and nations grow \n     stronger, and build a more just and tolerant future, by \n     acknowledging and reckoning with painful elements of the \n     past''; and\n       Whereas, California is home to the largest Armenian-\n     American population in the\n\n[[Page S7465]]\n\n     United States, and Armenians living in California have \n     enriched our state through their leadership and contribution \n     in business, agriculture, academia, government, and the arts, \n     many of whom have family members who experienced firsthand \n     the horror and evil of the Armenian Genocide and its ongoing \n     denial; and\n       Whereas, Every person should be made aware and educated \n     about the Armenian Genocide and other crimes against \n     humanity, and this state has been at the forefront of \n     encouraging and promoting a curriculum relating to human \n     rights and genocide in order to empower future generations to \n     prevent the recurrence of genocide; and\n       Whereas, April 24, 1915, is globally observed and \n     recognized as the commencement of the Armenian Genocide and \n     April 24, 2015, will mark the centennial anniversary since \n     the commencement of the Armenian Genocide; and\n       Whereas, Armenians in this state and throughout the world, \n     have not been provided with justice for the crimes \n     perpetrated against the Armenian nation despite the fact that \n     a century has passed since the crimes were first committed; \n     and\n       Whereas, The Armenian people, in this state and elsewhere, \n     remain resolved and their spirit continues to thrive a \n     century after their near annihilation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature hereby designates \n     the year of 2015 as ``State of California Year of \n     Commemoration of the Centennial Anniversary of the Armenian \n     Genocide of 1915-1923'' and in doing so, intends, through the \n     enactment of legislation, that the Armenian Genocide is \n     properly commemorated and taught to its citizens and visitors \n     through statewide educational and cultural events; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature hereby designates April 24, \n     2015, as ``State of California Day of Commemoration of the \n     Centennial Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide of 1915-\n     1923''; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature commends its conscientious \n     educators who teach about human rights and genocide, and \n     intends for them, through the enactment of legislation, to \n     continue to enhance their efforts to educate students at all \n     levels about the experience of the Armenians and other crimes \n     against humanity; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature hereby commends the \n     extraordinary service which was delivered by Near East Relief \n     to the survivors of the Armenian Genocide and the Assyrian \n     Genocide, including thousands of direct beneficiaries of \n     American philanthropy who are the parents, grandparents, and \n     great-grandparents of many Californian Armenians and \n     Assyrians, and pledges its intent, through the enactment of \n     legislation, to working with community groups, nonprofit \n     organizations, citizens, state personnel, and the community \n     at large to host statewide educational and cultural events; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature deplores the persistent, \n     ongoing efforts by any person, in this country or abroad, to \n     deny the historical fact of the Armenian Genocide; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature respectfully calls upon the \n     President of the United States and the United States Congress \n     to formally and consistently reaffirm the historical truth \n     that the atrocities committed against the Armenian people \n     constituted genocide; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature calls on the President of \n     the United States to work toward equitable, constructive, \n     stable, and durable Armenian-Turkish relations; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States, to the Governor of California, \n     to every member of the California State Legislature, and to \n     the Superintendent of Public Instruction.\n                                  ____\n\n  \n\n       POM-84.

In 1991, the UPPCO announced \n     intentions to sell the land currently under lease to an \n     intermediary who would simultaneously sell the land to the \n     United States Forest Service (USFS). Existing leaseholders \n     were offered an option to sign a 25-year, nonrenewable lease \n     on the land that was to be sold or to immediately vacate the \n     property. The leases were signed in March of 1992, and the \n     United States Forest Service (USFS) took control of the land \n     in June 1992. The land currently under private lease accounts \n     for less than 1,100 acres in the Ottawa National Forest; and\n       Whereas, Hundreds of people have experienced the wonders of \n     Michigan's great outdoors at these hunting camps. The Ottawa \n     National Forest is almost one million acres of rolling hills, \n     lakes, rivers, waterfalls, and abundant wildlife. Those who \n     lease land in the forest have built outdoor recreational \n     traditions with their families. The hunting camps allow them \n     to experience the seclusion and isolated environment of the \n     Ottawa National Forest while engaging in varied recreational \n     activities, including hunting, fishing, canoeing, and \n     snowshoeing; and\n       Whereas, The USFS has informed leaseholders that leases \n     will not be renewed at the end of 2016 because it is national \n     policy not to lease national forest land to individuals. The \n     holders of the active leases will have 90 days after the \n     leases expire to remove the hunting cabins and return the \n     land to its natural state; and\n       Whereas, The expiration of the leases will hurt local \n     economies in Ontonagon and Gogebic Counties. It will result \n     in over $35,000 in lost lease fee revenue to the townships \n     and almost $10,000 in tax revenue to the counties. Even a \n     greater loss will be realized by local businesses, including \n     gas stations, grocery stores, hardware stores, and \n     restaurants that benefit from the patronage of the camp \n     families; and\n       Whereas, The expiration of the leases will eliminate refuge \n     for people from the occasionally harsh and unexpected shifts \n     in weather conditions. The Ottawa National Forest covers a \n     large area in the western Upper Peninsula. Camp owners often \n     leave their cabins or outbuildings unlocked to the relief of \n     individuals stranded in the woods who have sought shelter. A \n     Boy Scout troop once sheltered at the Twin Pines camp after \n     being caught in a storm, and a group of snowmobilers is known \n     to regularly rest at one of the camps; and\n       Whereas, The USFS Recreation Residence Program provides \n     private citizens an opportunity to own single-family cabins \n     in designated areas of national forests. Currently, 15,570 \n     recreation residences occupy national forest system lands \n     throughout the country; and\n       Whereas, Although the National Forest Service placed a \n     moratorium on the establishment of new tracts under the \n     Recreation Residence program in 1968, the authority to issue \n     special use authorization under the Recreation Residence \n     program remains in federal regulations (36 CFR Part 251). \n     Therefore, lifting that moratorium for the limited purpose of \n     establishing a Recreation Residence tract in the Ottawa \n     National Forest and issuing special use authorization permits \n     is possible and would allow the many families currently \n     leasing in the Ottawa National Forest an opportunity that is \n     provided to thousands of people elsewhere in the country; and\n       Whereas, Converting to the Recreation Residence Program \n     would maintain a tax base for local governments, provide \n     continuing support for the local economy, and ensure that \n     hunting and recreational traditions held so dear by Michigan \n     residents continue to be experienced in the Ottawa National \n     Forest: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we encourage the United States \n     Forest Service to issue the owners of privately-held camps on \n     leased acres within the Ottawa National Forest special use \n     authorization under the Recreation Residence Program; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Chief of the United States Forest Service and the members \n     of the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-86. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States \n     Congress to take such actions as are necessary to regulate \n     airline baggage fees and processes for consumers as it \n     relates to transportation of passenger luggage and passenger \n     delays resulting from lost, damaged, or delayed luggage; to \n     the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 207\n\n       Whereas, deregulation of the airline industry in the United \n     States began more than three decades ago in 1978; and\n       Whereas, a consequence of deregulation was the elimination \n     of federal control over many airline business practices, \n     including pricing and domestic route selection; and\n       Whereas, though deregulation limits federal control of \n     airline business practices generally, the federal government \n     continues to legislate and enforce certain consumer \n     protections for airline passengers; and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress largely determines the \n     degree to which certain rights of airline passengers are \n     codified in law or developed through regulatory rulemaking; \n     and\n       Whereas, since deregulation, the primary means of \n     competition amongst airlines has progressively centered on \n     price, not service; and\n       Whereas, certain concerns for passengers of airlines \n     include increasing baggage fees and passenger delays \n     resulting from lost, damaged, or delayed passenger luggage; \n     and\n       Whereas, the airline industry began to charge passengers a \n     checked baggage fee per bag to curtail rising jet fuel costs \n     and to supplement marginal revenue during times of economic \n     decline; and\n       Whereas, as a result of increasing airline baggage fees \n     charged by airlines for checked luggage, passengers are \n     encouraged to increase the contents of carry-on luggage to \n     avoid the extra cost of baggage fees; and\n\n[[Page S7466]]\n\n       Whereas, increased carry-on luggage of boarding airline \n     passengers may be correlated to the claims of lost, damaged, \n     or delayed passenger luggage, because passengers are \n     oftentimes asked to check carry-on luggage at the boarding \n     gate, which may require passengers to wait for such luggage \n     after deboarding an aircraft, or luggage and contents may \n     become damaged during the process of fitting carry-on luggage \n     onto boarded aircrafts; and\n       Whereas, although checked luggage may be lost, damaged, or \n     delayed for a variety of reasons, baggage handling systems, \n     airline negligence, and the act of luggage offloading to \n     accommodate extra fuel have also been discussed as reasons \n     for lost, damaged, or delayed passenger luggage; and\n       Whereas, the aforementioned concerns of airline passengers \n     are issues of consumer protection for which the United States \n     Congress has the constitutional power to address and \n     determine fair and reasonable solutions through codified law \n     or regulatory rulemaking: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to regulate airline baggage fees and \n     processes for consumers as it relates to transportation of \n     passenger luggage and passenger delays resulting from lost, \n     damaged, or delayed luggage; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-87. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States \n     Congress and the Louisiana Congressional Delegation to take \n     such actions as are necessary to rectify the revenue sharing \n     inequities between coastal and interior energy producing \n     states; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 167\n\n       Whereas, since 1920, interior states have been allowed to \n     keep fifty percent of the oil, gas, and coal production \n     revenues generated in their states from mineral production on \n     federal lands within their borders, including royalties, \n     severance taxes, and bonuses; and\n       Whereas, coastal states with onshore and offshore oil and \n     gas production face inequities under the federal energy \n     policies because those coastal states have not been party to \n     this same level of revenue sharing partnership with the \n     federal government; and\n       Whereas, coastal energy producing states have a limited \n     partnership with the federal government that provides for \n     them to retain very little revenue generated from their \n     offshore energy production, energy that is produced for use \n     throughout the nation; and\n       Whereas, in 2006 congress passed the Gulf of Mexico Energy \n     Security Act (GOMESA) that will fully go into effect in 2017; \n     an act that calls for a sharing of thirty-seven and five \n     tenths percent of coastal production revenues with four gulf \n     states with a cap of $500 million per year; and\n       Whereas, the Fixing America's Inequities with Revenues \n     (FAIR) Act would have addressed the inequity suffered by \n     coastal oil and gas producing states by accelerating the \n     implementation of GOMESA as well as by gradually lifting all \n     revenue sharing caps but the legislation died with the close \n     of the previous congress; and\n       Whereas, with the state and its offshore waters taken \n     alone, Louisiana is the ninth largest producer of oil in the \n     United States in 2014 while including offshore oil from \n     federal waters, it was the second largest oil producer in the \n     country; and when taken alone Louisiana was the fourth \n     largest producer of gas in the United States in 2013 while \n     including the Gulf of Mexico waters, it was the second \n     largest producer in the United States; and\n       Whereas, with nineteen operating refineries in the state, \n     Louisiana was second only to Texas as of January 2014 in both \n     total and operating refinery capacity, accounting for nearly \n     one-fifth of the nation's total refining capacity; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana's contributions to the United States \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve with two facilities located in \n     the state consisting of twenty-nine caverns capable of \n     holding nearly three hundred million barrels of crude oil; \n     and\n       Whereas, with three onshore liquified natural gas \n     facilities, more than any other state in the country, and the \n     Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, the nation's only deepwater oil \n     port, Louisiana plays an essential role in the movement of \n     natural gas from the United States Gulf Coast region to \n     markets throughout the country; and\n       Whereas, it is apparent that Louisiana plays an essential \n     role in supplying the nation with energy and it is vital to \n     the security of our nation's energy supply, roles that should \n     be recognized and compensated at an appropriate revenue \n     sharing level; and\n       Whereas, the majority of the oil and gas production from \n     the Gulf of Mexico enters the United States through coastal \n     Louisiana with all of the infrastructure necessary to receive \n     and transport such production, infrastructure that has for \n     many decades damaged the coastal areas of Louisiana, an \n     impact that should be compensated through appropriate revenue \n     sharing with the federal government; and\n       Whereas, because Louisiana is losing more coastal wetlands \n     than any other state in the country, in 2006 the people of \n     Louisiana overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment \n     dedicating revenues received from Outer Continental Shelf oil \n     and gas activity to the Coastal Protection and Restoration \n     Fund for the purposes of coastal protection, including \n     conservation, coastal restoration, hurricane protection, and \n     infrastructure directly impacted by coastal wetland losses; \n     and\n       Whereas, the state of Louisiana has developed a science-\n     based ``Comprehensive Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast'' \n     which identifies and prioritizes the most efficient and \n     effective projects in order to meet the state's critical \n     coastal protection and restoration needs; and\n       Whereas, the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority \n     is making great progress implementing the projects in the \n     ``Comprehensive Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast'' with \n     all available funding, projects that are essential to the \n     protection of the infrastructure that is critical to the \n     energy needs of the United States; and\n       Whereas, in order to properly compensate the coastal states \n     for the infrastructure demands that result from production of \n     energy and fuels that heat and cool the nation's homes, \n     offices, and businesses and fuel the nation's transportation \n     needs, revenue sharing for coastal states needs to be at the \n     same rate as interior states that produce oil, gas, and coal: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to treat mineral and gas production in the \n     Gulf Coastal states in a manner that is at least equal to \n     onshore oil, gas, and coal production in interior states for \n     revenue purposes; and to rectify the revenue sharing \n     inequities between coastal and interior energy producing \n     states in order to address the nationally significant crisis \n     of wetland loss in the state of Louisiana; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-88.

A resolution adopted by the Michigan Senate urging \n     the United States Congress to restore Great Lakes Restoration \n     Initiative funding to 300 million dollars for fiscal year \n     2016; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 42\n\n       Whereas, the Great Lakes are a critical resource for our \n     nation, supporting the economy and a way of life in Michigan \n     and the other seven states with the Great Lakes region. The \n     Great Lakes hold 20 percent of the world's surface freshwater \n     and 95 percent of the United States' surface freshwater. This \n     globally significant freshwater resource provides drinking \n     water for more than 30 million people and is an economic \n     driver that supports jobs, commerce, agriculture, \n     transportation, and tourism throughout the region; and\n       Whereas, The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) \n     provides essential funding to restore and protect the Great \n     Lakes. This funding has support long overdue efforts to clean \n     up toxic pollution, reduce runoff from cities and farms, \n     combat invasive species like the Asian carp, and restore fish \n     and wildlife habitat. Since 2010, the federal government has \n     invested nearly $2 billion in more then 2,000 projects \n     through the GLRI. Over its first five years, the GLRI has \n     provided more then $280 million for 580 projects in Michigan \n     alone; and\n       Whereas, GLRI projects are making a significant difference. \n     They have restored more than 115,000 acres of fish and \n     wildlife habitat; opened up fish access to more then 3,400 \n     miles of rivers; helped implement conservation programs on \n     more than 1 million areas of farmland; and accelerated the \n     cleanup of toxic hotspots. In Michigan, GLRI funding has been \n     instrumental in removing contaminated sediments from Muskegon \n     Lake, the River Raisin, and the St. Mary's River, restoring \n     habitat along the St. Clair River, Cass River, Boardman \n     River, and the Keweenaw Peninsula; and developing improved \n     methods for sea lamprey control; and\n       Whereas, While this is a significant investment, there is \n     still more work to be done with numerous ready-to-go projects \n     that need funding. Toxic algal blooms, beach closings, fish \n     consumption advisories, and the presence of contaminated \n     sediments continue to limit the recreational and commercial \n     use of the Great Lakes. The 2014 shutdown of the city of \n     Toledo's drinking water system due to a toxic algal bloom, \n     forcing more than a half million people to find another \n     source of drinking water, is just one example of how much \n     still needs to be done; and\n       Whereas, Proposed cuts to GLRI funding would jeopardize the \n     momentum from a decade of unprecedented regional and \n     bipartisan cooperation. The FY 2016 executive budget \n     recommends a $50 million cut in federal funding to $250 \n     million. This cut would be a shortsighted, cost-saving \n     measure with long-term implications. Restoration efforts will \n     only become more expensive and more difficult if they are not \n     addressed in the coming years: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we urge the Congress of the \n     United States to restore Great Lakes Restoration Initiative \n     funding to $300 million for fiscal year 2016; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-91. A resolution adopted by the Michigan Senate \n     opposing the United States Environmental Protection Agency's \n     efforts to study or commission a study that could lead to \n     regulations on grills and barbecues; to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 56\n\n       Whereas, Barbecues are an American tradition enjoyed by \n     families from all walks of life across the country. Whether \n     tailgating for a football game, hosting a backyard get-\n     together, or just grilling a summer meal, barbecues are a \n     quintessentially American experience and an opportunity to \n     eat and socialize with family and friends; and\n       Whereas, Cooking outdoors on a grill during the summer \n     saves electricity. Using a grill prevents the release of heat \n     into the kitchen and other living spaces. while cooking \n     indoors heats up a kitchen, forcing cooling systems. such as \n     the refrigerator and air conditioner, to work harder and use \n     more energy; and\n       Whereas, The United States Environmental Protection Agency \n     (EPA), our nation's environmental regulatory agency, has \n     funded a University of California-Riverside student project \n     to develop preventative technology to reduce emissions from \n     residential barbecues. By funding this project, the EPA is \n     apparently intent on finding a solution to a problem that \n     does not exist and demonstrating an unnecessary interest and \n     concern over the impact of backyard barbecues on public \n     health: and\n       Whereas, Based on the EPA's past practices, today's study, \n     no matter how small, is a concern to Michiganders and \n     Americans, as it is inevitably the first step towards \n     tomorrow's regulation of this American pastime. To fulfill \n     its mission to protect human health and the environment, the \n     EPA's primary tool has been, and continues to be, regulatory \n     mandates that I time and again ignore the financial. \n     economic, and social burdens to the state and the country. \n     The regulation of barbecues would be the latest, egregious \n     example of overreach by the EPA; and\n       Whereas, Funding such a study is a poor use of taxpayer \n     dollars. In the face of record national debts, annual budget \n     deficits, and other profound problems the country is facing, \n     surely the federal government can better use our resources \n     than on a study of grills and backyard barbecues: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we oppose the United States \n     Environmental Protection Agency's efforts to study or \n     commission a study that, if consistent with the agency's past \n     practices, many fear will serve as the first step towards the \n     regulation of grills and barbecues: and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection \n     Agency and the members of the Michigan congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-92. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Commonwealth of Massachusetts promoting a multilateral \n     approach to the potential crisis in the Dominican Republic; \n     to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                              Resolutions\n\n       Whereas, Massachusetts, the first cradle of liberty, has a \n     long history of diverse activism and advocacy regarding the \n     issue of equality and civil rights; and\n       Whereas, The connection between Massachusetts and Haiti \n     dates back to the civil\n\n[[Page S7468]]\n\n     war during which time U.S. Senator Charles Sumner, who served \n     Massachusetts from 1852 to 1874, fought for the passage of \n     federal legislation in 1862 which enabled the United States \n     of America to recognize Haiti as a sovereign nation; and\n       Whereas, In 1871, in recognition of his diplomatic work on \n     this issue, president of Haiti Nissage Saget presented \n     Senator Sumner with a gold medal on behalf of the Haitian \n     people, which currently resides in the Massachusetts state \n     house in Boston; and\n       Whereas, Despite their shared history and geographical \n     proximity, Haiti and the Dominican Republic have often faced \n     challenging diplomatic relations; and\n       Whereas, In September 2013, the constitutional court of the \n     Dominican Republic issued a ruling that would denaturalize \n     people born in the Dominican Republic after 1929 whose \n     parents were noncitizens, the majority of whom are Dominicans \n     of Haitian descent; and\n       Whereas, The constitutional court's ruling effectively \n     stripped these persons of their identity and affiliation with \n     the Dominican Republic, rendering them stateless and \n     subjecting them to the risk of deportation from the country \n     of their birth; and\n       Whereas, In May 2014, the Dominican Republic passed special \n     law 169-14, which required persons affected by the 2013 \n     constitutional court's decision to be re-recognized as \n     citizens or apply to gain state recognition based on their \n     birth status and year; and\n       Whereas, The deadlines set forth in the 2014 naturalization \n     law allowed for only a fraction of this population to be re-\n     recognized thereby rendering tens of thousands of Dominicans \n     of Haitian descent vulnerable to deportation, discrimination \n     and loss of livelihood; and\n       Whereas, Later that same year, in response to a ruling by \n     the inter-American court of human rights deeming the 2013 and \n     2014 actions of the Dominican Republic to be in violation of \n     the American convention to which the Dominican Republic is \n     party, the Dominican Republic's constitutional court declared \n     the country would no longer recognize the authority of the \n     inter-American court; and\n       Whereas, Both the rulings of the constitutional court and \n     special law 169-14 have further separated Dominicans of \n     Haitian descent from the larger Dominican community; and\n       Whereas, The majority of Dominicans of Haitian descent, \n     threatened by deportation, have no family or support networks \n     in Haiti nor are they fluent in French or Haitian creole; and\n       Whereas, Article 15 of the universal declaration of human \n     rights, of which the Dominican Republic and the United States \n     of America are signatories, states that, ``no one shall be \n     arbitrarily deprived of his nationality nor denied the right \n     to change his nationality''; and\n       Whereas, Recognizing the impact that this crisis will have \n     on all nations in the western hemisphere, the Caribbean \n     community and Common Market Secretariat (Caricom) has called \n     for a moratorium on this law; and\n       Whereas, At the urging of other concerned nations, the \n     organization of American states sent a special mission to the \n     Dominican Republic and Haiti in order to investigate the \n     situation between the two countries to prepare a report for \n     the secretary general of the organization of American states; \n     and\n       Whereas, A broad coalition of humanitarian, academic, \n     legal, political and civil rights groups from across \n     Massachusetts, including but not limited to: the Irish \n     International Immigrant Center, Haitian Americans United, \n     Inc., Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts, Catholic \n     Charities' Haitian Multi-service Center of Boston, as well as \n     the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti call for \n     immediate action by the Dominican government to reverse the \n     effects of the constitutional court rulings and special law \n     169-14: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Massachusetts general court requests the \n     U.S. State department and the U.S. Secretary of State to \n     pursue a multilateral approach to promptly address the \n     potential crisis in the Dominican Republic that could render \n     tens of thousands of dominicans of haitian descent stateless; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of these resolutions be transmitted \n     forthwith by the clerk of the Senate to the President of the \n     United States of America, the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States Congress, Secretary of \n     State John Kerry and United States Ambassador to the \n     Dominican Republic James Brewster.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-93.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States \n     Congress to take such actions as are necessary to work to \n     adopt policies that will help with the stability and the \n     viability of the domestic shrimp industry, including support \n     for the Imported Seafood Safety Standards Act; to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 225\n\n       Whereas, consumption of seafood is one of the fastest \n     growing areas of our nation's food supply with shrimp being \n     one of the most consumed seafood products in the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas, over three-fourths of the seafood consumed in the \n     United States is imported from other countries around the \n     world with shrimp as the leading fresh or frozen product \n     imported into the United States accounting for about twenty-\n     eight percent of all seafood imports by weight; and\n       Whereas, most of the shrimp consumed in the United States \n     is grown in man-made ponds along the coasts of Thailand, \n     Vietnam, Ecuador, and other tropical countries rather than \n     being harvested from the waters of the Gulf of Mexico; and\n       Whereas, the countries that produce most of the shrimp \n     consumed worldwide support their shrimp hatcheries with large \n     state subsidies to keep the price of their shrimp lower than \n     the prices that our domestic Gulf of Mexico shrimpers need to \n     charge in order to just break even; and\n       Whereas, the Tariff Act of 1930, a law originally \n     introduced to protect farmers from imports, allows United \n     States industries to ``petition the government for relief \n     from imports that benefit from subsidies provided through \n     foreign government programs''; and\n       Whereas, the United States Department of Commerce launched \n     an investigation in 2013 to determine whether there was \n     sufficient evidence to support the claim that the seven \n     largest shrimp-producing countries were subsidizing their \n     shrimp industries, an investigation that will run \n     concurrently with the International Trade Commission's (ITC) \n     examination of whether the subsidies are causing significant \n     injury to United States producers with both investigations \n     needing to call for countervailing duties before any \n     penalties could be applied; and\n       Whereas, in September 2013, the ITC voted to throw out the \n     shrimp countervailing duty case based on the fact that injury \n     to the domestic industry was not proven, thus removing the \n     possibility of a countervailing duty and terminating the \n     shrimp subsidy investigation against Ecuador, China, India, \n     Malaysia, and Vietnam; and\n       Whereas, the ITC's decision has had a devastating impact on \n     the domestic shrimp industry, including the shrimpers \n     trawling the Gulf of Mexico and landing their shrimp at \n     Louisiana docks; and\n       Whereas, without relief from the unfair foreign competition \n     undercutting the domestic shrimp prices, the prices that \n     shrimpers\n\n[[Page S7469]]\n\n     are getting at the dock have dropped over fifty percent from \n     last year making it almost impossible for shrimpers to earn \n     enough money to provide for their families; and\n       Whereas, the Imported Seafood Safety Standards Act \n     introduced in the United States Senate by Louisiana Senator \n     David Vitter is being supported by the American Shrimp \n     Processors Association and it specifically targets foreign \n     food imported into the United States with hopes of tightening \n     testing standards, increasing inspection standards on foreign \n     imported seafood, requiring placement of United States safety \n     standards for foreign exporters, and increasing severe \n     penalties for exporters who fail food safety inspections, \n     ultimately benefitting the American shrimp industry: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to work to adopt policies that will help \n     with the stability and the viability of the domestic shrimp \n     industry including support for the Imported Seafood Safety \n     Standards Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-95. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan urging the United States Congress to enact \n     legislation that requires uniform and science-based food \n     labeling nationwide; to the Committee on Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 59\n\n       Whereas, In the absence of a federal genetically modified \n     organism (GMO) labeling standard, some states and localities \n     have developed a patchwork of labeling proposals that can be \n     confusing and misleading to consumers. Multiple local \n     regulations increase agriculture and food production costs, \n     requiring food companies operating in Michigan to create \n     separate supply chains to be developed for each state; and\n       Whereas, GMOs are found in 70 to 80 percent of the foods we \n     eat and play a vital role in maintaining Michigan's \n     agriculture, food processing, and other industries. In 2014, \n     100 percent of all sugar beets, 93 percent of all corn, and \n     91 percent of all soybeans grown in Michigan were genetically \n     modified; and\n       Whereas, A maze of regulations would cripple interstate \n     commerce throughout the food supply and distribution chain \n     and ultimately increase grocery prices for consumers by \n     hundreds of dollars each year. A Cornell University study \n     found that a patchwork of state labeling laws would increase \n     food costs for a family by an average of $500 per year; and\n       Whereas, On July 23, 2015, the U.S. House of \n     Representatives passed bipartisan legislation--the Safe and \n     Accurate Food Labeling Act (H.R. 1599)--to avoid this \n     patchwork of regulations and the costly challenges it \n     creates; and\n       Whereas, Senate passage of the Safe and Accurate Food \n     Labeling Act will allow consumers to have access to accurate \n     and consistent information on products that contain GMOs by \n     ensuring that labeling is national, uniform, and science-\n     based. The bill also establishes a United States Department \n     of Agriculture (USDA)-administered certification and labeling \n     program, modeled after the USDA National Organic Program for \n     non-GMO, organic foods: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we urge the United States \n     Congress to enact legislation that requires uniform and \n     science-based food labeling nationwide; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-96.

It protects everyone from sex-\n     based discrimination, regardless of real or perceived sex, \n     gender identity, or gender expression; and\n       Whereas, Although Title IX has increased opportunities for \n     girls and women in academics, sports, and other educational \n     activities, it has not yet achieved the goal of full \n     equality: Now therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature urges Californians \n     to continue to work together to achieve the goals set by \n     Title IX of increased opportunities for girls and women in \n     academics, sports, and other educational activities; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the State of California, \n     on June 23, 2015, commemorates the 43rd anniversary of Title \n     IX, and commends the national movement toward increased \n     equality and fair treatment of all students; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, and to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-97.

PAEs assert \n     these patents against businesses of all sizes and in all \n     industries, often years after the product has become standard \n     and widely used; and\n       Whereas, PAEs rarely earn successful judgments in court, \n     underscoring the questionable merits of these particular \n     patent cases. However, given the high cost and risks \n     associated with patent litigation, most defendants choose to \n     settle in order to avoid further financial loss. Indeed, many \n     PAEs will offer royalty settlements below market value in \n     order to encourage settlement and avoid trial; and\n\n[[Page S7470]]\n\n       Whereas, Predatory PAEs have a detrimental impact on the \n     economy and innovation. PAE activities cost businesses $29 \n     billion directly, mostly borne by small- and medium-sized \n     businesses; and\n       Whereas, The growth of patent litigation is directly tied \n     to aggressive PAEs in recent years.

A bill to promote the use of clean cookstoves and fuels to \nsave lives, improve livelihoods, empower women, and protect the \nenvironment by creating a thriving global market for clean and \nefficient household cooking solutions; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Clean \nCookstoves and Fuels Support Act. This bill addresses a serious global \npublic health and environmental issue. I am very pleased to be joined \nin this effort by my friend and colleague Senator Durbin.\n  Nearly half of the world's people cook over open fires or \ninefficient, polluting, and unsafe cookstoves using agricultural waste, \ncoal, dung, wood or other solid fuels. Smoke from these traditional \ncookstoves and open fires is associated with chronic and acute diseases \nthat affect women and children disproportionately. The black carbon \nfrom these traditional cookstoves is also a significant driver of air \npollution and climate change.\n  Alarmingly, the World Health Organization found that in 2012 this \ntype of air pollution claimed 4.3 million lives. Millions more are \nsickened from the toxic fumes, and thousands suffer\n\n[[Page S7473]]\n\nburns annually from open fires or unsafe cookstoves. The Global Burden \nof Disease Study of 2010 doubled the mortality estimates for exposure \nto smoke from cookstoves, referred to as ``household air pollution,'' \nfrom 2 million to 4 million deaths annually. That is more than the \ndeaths from malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS combined. This same \nstudy ranks household air pollution as the fourth worst overall health \nrisk factor in the world and is the second worst health risk factor in \nthe world for women and girls.\n  Traditional cookstoves also create serious environmental problems. \nRecent studies show that the emissions of black carbon or common soot \nfrom these cookstoves significantly contribute to regional air \npollution and climate change. In fact, black carbon emissions from \nresidential cookstoves in developing countries are responsible for as \nmuch as 25 percent of black carbon emissions. Moreover, each family can \nrequire up to two tons of cooking fuel, and where the demand for fuel \noutstrips the natural regrowth of resources, local environmental \ndegradation and loss of biodiversity can result.\n  The collection of this fuel is also a burden that is shouldered \ndisproportionately by women and children. In some areas, women and \ngirls risk rape and other violence during the up to 20 hours per week \nthey spend away from their families gathering fuel. This often means \nthese women and girls have far less time to pursue an education, to \ngenerate income or to participate in other community activities, and \nthis marginalizes their role in society. A new report by McKinsey \nGlobal Institute estimates that the world economy could increase by \nbetween $12 trillion and $28 trillion over 10 years if the \nparticipation of women was to equal that of men.\n  Replacing these cookstoves with modern alternatives would help \nreverse these alarming health, environmental, and economic trends, and \nit would be relatively inexpensive. In fact, there are stoves that are \ncoming on the market that cost as little as $20 that are 50 percent \nmore efficient than the traditional cooking methods. It could also be \ndone quickly. It is what scientists call the low-hanging fruit of \nenvironmental and health fixes.\n  In 2010, the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves was formed to help \nsupport the adoption of clean cookstoves in 100 million households in \nthe developing world by the year 2020. Recognizing the serious health \nand environmental issues posed by traditional cookstoves, the Alliance \naims to save lives, improve livelihoods, empower women, and combat \npollution by creating a thriving global market for clean and efficient \nhousehold cooking stoves. Alliance partners are working together to \nhelp overcome the market barriers that currently impede the production, \ndevelopment, and distribution of clean cookstoves in developing \ncountries.\n  During the first 5 years of the Alliance, the U.S. Government played \na key role in supporting this important endeavor, including through \nfinancial assistance that surpassed the original funding commitments. \nLed by the Department of State, 11 Federal agencies have invested more \nthan $114 million in clean cookstoves and fuel initiatives to date. For \nthe next 5 years of the Alliance, our government has announced \nanticipated commitments of another $175 million.\n  To date, our government has focused its efforts on applied research \nand development, diplomatic engagement to encourage a market for clean \ncookstoves and to improve access to them, international development \nprojects to support clean cookstove businesses engaging women \nentrepreneurs, and supporting the adoption of clean and efficient \ncooking solutions by providing some financial assistance.\n  The legislation Senator Durbin and I are introducing today \nstrengthens these important commitments by requiring the Secretary of \nState--in consultation with the relevant Federal agencies and in \ncoordination with international NGOs and private and other government \nentities--to advance the goals and work of the Alliance. In addition, \nthe bill would formally authorize the funding commitments already made \nby our government for the next 5 years, through the year 2020, to \nensure that these important pledges toward preventing unnecessary \nillness and reducing pollution around the globe are met.\n  By supporting the work of the Alliance and the commitment of the U.S. \nGovernment to replace traditional cookstoves with modern versions that \nemit far less soot, this bill aims to benefit directly some of the \nworld's poorest people and to reduce the harmful pollution that affects \nall of us. It offers a way for us to address the second largest \ncontributor to climate change in a way that is inexpensive, not \nburdensome to the people of our country, and that will benefit poor \npeople living in developing nations.\n  There is lots of disagreement on many proposals that have been \nadvanced to address climate change, but this is one that should unite \nall of us. It will help to improve the health of women and children, in \nparticular, who bear the burden of working over these dirty cookstoves \nin developing countries, and it will reduce carbon soot in our \natmosphere--the second biggest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. \nIt will do so without requiring those of us in our country to change \nour ways.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Durbin and me in supporting the \nClean Cookstoves and Fuels Support Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/senate-section/article/S7473-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7473-S7474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 292--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n AVAILABILITY OF HIGH-QUALITY CHILDCARE FOR WORKING PARENTS SHOULD BE \n                               INCREASED\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Blumenthal, Mrs. Boxer, \nMs. Cantwell, Mr. Casey, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Franken, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. \nHeinrich, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Markey, Mr. Merkley, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \nMurphy, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schatz, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Udall, \nMs. Warren, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Wyden, Mrs. Feinstein, and Ms. \nKlobuchar) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 292\n\n       Whereas working parents depend on high-quality childcare so \n     they can work and support their families;\n       Whereas over 60 percent of children under 5, and \\1/2\\ of \n     grade school-aged children, are in a regular childcare \n     arrangement;\n       Whereas United States businesses lose $3,000,000,000 \n     annually due to employee absenteeism resulting from child \n     care challenges, which weakens the stable and reliable \n     childcare system that is essential for the economy;\n       Whereas childcare is difficult to find for millions of \n     families, particularly the nearly 9,000,000 parents who work \n     non-standard hours, because only 8 percent of childcare \n     centers provide evening or weekend care;\n       Whereas most middle-class families struggle to afford high-\n     quality childcare;\n       Whereas the median annual aggregate cost of full-time care \n     for an infant and a 4-year-old in a childcare center is \n     nearly $16,000;\n       Whereas the average annual cost of center-based childcare \n     for an infant is over \\1/2\\ of the income of a family of 3 \n     living at the poverty level in 21 States;\n       Whereas high-quality childcare and early education, \n     especially for disadvantaged children, helps children thrive \n     in school and beyond by--\n       (1) decreasing special education placement and reducing \n     grade retention;\n       (2) decreasing child abuse and neglect and juvenile \n     arrests;\n       (3) increasing high school graduation and college \n     attendance; and\n       (4) increasing employment;\n       Whereas the eligibility requirements to receive assistance \n     under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 \n     (42 U.S.C. 9858 et seq.) (referred to in this preamble as the \n     ``CCDBG''), the primary source of Federal funding support for \n     childcare, exclude most United States children from Federal \n     childcare assistance;\n       Whereas the CCDBG serves only a fraction of families \n     eligible for Federal support, with only 17 percent of \n     eligible children receiving Federal childcare assistance, the \n     lowest percentage since 1997;\n       Whereas these issues affect all families, but \n     disproportionately affect women because--\n       (1) over 95 percent of the formal childcare workforce is \n     comprised of women; and\n       (2) women do most of the unpaid childcare work in families;\n       Whereas increased pay for workers in the childcare industry \n     improves the quality of childcare for young children;\n\n[[Page S7474]]\n\n       Whereas to recruit and retain a qualified childcare \n     workforce for young children, childcare staff for young \n     children should be paid as much as K-12 staff with equivalent \n     education and experience;\n       Whereas a full-time living wage of at least $15 per hour is \n     needed for childcare workers to meet the essential needs of \n     their families, but the average childcare center worker earns \n     $10.60 per hour and has experienced no increase in real \n     earnings since 1997;\n       Whereas high-quality childcare that works for everyone is \n     essential for a strong economy and future;\n       Whereas each working family needs, in order to support its \n     well-being--\n       (1) universal preschool;\n       (2) child nutrition programs that promote health and \n     wellness;\n       (3) a fair work schedule;\n       (4) a living wage;\n       (5) paid family and medical leave;\n       (6) paid sick days; and\n       (7) credit in the Social Security system for time spent \n     caregiving; and\n       Whereas when families are guaranteed high-quality, \n     flexible, available, and affordable childcare--\n       (1) business productivity improves;\n       (2) parents have a greater likelihood of finding and \n     keeping employment; and\n       (3) children do better in school and in life: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate supports efforts--\n       (1) to provide childcare assistance to each working family \n     that needs childcare assistance, including--\n       (A) middle-class families that struggle to afford the costs \n     of high-quality childcare; and\n       (B) underpaid families that are often left behind;\n       (2) to make childcare affordable--\n       (A) such that no working family must pay more than 10 \n     percent of its income for childcare; and\n       (B) by providing additional help to families most in need;\n       (3) to ensure that childcare is available so that parents \n     in the 24-hour economy can access high-quality care--\n       (A) when and where the parents need it (during weekends, \n     nights, and as their job schedules change); and\n       (B) with options across school, center, and home settings;\n       (4) to guarantee that each family eligible for childcare \n     receives childcare by creating a system that expands with \n     need;\n       (5) to improve the quality of childcare by--\n       (A) guaranteeing childcare workers a living wage and wage \n     parity with K-12 staff with equivalent education and \n     experience;\n       (B) improving training opportunities; and\n       (C) giving workers a voice on the job to advocate for \n     higher workplace standards and standards of care for the \n     children the workers serve; and\n       (6) to provide sufficient Federal, State, and local \n     investment to ensure resources for high-quality jobs and \n     affordable childcare.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/22/senate-section/article/S7474-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 293--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL \nDOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH, COMMENDING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM \n ADVOCATES, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM SERVICE PROVIDERS, CRISIS HOTLINE \n STAFF, AND FIRST RESPONDERS SERVING VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FOR \n   THEIR COMPASSIONATE SUPPORT OF VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, AND \n  EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT CONGRESS SHOULD CONTINUE TO \n   SUPPORT EFFORTS TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND HOLD PERPETRATORS OF \n                     DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ACCOUNTABLE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Ms. Ayotte, and Ms. Klobuchar) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.
