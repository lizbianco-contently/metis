Mr. President, every year in America countless \ninnocent victims, including children, are bought and sold into modern-\nday slavery. This heinous crime of human trafficking is shameful and \ndisgraceful, and the Senate can do something about it by passing the \nbipartisan human rights legislation before us today.\n  The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, introduced by Senator \nCornyn and his Democratic colleague Senator Klobuchar, would give \nvoices to the voiceless and justice to the children suffering in the \nshadows. Their bipartisan human rights bill may not be that long, but \nit sure is effective, and it is transparent. This bill has been \navailable for any Senator and any member of the public to read since \nJanuary. This bipartisan legislation was considered and strengthened in \nan open and transparent committee process. This human rights bill \nconforms with longstanding bipartisan law that so many of our \nDemocratic friends have supported repeatedly. It is no wonder that once \nSenators have read the bill, they can't seem to help but support it.\n  We welcome the 13 Democratic cosponsors of this human rights bill. We \nwelcome the messages of support our Democratic friends have delivered \nas well.\n  Here is what one Democratic Senator from New York had to say just a \nfew days ago. ``We should pass Senator Cornyn's Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act,'' she said. She explained that this bipartisan bill \nwould ``support programs for survivors of human trafficking and child \npornography and ensure that the johns who are buying trafficking \nvictims are actually prosecuted in Federal court.'' She is right. All \nof those measures are contained in the text of this bipartisan bill.\n  We also heard the Democratic Senator from North Dakota who called on \nme to bring ``S. 178, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, to \nthe floor for a vote.'' I was happy to do it. I am appreciative of her \nsupport.\n  I am appreciative of the support from so many from across the aisle \nwho have read and support this bill. The children who suffer from such \nterrible oppression and injustice must appreciate their support too. \nThey must appreciate our Democratic friends closely examining this \nbipartisan human rights bill of modest length and then voting \nunanimously to support it in the Judiciary Committee.\n  On Monday they must have appreciated seeing our Democratic friends \njoin with us to unanimously advance the same bipartisan human rights \nbill. Here is what the Democratic leader had to say that day--right \nafter I called for strong bipartisan backing for our human rights \nlegislation. ``On human trafficking, I underscore, appreciate, and \nagree with the statement of the Republican leader. I feel very \nconfident we will clear on our side moving to that. I think it would be \na waste of the\n\n[[Page S1398]]\n\nSenate's time to have a vote on a motion to proceed and a waste of time \nafterward. . . . I doubt there will be problems on my side,'' the \nDemocratic leader said. ``If there are, I will work to clear them.'' I \nwas very appreciative of my good friend making that statement after \nexamining this bipartisan legislation.\n  This bipartisan human rights bill may not be that long, but it is \ncritical to helping lift innocent victims out of the shadows.\n  A broad coalition--everyone from the NAACP to the National Domestic \nViolence Hotline--has called it ``vital.''\n  They wrote:\n\n       The [Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act] provides \n     unprecedented support to domestic victims of trafficking who \n     are too often invisible and underserved.\n\n  They continued:\n\n       As leaders in the anti-trafficking, anti-violence, child \n     welfare, civil rights, runaway and homeless youth, and human \n     rights movements, we urge Congress to pass this critical \n     piece of legislation.\n\n  So I would urge Members on both sides of the aisle to help pass this \ntransparent and bipartisan human rights legislation overwhelmingly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/11/senate-section/article/S1398-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, around the country we see a number of \nstories appearing. I will take one of the stories from the New York \nTimes and read just a little bit of it. It is a long article, but \neveryone gets the drift of it. There are a few paragraphs I am going to \nread.\n\n       The Obama administration said Tuesday that 11.7 million \n     Americans now have private health insurance through federal \n     and state marketplaces, with 86 percent of them receiving \n     financial assistance from the federal government to help pay \n     premiums.\n       About three-fourths of people with marketplace coverage--\n     8.8 million consumers--live in the 37 states served by \n     HealthCare.gov, the website for the federal insurance \n     exchange. The other 2.9 million people are in states that \n     created and operate their own exchanges.\n       Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services, underlined the importance of subsidies for people \n     in states using the federal exchange--subsidies that could be \n     withdrawn if the Supreme Court rules against the Obama \n     administration in a pending case.\n       Administration officials suggested that more than 7 million \n     people could lose subsidies, making insurance unaffordable, \n     if the court ruled that such assistance was unavailable in \n     the federal exchange. The plaintiffs contend that the \n     Affordable Care Act does not allow subsidies in the federal \n     exchange.\n       In Florida, nearly 1.6 million people have selected or been \n     automatically re-enrolled in health plans--the largest \n     enrollment of any state in the federal exchange--and 1.5 \n     million of them qualified for subsidies in the form of tax \n     credits, which averaged $294 a month.\n       In Texas, 1.2 million people selected or were re-enrolled \n     in health plans, and one million of them qualified for \n     financial assistance averaging $239 a month.\n       In North Carolina, 560,400 people selected health plans in \n     the federal marketplace, and 515,500 of them qualified for \n     subsidies averaging $315 a month.\n\n  A lot rides on what the Supreme Court does, affecting millions and \nmillions of people. If the Supreme Court can't see the absolute clear \nlanguage of that bill, millions of people will lose their health \ninsurance, and that would be a tragedy. It would be so very bad if \nsuddenly people find themselves with no health insurance after they \nwaited for so long to get it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/11/senate-section/article/S1398-3", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HUMAN TRAFFICKING LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, an ancient Greek philosopher once said, ``To \nbe doing good deeds is man's most glorious task.''\n  Today the Senate has an opportunity to do a good deed. We have a \nchance to do something to address human trafficking. It is hard to \nfathom that in the 21st century, slavery continues to rear its ugly \nhead in the form of human trafficking. But in the shadows of American \nsociety, there are children, women, and men who are literally being \nenslaved and subjected to the most shockingly inhumane treatment \nimaginable. The victims of human trafficking suffer physical and sexual \nabuse and violence. Forced to live in squalor, they have no hope. This \nlegislation before this body aims to change that. It seeks to not only \nprevent trafficking but also gives survivors hope for a new life.\n  This legislation creates a domestic trafficking victims fund that \nwill help support victims of trafficking and child pornography get back \non their feet by providing housing, job training, and other support \nservices. This legislation provides funding to train law enforcement in \nrescuing and supporting survivors of human trafficking and effectively \nprosecuting traffickers. It officially designates child pornography as \na form of human trafficking and ensures that victims have direct access \nto child advocacy centers. It protects victims and witnesses by \ntreating suspected human traffickers as violent criminals. It keeps \nvictims of trafficking and child pornography informed regarding any \nplea bargain or deferred prosecution related to their cases.\n  This legislation is good for our country. It will go a long way in \ncurbing human trafficking and child pornography. That is why it is \nsupported by 200 law enforcement and victims' rights groups nationwide.\n  Unfortunately, Republicans are committed to turning a bipartisan bill \ninto an unrelated and unconscionable political fight. We can give all \nthe speeches out here we want saying somebody should have read the bill \nmore closely. The question is--and we can have all kinds of debates out \nhere as to how it got in the bill. A number of people feel it was by a \nlittle bit of sleight of hand and that it shouldn't be in there. In \nthis legislation that is meant as an outline to stop child trafficking \nand human trafficking generally, there is a provision dealing with \nabortion. It has nothing--nothing--to do with this.\n  I served in the House of Representatives with a very fine man. He has \nhad his name affixed to an anti-abortion bill--anti-abortion \nlegislation for almost three decades, and it has been continued year \nafter year in appropriations bills. What I am talking about, what is \nhappening in this legislation, it would make it permanent. It is wrong.\n  If my friend the Republican leader is so in tune with getting this \npassed, take that provision out of the bill; otherwise, it will not \npass. Take it out.\n  It is unfortunate that Republicans are committed to turning a \nbipartisan bill into an unrelated, unconscionable political fight. Is \nit worth it? Is it really worth endangering a piece of legislation that \nwould do good for our country?\n  Democrats will not allow a bill to prevent human trafficking and \nchild pornography to be hijacked by a Republican ploy. We can do a lot \nof good with this legislation, and I hope my Republican friends will \nchoose to do the right thing and take this out of this legislation and \npass this bill without any gimmicks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/11/senate-section/article/S1398-4", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1398-S1399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LETTER SENT TO IRAN\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, talking about gimmicks, there have been a \nnumber of reports in the press in the last couple of days about how \nthis unprecedented letter to the leaders of the Iranian regime \noriginated. We know 47 Republican Senators signed it. There are news \naccounts reporting that this was intended as a big joke. A big joke? \nOthers say Republicans say it was a political organizing exercise after \nbeing hammered so hard with their nonfunding of Homeland Security. \nOthers say it was simply designed to sabotage negotiations. Pick \nwhatever one of the three you want. Whatever the reason, one thing is \nclear: This is not a joke; this is not an organizing exercise; this is \nabout Iran getting a nuclear weapon.\n  I am disappointed that so many of my Republican colleagues are \ndestroying the long tradition of bipartisanship in defending Israel and \nstopping Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. I am heartened that a few \nRepublicans--seven to be exact--didn't sign the letter. That is nice. \nSeven out of 54 didn't sign the letter. Seven is certainly better than \nnothing.\n  As some of the seven Republican Senators have said, they agree with \nDemocrats that this letter was not appropriate. We are witnessing a \nfundamental test of Republicans' ability to govern. They are treating \nnuclear negotiations as a chance to play games--\n\n[[Page S1399]]\n\npolitical games. They are treating a human trafficking bill as a chance \nto play some of these games. This is not the time for games. \nRepublicans' behavior on these issues is irresponsible and beneath the \ndignity of this institution. We can and should do better.\n  Mr. President, what is the business of the day?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/11/senate-section/article/S1399-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week I had an opportunity to cross \nthe street into the Supreme Court, and I witnessed the first oral \nargument I have ever seen. It was a historic moment for me and for our \nNation because it was a moment for the Court to argue about the \nAffordable Care Act and the intention of Congress when it was creating \nthis Affordable Care Act.\n  Having been here at the time it was debated and having voted for it, \nit was interesting to hear arguments made on the floor of the Supreme \nCourt that suggested something we had never intended. The exchanges \nthat were created under the Affordable Care Act are exchanges created \nby each State or Federal exchanges. There was never a distinction made \nin the debate nor any intention that the subsidy given to those who \nbought insurance in these exchanges would be different if the exchanges \nwere State-created or federally created, and that is basically the \nargument before the Supreme Court.\n  One can only imagine what the final decision of the Supreme Court \nwill be, but we know it is critically important to millions of \nAmericans. In the past year alone, 10 million uninsured Americans \nfinally have insurance because of the Affordable Care Act. In the \nprivate market, millions more now have access to expanded coverage for \npreventive health services, such as a mammogram or a flu shot, without \nany cost sharing. Because of the Affordable Care Act, a person no \nlonger needs to stay in a job simply to carry health insurance or be \ndenied coverage because of a preexisting condition--a situation which \nvirtually every family faces. And because of this law, prescription \ndrugs for seniors cost less.\n  Last week, when the Supreme Court heard arguments in King v. Burwell, \nthe plaintiffs made an argument that those who were governed by Federal \nexchanges were supposed to be treated differently under this act. That \nwas never the intention of those of us who were part of the creation \nand voting for this legislation.\n  A ruling in favor of King would change this provision as we intended \nit. It would mean 8 million Americans would no longer be able to afford \nhealth insurance.\n  According to the Urban Institute, premiums for people able to \npurchase insurance would increase by 35 percent. I can't imagine that \neven Senators who voted against this bill are cheering at the prospect \nthat 8 million Americans would lose insurance and many others would \nface higher premiums.\n  Well, the Republicans have argued they have an alternative to the \nAffordable Care Act in the Senate. They put out a draft proposal last \nmonth. The chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in the House said \nhe was going to release his own plan.\n  The Affordable Care Act puts families in charge of their care instead \nof insurance companies. It expands health care coverage and lowers \nhealth care costs, makes Medicare stronger, and lowers the deficit.\n  What part of that do my Republican colleagues disagree with?\n  Before the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, 50 million Americans \nlacked health insurance while health care costs for working families \nand small businesses were increasing by double digits. The Affordable \nCare Act changed all of that. Ten million people now have private \nhealth insurance, millions more are covered by Medicaid, and for the \nfirst time ever insurance companies have to live up to their promise of \nbeing there when you actually need them.\n  The Senate Republican proposal falls short. It would allow insurance \ncompanies once again to charge higher premiums to women, to decide that \npeople with preexisting conditions will not get any coverage at all, \nand to decide that certain individuals will only get so much help for \npaying their bills. If Republicans have their way, insurance companies \nwill get to decide again whether you can renew your health insurance \npolicy as you become older. Worse yet, under the Republican proposal, \n12 million people would lose their health insurance and taxes on \nworking families would go up. That is not right.\n  The Supreme Court would put in jeopardy health insurance coverage for \nAriana Jimenez. She lives in Chicago and works part time as a nursing \nassistant at a community health center. Ariana pays $52 a month for her \nhealth insurance premium. When asked what would happen to her coverage \nif the Supreme Court took away the tax credit, she simply said: ``I \nwouldn't be able to afford it.''\n  In Illinois over 800,000 people now have health insurance. Over \n290,000 people purchased their plan through the Illinois marketplace, \nwhich is a Federal marketplace. An additional 530,000 people have \nenrolled in Medicaid, and 125,000 young adults in Illinois can still \nstay on their parents' health insurance plan.\n  Since September 2010, children under the age of 18 enrolled in the \nemployer-based or marketplace plan have been eligible to receive \nvaccinations for diseases such as measles without any cost sharing.\n  A few years ago Domingo Carino found out he had a health condition \nthat required medication he couldn't afford. Thanks to the Affordable \nCare Act and to some help from staff at the Asian Human Services Family \nHealth Center in Chicago, Domingo found good health insurance that only \ncosts him $11 a month. Domingo's plan not only allows him to afford the \nmedication he desperately needs, but he is also able to keep his \ncurrent primary care physician. According to Domingo, he can now live \nwithout worrying about how to afford his medication.\n  For Domingo and millions like him the tax credits provided by the \nAffordable Care Act are a lifesaver. If those who oppose the Affordable \nCare Act prevail in the Supreme Court, that tax subsidy, or tax credit, \nwill not be available to Domingo.\n  Over 54 million people also benefit from Medicaid. Before the \nAffordable Care Act, two out of three people on Medicaid were pregnant \nwomen and children. That is 36 million vulnerable Americans. Medicaid \nalso provides for people with disabilities.\n  Before the Affordable Care Act, almost 3 million people were covered \nby Medicaid in Illinois. More than half a million births were covered \nby Medicaid in Illinois, too. Since the Affordable Care Act was signed \ninto law, another 290,000 people in Illinois are covered by Medicaid. \nThat means these people finally get better from a condition they could \nnot afford to treat. That is a success story.\n  The new Republican plan uses something else out of an old playbook. \nRepublicans want to cap Medicaid spending for each beneficiary. This \nbudget gimmick would hurt the most vulnerable people in America--low-\nincome seniors, people with disabilities, children, and pregnant \nmothers. States would be forced to make harsh choices on what they \nwould cover and what they would not cover.\n  Is that what America wants?\n  According to a recent Gallup poll, the uninsured rate dropped 3.5 \npoints from 2013 to 2014. In Illinois the uninsured rate dropped 4.5 \npercent in the same period of time.\n  The Affordable Care Act includes changes meant to help slow the \ngrowth in health care costs, and they are working. We need to stick \nwith the Affordable Care Act.\n\n[[Page S1400]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/11/senate-section/article/S1400-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1400-S1401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      HEALTH CARE RESEARCH FUNDING\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, another critical part of this conversation \nis health care research.\n  One of the most outstanding men serving the Federal Government in \nAmerica is named Francis Collins. He is an amazing man who heads up the \nNational Institutes of Health. He is a great physician and a great \nresearcher.\n  When the United States wanted someone to head up the Human Genome \nProject, they picked Francis Collins. He managed to bring that project \nto success by providing more information than anyone ever dreamed of, \nand now we are better in treating problems and diseases across America.\n  I went to see him last year at the National Institutes of Health. We \ntalked about medical research in America, and what he had to say was \nterrifying. There has been a 23-percent decline in medical research in \nthe United States over the last 10 years. We have not even kept up with \ninflation in providing money for medical research, and that is not lost \non people in the research field.\n  We are now finding that our medical researchers are older and older. \nYounger researchers have given up. They don't think they are getting \napprovals for their research applications. As they leave the field, the \nnew generation of researchers has diminished and our ability to find \ncures has also diminished.\n  At the same time that the United States is backpedaling and falling \naway from its leadership in biomedical research, the rest of the world \nis charging forward. The European Union is making massive investments \nin medical research and in just a few years the Chinese will pass the \nUnited States for the first time in their investment in biomedical \nresearch. They understand that in addition to finding cures, biomedical \nresearch is really the opening for entrepreneurship, profitability, \npharmaceutical companies, medical devices, and they want to make sure \nChina is in the lead. Why isn't the United States in the lead?\n  I will speak about two particular diseases that need to be \nresearched.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have to leave the floor in a moment, and I \nwould like to direct my question to my friend, the senior Senator from \nIllinois.\n  I too met with Francis Collins. He is a genius. We are so fortunate \nthat he is there. He told me something I can't get out of my mind--\nsequestration. It took $1.5 billion away from the things that the \nSenator from Illinois has been talking about. The second year of \nsequestration will take away $2 billion.\n  I read in the press that Republicans in the House--with their budget \nand the budget over here--are going to continue the sequestration.\n  I ask my friend, what will that do to Francis Collins and the people \nhe has working at that institution?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will respond to the Democratic leader \nand say that I have heard the same thing. There are some Republicans in \nthe House who believe that sequestration--this across-the-board cut--is \nwhat we should do, and I could not disagree more.\n  I chair the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. If we go forward \nwith the sequestration, this will be devastating to America's national \ndefense. If we get into this practice of cutting back in biomedical \nresearch, it will not only deny us the basic money we need to fund \nresearch grants--and we are now funding a lower percentage than we have \nin decades--it will also mean a discouraging message to researchers. \nThey are going to think: What is the point in becoming an NIH \nresearcher if the government and Congress will not provide the basic \nresources we need? The third element, which we cannot overlook, are all \nof the millions of people in the United States and around the world who \nare praying that we will be able to come up with breakthroughs when it \ncomes to medical research.\n  In the United States of America, a person is diagnosed with \nAlzheimer's disease once every 68 seconds. Last year we spent over $200 \nbillion on Medicare and Medicaid for the care of Alzheimer's patients.\n  What Francis Collins has said to me is that if we can dedicate growth \nin research funds, we can--with the grace of God and maybe \nmiraculously--find a cure or find a way to delay the onset of \nAlzheimer's, even for a few months. The savings to the Federal \nGovernment would be so much more than the actual cost of the medical \nresearch.\n  This notion of cutting back on NIH research, which some in the House \nare pushing, is really an effort that will cost us more in the long \nrun--not to mention the human suffering.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could, through the Chair, ask my friend \none final question. During my last trip to the National Institutes of \nHealth, when I met with Dr. Collins and others, one of the issues they \nwere so in tune with was that they were so close to having a universal \nvaccine for flu. In the past they would come up with the best solution \nthey could for a flu vaccine every year. If we are fortunate, it is 50-\npercent effective. They are very, very close to having a universal \nvaccine for flu.\n  Tens of thousands of people in the United States die from the flu \nevery year. Why didn't they proceed? Sequestration. They didn't have \nthe money to continue the research.\n  I thank my friend very much for bringing this subject up. It is \nsomething that is devastating not only to the scientific community, but \nit is devastating to the people out there who would benefit from the \nresearch who really don't know what could be in store for them.\n  It is such a shame for our country that China--Japan has done a good \njob for many, many decades. They have the lowest death rate in the \nworld. The European Union is trudging way ahead of the United States in \nsomething on which we have lead forever.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  It was not that long ago that America was consumed with Ebola and \nwhat it meant in terms of threats to life in Africa, the United States, \nand around the world, and it was right that we focused on stopping the \nscourge of the Ebola epidemic in Africa.\n  But there was a concern, as well, expressed over and over again this \nlast fall, about how many Americans would be a victim to this Ebola \nepidemic. It turns out at the end of the day that fewer than a handful \nwere actually affected by it, but every year in the United States and \naround the world, hundreds, if not thousands, die from flu--influenza.\n\n  Again, just to get to the point the Senator from Nevada makes, we are \npenny wise and pound foolish by denying the money for research for a \nuniversal flu vaccine that will save lives around the world. A minimal \ninvestment in the United States can make a dramatic improvement in the \nmorbidity and mortality of those who are affected by flu.\n  So I thank the Senator from Nebraska for joining in this conversation \nthis morning and talking about the biomedical research deficit which we \nare facing in the United States.\n  I wish to mention one or two other specific examples in this field. \nThe kind of research we are talking about at NIH holds great promise \nwhen it comes to treating disorders such as multiple sclerosis. MS is \nan unpredictable and disabling disease that affects the central nervous \nsystem. Symptoms range from numbness and tingling to blindness and \nparalysis, and there is no known cure.\n  Today more than 2.3 million people have been diagnosed with MS \nworldwide, including 20,000 in my home State of Illinois.\n  Typically, MS is diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, but between \n8,000 and 10,000 children and adolescents live with it in America, \npeople such as Meghan Malone. In 2004, at the age of 14, Meghan was \ndiagnosed with MS. Her first symptoms began when she was in the eighth \ngrade. She lost vision in her right eye for a few days. One year later \nher feet went numb while she was out trick or treating with friends. By \nthe next morning she couldn't feel her thighs, and a few days later she \nwas completely numb from the waist down.\n  Her parents quickly brought her to the hospital where she was \ndiagnosed with MS. She panicked, thinking she was too young for this \ndisease and afraid of what it meant for her future, but she is doing \nwhat she can to stay healthy. She spends a lot of time exercising every \nday. She tries to think positively.\n\n[[Page S1401]]\n\n  Since her diagnosis, Meghan has gathered her friends and family to \nparticipate in Walk MS every May. There is one in my hometown of \nSpringfield, IL. They have raised over $50,000--Meghan has--to help \nfight the disease. Meghan said:\n\n       I walk to give hope to others who are newly diagnosed with \n     MS. It wasn't easy to hear those words and I think by walking \n     I can help others find ways to be positive about their \n     diagnosis.\n\n  The National Multiple Sclerosis Society has been sponsoring Walk MS \nsince 1988 and they have raised $870 million to support research. The \nNational Multiple Sclerosis Society and people such as Meghan are doing \ntheir part, but if the Federal Government is going to do something it \nhas to do its part. We have to make an investment at the National \nInstitutes of Health to complement the efforts by private citizens and \ngenerous people across America to fund research in these diseases.\n  Let me give an example. Jonah Chan and his team at the University of \nCalifornia in San Francisco can teach us a lesson. Dr. Chan's team \ninvented a new technology that led to the discovery of a drug normally \nused for allergies that has the potential to repair the nervous system \nin people with MS, but this important discovery needs further Federal \ninvestment in biomedical research to move these early findings to \npromising treatments. Here is what I have done. I have introduced the \nAmerican Cures Act. It will increase funding at the Nation's top four \nbiomedical research agencies, a 5-percent annual budget increase over \nand above inflation--the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for \nDisease Control, the Department of Defense, and the Veterans' \nAdministration medical research programs. The American Cures Act will \nmake funding for critical biomedical research projects less political \nand more predictable.\n  Dr. Collins at NIH told me: If you gave us regular funding increases \nof 5 percent real growth a year for 10 years, I will prove to you that \ninvestment will come back tenfold in helping the improvement of health \nin the United States and reducing the cost of health care. I believe \nhim. I have confidence in him. So why would we not do it? We should be \nmaking this commitment.\n  Cystic fibrosis is another example of federally funded basic research \nthat improves people's lives. The other day Patrick Magner, a sophomore \nat Loyola Academy in Wilmette, IL, wrote to me about his two young \nbrothers. John is 12 years old, a fully functioning sixth grader, and \nMatthew is 9 years old and plays sports in school. On the outside, one \nwould never know they are dealing with cystic fibrosis.\n  John and Matt both take about 30 pills a day to help with their basic \ndigestive functions. This doesn't include several other prescriptions, \nover-the-counter drugs, and daily therapy. They consider themselves \nlucky because 50 years ago people with cystic fibrosis didn't live long \nenough to even attend school. Today, with more advanced treatment, life \nexpectancy for people with cystic fibrosis has increased over 800 \npercent. Research generated by NIH funding continues to give John and \nMatt hope for their future.\n  Their older brother Patrick wrote:\n\n       Without this funding, my two younger brothers might not be \n     alive today. This funding is crucial to not only curing \n     cystic fibrosis, but other diseases as well.\n\n  That is the promise of the American Cures Act. It allows America's \nsmartest medical researchers to continue to find treatments to stop \nprogression and one day, God willing, find a cure for diseases such as \nMS, cystic fibrosis, and many more.\n  Last week I joined Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania on his \nresolution to support Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week. I would also \nlike to acknowledge the work of Senators Wyden, Hatch, Brown, Markey, \nand others on behalf of fighting this terrible disease. Together, along \nwith the American Cures Act, these efforts are improving people's \nlives.\n  In order to lead to breakthrough cures for these diseases, we need as \na nation--as a government--to take the lead. This research shouldn't be \na low-budget priority; I think it should be one of the highest.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to make Federal funding for biomedical research the true national \npriority which it is.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton).

BURWELL\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about the oral \narguments in King v. Burwell that took place last week. Similar to many \nof us on the floor today, I was here when we fought to get the \nAffordable Care Act passed. I know firsthand our top priority was to \nhelp all Americans get more affordable health care coverage. That goal \nis clear in the history and in the text of this law. I am confident the \nSupreme Court will reach the same conclusion; that no matter how the \nhealth care exchange is set up in any State, if people qualify for tax \ncredits, people should get them just as Congress intended. \nUnfortunately, many of our Republican colleagues appear to be hoping \nfor the opposite outcome.\n  I wish to take a step back to note how appalling this particular \nsituation is. Right now Republicans seem to be rooting for a ruling \nthat would take away millions of Americans' health care coverage. They \nseem to want a ruling that would put their own constituents' health at \nrisk, and that amounts to a tax increase on 6.5 million people of about \n$3,200 a year.\n  Working families should not have to pay the price for Republican \npolitical games, including this Supreme Court case that they pushed \nfor. If I were a mother who no longer has to worry about what happens \nif my child breaks an ankle or a struggling worker who now has a little \nbit more to spend on groceries because their health care insurance no \nlonger costs so much, I would have a lot of tough questions for \nRepublicans right now. I would wonder why on Earth Republicans are so \nfocused on taking apart a law that is helping families get quality, \naffordable health insurance.\n  The Affordable Care Act was a critical step forward in terms of \nmaking sure our health care system puts patients and families first. \nOver 10 million Americans have gained coverage in the last 2 years. In \nfact, today the uninsured rate is at a near-historic low. Health care \ncoverage is more affordable for families across the country, and we are \nseeing important improvements in the quality of care patients are \ngetting.\n  We have a lot more work to do to strengthen our health care system, \nbut there is no question that this law is doing what we set out to do: \nexpand access to affordable health care for all--all--Americans. \nDemocrats want to build on this progress.\n  So while we see Republicans putting politics first ahead of families' \nneeds, Democrats are going to be focused on building on the Affordable \nCare Act with more coverage, not less; more affordability, not less; \nand better quality, not less.\n  We know the work to put patients first didn't end when the Affordable \nCare Act passed. That is why we are going to keep working to move our \nhealth care system forward, not backward, for our families.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last month I came to the floor to launch \nwhat I call the ``Waste of the Week.'' We look at how we spend the \ntaxpayers' dollars. We all know the biggest issue over the past several \nyears is now sort of fading into the ether is the fact that the \ngovernment continues to spend the taxpayers' money in reckless ways, \nincluding not balance our budget and go deeply into deficit spending \nevery year, then borrow to cover the cost, and increase our debt limit \nfrom the staggering $18 trillion-plus and growing. My purpose in coming \nto the floor was to highlight some examples of this waste.\n  I wish to step back for a moment to say this follows numerous \nbipartisan efforts to deal with a larger issue, and that is our debt \nand deficit, in a way that we can put a budget proposal together to get \nus out of this mess and stop loading up our children and grandchildren \nwith the responsibilities and costs they probably will not be able to \nrepay without significant sacrifice in terms of their standard of \nliving.\n\n[[Page S1402]]\n\n  Having failed every one of those over the past 5 years--Simpson-\nBowles, the Gang of 6, the Committee of 12, the supercommittee, the \ndinner committee on which I serve 7 arduous months trying to come to \nsome minimal agreement in terms of how to deal with our debt and \ndeficit because the President blocked every single attempt. I thought \nthe least we could do was look at the simple things, the easy things. \nWe started with--not such a small thing--duplication of efforts in \nterms of benefits that went to people that were actually illegal \ntotaling $5.7 billion, the difference between Social Security \ndisability and unemployment insurance.\n\n  Last week I talked about duplication. There are 52 programs--through \nthe Federal Government, through a number of agencies, to provide \nassistance on economic development. Do we need 52? Can't we consolidate \nsome of these down to three or four? Why does every agency in the \ngovernment have to duplicate what is being done in every other agency? \nWe talked about the savings that would come from that.\n  It is my understanding that the minority leader and the minority \nwhip--No. 1 and 2 on the Democratic side--came down here and talked \nabout the fact that in the budget we may be cutting funding for the \nNational Institutes of Health and how tragic it would be if we took one \npenny away from them. I can give them a very simple example on the \nthird week of Waste of the Week in terms of how they can save some \nmoney or better utilize some money through the National Institutes of \nHealth.\n  This is a study for which I have to give credit to my former Senate \ncolleague, Dr. Tom Coburn. For years Dr. Coburn highlighted examples of \ngovernment waste, fraud, and abuse. He was a champion of transparency \nand made great strides in giving the American people a more accountable \ngovernment.\n  So I come here today to share one of Dr. Coburn's taxpayer issues he \nbrought before the Senate, and I think it needs to be brought here now. \nHow timely it is when I was just preceded unknowingly by those who came \nto the floor saying we can't take a penny out of NIH because it goes to \ncritical research.\n  I support NIH. I think it is an important agency. We need to do some \nof that research. But does NIH need to do this: Does NIH need to fund a \nstudy to determine the benefits of massage by using 18 white rabbits \nfrom New Zealand that receive 30-minute massages four times a day?\n  According to co-medical director of the Ohio State University Sports \nMedical Center, ``We tried to mimic Swedish massage because \nanecdotally, it's the most popular technique used by athletes.''\n  That study amounted to a cost of $387,000 of taxpayer money given in \na grant. Why didn't they just ask the football team? Why didn't they \njust walk in the locker room and say: Hey guys, you have just been beat \nup for 60 minutes and you probably have a lot of aches and pains. A \ngood hot shower and a massage--does that help?\n  I think every one of us--we have all had aches and pains--understands \nthat a massage helps relieve the soreness. Do we need to spend $387,000 \non a study and take 18 white rabbits and give them massages four times \na day on taxpayer dollars to prove the point that massages actually \nwork?\n  So once again, while this is a small thing, we have to add to our \nchart showing that we continue to expend taxpayer money and waste \ntaxpayer money on frivolous things that are not needed. You can point \nout every egregious agency spending.\n  Until we are willing to have the political will to stand up and deal \nwith the runaway entitlements, these discretionary programs will \ncontinue to be squeezed. Unfortunately, we have come to a roadblock \nunder this Presidency in terms of any effort left to deal with the \nlarger issue of runaway spending and runaway debt. This burden is being \nplaced on the future of America and the children and grandchildren of \nAmericans and that is generational theft, and it is irresponsible for \nthis body to not take action.\n  At the very least, can we not at least do the most simple of things \nin terms of eliminating waste of taxpayer dollars through duplication, \nand unnecessary studies?\n  Eliminating waste like this will not change Washington's long-term \nfiscal picture, but it does point out that it is important to ensure \nthat taxpayer funding of projects like this keep, like the Energizer \nbunny, going and going.\n  I hate to say this, but sadly, after the project was over, the 18 New \nZealand white rabbits were euthanized. It is my hope that in going \nforward, instead of killing rabbits, we can kill taxpayer-funded \ngovernment waste like this project.\n  I see my colleague from Arizona has come to the floor. I have just \nfinished the latest ``Waste of the Week.'' We will be back next week \nwith ``Waste of the Week'' No. 4.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to thank my friend and \ncolleague from Indiana for his ``Waste of the Week'' speech, although I \nwish it were the ``Waste of the Day'' event that we celebrate. But I \nwish to thank him for his steadfast and longstanding efforts at \neliminating government waste and mismanagement. If we are going to \nconvince the American people that we need to make significant \nsacrifices, we have to start with an efficient government that does not \nwaste the taxpayers' dollars. So I thank my friend from Indiana.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week Senator Graham and I introduced \na Senate resolution condemning the murder of my friend and a true \nRussian Patriot, Boris Nemtsov. The resolution calls upon the Russian \nFederation to support an independent investigation into Boris Nemtsov's \nmurder and take immediate steps to end its suppression of free speech \nand justice. It also urges President Obama to continue to sanction \nhuman rights violators in the Russian Federation and to increase U.S. \nsupport to like-minded human rights activists in Russia.\n  My friends, I was devastated to learn of Boris's murder in Moscow \nlast month. My thoughts and prayers remain with his family and many \nfriends in Russia and around the world. With his death, the struggle \nfor free speech and human rights in Russia has suffered another \nshattering blow.\n  When the Soviet Union collapsed, Boris Nemtsov was one of Russia's \nearliest and most vigorous economic and political reformers, a champion \nof liberalization and democracy. His leadership of Russia's laboratory \nof reform eventually brought him to Moscow, where he served as Deputy \nPrime Minister and was once a favorite for the Russian Presidency.\n  But then Russia took a dark turn when Vladimir Putin entered the \nKremlin. Boris was one of the first to warn of the coming Putin \ndictatorship, even when many of his fellow liberals could not see it. \nAs Putin's grip on power tightened, Boris's hopes for a free, just, and \neconomically vibrant Russia, at home and at peace in Europe, were \ndashed. Yet, even after multiple arrests and countless threats on his \nlife, Boris never stopped fighting the corruption and lawlessness of \nthe Putin regime, never stopped seeking to advance democracy, human \nrights, free speech, free market reforms, and the rule of law.\n  In December 2011 Boris Nemtsov helped mobilize the largest anti-\nKremlin demonstrations since the early 1990s, leading tens of thousands \nof Russians to march in protest of widespread fraud and corruption in \nthe parliamentary elections. He stood up to harsh laws that vastly \nexpanded the definition of ``treason,'' increased government control \nover the media, and limited the scope and activities of opposition \nparties and civil society organizations--laws that Vladimir Putin and \nhis cronies have exploited to intimidate the Russian people into \nobedience.\n  Shortly before his death, Boris Nemtsov was reportedly planning to \nrelease a report on Russia's military involvement in Ukraine. At the \nprotest march scheduled 2 days after his murder, he was set to demand \n``the immediate end to the war and any aggressive actions towards \nUkraine.'' He investigated and saw through the fabricated\n\n[[Page S1403]]\n\nrationalizations of Putin's war. Putin didn't invade Ukraine to protect \nRussian-speaking peoples or to establish a federal state. Putin didn't \ninvade Ukraine because he is crazy or merely to reassert Russia's \nsphere of influence in the near abroad. Rather, Boris Nemtsov wrote \nthat the goal of Putin's ``fratricidal war'' is the ``preservation of \npersonal power and money at any cost,'' a ``cold strategy for lifelong \ndespotism.'' Putin was willing to doom Russia to isolation and \nsanctions and to sink his country ``into lies, violence, obscurantism, \nand imperial hysteria'' for his own personal power and enrichment. As \nBoris Nemtsov knew, this is not Russia's war; this is not Ukraine's \nwar; this is Vladimir Putin's war.\n  That is why Boris Nemtsov's murder is not just a tragedy for the \npeople of Russia but for the people of Ukraine. He was one of the few \nbrave Russians who sought to pierce the veneer of Putin's cynical and \nfalse narrative that Russia was not at war in Ukraine. There are many \nwho now believe that Boris is yet another casualty of that war. At the \nmemorial march honoring his life in Moscow on Sunday, one woman held a \nsign that read ``The war killed Nemtsov.''\n  I had long been concerned about Boris's safety and said so publicly. \nI will never forget the last meeting we had in my office. I begged him \nto be careful, and Boris told me he would never give up the fight for \nfreedom, human rights, and rule of law for his fellow Russians, even if \nit cost him his life. I am heartbroken that it has come to that.\n  That Boris Nemtsov's murder occurred on a bridge in a shadow of the \nKremlin in one of the most secure parts of the Russian capital raises \nserious questions about the circumstances of his killing and who was \nresponsible. In KGB fashion, Vladimir Putin will round up all the usual \nsuspects, but I fear we will never know who really pulled the trigger \nthat night. Putin's farcical oversight of the investigation ensures \nthat it will be a sham.\n  We don't need any investigation to know who was responsible for \nBoris's murder. Vladimir Putin may not have ordered Boris's \nassassination, but perhaps what is most frightening about Putin's \nRussia is that he didn't need to. Boris is dead because of the culture \nof impunity that Vladimir Putin has created in Russia, where \nindividuals are routinely persecuted and attacked for their beliefs, \nincluding by the Russian Government, and no one is ever held \nresponsible.\n  Sadly, Boris Nemtsov was not the first and certainly will not be the \nlast victim of Putin's repression. The culture of impunity has steadily \nworsened, deepened by the increased surveillance and harassment of \nmembers of opposition and civil society groups, the ongoing detention \nof numerous political prisoners, and by the continued violent attacks \non brave journalists who dare to publish the truth about official \ncorruption and other state crimes in Russia.\n  According to one news report, at least 23 journalists have been \nmurdered in Russia for reporting on government criminality and abuse \nsince Vladimir Putin came to power in 2000, along with several anti-\nKremlin political activists. In only two of these cases have there been \nconvictions.\n  Igor Domnikov, a reporter who was writing about government \ncorruption, was severely beaten in Moscow. He died 2 months later.\n  Sergei Yushenkov, a leader of a Russian opposition party, was shot \nand killed at the entrance of his apartment building. At the time, he \nwas serving on a commission investigating the Kremlin's potential role \nin the 1999 apartment bombings in Russia.\n  Another member of that commission, a reporter who was investigating \ncorruption in Russian law enforcement, was poisoned to death.\n  American journalist Paul Klebnikov was investigating Russian \nGovernment connections to organized crime when he was shot to death in \nMoscow.\n  Anna Politkovskaya, a journalist and human rights activist, was a \nfierce critic of Vladimir Putin's brutal war in Chechyna. She was \nmurdered in the stairwell of her apartment building on Vladimir Putin's \nbirthday in 2006. The lawyer who represented her family later survived \na poisoning attempt.\n  Former FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko exposed the Putin regime's \nmassive corruption, ties to organized crime, and involvement in \nassassination and murder. He was poisoned in 2006 with a radioactive \nisotope in a brazen act of nuclear terrorism.\n  Ivan Safronov was investigating a secret sale of Russian missiles and \nfighter jets to Syria and Iran. He was pushed to his death from the \nwindow of his Moscow apartment.\n  Sergei Magnitsky blew the whistle on tax fraud and large-scale theft \nby Russian Government officials. He was thrown into one of Russia's \nharshest prisons without trial, beaten and tortured, denied medical \ncare, and died in excruciating pain. Even after his death, the Russian \ncourts convicted him of tax evasion in a show trial.\n  As Orwell once wrote, ``In a time of universal deceit--telling the \ntruth is a revolutionary act.''\n  Russia has fewer and fewer revolutionaries, but Boris Nemtsov was \ncertainly one of them. Boris told the truth and was willing to lay down \nhis life for it. He told the truth about Putin's reign of terror and \nhatred. He told the truth about Putin's kleptocracy, rampant \ncorruption, and systematic theft perpetrated against the Russian \npeople. He told the truth about Putin's illegal invasion of the \nsovereign Nation of Ukraine and Russia's continued support for \nviolence, instability, and terror.\n  Boris told the truth, and we must honor his memory by speaking these \nsame truths fearlessly. Our Nation and free people everywhere must draw \nstrength from Boris's example and continue to resist Vladimir Putin's \ndark and dangerous view of the world.\n  Last Sunday, over 50,000 Russians marched in tribute to Boris \nNemtsov, still seeking, despite the odds, what a Russian poet once \ncalled the footprints of the forgotten truth. At a funeral on Tuesday, \nthousands more waited in line in the cold for more than 1 hour to pay \nBoris their respects.\n  Finally, as the hearse carrying Boris Nemtsov pulled away, mourners \ntossed flowers and chanted: ``Russia will be free!''\n  As I remember my friend Boris Nemtsov, that is my most sincere hope \nand fervent prayer.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 178, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 178) to provide justice for the victims of \n     trafficking.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Portman amendment No. 270, to amend the Child Abuse \n     Prevention and Treatment Act to enable State child protective \n     services systems to improve the identification and assessment \n     of child victims of sex trafficking.\n       Portman amendment No. 271, to amend the definition of \n     ``homeless person'' under the McKinney-Vento Homeless \n     Assistance Act to include certain homeless children and \n     youth.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the Senate is presently considering a \nseries of human trafficking bills that will help law enforcement and \nnongovernmental organizations to take swift aggressive action to \nprotect our most vulnerable populations and work to ensure justice, \nrestitution, and healing for victims of these most horrific crimes.\n  Human trafficking--modern-day slavery--is not a vestige of the past. \nIt is an evil presence here and now. Children and young adults are \nbeing bought and sold in our back yard. This problem knows no borders. \nIt is happening in communities across Ohio. It is a particular problem \nin Toledo--northwest Ohio--where several north-south and east-west \nhighways come together.\n  It is difficult even to obtain accurate information on this depraved \ncrime\n\n[[Page S1404]]\n\nthat happens in the shadows. But we know that as many as 17,000 \nindividuals may be trafficked into our Nation each year, and some \nestimate that as many as 100,000 American children may be victims of \ntrafficking within the United States each year.\n  The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act will give the Department \nof Justice additional tools to help victims and to crack down on this \ncrime. It would enhance services for victims of human trafficking, and \nit would expand victim restitution, as well as provide additional \nresources to law enforcement to help improve human trafficking \nreporting and investigation.\n  There is bipartisan and bicameral support for the tracking provisions \nof this bill. This is a bill about human trafficking. We should not let \nit become a fight about abortion. I hope my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle will agree with this and strip out the Hyde language \nthat has become such a point of controversy. I know reasonable people \ncan disagree about the Hyde amendment, but now is not the time or place \nto debate it.\n  There is agreement--broad, wide, deep agreement--on the need to \naddress trafficking. Americans from all walks of life have come to us \nasking that we do something. We can and we should. These new tools \nwould be essential in assisting the Department of Justice, which has \nmade combating trafficking a priority.\n  I would like to commend Attorney General Holder for his leadership on \nthis issue. Under his management, DOJ's commitment to preventing human \ntrafficking and bringing these criminals to justice has never been \nstronger. The Attorney General has really stepped up on this. This bill \nwill give our next Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, the tools she needs \nto build upon Holder's efforts.\n  Another area where we can do more to prevent human trafficking is \ngiving law enforcement in our communities the resources to find kids \nbefore they fall prey to traffickers. That is why I plan to introduce \nan amendment that would provide grants to local law enforcement for \ntracking down homeless and runaway youth, and that will include \nassistance for retired Federal agents to assist local law enforcement \nin these investigations. We must find these at-risk children and teens \nand bring them home before their youthful rebellion becomes something \nso much worse.\n  A group of retired FBI agents in northwest Ohio came to my office and \nasked for our help in the creation of a pilot program that would allow \nretired agents to assist local law enforcement in finding runaway kids \nand teens. Generally, northwest Ohio children who become involved in \ntrafficking do so within about 2 weeks of running away from home. So \nfinding them quickly is essential. About one-third of runaways become \nvictims of trafficking. Think of that. One-third of runaways become \nvictims of trafficking.\n  Toledo has just one detective working on cases of missing children, \nboth adult and children. These retired FBI agents want to help local \nlaw enforcement investigate the 18,000 runaways in Ohio every year, but \nthey need help. Police don't have the manpower to track these children, \nbut every city has retired agents who could assist the overworked \ndepartments.\n  I will also be introducing a series of amendments, which I hope will \nbe bipartisan, including the Rape Survivor Child Custody Act, a bill I \nintroduced in the last Congress with Senator Ayotte. We know that human \ntrafficking victims are especially vulnerable to sexual assault. Women \nwho give birth to a child conceived through rape can often face \nintimidation from attackers who pursue, amazingly enough, parental \nrights.\n  My amendment would help protect these survivors by encouraging States \nto pass laws allowing women to petition for the termination of their \nattacker's parental rights, if there is clear and convincing evidence \nthe child was conceived through rape. These women have already been \nsubjected to horrific crimes. They should not have to suffer a life of \nintrusion by the man who raped them.\n  I was first moved to introduce this bill because of the case of Ariel \nCastro in Cleveland. He was on trial in Ohio for kidnapping, raping, \nand holding prisoner three women for nearly a decade. He asked the \njudge for parental rights to visit his 6-year-old daughter he conceived \nthrough rape.\n  While the judge denied his request, Ohio has no law that prevents \nrapists such as Castro from claiming parental rights and forcing their \nvictims to let these criminals into their children's lives. I hope this \nlaw encourages Ohio and other States to pass laws making it clear that \nanyone who commits such a terrible act forfeits any right to parent a \nchild he forced on his victim. This amendment will help protect rape \nsurvivors, ensuring their right to care for their children free from \nfear.\n  Senators Klobuchar, Corker, and Leahy also have their own bill, which \nthey plan to offer as amendments, and which will help us to work to \nstamp out this terrible crime.\n  Finally, I want to commend those in my State who have helped lead the \nway on this issue. There is a history of strong bipartisanship on this \nissue that cuts across all ideological lines. State Representative \nTeresa Fedor helped to lead a successful fight for passage of the safe \nharbor bill in the Ohio legislature 3 years ago.\n  Dr. Celia Williamson, a professor of social work at the University of \nToledo, is recognized nationally, and even internationally, as a leader \nin human trafficking research and activism. She has been a tremendous \nforce on this issue. With her help and leadership, the University of \nToledo just established the Human Trafficking and Social Justice \nInstitute. The university has hosted annual human trafficking \nconferences, and the formation of this institute is a terrific next \nstep in its commitment to addressing a problem that plagues Toledo and \ntoo often goes unacknowledged and unaddressed.\n  Finally, I want to commend the members of the Lucas County Human \nTrafficking Coalition, which has had some very diverse membership and \nhas worked for several years to better coordinate and provide services \nto victims.\n  Human trafficking is a problem that knows no borders and, of course, \nknows no political party. I hope we can continue to work together to \ncombat this awful epidemic. I hope we will be able to work through our \nissues to resolve the issue with the Hyde amendment language.\n  We must take swift and aggressive language to prevent these crimes \nand work to ensure justice and restitution and healing for its victims.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are debating a bill today that should \nbe about an issue we can all agree on--eliminating human trafficking. \nThis bill should be about protecting women's health and rights and \nabout fighting back against the unacceptable presence of human slavery \nin our country. In other words, if anything should be bipartisan, this \nbill is it.\n  I know many of us were hoping this bill--the Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act--would be an example of Republicans and Democrats \nworking together because surely we can agree these problems need to be \naddressed--and urgently--and that the gridlock and dysfunction we see \nfar too often in Congress should have absolutely no place in this \ndiscussion. So I am appalled that on a bill intended to help women, \nRepublicans actually have chosen to double down on their political \nfight against women's health. Republicans have tried to sneak in a \nprovision that would hurt women and drag this bill into yet another \npartisan fight. They just can't seem to help themselves.\n  The provision the Republicans are hoping to sneak in--again, on a \nhuman trafficking bill--would be a permanent extension of the so-called \nHyde amendment. It would move beyond the status quo, which only applies \nto appropriated taxpayer money, and expand it into the new nontax-\nfunding streams this bill would authorize. That means if this law \npasses--a law intended to help women who have experienced truly \nhorrific violence and hardship--Congress would at the same time allow \npoliticians to interfere even more with the most deeply personal health \ndecisions a woman can make.\n  Trying to slip a women's health restriction into a women's safety \nbill is akin to slipping a tractor ban into the farm bill. It doesn't \nmake sense.\n  This isn't the first time Republicans have tried this political \nstunt. Again\n\n[[Page S1405]]\n\nand again Republicans in Congress have picked completely unnecessary \npolitical fights over women's health. They threatened a government \nshutdown over Planned Parenthood funding in 2011. They have tried to \njam through reproductive health riders on appropriations legislation. \nHouse Republicans even attached women's health restrictions to the \neducation bill they tried to pass this month. It is shocking to see it \nhappening again.\n  The good news is that the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act can \nstill be the bipartisan legislation it should be. Democrats are here \nand ready to work with Republicans to fix this bill and move past this \npartisan debate over women's health. We are very hopeful that once that \nhappens, we can get this bill passed and take a step toward solving a \nhorrible problem we all know needs a solution.\n  I hope my Republican colleagues agree with me that women deserve \nbetter than one step backward for every step forward when it comes to \ntheir health and their rights. I hope they agree that a bill to end \nmodern-day slavery in the United States is not the right time to try to \nsneak in a political victory for their base. If they agree, they will \nprove that by working with us rather than focusing on political fights \nwe have seen more than enough of in this Congress.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment to call up my amendment No. 285.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BROWN. I object on behalf of a number of Members on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, it is hard to adequately express my \nfrustration that we can't get moving on this bill.\n  First of all, the underlying bill that our friends on the other side \nare blocking progress on is a very sensible, important, constructive \nbill. I commend Senator Cornyn for having introduced this. I am proud \nto be a cosponsor.\n  This is the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act.\n  Let's be clear what this is about. We have a huge problem in this \ncountry. In all 50 States there are people who actually engage in the \nbuying and selling of human beings, mostly women and young children, in \na sex trade. That is what is happening. And this is a bill that would \nenhance the penalties and thereby discourage this activity. It would \ntake some of the proceeds from the penalties paid by these monsters who \nwould engage in this kind of activity and it would use those proceeds \nto help victims. I don't understand where the objection comes from for \na bill such as this, and now we can't move ahead on my amendment.\n  My amendment is a little bit different but it is in a similar vein. \nIt is designed to help protect children from sexual predators in \nschools, and we just heard the objection. The folks on the other side \nof the aisle somehow object to legislation that would enhance a \nprotection for the kids in our schools. Let me explain why this is so \nimportant.\n  The inspiration for this bipartisan bill that I have introduced with \nSenator Manchin and which I just tried to call up as an amendment and I \nwas prevented from doing so--the inspiration for this is an absolutely \nhorrendous story that begins in Delaware County, PA.\n  There was a schoolteacher who for years was molesting boys in his \ncare. He raped one of the boys. The prosecutors discovered what was \ngoing on, but they never had enough evidence to actually press charges. \nThe school knew what was going on, so they decided: Why don't we make \nthis monster someone else's problem? And that is exactly what they did.\n  They wrote a letter of recommendation so this animal could go across \nthe State line--which he did--get hired by a school in West Virginia--\nwhich he did--and become a teacher, eventually rise to be principal, \nand along the way continue molesting we don't know how many kids, but \nwe do know in the end he raped and killed a 12-year-old boy. Because \nthat is what these people do. And there is a practice that happens--as \nhard as this is to talk about, as unbelievable as this is in practice, \nit is a reality that some schools would like these people to become \nsomeone else's problem, and they actually give them a letter of \nrecommendation so they can go somewhere. And they do indeed become \nsomeone else's problem. That is what I am trying to stop here. That is \nwhat we are trying to stop.\n  This happened with a teacher who left Pennsylvania and went to West \nVirginia, and the little boy's name was Jeremy Bell.\n  Senator Manchin from West Virginia and I have teamed up on a bill \nthat would make this practice of knowingly and willfully aiding a known \npedophile from getting a job somewhere else--we would make that \nillegal.\n  We wouldn't think we should have to do that because we wouldn't think \nanybody with a conscience could do it, but it happens. We know it \nhappens. We have heard these stories time and again.\n  By the way, this is not such an isolated event as we would like to \nthink it is. Last year alone, 459 teachers and other school employees \nacross America were arrested for sexual misconduct with the kids they \nwere supposed to be taking care of and looking after.\n  We all know that for the vast majority of schoolteachers it would \nnever occur to them. It would never cross their mind, they would never \ndo such a thing. But there are a number of pedophiles--monsters who \nprey on kids. And they know where the kids are. So they try to find \ntheir way into these schools so they can prey on the victims.\n  The 459 who were arrested last year were the ones we knew enough \nabout that prosecutors felt they could prosecute, so they made an \narrest. How many more are happening but we don't know enough of the \nspecifics, we don't have a strong enough case to actually make an \narrest?\n  So far this year, we are not off to a much better start. We are 69 \ndays into the new school year, and already 82 people have been arrested \nacross America.\n  This isn't some isolated one-time problem. This is a genuine problem \nwe need to do something to solve, so Senator Manchin and I have come \ntogether with a bill that addresses this.\n  The whole idea, the whole goal, is very simple: Let's make sure \nschools are not hiring these predators and we are protecting our kids \nfrom them. It does that with two mechanisms, two simple provisions that \nachieve this.\n  One is it requires background checks that will get the job done and \nscreen out those who have a previous conviction; and it will also make \nit illegal to have this terrible practice of passing the trash--this \nterrible practice of recommending a teacher who is a known pedophile. \nNeither of these mechanisms should be controversial.\n  This is almost identical legislation which passed the House \nunanimously. The House is not exactly known for not having any partisan \ndivides, and yet it passed unanimously. We have Members of this body \nwho were Members of the House in the last Congress and voted for it \nthen, are now cosponsors of this legislation, and amazingly to me we \nare having this discussion.\n  I am being blocked from offering this amendment. The language in my \namendment is almost identical to the language we had in the child care \ndevelopment block grant, which this body voted for and all but one \nMember voted in favor of that bill, which would provide exactly this \nkind of criminal background check on employees for daycare.\n  This body has voted to ensure the protection of really young kids, as \nit should have. I fully supported that. Why would we block providing \ncomparable protection to kids who are just a little bit older? How can \nit be that we want to make sure pedophiles don't get into our daycare \ncenters but it is OK for them to be in elementary schools, in middle \nschools, and in high schools? This makes no sense at all. And it is \nnecessary, because while every State\n\n[[Page S1406]]\n\nhas some kind of background check system, there are huge loopholes, \nthere are huge gaps, there are huge inconsistencies that are allowing \npeople to get through.\n  Our legislation would require background checks on any adult hired by \na school who would come in unsupervised contact with kids--teachers, \ncontractors, schoolbus drivers, a sports coach--anybody so that we \nwould be protecting our kids from pedophiles who actively seek the \nopportunity to prey on these kids.\n  One of the things we do to make sure the background check would be \nthorough is we require that the school districts would check both the \nState and Federal databases. Let me give a story about why this is so \nimportant.\n  In Alaska, parents got a very rude awakening when they discovered \nthis story. It was on August 29 of last year. Alaska State troopers \narrested a middle school teacher in Kiana, AK.\n  The teacher had fled Missouri 4 years earlier to escape an arrest \nwarrant. Multiple witnesses accused the teacher of over a decade of \nsexual and physical abuse of his own adopted kids. He had raped and \nstarved his own children. These kids literally burrowed a hole through \nthe wall so they could take frozen food out of the freezer. They heated \nit up on a furnace just to survive. It is just one of those \nunbelievable horror stories--while this monster was able to obtain a \nteaching certificate in Alaska and teach there--teaching kids for 4 \nyears.\n\n  When asked how this could possibly happen, the Alaska Department of \nEducation explained that Alaska's background checks only check the \nState's criminal registry. Now, had our legislation been in force, they \nwould have been required to check the Federal registry, and they would \nhave learned that he was a fugitive with an arrest warrant and a \ncriminal record in another State. That is the kind of ability we have \nto have to prevent these people from going across States and committing \nthese kinds of crimes.\n  The other provision that I mentioned earlier is a provision that \nwould preclude--make it illegal--for someone knowingly to recommend a \npedophile to be hired at another school. Again, you would like to think \nthat something like that wouldn't even be necessary. But it is, and \nanother story reveals this recently.\n  A Las Vegas, NV, kindergarten teacher was arrested for kidnapping a \n16-year-old girl and infecting her with a sexually transmitted disease. \nThat same teacher had molested six children, all fourth and fifth \ngraders, several years before when that teacher was working in the Los \nAngeles school district.\n  The Los Angeles school district knew all about these allegations. In \n2009, in fact, the school district recommended settling a lawsuit they \nwere facing because the teacher had molested the children. The Nevada \nschool district to which the pedophile went had specifically asked if \nthere were any criminal concerns regarding the teacher, and the Los \nAngeles school district not only hid the truth that they knew about \nthis guy's predations, but they actually provided three references so \nthat he could get hired in Las Vegas.\n  So for people who say the States can solve these problems themselves, \nI would ask: What was that 16-year-old girl supposed to do? What could \nNevada have done about the Los Angeles school district's behavior?\n  So I am not going away on this. This is something that we need to do. \nI have three young kids. When any one of us parents anywhere in America \nputs our children on the school bus in the morning, we have every right \nto expect they are going to a place where they will be safe--as safe as \nthey could possibly be. We know that there is more that we could be \ndoing here to make them safer. It is unconscionable that we don't act \non it.\n  So I will be back, because we are going to have a vote on this one \nway or another, and I am very disappointed we couldn't have it this \nmorning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would like to follow up on something that the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania just said on the process--not on the substance of \nthese amendments.\n  We are in a situation where we have a bill before the Senate that has \nbroad bipartisan support, and it came out of the committee I chaired, \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, on a unanimous vote. Now we are stalled \non proceedings, and I would like to emphasize what is different and why \nthis bill should be moving forward in the year 2015 as opposed to the \nlast few years when the other political party controlled the Senate.\n  In the U.S. political system, elections are supposed to have \nconsequences, and as a consequence of the last election, there is a new \nmajority in the Senate. That new majority results from campaign \npositions taken in the last election that if we had a new majority, the \nSenate was going to be run in the way that James Madison implied that \nit ought to run--as a deliberative body, as a body where every Member \ncould participate, where you would reach consensus, and where you give \nvery serious thought to legislation that comes before this body--and do \nit in a way differently than the House of Representatives was meant to \ndo business and has done business for the 230 years under our \nConstitution.\n  So we ran on a platform that we would have the Senate debate and be \nopen for amendments, and the leader announced that when this bill was \ngoing to come up, it would be an open amendment process. Everybody \ncould participate. Now we are in a situation where the minority is not \nallowing us to move forward on amendments because they have objections \nto a provision that was in this bill since its introduction. Every \nMember had not only days but weeks to consider it before it came out of \ncommittee on a unanimous vote. And those provisions that were in this \nbill from the introduction--and every Senator knew they were in there, \nand every Senator's staff knew they were in there. If they didn't know \nthat this language was in there, then they didn't read the legislation. \nThere are plenty of people to read legislation around here, even beyond \nthe Members of the committee.\n  So this language deals with what is called the Hyde amendment, which \nfor either 39 or 40 years has basically said that taxpayers' money \nshould never be used to finance abortions. So all of a sudden there is \nobjection to that language in this bill, which was in the bill when the \nvery same Members who are objecting to it now on the floor of the \nSenate knew it was in there, and we can't move forward because they \nobject to the amendment.\n  So I proposed to them that they offer an amendment to strike what \nthey don't like and find out where the votes are. If they win, they \nwin. If they don't win, we move forward. But you can't hardly hold up a \npiece of legislation over language that is in the bill that has been \npart of the law of this country for 39 or 40 years and then say that \nyou didn't know it was in there, when it was in there when you voted to \nget it out of committee.\n  Senator Toomey just gave a speech about his amendment. He asked \nunanimous consent to bring it up. The minority in the Senate, which has \nthe same right to offer amendments that any other Senator can offer, \nrefused to let him get a vote on his amendment or even disputed the \nfact of laying an amendment aside to move forward on it. So we are at a \nstandstill.\n  Statistically, I would like to show how the new majority is intending \nto operate the Senate on a different basis than had been operated on in \nprevious years and use statistics of last year. If the statistics are \noff by 1 or 2 numbers, I hope somebody will forgive me. But roughly, we \nhad 18 rollcalls on amendments last year, because there was every \neffort to be made to stall the Senate so amendments couldn't come up \nfor a vote. Already this year we have had approximately 40-some \nrollcall votes on amendments, and more than a majority of those have \nbeen amendments offered by the minority party in the Senate.\n  So the elections showed that people want the Senate to work as a \ndeliberative body, where every Senator can participate, and we ought to \nmove forward on that.\n  I would ask the people who object to moving forward on this amendment \nto offer an amendment to strike the provisions they don't like and move \non so that the other several Members of the Senate who are stalled now \non offering their amendments can offer their\n\n[[Page S1407]]\n\namendments and eventually we can get through those amendments and vote \non a bill that got out of the Senate Judiciary Committee without a \nsingle dissenting vote from either Republicans or Democrats.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, of course I also would like to see the \ntrafficking bill go forward.\n  I am looking around the floor of the Senate, and I think I am the \nonly person standing on the floor who has actually prosecuted people \nfor molestation and endangerment of children.\n  I am not going to repeat what I said yesterday. I talked about some \nof those horrible cases, and I did mention having young children of my \nown at the time and how hard working on those cases hit me. When \nnormally preparing for trials--in the evenings, in most cases--I could \njust work at home preparing for the trial. When preparing for these \ntypes of cases however, I didn't come home. I would work in my office \nfor two reasons. I didn't want to take any chance, inadvertently, that \none of my children would see any of the pictures or the exhibits that \nwe were going to have in the trial, as graphic as they were. But also, \nI didn't want them to see their father crying, which I did as I would \nread these files, and have them ask me why I was crying, because I \ncouldn't lie to them. It was better just to stay in the office.\n  I say that because we have to approach this not just in the after-\nthe-fact manner expressed. I like the idea of having the $30 million to \nhelp those who have been hurt--the victims. I worry, as the House of \nRepresentatives worried, that if it is simply money that comes from \nfines, we are never going to see that money. All the people I \nprosecuted on crimes against young people went to prison. If you could \nhave given them a $50 million fine or a $50 fine, they weren't going to \npay it. They had no money. After their defense was over, they had no \nfunds.\n  At some point we are going to have to correct that. Say $30 million \nis a good target, and any fines will go into that fund, but we should \ntake taxpayers' funds to make up any difference.\n  When we lock these people up, we spend $25,000 or $35,000 a year to \nlock them up. But half of the time we tell the victim: It is terrible \nwhat happened to you. Sorry, we can't do anything for you.\n  We also have to approach the things necessary to prevent what \nhappened. I am filing a Leahy-Collins amendment, the Runaway and \nHomeless Youth Trafficking Prevention Act. I will file that. The \namendment will help runaways such as Holly Austin Smith. She was 14 \nyears old when she was lured away from home by a man who promised her a \nglamorous life in California. Instead, he sold this 14-year-old for \nsex. She told her devastating story to the Senate Judiciary Committee \nlast month. Both Senator Grassley and I were there and heard it. I was \ncertainly moved by her words and call for action.\n  She told us to protect girls such as her, saying that ``policies on \nprevention should be one of our highest priorities.'' I agree. That is \nwhy Senator Collins and I are offering this amendment.\n  Of course we should have the ability to go after somebody who has \ncommitted these crimes. But wouldn't it be better for the victims if we \ncould stop the crime from happening in the first place? If we can do \nsomething to help people such as this 14-year-old and we can stop it \nfrom happening in the first place, we would be much better off.\n  Too many of the runaway and homeless youth in this country have no \nplace to go. They have no place to sleep at night. They are alone on \nthe street without resources or adults to protect them, and human \ntraffickers know that. One shelter survey found that 50 percent of the \nhomeless youth have been solicited for sex by an adult within 48 hours \nof leaving home.\n  I ask any parent or grandparent in this Senate: What would you think \nif your children or grandchildren were put in that situation?\n  This is not a Republican or a Democratic issue, this is a human \nissue--this is an American issue.\n  It is our hope that we can work around what I hope is a momentary \nglitch in this bill so we can get to these things.\n  I will say again, based on my own experience as a prosecutor and \nbased on everything I have heard over the years--part of the time as \nthe ranking member and part of the time as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee during the past 40 years--that when it comes to the fight \nagainst human trafficking, we cannot simply focus on ending demand and \narrest our way out of this problem. We have to eliminate the conditions \nthat make these children so vulnerable.\n  The good news is the program supported by this amendment has helped \nthousands of young people get back on their feet by providing shelter, \njob training, and caring adults to counsel and guide them. These \nprograms work. They keep kids safe, and they save lives.\n  A growing number of homeless and runaway youth are LGBT, and many of \nthem have been thrown out of their homes for who they are. Again, as a \nparent and grandparent, that is heartbreaking to me. We have to ensure \nthat these particularly vulnerable children, who have already been \nrejected once, do not face rejection again, and that is why Senator \nCollins and I included a nondiscrimination provision in our amendment \nthat will make clear that any program accepting Federal dollars must \nhelp care for all of these children. They can't turn these young people \naway because they do not like the way they look or dress or who they \nlove. No program that takes Federal money should be allowed to \ndiscriminate, period.\n  The nondiscrimination language in this bill is nearly identical to \nthe language that 78 Senators--Republicans and Democrats alike--\nsupported in this body when we passed the Violence Against Women Act in \nthe last Congress, the Leahy-Crapo bill. It is the same language the \nRepublican-controlled House passed and the President signed into law 2 \nyears ago.\n  Last year, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I moved \nthis legislation through committee and Senator Grassley and Senator \nCornyn, to their credit, and almost every Republican on the Judiciary \nCommittee voted for it. If these protections are acceptable for adult \nvictims of domestic and sexual violence, why shouldn't they be for \nchildren? No one should be discriminated against, but especially not \nthese vulnerable children who have already faced more adversity than \nmany of us will ever know.\n  We, as Senators, lead a privileged and sheltered life. We work hard, \nbut it is still a privileged and sheltered life. We are not facing what \nthese children are facing--a scared, vulnerable, lonely child at a bus \nstop or trying to get somebody to buy them a pizza because they are \nhungry or looking for a place where they can sleep out of the cold. We \nare never going to face that, but too many Americans do.\n  Some may argue and say that the antidiscrimination language somehow \nthreatens religious freedom. That is not true. No one's religious \nfreedom is threatened by this language. This is not about religion, it \nabout supporting all of the children who most desperately need our \nhelp.\n  I understand their concerns. We have narrowed the scope of this \nprovision so it applies only to these programs being reauthorized in \nthis amendment. We have also clarified that nothing in this bill stops \norganizations from providing necessary sex-specific programming, such \nas shelters for homeless, runaway, or trafficked girls.\n  I have heard from dozens of service providers in my State of Vermont, \nand also across the country, that these programs work.\n  As Cyndi Lauper, a long-time advocate for homeless and runaway youth, \nwrote in an op-ed for The Hill yesterday, ``The time to act is now, \nbecause homeless youth don't have the time for us to wait until \ntomorrow.''\n  Who will help these young people if we do not? These children are too \noften left behind, and for too many being left behind means being \ntrafficked. We cannot and should not leave them behind today.\n  I urge all Senators that when the amendment is called up to support \nit. I ask unanimous consent that the op-ed that was in The Hill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1408]]\n\n                    [From The Hill, March 10, 2015]\n\n Don't Let the Senate Throw Away 40 Percent of America's Homeless Youth\n\n                           (By Cyndi Lauper)\n\n       ``Enough is enough.'' It's a phrase that is said all too \n     often about so many issues in our society, but unfortunately \n     not enough when it comes to our nation's most vulnerable \n     young people.\n       Congress must reauthorize the Runaway and Homeless Youth \n     Act (RHYA), our nation's only federal law that specifically \n     funds vital services for homeless youth. Republicans and \n     Democrats have come together to ensure that our Federal \n     Government offers much needed support to all homeless youth.\n       Sens. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) \n     have introduced bipartisan legislation to reauthorize RHYA, \n     which will likely be brought up for a floor vote in the \n     Senate this week--possibly as soon as today.\n       The act includes a non-discrimination clause that will help \n     ensure lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) \n     homeless youth not only have access to critical services, but \n     that those services are safe, welcoming, and tailored to meet \n     the needs of all youth.\n       We need that clause and some groups are trying to push to \n     have it taken out. I was taught to listen to Proverbs 31: \n     Speak up for those who cannot speak up for themselves. Our \n     kids need us to protect them, not to discriminate against \n     them.\n       Research shows that while LGBT youth make up to seven \n     percent of the general youth population, they comprise, on \n     average, 40 percent of the 1.6 million youth that are \n     homeless in this country each year. Think about that. It's \n     impossible to ignore.\n       There is no getting around the fact that these kids are too \n     often being thrown out of their homes and left to fend for \n     themselves on the streets. The fact that this occurs each and \n     every day in our country is simply a tragedy--a tragedy that \n     does not have to continue.\n       At the True Colors Fund, we continue to hear stories of \n     young people being discriminated against, offered improper \n     services, and even turned away by service providers just \n     because they happen to be lesbian, gay, bisexual, or \n     transgender. By continuing to leave 40 percent of our \n     homeless youth unprotected, we are cutting our society off at \n     the knees.\n       Kids actually ARE our future. What kind of future do we \n     have in store if we do not care for all of our youth? ALL \n     deserve to have their needs met so that these incredible and \n     courageous young people can achieve their dreams and become \n     healthy, happy, and contributing members of our society. \n     These are our future teachers, parents, and leaders and we \n     cannot afford to leave even one of them behind.\n       Programs and services receiving federal funding must be \n     inclusive of all youth. Congress can start by passing the \n     Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act to \n     ensure that all youth are protected in the vital programs \n     that it would reauthorize. The time to act is now, because \n     homeless youth don't have the time for us to wait until \n     tomorrow.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to \nSenator Cornyn's bill, S. 178, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking \nAct.\n  Under current law, there are many trafficking victims who, even after \ngaining freedom from their captors, have to live their lives stuck with \na criminal record because of things they were forced to do in \ncaptivity.\n  Imagine being freed from the hell of sexual slavery only to find \nyourself unable to get a job or stable housing because the law \nconsiders you a criminal.\n  My amendment, the Federal Criminal Procedure Post-Conviction Relief \nFor Victims of Trafficking Act, would vacate the criminal convictions \nof trafficking victims who were forced to break the law while they were \ntrafficked. It would expunge the criminal records of trafficking \nvictims and it would give trafficking victims a chance to restart their \nlives without stigma and without a criminal record.\n  These boys and girls were snatched into captivity. They were forced \ninto sexual slavery, and they were denied the freedom to make their own \ndecisions, including the chance to say no to committing a crime.\n  These victims are not criminals. Their bodies are scarred. Their \nmemories are shaken by trauma. The least Congress can do is give them \nthe dignity of a clean record and a new chance to lead a fulfilling \nlife. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I also wish to urge my colleagues to support a bill Senator Rubio and \nI introduced called the Strengthening the Child Welfare Response to \nTrafficking Act. This bill would require each State to develop a plan \nto protect young victims of labor and sex trafficking from falling back \ninto captivity after they have escaped.\n  As it stands now, many of the various services and programs that are \nmeant to keep children from these dangerous, oppressive cycles are \nfailing to do their jobs. Instead of being protected and comforted as \nvictims of violent crime, young trafficking survivors are sent into the \njuvenile justice system and treated as criminals--as if it were their \nown fault and their own choice that they were held in captivity and \nforced into exploitation. This is just not the case.\n  This bill would give American children better trained protective \nservice workers, better lines of communication between victims and \nprotective services, and better data on where trafficking crimes are \nactually occurring, how often, and whom traffickers are targeting.\n  I commend my colleagues for bringing this issue of human trafficking \nso boldly to the Senate floor, and I encourage everyone in this Chamber \nto support these legislative efforts to solve our country's trafficking \nproblem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 284 to Amendment No. 271\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk, Vitter amendment No. 284, to Portman amendment No. 271, and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 284 to amendment No. 271.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend section 301 of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n to clarify those classes of individuals born in the United States who \n       are nationals and citizens of the United States at birth)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. _. CITIZENSHIP AT BIRTH FOR CERTAIN PERSONS BORN IN THE \n                   UNITED STATES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 301 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1401) is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(a) In General.--'' before ``The \n     following'';\n       (2) by redesignating subsections (a) through (h) as \n     paragraphs (1) through (8), respectively, and indenting such \n     paragraphs, as redesignated, an additional 2 ems to the \n     right; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b) Definition.--Acknowledging the right of birthright \n     citizenship established by section 1 of the 14th Amendment to \n     the Constitution of the United States, a person born in the \n     United States shall be considered `subject to the \n     jurisdiction' of the United States for purposes of subsection \n     (a)(1) only if the person is born in the United States and at \n     least 1 of the person's parents is--\n       ``(1) a citizen or national of the United States;\n       ``(2) an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in \n     the United States whose residence is in the United States; or\n       ``(3) an alien performing active service in the armed \n     forces (as defined in section 101 of title 10, United States \n     Code).''.\n       (b) Applicability.--The amendment made by subsection (a)(3) \n     may not be construed to affect the citizenship or nationality \n     status of any person born before the date of the enactment of \n     this Act.\n       (c) Severability.--If any provision of this section or any \n     amendment made by this section, or any application of such \n     provision or amendment to any person or circumstance, is held \n     to be unconstitutional, the remainder of the provisions of \n     this Act and the amendments made by this Act and the \n     application of the provision or amendment to any other person \n     or circumstance shall not be affected.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this is the same amendment I presented--\ntried to present--and discussed on the floor of the Senate yesterday. \nIt addresses a very serious problem with our\n\n[[Page S1409]]\n\nbroken immigration system as well as a problem that leads to serious \nabuse and trafficking, which is why it is certainly relevant and \npertinent in this ongoing discussion of the bill on the floor.\n  First of all, let me again compliment Senator Cornyn and everyone who \nhas joined him on a bipartisan basis in support of his antihuman \ntrafficking amendment. I think that underlying bill is very positive \nand very significant. I certainly fully support it, apart from how my \namendment fares. Obviously I hope my now second-degree amendment to the \nPortman amendment is adopted, but I certainly support this underlying \neffort, which is very important.\n  As I said, my amendment pertains to birthright citizenship and the \nfact that that now acts as an enormous magnet to increase and encourage \nillegal crossings into our country. It also has spawned an entire \nsubculture and industry, quite frankly, that has given rise to \nsignificant abuse--often very dangerous and horrific conditions for the \nwomen and families who are caught in it.\n  Yesterday, as part of my floor statement, I submitted for the Record \nseveral news reports that underscored these cases of abuse. This came \nto light in part because of the raid by Federal agencies just within \nthe last few weeks of these so-called birth tourism businesses, and \nthose Federal raids uncovered some truly grizzly situations in \nCalifornia and elsewhere that underscore my point.\n  This ad, which is an ad on behalf of one of these birth tourism \ncompanies in China, also underscores my point. The Presiding Officer \nand I couldn't come up with a cartoon such as this and call it fiction \nif we were challenged to, but this is real. This is an actual cartoon \nad enticing birth mothers in China to go to the United States, to come \nback with their baby having been born in the United States, and the \nbaby wrapped in the American flag means automatic U.S. citizen. That of \ncourse triggers all sorts of significant benefits and opportunities for \nthe immediate family of that baby to in the future come to the United \nStates and become citizens.\n  This birthright citizenship has clearly mushroomed into a significant \nproblem and a significant form of abuse of our immigration system.\n  According to the Center for Immigration Studies, every year about \n300,000 to 400,000 children are born to illegal aliens in the United \nStates, and under this practice--and I underscore ``practice''--of \nbirthright citizenship--and I will come back to that word because it is \nnot mandated by the Constitution--they automatically are recognized as \nU.S. citizens simply and purely because of the physical location of \ntheir physical birth.\n  I said ``practice'' for a reason. It is not mandated by the \nConstitution as opposed to what we hear on a regular basis. It isn't \neven mandated by statutory law. It is the practice of several \nadministrations, including this one. It is a very uncommon practice if \nwe look worldwide. Only Canada, among advanced or industrialized \ncountries, follows this practice along with the United States. No other \nadvanced or industrialized country--for instance, no European country--\nfollows this practice of counting folks, giving them citizenship based \npurely on the fact, on the accident of the location of their physical \nbirth.\n  My amendment would change this. It would simply say a person can only \nbe a citizen if they were born in this country and at least one parent \nis a U.S. citizen or a legal, valid green card holder or a serving \nmember of the U.S. military. That is a commonsense rule that I think \nthe vast--in fact, I know from public polling and other means--the vast \nmajority of Americans of all stripes, of all walks of life, and of both \nparties support.\n  Again, let me be clear. My amendment would say a child born in this \ncountry is a U.S. citizen if they are born in this country and at least \none of the parents is a U.S. citizen or a valid green card holder or a \nmember of the U.S. military.\n  If there is any policy reason why that rule is unreasonable, I would \nlove to hear it. I have been promoting this debate, I have been pushing \nthis change of policy for several years now, and I have never heard a \nreal debate on the policy, on the merits. There are lots of excuses \nthat people don't want to bring this up, don't want to have a vote, but \nI have never heard a real debate and objection on the merits.\n  That being said, let me move to one of the excuses, and the most \npopular excuse given is that somehow this is embedded in the \nConstitution--specifically, the 14th Amendment--and we can't change \nthis absent a constitutional amendment. I am absolutely convinced that \nis not true, and I will explain why.\n  The first reason I think we can glean that it is not true is the \nlanguage of the 14th Amendment. That is a good place to start, right? \nWe are talking about the 14th Amendment. We are talking about a \nspecific constitutional provision, so let's start by going there and \nsee what it says. Does it say everyone physically born in this country \nis a U.S. citizen, period? No, it does not. So what does it say? It \nextends citizenship to ``all persons born or naturalized in the United \nStates and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.'' The key phrase is \n``and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.''\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, our Founding Fathers, including our \nlater Founding Fathers who came up with the language of the 14th \nAmendment, chose their words carefully, and it is a fundamental rule of \neither constitutional or statutory construction that any word there, \nany phrase there must be there for a reason. It is not there just to \nadd extra words without adding meaning.\n  So that phrase absolutely has to mean something. It has to be there \nfor a reason. When we look at the history of the 14th Amendment, the \ndebate, the discussion in Congress, it is very clear it was there for a \nreason. It was there to exclude persons born in the United States who \nhad allegiance, who had some calling to another country. Specifically, \nthe folks participating in that debate talking about this language \nsaid, We are not including American Indians; they have an allegiance to \nthe tribe. We are not including aliens. Aliens--that word was broadly \nused. We are not including aliens. That certainly includes in today's \nlanguage illegal aliens who have an allegiance to another country. They \nare citizens of another country. We are not including the children of \ndiplomats who happen to be born here during their diplomat parents' \nstay. They clearly are citizens of another country. They have an \nallegiance to another country.\n\n  This line of thought was further elucidated by court decisions. In \nfact, there is a specific court decision with regard to American \nIndians. The Court directly said in that case, no, the 14th Amendment \ndoes not make American Indian children automatically U.S. citizens--\nbased on the specific language I am citing. Because of that, it wasn't \nuntil the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 was passed, explicitly making \nthose children American citizens, that they became American citizens. \nMuch more recently, respected jurists such as Judge Richard Posner of \nthe Seventh Circuit wrote in a 2003 case:\n\n       Congress would not be flouting the Constitution if it \n     amended the Immigration and Nationality Act to put an end to \n     the nonsense.\n\n  Talking specifically about birthright citizenship. So I hope we get \nthrough these excuses, these flawed constitutional arguments, these \nflawed arguments. Really, they are excuses to avoid the debate, to \navoid the issue, to avoid giving any reason why we should not go to the \nrule I am proposing. Why we should, in fact, recognize any child \nphysically born in this country as automatically a U.S. citizen, even \nif neither parent is a citizen, neither parent is here in the country \nlegally, neither parent is a green card holder, neither parent is a \nserving member of the U.S. Armed Services.\n  As I explained at the beginning, this is a very real, in fact, \nexploding phenomenon. There is a whole industry, an underworld, that is \nselling so-called birth tourism. This ridiculous but true cartoon is an \nexample. This acts as a magnet--a potent, powerful magnet growing in \npower by the year to lure more and more folks to come across the border \nin specific cases to have their babies here, 300,000 to 400,000 per \nyear.\n  In the last few weeks, as I mentioned earlier, there was a raid by \nthe relevant Federal agencies on some of\n\n[[Page S1410]]\n\nthese underworld and trafficking operations related to birth tourism. \nIt hit the news. It made significant news, as it should have. It was a \nsignificant law enforcement action. I applaud that action. It is a \ndangerous element. It is an underworld, usually criminal elements in \nthe midst of that, oftentimes abusing the women and children who have \nbeen placed into their hands.\n  Clearly, the most effective way to put an immediate end to all of \nthis is not simply conducting a law enforcement raid once every 5 years \nor once every 3 years or even once a week. Clearly, the most effective \nway to end this is to end the practice of birthright citizenship. That \nis what my amendment--now a second-degree amendment pending to the \nPortman amendment--would do.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to put an end to this nonsense, as Judge \nPosner said in his dicta, to set our policy straight, to adopt the \ncommonsense position of the vast majority of the American people, to \nadopt the same policy of every advanced industrialized country now save \nus and Canada, and to adopt this language on the present bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Capito). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I want to talk about the bill we are \nlooking at now, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. Certainly \nthere is nothing more hideous, nothing more morally offensive than the \nsexual exploitation of a human being. Take that exploitation today at a \nlevel that happens over and over again with children and with adults. \nThis is modern-day slavery. It exists right here in our country and all \nover the world. Slavery officially ended in the United States 150 years \nago. Worldwide there may be more people involved in enslaved activity \nand labor or in sex trafficking than at any other time.\n  According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, \nat least 100,000 American children each year are victims of commercial \nchild prostitution, child trafficking, other children brought to this \ncountry. Certainly this is not a tragedy that is isolated in the United \nStates. In fact, it is worse than other places, but it is unacceptable \nin all places.\n  Women and children, especially young girls, are advertised online \nwhere buyers purchase them with ease, generally with anonymity, and \nusually with impunity. We are told this happens in most cities in our \ncountry and in every State in our country. But this fight against sex \ntrafficking and labor trafficking isn't just a law enforcement issue, \nit is a human rights issue, and we should take it as seriously as we \npossibly can take anything.\n  That is why I was pleased to join Senator Cornyn and Senator Ayotte \nand others in cosponsoring and supporting the Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act. This act would provide law enforcement, the courts, \nand antitrafficking task forces with the necessary tools to help them \ntrack down traffickers; and it would also help victims restore their \nlives.\n  Last year we were able to pass the continuation of the Victims of \nChild Abuse Act, of which in our State we have 22 centers. We have \nhundreds of centers in the country where the beginning of restoration \ncomes with that first interview, that first determination. We are \nputting this behind us and moving forward. That same thing needs to \nhappen with victims of exploitation. This bill helps victims of \ntrafficking who are often invisible, often underserved, often unknown \nby anybody in the community where they have been taken except a person \nwho somehow has seized control of them and the people with whom that \nperson deals.\n  This bill would create grants for State and local governments to \ndevelop comprehensive systems to address these crimes and to provide \nservices for the victims of these crimes. This legislation would allow \nwiretaps obtained through State courts to be used to stop child sex \ntrafficking. This would train Federal prosecutors and judges on the \nimportance of requesting and ordering restitution.\n  In the last few days we passed a law that hopefully will wind up on \nthe President's desk so there could be some compensation for victims of \nchild pornography. We need to have that same kind of restitution and \nseizing of assets of these criminals who use people in this way, and \nthis bill allows some of those things to happen. It trains law \nenforcement on the physical and mental services that are immediately \nnecessary, and necessary in a longer term, for victims of trafficking.\n  The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act has been endorsed by 200 \nadvocacy groups. Those would include the NAACP, the National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children, Rights4Girls, the National Association \nto Protect Children, the Fraternal Order of Police, and the National \nConference of State Legislators. We need to get this done.\n  The elimination of sex trafficking has to be also focused on the \ndemand side. Without the buyers and facilitators, sex trafficking \nwouldn't happen. Labor trafficking wouldn't happen unless there were \nbuyers of that unwilling labor. Neither of these things should be \nallowed to continue. This bill deals with this topic in our country. I \nknow the Foreign Relations Committee is looking at what we can do to \nencourage the elimination of this travesty and tragedy all over the \nworld.\n  We have to take a stand against this modern-day slavery. This is a \nproblem that I hope we see Senators on both sides of the aisle step up \nto in the next few days and hopefully this week and figure out how to \nserve.\n\n\n                        Remembering Tom Schweich\n\n  Madam President, this is the first chance I have had to be on the \nfloor since I attended a memorial service a week ago yesterday in our \nState memorializing the life of our State auditor, Tom Schweich. Tom \nSchweich was very smart. He was very capable. He was very good at his \njob. He had a wonderful family. He had established such a record as \nState auditor that at the end of his first term, Tom Schweich, a \nRepublican, wasn't even opposed by a Democrat. I think it was the first \ntime in our State since the 1880s that the Democrats had not offered a \ncandidate for any State office.\n  Sometimes people with great capacity and great opportunity can face \nchallenges that others do not see. Tom's family is missing him. His \nfriends are missing him. Missouri will miss him but certainly benefited \nfrom his good work. I am thinking today, as I have every day since I \nheard the news of his death, about the service he provided, the lost \nopportunity of not having him with us any longer, and I am thinking \nabout his family.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I first want to thank my colleagues \nwho are continuing to work on this very important issue of sex \ntrafficking, Senator Grassley, the chairman of the Committee on the \nJudiciary, and Senator Leahy, the ranking member, who has long been \nworking on this issue and has a very important bill of his own related \nto this, as well as Senator Cornyn. Senator Cornyn and I have worked \ntogether on the sex trafficking issue for the past year. We are \ncosponsors of each other's bills. We have worked in the past on other \njudiciary issues, including a successful bill on prescription drug \ntake-backs, where we just recently were able to get the rules out and \ngot to work on that very important issue. I thank him for his good \nwork. We continue to work on the bill, the Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act. We know there are some major issues that have come up, \nand we continue to look for a path forward on that issue.\n\n  I do want to point out that sometimes in all of the disagreements, \nwhat gets lost is the good that needs to be done and why this bill is \nso important. It would support victims by taking fines and criminal \nassets from convicted human traffickers and directing them toward \nservices and treatment to help these victims restore their lives.\n  I know as a prosecutor in my former job that if people get the help \nthey need--if they can go to a shelter and they have an alternative to \na pimp--they will have a fighting chance of getting their life together \nagain and not going back into that cycle of violence.\n\n[[Page S1411]]\n\n  They also, by doing this--and we have done a lot of this in \nMinnesota--if we give them the support they need, then they will \ntestify against the person who is running that sex trafficking ring, \nagainst the perpetrator. We had a 40-year sentence last year in St. \nPaul, MN, against someone who was running a sex trafficking ring. That \nwas because we were able to provide the support the victims need, and \nthat is what Senator Cornyn's bill is about. It doesn't only help \nvictims, as I said, it also helps law enforcement and ensures that the \ncriminals, including johns, are brought to justice under our law \nbecause a financial transaction should not mask a sexual assault or \nrape on a child.\n  I think people often think of sex trafficking as something that is \njust happening in another country, in another part of the world. It is, \nin fact, the third largest enterprise in the world. First is illegal \ndrugs, then illegal guns, and then the illegal trafficking of people, \nprimarily kids. That is going on in our world right now. But what \npeople don't always expect is that in the United States, when we have \nsex trafficking cases, 83 percent of the victims are from our own \ncountry. Eighty-three percent of the victims are from the oil patches \nin North Dakota, from the streets of Minneapolis, and from the hills of \nWest Virginia. This is happening in our country right now.\n  That is why this pair of bills, Senator Cornyn's bill and the bill I \nhave--the safe harbor bill that passed through the Judiciary Committee \nunanimously last week--is designed to focus on domestic trafficking. It \ndoes have international implications because if we do our job and we \nshow as a country that we take this seriously, it will help us partner \nwith other countries.\n  Senator Heitkamp, Cindy McCain, and I went down to Mexico last spring \nto focus on partnering with Mexico. They have been enormous help in \nsome of the Federal prosecutions for sex trafficking rings we have had \nin our country--girls who have been brought across the border from \nMexico. They have helped with that. We have met with the Attorney \nGeneral as well as the head of their Federal Police on more work that \ncan be done.\n  But just think about what is happening right now in our country. Just \nin the last few weeks, five St. Paul, MN, residents were charged with \nrunning a multistate sex trafficking ring. One of the alleged victims \nwas 16 years old. Last month a man was indicted in Federal court under \nthe leadership of our U.S. attorney in Minnesota. What was he indicted \nfor? He was indicted for trafficking a 12-year-old girl, a young girl \nin Rochester, MN, who got a text that said: Come to a party. The girl \nshows up where she is supposed to go; it is the parking lot of a \nMcDonald's. She gets shoved in the car, along with her friend. They are \nbrought up to the Twin Cities. The man rapes her and takes sexually \nexplicit pictures of her and puts them on Craigslist. The next day she \nis sold to two guys, and she is raped by those two men. That happened \nin Minnesota. The charges were just filed.\n  The average age of a victim of sex trafficking is 12 years old--not \nold enough to go to a high school prom, not old enough to drive. That \nis what is happening in our country right now.\n  What can we do? Well, I discussed Senator Cornyn's bill and the \nimportance of that bill. I hope we can work through these issues. There \nis also the other bill, the Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act. \nThat would make sure victims of sex trafficking, like the 12-year-old \nRochester girl, are treated as victims. This is a bill that passed \nthrough the Judiciary Committee. I thank 26 of my colleagues across the \nSenate for cosponsoring this bill. It has been an honor to work with \nthem, with Senator Cornyn as the Republican lead.\n  I appreciate the help of the National Conference of State \nLegislatures, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, \nthe Fraternal Order of Police, Shared Hope International, and the \nNational Alliance to End Sexual Violence.\n  This bill is different from the bill we have in front of us on the \nfloor, but it has the same focus. What this bill does is it says: Let's \nlook at some of these models that have worked across the country. One \nof them is my State, and it is called the safe harbor law. What it does \nis that when States do this, they basically aren't prosecuting these \n12-year-old or 15-year-old girls or 16-year-old boys; they are seeing \nthem as victims, and then they give them the kinds of services they \nneed. A version of this bill, led by Erik Paulsen, one of my Republican \nCongressmen, passed through the House last year. I know the Presiding \nOfficer was there at that time. So I feel good about this bill's \nchances in the House as well as in the Senate.\n  Fifteen States across the country already have these safe harbor \nlaws, and another 12 States are making good progress in the direction \nthat we need, so we are not starting from scratch. What the bill does \nis simply give incentives for States to adopt these kinds of laws.\n  The bill also creates a national strategy to combat human trafficking \nwhich would encourage cooperation and coordination among all the \nagencies that work on the problem--Federal, State, tribal, and local. \nOur law enforcement officers and prosecutors, as I mentioned, have to \nwork together on this issue at all levels, but law enforcement can't do \nit alone. We need to make sure we are giving them the right support, \nand that is what this national strategy is about.\n  Other parts of the bill include allowing victims of sex trafficking \nto be eligible for the Job Corps program to help them get back on their \nfeet.\n  I am also pleased to have included in this safe harbor bill, in the \nStop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act, a provision that Senators \nWhitehouse and Sessions worked on that got included in our bill to \nclarify the authority of the U.S. Marshals Service to assist local law \nenforcement agencies in locating missing children.\n  I also know Senator Leahy and Senator Collins have a very important \nbill that I am a cosponsor of, the Runaway and Homeless Youth and \nTrafficking Prevention Act, which we would like to be considered either \nas a part of this bill, if we can work out these other issues, or on \nits own. It is a very important bill.\n  I have been very impressed by the bipartisan work we have done today. \nI was also very excited when all the women Senators, including the \nPresiding Officer, came together and asked for a hearing under Senator \nGrassley's and Senator Leahy's leadership. We had a very good hearing, \nand I think we can move from there.\n  This is one of those issues which people haven't talked about a lot \nin our country for a long time. I think one of the reasons it has come \nto the forefront is because of the Internet--something we love. More \nand more of these kinds of purchases can be made behind closed doors \nand out of the jurisdiction of any law enforcement officers if they \ndon't see it happening. Well, that is what happened with that 12-year-\nold girl in Rochester; she just received a text.\n  This is not only going to take Congress getting the bills done, it \nwill also take the work of the private sector. I have been impressed by \nthe work by our hotels and transportation companies, places such as the \nRadisson hotels and our various transportation companies that have \nreally stepped up and trained their employees because they are on the \nfrontlines, they can look for problems, and they can report them to law \nenforcement. That is something which we can not legislate; that is \nsomething which is just happening.\n  I know there are a number of amendments--some I like and some I do \nnot. I hope we can work through those as well.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and thank all of those--especially \nSenator Leahy, whose chair I am temporarily filling here on the floor, \nas he has spent a lot of time watching over this bill the last 2 days. \nI again thank Senator Cornyn for his good work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Tribute to Brian Phillips\n\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to a gentleman \nfrom Rosebud, TX, who has helped this\n\n[[Page S1412]]\n\nSenator from Utah on occasions too numerous to count and in ways \nimpossible to measure. For over 4 years Brian Phillips has dutifully \nserved as my communications director. As he prepares to pursue new \nopportunities, I want to pause and acknowledge his service to me, to my \noffice, to the people of Utah, and to our Nation.\n  The role of communications director in a Senate office is not for the \nfaint of heart nor is it for the arrogant or overconfident. Many \nbelieve the job of a communications director is to rack up style \npoints, political positioning, and positive spin. I have learned from \nBrian that a true communications director is laser-focused on \nsubstance, rock solid in his principles, and devoted to creating a \nspace for people to hear and understand a message. He has expanded my \nview of what communication truly is and what it can be--what it should \nbe.\n  Brian brought to my office the grittiness of his Texas roots, his \npassion from years on the campaign trail, the wisdom of one who has \nbeen tested in tough times, and the vision of a conservative reformer \nwho has seen the view from higher up. I am certain there were times \nwhen Brian wondered what in the world he had gotten himself into with a \nfreshman Senator and a ragtag team from Utah. I am also certain we are \nall better in what we do because he was willing to stand with us.\n  Brian is more than a communications director. He is a trusted \ncounselor. I trust Brian's assessment of complex situations and count \non his counsel to navigate challenging circumstances and to maximize \nseemingly hidden opportunities. No one has prepared me better to answer \nhard questions or deliver vital messages at critical moments. I would \nput Brian's uncanny sixth sense--his ``Spidey'' sense, as he calls it--\nabout what lurks around corners up against anyone's communications \nprofessional anywhere. Brian is a master at leading people into \nstrategic thinking, sometimes through heated discussions, but always to \nthe higher ground of meaningful dialog.\n  Brian is comfortable with and capable of engaging people from across \nthe professional and personal spectrum. I have watched him work with \nSenators and staff, with interns and individual Utahns, jaded \njournalists and passionate groups of grass-roots activists. He sets \neveryone at ease, provides an honest assessment, pushes when needed, \npulls when necessary, and through pushes, pulls, nudges, and shoves, \ngets everyone to the best possible place. To watch him work is \nextraordinary.\n  There are many in this town who simply look out for themselves. There \nare many who judge their success by their own headlines, bylines, and \nstory lines. I am most thankful that Brian Phillips put me and my \nstaff, along with the people of Utah and the people of this Nation, \nahead of his own interests. Because he put others first, he has created \na legacy that will last.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, we are here today and apparently this \nweek to discuss legislation pending before the Senate, the Justice for \nVictims of Trafficking Act.\n  We have a serious problem in this country and around the globe in \nregard to human trafficking. This legislation is an issue that needs to \nbe addressed and ought not be delayed. In fact, many from across the \ncountry are asking us to do just that, including hundreds of Kansans \nwho are concerned about the rights of individuals, the rights of women \nand men across the country. Congress has legislation now pending that \nseems to me to be very straightforward and common sense in trying to \neliminate this scourge from our country.\n\n  I want to highlight what I think is unfortunately developing in the \nSenate. I would refer back to the elections of November 2014, in which, \nI thought, at least one of the messages the American people delivered \nto us through their votes was a desire to see that legislation--\nparticularly legislation such as this--be addressed, that the Senate \nconsider it, amendments be offered, votes be taken, and ultimately \nlegislation be approved or disapproved by the Senate. Unfortunately, we \nstill find ourselves in a position in which we are unable to move \nforward on this legislation to consider amendments.\n  I would guess that some of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle would indicate that when the Republicans were in the minority \nthey from time to time blocked consideration of legislation pending. I \nwould tell you, that in my view, when I was a participant in that \nprocess, it was because of the belief that we would have no opportunity \nto offer amendments to legislation then pending. What I want to see is \nhow the Senate can process legislation, and what I want is for every \nMember of the Senate to have the opportunity to offer amendments, to \nhave them considered, to be voted on, and that right should exist for \nevery Republican Senator and every Democratic Senator. We should be in \na position in which we can resolve our differences not by blocking the \nconsideration of an important piece of legislation but by taking a vote \non an amendment offered by a Senator from a State here in the United \nStates and that the Senators have an opportunity to present their case, \nvotes be taken, and issues be resolved. Unfortunately, we are in a \nposition where we are even unable to consider this legislation, and I \nwould ask that this circumstance come to an end.\n  Again, in my view, a message from November 2014--the last time voters \nspoke in the United States--was, could we at least have a Congress that \ncan function, that can consider issues, and where votes can be cast and \ndecisions made. We find ourselves one more time in a situation in which \nwe are unable even to get to the bill to enable that consideration to \noccur.\n  At least as stated in the press, there is an argument about a \nprovision in the legislation. I would again say that if there is a \nprovision in the legislation, despite the fact that it was unanimously \napproved by the committee--every Republican and Democrat voted for it. \nAnd now there is this claim that they are opposed to that. If you are \nopposed to something, the way to solve it is not to block consideration \nof the bill. The way to solve it is to allow the bill to be considered, \nand if you oppose something in the bill, offer an amendment, have a \ndebate, and let the votes decide here on the Senate floor whether that \nprovision should remain in or be removed.\n  That provision that people are indicating is causing problems is one \nthat is related to the public funding of abortions. It is a provision \nthat has been law since the 1970s. It was voted on many times in the \nSenate, and 23 Senators voted for that provision in a spending bill in \n2014--just last year.\n  It appears we are manufacturing problems that don't really exist. \nThis provision was in the bill when the committee considered it, when \nthe committee approved it. Now as we bring this bipartisan bill to the \nSenate floor, there are those who are saying we can't consider it \nbecause this provision is included. I would indicate that the idea of \npublic funding--the use of taxpayer dollars to support abortion--is \ndisapproved by 7 out of 10 Americans. This is not a radical kind of \nissue or proposal. But my point is that we should have the opportunity \nto debate this and every other item within the bill, reach a \nconclusion, and move forward on a piece of legislation that is \nimportant in trying to protect the lives and safety of people across \nour country, particularly women and children.\n  So my plea to my colleagues is this. Could we again get to the point \nwhere the Senate functions, where we debate bills, votes are taken, and \nissues of importance are considered. I hope I learn later today that is \nthe case--that we can move forward in resolution of this legislation.\n  I am here to indicate I oppose public funding of abortion. I support \nthe trafficking legislation now pending. But I will never have the \nopportunity to demonstrate that because we are at a point in which no \nlegislation is able to be considered.\n  Madam President, I thank you for the opportunity to address the \nSenate.\n  I notice the Senator from Wyoming is on the floor, and I would be \nhappy to yield the floor for him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n[[Page S1413]]\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I agree entirely with my friend, the \nSenator from Kansas, and I thank him for his leadership and thoughtful \ndeliberation on this matter.\n  I would like for a moment to talk about this bill that is on the \nfloor, S. 178, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. I have an \namendment that I am offering today on human trafficking in Indian \nCountry. I will tell you that human trafficking is widespread in Indian \nCountry, and we have to do everything we can to stop it. Violent crime \nrates against women and girls in Native American communities are far \nhigher than the national averages. This amendment delivers help to \ntrafficking survivors and gives tribes the resources they need to \nbattle human trafficking in their own backyards. This amendment has \nbroad support and is a vital addition to the bill on the floor today.\n  My amendment would provide tribes the opportunity to access funding \nfor recovery programs for survivors and special training for local law \nenforcement in order to combat human trafficking specifically in Indian \nCountry. This amendment would allow Indian tribes to be able to compete \nfor resources for programs to prevent human trafficking. It would \nprovide for training for local tribal law enforcement so they would be \nbetter able to track trafficking activities. These trainings and \nadditional resources will better equip the tribal resources to better \nspot human trafficking in local communities and to act quickly to \nrespond.\n  This funding would also help the survivors of sex and labor \ntrafficking in their recovery. Programs such as this assist survivors \nin human trafficking and enable them to begin to heal and restore their \nlives. The bill, S. 178, allows for more protections for victims of \nhuman trafficking in our country, and my amendment would extend those \nprotections to the tribes in Indian Country as well.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Madam President, I noticed earlier today the minority leader as well \nas the minority whip on the Senate floor talking about the President's \nhealth care law.\n  I would like to point out that the Congressional Budget Office \nreleased a report Monday about the Obama health care law--ObamaCare. I \nsee the White House is actually championing the report. They call it \ngreat news for America.\n  Let's be clear. This report contains significant amounts of bad news \nfor people--bad news for people who signed up on the ObamaCare \nexchanges for getting their health insurance coverage.\n  In fact, the Congressional Budget Office predicts that health care \npremiums will increase more than 8 percent a year this coming year for \nObamaCare enrollees. They also predict it will increase 8 percent next \nyear for ObamaCare enrollees through the exchange for the benchmark \nplan, and they predict it will increase another 8 percent a year after \nthat. Most Americans can't afford to pay 8 percent more a year in \npremiums each and every year, which is what the Congressional Budget \nOffice is proposing, but you don't hear the Democrats on the floor \ntalking about that.\n  Wasn't it the President of the United States who said that premium \nrates would go down for families by $2,500 a year?\n  Isn't it so that many Senators on the other side of the aisle came to \nthe floor and said rates would go down. Nancy Pelosi said they would go \ndown for everyone. Why are the Democrats not mentioning what the CBO is \nsaying, that year after year after year the rates are going to go up 8 \npercent, another 8 percent, another 8 percent?\n  So we know the reality of what is happening to people all across the \ncountry, which is why this health care law continues to be unpopular, \nunaffordable, and unworkable. So I think it is time for the White House \nto stop celebrating and start thinking about the people who have been \nimpacted specifically by this expensive and unworkable piece of \nlegislation.\n  I found it interesting that on Monday, the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services held an event to celebrate the number of people who had \nsigned up for coverage this year. Secretary Burwell said she was \n``pleased with the results to date.'' She repeated the administration's \nsound bite about the health care law working.\n  Well, that is not what I am hearing from people at home in Wyoming. \nIt is not what I am hearing from my friends, neighbors, and patients. \nAs a doctor who has been taking care of patients in Wyoming for 25 \nyears, I talk to lots of patients every weekend at home. It is also not \nwhat I read in the papers. Papers all across the country, from the east \ncoast to the west coast, talk about hard working Americans who have \nbeen devastated by the impacts of this terrible health care law. It \nseems that every day there is more bad news about more ways that \nObamaCare is hurting American families and failing to live up to the \nmany promises made by the President and the Democrats in this body who \nvoted for it--the promises they made.\n  When you take a look at the Congressional Budget Office's new \nestimates of how many people are going to sign up for ObamaCare this \nyear, they had originally said there would be 14 million people who \nwould sign up for ObamaCare plans by the end of the year. Now they have \ndropped that number down to 11 million people. So it is not a surprise \nwhen fewer people--3 million fewer people--sign up, that it is going to \ncost the taxpayers less than the very high number they were expecting \nto have to pay. So that number has dropped, but it is because fewer \npeople are choosing to sign up for the Obama health care plan. Is the \nObama administration pleased that the President's health care law is so \nmuch less popular with the public than the President and Democrats \nexpected it to be?\n  As I talk about some of the stories that are coming out from the east \nto the west coast, I would like to start with a story from the Portland \nPress Herald newspaper in Portland, ME. On February 27, the headline \nwas: ``Many insured under Affordable Care Act taking a hit at tax \ntime.''\n  The article tells the story of Diana Newman, who lives in Southwest \nHarbor. She had ObamaCare insurance last year. She went to file her \ntaxes a few weeks ago. The article says that ``she got a $400 \nsurprise.'' That is how much she owed on her taxes specifically because \nof the new health care law. She told the newspaper that her tax \ntroubles are just another stumbling block in what she said was a long, \ndifficult year trying to figure out how to use and how to pay for her \nnew insurance.\n  She said: ``At the end of all this confusion, I was hit with hundreds \nof dollars at tax time.'' She said: ``It's frightening.''\n  Frightening--that is how somebody whom the President is claiming has \nbeen helped by the law is describing the impact on her life. It is \nfrightening. It turns out she was one of almost a million people who \ngot bad information from the government about their tax forms.\n  Well, that just made things more confusing for her. She said: ``At \nthis point, I don't know what to think. I may owe more, or less, or \nabout the same.''\n  Is the Obama administration--and all the Democrats who voted for this \nhealth care law--pleased about the way it is frightening this woman in \nMaine? I don't hear the Senate minority leader or the whip talking \nabout that.\n  Does the administration think that ObamaCare is working for Diana \nNewman?\n  The tax preparation company H Block says that more than half of \ntheir clients--more than half of their clients--have had their refunds \nreduced because of the health care law. On average H Block says their \ncustomers owe the IRS an extra $530. That is a lot of money for hard-\nworking taxpayers. A lot of people count on getting that tax refund to \nhelp them pay their bills this time of year.\n\n  Is the Obama administration pleased to see the IRS take another $530 \nfrom hard-working American families? Some of these people who owe money \nto the IRS didn't sign up for ObamaCare insurance at all last year.\n  Many are now finding out for the first time that they owe a tax \npenalty because the health care law's mandate says they have to buy \nhealth insurance and not just necessarily insurance that works for them \nand their family and their family's needs. Oh, no, the mandate states \nthey have to buy insurance President Obama says works for them, even \nthough they know it doesn't work\n\n[[Page S1414]]\n\nfor them. It may be too much insurance or insurance they don't need, \ndon't want, can't afford, and they don't have the freedom or \nflexibility to even make that choice. President Obama says he knows \nwhat is best for them because they don't.\n  The problem is that by the time many of these people figured that \nout, it was already too late to sign up for ObamaCare insurance for \nthis year so now they are getting taxed--penalized. People who didn't \nunderstand the tax penalties feel as though the Obama administration \nhas pulled a fast one on them.\n  Again, as we approach the 5-year anniversary, ObamaCare continues to \nbe unpopular with the American people. There is so much anger about the \ntiming of the tax issues that the administration had to backtrack and \nallow extra time for people to sign up this year.\n  The President made a YouTube video saying the deadline was February \n15. February 15 came and went, and then the President said: Well, we \nbetter open it up again. This President is making it up as he goes \nalong. We have seen it time and time again with this President and this \nlaw. He is making it up as he goes along.\n  Is the Obama administration pleased with this confusion and anger \nthat a lot of Americans are feeling because of the IRS penalties?\n  It is not just Washington that is causing trouble for people who have \nto sign up for the President's health care. We are seeing bad news all \nacross America.\n  I talked about Maine earlier. Let's go over to the other coast. Let's \ngo to Oregon. Oregon tried to set up its own health insurance exchange. \nThey did such an awful job that not one single person was ever able to \nsign up on the State Web site--not one, no one. People had to fill out \npaper applications if they wanted to try to buy insurance last year.\n  How much did it cost the State to set up this exchange where not one \nperson was able to buy insurance from the Web site? It cost taxpayers \n$248 million.\n  Last Friday the Governor of Oregon officially gave up. He signed a \nlaw dissolving the State exchange. Oregon will just use the Federal \nGovernment's exchange and the Federal Web site.\n  Does the Obama administration think that the failed Web site and the \nwasting of $248 million in taxpayer money is a sign that the health \ncare law is working? Is this administration pleased with the way \nOregon's ObamaCare exchange wasted nearly one-quarter of a billion \ndollars? That is one State alone.\n  Just next door in Washington State, they are having troubles of their \nown. There was an article in The Hill newspaper here in Washington, DC, \non February 25 titled ``State's ObamaCare overcharges 13K.'' There were \n13,000 people overcharged in the State's ObamaCare exchange in \nWashington State.\n  According to the article, the Washington State ObamaCare exchange \nsaid it withdrew the incorrect amount of money from the bank accounts \nof 13,000 people. Think about that in reference to your own checking \naccount, where there may be an automatic withdrawal based on a cable \nbill, cell phone bill or whatever. Many people--13,000 in this case in \nWashington State--had an incorrect withdrawal from the Washington State \nObamaCare exchange. It says that some of the people say that more than \nthree times the correct amount was withdrawn for their monthly premium \nfor health insurance.\n  Can you imagine if the electric company or one of the utilities--your \ncell phone provider or your cable company--withdrew three times the \namount expected from your checking account for that monthly bill. For \nsome people that glitch in the State system probably meant their \naccounts were going to end up overdrawn.\n  Even if the States get the problem fixed right away, that is an \nalarming failure by that ObamaCare exchange.\n  Is the Obama administration pleased with the anxiety the exchange is \ncausing 13,000 people in Washington State? These are just a few of the \nways ObamaCare is not living up to the promises that Democrats and the \nadministration made to the American people.\n  Later this month, on March 23, we will hit the fifth anniversary of \nPresident Obama signing this health care bill into law. If Monday's \nevent with Secretary Burwell was any indication, the White House is \ngoing to throw a celebration. Once again they will say they are pleased \nand they will say ObamaCare is working. The Obama administration should \nnot be pleased with its health care law. The Obama administration, and \nevery Democrat who voted for it, should be embarrassed by it.\n  It is not what Democrats promised, and it is not what people wanted. \nPeople wanted something very simple when it came to their health care \nand health care reform. People want the care they need, from a doctor \nthey choose, at a lower cost, and that is what Republicans in the \nSenate are planning to give them.\n  We can do it without a 2,000-page law, and we can do it without all \nof the negative side effects of ObamaCare. That will be health care \nreform worth celebrating.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Leahy, the \nranking member of the Committee on the Judiciary, in explaining an \namendment we have filed, amendment No. 290, to the Justice for Victims \nof Trafficking Act. I wish to take this opportunity to thank Senators \nAyotte, Murkowski, Heitkamp, and Baldwin for also cosponsoring our \namendment and for their strong support.\n  Our amendment would reauthorize the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act \nprograms which expired in 2013. These three programs--the Street \nOutreach Program, the Basic Center Program, and the Transitional Living \nProgram--have helped thousands of our homeless youth meet their \nimmediate needs and provide long-term residential services for those \nwho, sadly, cannot be safely reunited with their families.\n  The Street Outreach Program helps homeless and runaway youth find \nstable housing and connects them with the treatment, counseling, and \ncrisis prevention they need. A central goal of this program is to \nprevent sexual exploitation and abuse.\n  The Basic Center Program helps community-based providers meet the \nbasic needs of shelter, food, and clothing for homeless youth.\n  The Transitional Living Program supports long-term housing services \nthat help our homeless youth enter stable living environments and \ndevelop critical life skills.\n  The amendment Senator Leahy and I and our cosponsors are offering \ncomplements the underlying bill by addressing prevention, intervention, \nand recovery services for the victims of sex trafficking--particularly \namong one of the most vulnerable populations, and that is our homeless \nyouth. According to the Institute of Medicine and the National Resource \nCouncil, homelessness is one of the most common risk factors for sex \ntrafficking. Without access to food, shelter, and social supports, \nhomeless youth too often turn to what is termed survival sex--a way to \ntrade sex for a place to sleep and other basic necessities. Another \nrecent report found that one in four homeless youth are victims of sex \ntrafficking or engaged in survival sex. Approximately 48 percent of \nhomeless youth have done so because they did not have a safe place to \nstay. Our amendment strengthens the existing programs by ensuring that \nservice providers know how to identify trafficking victims and give \nthese youth the support they need.\n  In Maine, our homeless shelters are critical partners in the fight to \nend human trafficking. In Portland, the Preble Street Resource Center \nhas used Runaway and Homeless Youth Act resources to connect young \npeople who need food, safe shelter, health services, and educational \nsupport with those who can provide those services. The Preble Street \nAnti-Trafficking Coalition is currently helping approximately 50 \ntrafficking victims--whose ages range from 15 to 42--start new\n\n[[Page S1415]]\n\nlives. There are more than 1.6 million homeless teens in the United \nStates, an astonishing number. A growing number of homeless youth \nidentify as LGBT, and it is estimated that up to 40 percent of runaway \nand homeless youth are LGBT. Our amendment would also ensure that those \nseeking services through these Federal programs are not denied \nassistance based on their race, color, religion, national origin, sex, \nsexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. All homeless young \npeople need access to safe beds at night and services during the day so \nthey will never have to choose between selling their bodies and a safe \nplace to sleep.\n  The stand-alone bill on which our amendment is based was reported out \nof the Committee on the Judiciary during the last Congress with an \noverwhelmingly strong bipartisan vote of 15 to 3. It has the support of \nnearly 270 organizations, including service providers, anti-trafficking \nadvocates, and many faith-based organizations that serve homeless youth \neach and every day. Covenant House, the largest service provider for \nrunaway and homeless youth, strongly supports our reauthorization of \nthese programs.\n  Let me thank Senator Leahy for working so hard and for working to \nincorporate important feedback into our amendment, such as applying the \nnondiscrimination clause only to the runaway and homeless youth \nprograms and clarifying the continued ability to provide sex-specific \nshelters and programming, such as all-girls shelters or all-male \nshelters.\n  Let me take this opportunity to also commend Senator Cornyn and \nSenator Klobuchar for their work on the Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act, a bill I have proudly cosponsored. The policies and \ntools included in this bill are important pieces of the Federal \nresponse to the horrific crime of human trafficking. Congress must do \nmore to provide law enforcement with the tools it needs to pursue to \nend sex trafficking and to also support preventive programs such as the \nrunaway and homeless youth programs that help those who fall victim to \ntraffickers. In many ways our bill is the bookend for the bill that is \npending on the Senate floor because it focuses on the service end in \nhelping those who are most vulnerable, our young people.\n  By providing homeless young people with the support and services they \nneed, we can help prevent them from ever being trafficked in the first \nplace. The runaway and homeless youth programs have provided a lifeline \nand housing for America's homeless and for its human trafficked youth \nfor 40 years. They are a vital tool in addressing these serious \nproblems. I urge my colleagues to support our bipartisan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I want to thank the distinguished senior \nSenator from Maine, my New England neighbor, for her comments, speaking \non Leahy-Collins amendment No. 290. She and I and others have worked on \nthis for a very long time. In her comments, she talked about shelters \nfor homeless teens, and I think about how much better this whole \ncountry would be if this homeless teen could turn to a shelter and not \nto a trafficker.\n\n  As I said earlier on the floor, traffickers often find their victims \nsoon after they runaway or become homeless.\n  In a couple of States, such as mine and the Senator from Maine's, \nespecially at this time of year, people need shelter or they die. They \nliterally die in a relatively short period of time from the cold.\n  We see what happens. Listen to the stories of these trafficking \nsurvivors. Many of them began as a homeless or runaway teen. They are \nscared, desperate for affection, for food, for safety, and for a safe \nplace to sleep.\n  Our children and our grandchildren don't have to be scared. They have \na safe place to sleep. They have food. But for a lot of these runaways, \nthat is not the case.\n  That is a problem we can fix. We can reauthorize the Runaway and \nHomeless Youth Act. We can ensure that no child is turned away, \nregardless of their religion or their race or whom they love. A child \nis a child is a child. They all deserve our protection.\n  We don't say: OK, you four homeless children, we will take care of \nyou but not you because you are the wrong race or you are the wrong \nreligion or you love the wrong person. So you have to just stay out and \nbe prey to the traffickers.\n  We will recount some of the stories I told before, the traffickers I \nprosecuted years ago and the horrible stories. I know the distinguished \nSenator from Maine has heard these stories, and she has visited these \nshelters. She has seen and heard the stories. When you do, it tears \nyour heart. So I hope the amendment that she, Senator Murkowski, I, and \nothers have written will be in the final bill when it is passed. I \nthank my friend from Maine for her hard work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I am just going to say that I know the \ndistinguished Senators from Vermont and Maine have been on the floor \ntalking about an amendment they hope to offer to this anti-trafficking \nbill. But the sad fact is that no one is going to get to offer any \namendments to this bill unless the Democratic leader, Senator Reid, \ndecides that we are going to have an open amendment process because \nright now there are objections to anyone setting any of the amendments \nfor votes, much less asking to set aside the pending amendment and \nmaking your amendment the pending amendment so it could be considered \nand scheduled for a vote.\n  I wish to make sure our colleagues understand the rationale because I \nhave had conversations with a number of members of the Judiciary \nCommittee, which voted unanimously to support this bill. That doesn't \nhappen very often, that we have that kind of unanimous support. Ten of \nour Democratic colleagues are cosponsors on the original bill.\n  So it might sound strange that after 10 Democrats have cosponsored \nthe bill, after all of the Republicans and all of the Democrats on the \nJudiciary Committee have voted to support this bill--and the minority \nleader, Senator Reid, has agreed to dispense with the normal procedural \nprocess to get the bill on the floor--that we would now have this \nunusual situation where this bill is being hijacked and being used to \ndebate something that it really doesn't have very much to do about, and \nthat is the subject of abortion.\n  Some of our colleagues raised this issue yesterday for the first \ntime, and they said they were surprised to find some language in the \nbill that limited the use of the funds in this bill consistent with the \nHyde amendment. The Hyde amendment is a prohibition against using \ntaxpayer funds for abortion, and it has been the law of the land for 39 \nyears--39 years. All our bill does is preserve the status quo when it \ncomes to the Hyde amendment.\n  Then, all of a sudden, some of our colleagues woke up I guess \nyesterday morning and discovered this and said that they were outraged \nand that it was totally unacceptable. Well, when we offered them an \nopportunity to offer an amendment to change that, they said: No, we \ndon't want an amendment. We don't want to change it by a vote of the \nSenate. We just want to block the bill. We want to kill the bill.\n  Unless something changes between now and the time we vote on cloture \non the bill, that is what is going to happen because they don't want to \namend the bill; they don't want to allow others the opportunity--such \nas the Senator from Maine and the Senator from Vermont--to amend the \nbill; they just want to kill the bill.\n  It really is baffling to me, on a topic we all ought to agree is an \nimportant one, where some of the most vulnerable individuals in our \nsociety--children who have been sex-trafficked--would be the \nbeneficiaries of the bill, that we are for some reason debating a \nprovision in the bill that was in the bill when 10 Democrats agreed to \ncosponsor it, when all members of the Judiciary Committee, including \nthose same Democrats, agreed to vote for the bill, and when the \nDemocratic leader agreed\n\n[[Page S1416]]\n\nto bring it to the floor unanimously by a vote of the Senate. All of a \nsudden we want to try to revisit a provision that has been the law of \nthe land for 39 years.\n  I hope something happens between now and the end of the week that \ncauses some of our friends to reconsider this idea that they are going \nto filibuster this bill which many of them cosponsored and for which \nmany of them voted. It would be a real shame and a tragedy if something \nthat was designed to help these vulnerable kids was killed in the \nSenate because this became a political football. That would be a shame.\n  I know the distinguished Senator from Utah is on the floor and ready \nto speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I will speak for a few seconds on what \nthe distinguished Senator from Texas said.\n  It would be absolutely pathetic if this bill were stopped--a bill \nthis important that means so much to our families and to our children--\nbecause of the long-term language that has been, as I say, for 39 \nyears--I can't believe this Senate has become so political that we \nwould raise that issue at this time on this bill that almost everybody \nwith any brains at all would be for. I would be ashamed of myself. And \nthen not be willing to bring up an amendment if they don't like the \nlanguage, go through the regular order, and act like the Senate and act \nlike Senators--it is pathetic. What have we come to around here that we \nare so doggone partisan that we can't even pass a bill to protect \nchildren? I think it is pathetic, is all I can say.\n\n\n                                Ukraine\n\n  Madam President, in my nearly 40 years of public service, I have \nbecome very concerned with the state of our national security.\n  From the firestorm of terrorism that has swept Syria and Iraq, to the \nlooming specter of a nuclear Iran, our Nation faces yet another \npotential catastrophe in Ukraine, where Russian separatists and \nsoldiers continue their drive to consume as much of that nation as \nPresident Putin desires. It is particularly vexing that each of these \ncatastrophes could have been prevented or at least greatly mitigated \nhad the instigators of these events believed that the United States \nintended to use its national power to deter and, if necessary, repulse \nthose seeking to use aggression against our national interests.\n  As I mentioned before, Ukraine is the latest example. Almost 1 year \nago Russian forces seized and then annexed the Crimean peninsula. Ever \nsince then, Russian separatists and Russian forces have snapped up \nlarge parts of eastern Ukraine.\n  Until last year, the areas controlled by Russian separatists and \nRussian forces could be loosely grouped into two areas along the \nRussian border--specifically, a northern area around the city of \nLuhansk and a southern area around the city of Donetsk. In between \nthese two Russian-controlled areas lies the town called Debaltseve, \nwhich is a vital transportation hub. By seizing this strategic town, \nRussia can transport troops and supplies more easily between the \nRussian-controlled areas in the north and the South.\n  However, after weeks of fighting in and around Debaltseve, a \nceasefire called Minsk II was brokered. Unfortunately, as many realists \nwarned, Minsk II was not worth the paper it was written on. \nPredictably, 72 hours after the ceasefire was signed, Russian forces \nviolated the protocol and Ukrainian soldiers retreated from the town \nunder heavy fire.\n  Adding insult to injury, President Putin was quoted by the New York \nTimes, after the fall of Debaltseve, saying:\n\n       Life is life. It just goes on. No need to dwell on it.\n\n  What is the response of the United States to this aggression? Well, \nuntil today the only concrete action, as reported by ABC News, is that \nthe administration has decided to send fewer than 10 soldiers to \nwestern Ukraine to provide combat medical training to Ukrainian forces. \nThis would not be so laughable if I did not believe the Ukrainians will \nrequire far greater medical assistance if Russian aggression continues \nunabated. But now that Russian-backed forces have solidified their \ncontrol over whole swathes of eastern Ukraine, what comes next? Will \nMr. Putin be appeased and go home? I very much doubt it. Recent reports \nindicate that both sides have moved some heavy weapons away from the \nbattlefield; nevertheless, I believe this could just be a lull in the \nstorm.\n  As I mentioned earlier, Russian forces have annexed Crimea, which is \na peninsula between the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. To supply their \nforces in Crimea, Russians must fly over or cross a narrow strip of \nwater between the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov called the Kerch \nStrait. But if Russians controlled the land between Crimea and the \nRussian border, they could ship those supplies more efficiently and at \nlower cost. This stretch of land, of course, is Ukrainian sovereign \nterritory. Therefore, it is very possible that the Russians will move \nto conquer this region to establish a land corridor between Russia and \nCrimea.\n  Many military experts believe this is Russia's objective since \nRussian-backed separatists have intensified their military activities \naround the port city of Mariupol.\n  The New York Times reports that the city ``is a bustling port in a \nstrategic location on the Sea of Azov, near the Russian border.''\n  Mariupol is the only major obstacle to the Russians realizing a long-\nheld goal of opening a land route between Russia and Crimea and taking \ncomplete control of the Sea of Azov and its rich industrial \ninfrastructure.\n  In addition, the highly regarded Institute for the Study of War has \nnoted that a village approximately 8 miles from Mariupol has ``become \nthe most actively contested area'' in the region.\n  So what has been our response to this aggression? How is this \nadministration preserving what is arguably one of the greatest American \nnational security accomplishments in the past 100 years--ensuring a \nsafe, secure and democratic Europe? Well, to be honest, not much.\n  Before the events of the past 12 months, this administration's \nPollyanna policy toward Russia was defined by the so-called reset. It \nwas my impression this policy was designed to convince the Russians we \nwere not a threat and therefore we should work together for the common \ngood. Unfortunately, the Russians exploited the former and did not give \na darn about the latter.\n  Then, as the situation in Crimea and eastern Ukraine continued to \ngrow more dire, we instituted a series of economic sanctions--first \nagainst Russian officials, then later against banks and businesses \nassociated with Putin's cronies. These economic sanctions have grown \nagainst a number of key Russian energy, banking, and defense firms. To \nbe fair, today the administration announced a modest increase in the \nnumber of individuals to which economic sanctions will be directed \nagainst.\n  However, one would be hard-pressed to call these sanctions robust. \nIndividuals' assets were frozen and companies find it harder to raise \ncapital, but they are hardly enough to make Mr. Putin think twice \nbefore proceeding to use force against his next objective.\n  What about our diplomatic efforts? As the Congressional Research \nService has stated, ``The administration has appeared to leave the \nleading role in negotiating such a [peace] settlement [regarding \nUkraine] to France and Germany.''\n  What about U.S. military aid? According to the Congressional Research \nService, the United States has allocated $120 million in security \nassistance so far. Today our government announced a modest increase in \naid. Of the aid previously announced, funds were used for body armor, \nhelmets, vehicles, night and thermal vision devices, heavy engineering \nequipment, advanced radios, patrol boats, rations, tents, countermortar \nradars, uniforms, and first aid equipment and supplies. Glaringly \nabsent from this list are the pieces of equipment that could tilt the \nbalance of power and change Mr. Putin's calculations. Specifically, \nwhere are the intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, heavy weapons \nand logistics assets?\n  What is the administration's response? Just this week Brian McKeon, \nthe Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy stated--more \nthan 1 year after the Russian invasion of Crimea--that the Obama \nadministration is ``still working in the interagency group on reviewing \na number of\n\n[[Page S1417]]\n\noptions including lethal defensive weapons, but I can't give you a \ntimetable on when we might have a decision on additional assistance.''\n  That is pathetic. By any measure that is pathetic. I am flabbergasted \nnot only by Mr. McKeon's comment but the thought that the \nadministration believes anyone would see that as a legitimate answer.\n  In other areas, what about the deployment of more U.S. military units \nto Europe to reassure our allies? While the United States has deployed \nsome troops to the region, that is not enough to convince Moscow this \nadministration is determined to give a resolute response to further \nRussian aggression.\n  Specifically, the initial deployment of U.S. land forces were in \ncompany-size units. A company-size unit has less than 150 soldiers, an \ninsufficient force to amount to an effective deterrent. Then the \nadministration announced that a single armored brigade--which consists \nof less than 100 tanks--would be deployed on a rotational basis. Once \nagain, this is a relatively small force to deter what historically has \nbeen one of the great land armies.\n  Deterrence comes through strength. The world has changed since the \nfall of the Berlin Wall, but it appears this has been lost on President \nPutin. Indeed, it appears President Obama believes the world has \nchanged more than it has. Regardless, the United States must take more \nforceful and dynamic actions. Otherwise, our policy of appeasement \ncould result in more than just the loss of eastern Ukraine.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I thought I might take just a few \nminutes during this lull in our schedule. If other Senators come down \nto talk, I will yield to them, but I would like to talk a little about \nwhat is in this piece of legislation--the Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act. While I am on the Judiciary Committee and the Senator \nfrom Vermont is on the Judiciary Committee--he has worked together with \nme and others on this piece of legislation--I am aware of the fact \nthere are many Senators for whom this is a relatively new topic and who \nhave not been as immersed in it.\n  First, I would just say by way of major support that there are 200 \nvictims' rights groups and law enforcement organizations that have \nendorsed this legislation--200 of them. I am looking forward to having \na conference call with them this afternoon, where I can explain to them \nhow we are currently stuck and to solicit their help in getting us \nunstuck so we can hopefully move this legislation along, have an open \namendment process, and working with our colleagues in the House, send \nthis important piece of legislation to the President.\n  As I said, more than 200 victims' rights and law enforcement \norganizations have endorsed this legislation, including Shared Hope \nInternational, Rights4Girls, the Fraternal Order of Police, the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the National \nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People, the National \nChildren's Alliance, the National Criminal Justice Association, the End \nChild Prostitution and Trafficking organization, PROTECT, Alliance to \nEnd Slavery and Trafficking, the National Association of Police \nOrganizations, the National Conference of State Legislatures, and the \nNational District Attorneys Association.\n  I read that rather long list of supporting organizations to point out \nthere is nothing political about this particular bill. This is neither \na Republican bill nor a Democratic bill. This is, I think, in the best \ntraditions of the Senate, the Congress, when Members of Congress on \nboth sides of the aisle work together to come up with a policy solution \nthat makes sense and that will help.\n  One of the key features of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act \nis the creation of a special Crime Victims Compensation Fund. It is \ncalled the Domestic Trafficking Victims Fund.\n  When I had the honor of serving as attorney general of Texas, we had \na Crime Victims Compensation Fund--much like I suspect most States \nhave--where people who commit crimes and who pay fines and penalties \npay into that fund, and those moneys are then distributed on a grant \nbasis by the State to help organizations such as the Court Appointed \nSpecial Advocates Groups--CASA--which I worked closely with as attorney \ngeneral, and a number of crime victims' groups and other survivors of \ncrime.\n  What we do is use that same model here. We take the money that is \npaid by people convicted of human trafficking, sexual abuse, child \npornography, child sexual exploitation, interstate transportation for \nillegal sexual activity, commercial human smuggling, and we require a \nspecial additional assessment of $5,000 upon conviction for any one of \nthis class of crimes.\n  In other words, one of the things we are trying to do is move from \nthis model of just dealing with the supply side of a problem and deal \nwith the demand side. We are trying to focus on the people who purchase \nthese illicit services from trafficking victims and then use that fund \nto do some good, to provide grants to various faith-based \norganizations, nongovernmental organizations, and the like that help \ntreat the victims of child trafficking and hopefully help them begin to \nheal once they are rescued from their abusers and their assailants.\n  The other thing we do, sort of from a structural point of view, is we \ndon't treat a young girl who has been trafficked as the criminal. In \nother words, in the past there has been a tendency to say we are going \nto arrest the 15-year-old girl and charge her for being a prostitute, \nwhen in fact she has no choice in the matter. She is being compelled by \neither violence or some other coercive means to do what she is doing. \nSo it is not a voluntary act on her part.\n  So what we do is we don't treat them as a criminal. We treat the \npurchaser of these services as the criminal. We fine them. We use that \nmoney then to supply services to help that victim get rescued and get \nbetter, to heal, and to get on with their lives.\n  That is what is a little different here because we are not actually \nusing tax dollars. We are using the fines and the penalties assessed \nagainst these perpetrators to help these victims heal once they are \nrescued. That is one of the most important parts of this bill.\n  We expect there would be roughly $30 million a year available for \nthat out of this bill alone. That would be in addition to other things \nwe are doing and other things that are being done at the local and \nState level.\n  We also make sure that we clarify the benefits and protections \noffered to victims of domestic human trafficking. Under current law, \nU.S. citizens are sometimes placed at a disadvantage when seeking \nservices to restore them to their well-being and to offer them \nprotection. But now we would make sure that those services are \navailable without regard to citizenship and would make sure that people \nwho would otherwise not get benefits will get benefits. This disparity \nin certification has led to some confusion, as we might imagine.\n  For example, under current law, a young person who has been \ntrafficked from Central America through Mexico and into the United \nStates would be eligible for a temporary visa while they cooperate with \nlaw enforcement because that testimony would be essential to convict \nthe person who trafficked them. This clarifies that U.S. citizens and \nlawful permanent residents should never be denied services due to the \nfact that they have not received that kind of special certification. It \nis a little technical, but it is an important area.\n  We also provide child human trafficking deterrence block grants paid \nentirely through the Crime Victims Compensation Fund I mentioned a \nmoment ago. These funds would be granted to qualifying organizations \nbased on their focus on victim rescue and restoration.\n  Collaboration among law enforcement, social services, emergency \nresponders, children's advocacy centers, victims service providers, and \nnonprofits would be encouraged to help communities and government work \ntogether to develop a holistic approach to figure out what works best \nto protect these victims of trafficking and to serve victims.\n\n[[Page S1418]]\n\n  It also would create a new purpose area under the Victims of Child \nAbuse Act for the 900 children's advocacy centers across the country \nthat provide restorative services for victims of child pornography, and \nit requires that not less than $2 million a year be dedicated to this \npurpose.\n  In my experience, in Texas, the children's advocacy centers are some \nof the most outstanding organizations that exist for the treatment of \nvictims of abuse and trafficking. One of the key features in the \nchildren's advocacy centers that I have visited is--imagine that a \nchild who has been assaulted or a victim of human trafficking is not \nonly going to be terrified by the experience, but they are also \nterrified by the law enforcement authorities who try to question them \nand to get evidence so they can make a case and conviction against the \nperson who did harm to the child. The children's advocacy centers do an \namazing job of creating a more relaxed atmosphere, where law \nenforcement and social service providers can work together in an \nenvironment where a child does not feel threatened and where the child \ncan actually not only begin to get better but also cooperate with law \nenforcement authorities and provide more reliable testimony and \nevidence that can be used to convict the perpetrators.\n  Also in the bill, we would amend the human trafficking asset \nforfeiture statute to track the asset forfeiture statute for money \nlaundering and eliminate the need for prosecutors to show direct \ntraceability to the underlying crime and the targeted proceeds when \nthey can show that the assets involved in the crime are used to conceal \nthe source of criminal assets. This is basically taking another \nprovision of current law. I realize that the whole issue of asset \nforfeiture, when taken to the extreme--I know Chairman Grassley is \ninterested in holding hearings on the subject. But I think the part of \nthis which is not controversial is taking the assets used in the \ncommission of a crime and forfeiting that by the perpetrator, again, \nusing those funds in part to help their victims get better.\n  We also have a provision in the bill that would allow for the \nstreamlining of criminal investigations of human trafficking.\n  Under current law, State and local law enforcement may obtain a \nwiretap warrant in State court upon showing that the investigation may \nprovide evidence of murder, kidnapping, gambling, robbery, bribery, \nextortion or dealing with narcotic drugs, including marijuana or other \ndangerous drugs, or other crimes dangerous to life, limb or property \nand punishable by imprisonment for more than 1 year.\n  What we would do here is provide additional tools for law enforcement \nto conduct lawful wiretaps in order to get evidence important to \nconvicting the perpetrators of these terrible crimes.\n  We also would require better reporting of this terrible crime of \nhuman trafficking. I remember a few years ago, when the Super Bowl was \nin Dallas, actually working with local law enforcement there where I \nlearned for the first time that, unfortunately, at the same time that \nthe Super Bowl is held in different cities around the country, there is \na spike in the amount of trafficking that occurs in conjunction with \nthese huge public events. That was quite an eye-opening experience for \nme.\n  Part of what we need to do is to get the facts, and to make sure that \nhuman trafficking is treated as the serious crime that it is for \npurposes of the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program. This legislation \nwould encourage law enforcement to investigate and report human \ntrafficking activity by classifying this as a part I violent crime and \nrequiring it to be included in the calculation of index crime rates--\nagain, making sure we understand what the facts are, because I think \nthe fact is that so much of this crime and this sort of activity is \nhidden from public view. So most Americans probably don't know that \nthis sort of activity goes on in their cities, in their States, and \nacross the country. This would help us deal with that.\n  Under another provision of the bill, we would also make sure we use \nexisting task forces to target offenders who exploit children, and we \nwould, in particular, target child predators.\n  One of the things we learn, as we get deeper into this topic, is the \nsad fact that somebody who sexually abuses a child is likely to do it \nmore than once. In other words, these twisted individuals unfortunately \nare going to commit crime after crime after crime until they are caught \nand taken out of commission.\n  This is one reason why I feel so strongly that we had to eliminate \nthe rape kit backlogs around the country, and we worked closely with a \ncourageous woman named Debbie Smith to reauthorize the Debbie Smith Act \nto make sure the money that Congress appropriated for the rape kit \nbacklog was adequately funded. Due to the power of DNA testing, we can \nidentify people who commit these serial offenses, and law enforcement \ncan connect the dots better and at the same time exonerate people who \nhave perhaps been falsely accused because they are excluded through a \nDNA test through this rape kit backlog elimination effort.\n  So trying to make sure we take these serial offenders off the streets \nis a priority under our bill.\n  As I said, we worked very closely with a number of colleagues, \nincluding the Senator from Vermont, the Senator Feinstein of \nCalifornia, Senator Coons, Senator Wyden, and Senator Klobuchar on the \nother side. On our side, we have had a lot of great effort by Senator \nPortman and Senator Kirk, among others. Senator Collins has certainly \nmade important contributions. But I wish to particularly recognize the \ncontributions by the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein.\n  We added a second title, title II in the legislation, entitled \n``Combating Human Trafficking.'' Senator Feinstein was the person who \nmade that major contribution to this effort.\n  My point is that this has really been a bipartisan collaborative \neffort--something we don't see enough of here in Washington, DC--\nuntainted by politics and ideology, where we are actually trying to do \nsome good for people who need our help the most.\n  Senator Feinstein contributed much of the meat of title II, including \namendments to the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, response to victims \nof child trafficking provision, creating an interagency task force \nreport on child trafficking primary prevention and also requiring a \nGeneral Accountability Office report to Congress that includes \ninformation on Federal and State law enforcement agencies to combat \ntrafficking in the United States and requiring that it include \ninformation on each available grant program intended to combat human \ntrafficking or assist victims of trafficking.\n  On our side of the aisle, I mentioned that one of the people who has \nbeen a relentless warrior on this has been our friend the junior \nSenator from Illinois, Mr. Kirk, who contributed the HERO Act to this \nlegislation. That is title III under the HERO Act.\n  Under that important part of the legislation that makes up this \noverall bill, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, the HERO Act \nwould provide express statutory authorization for the existing ICE \nCyber Crimes Center--Immigration and Customs Enforcement--recognizing \nthat so much of what happens in terms of the marketing and the \nsolicitation for people to engage in these crimes occurs now on the \nInternet.\n  I had the privilege of being here with the Senator from Illinois on \nthe floor yesterday afternoon, and he talked about this one particular \nsite that has been responsible for the trafficking of so much human \nflesh, mainly in the form of minor children, and his efforts to combat \nthat. But part of what the HERO Act would do is to make sure that we \nhave this powerful tool in the fight against sexual exploitation of \nchildren and the production, advertisement, and distribution of child \npornography and child sex tourism--if you can imagine such a thing.\n  The HERO Act would also authorize the Cyber Crimes Center to \ncollaborate with the Department of Defense and the National Association \nto Protect Children for the purpose of recruiting, training, and hiring \nwounded and transitioning military veterans to serve as law enforcement \nofficials in the investigation and prosecution of these crimes. This \nchild exploitation section uses sophisticated investigative tools to \ntarget violators who operate on the Internet, which has been one of the \nprimary focuses of the Senator from Illinois in his efforts, targeting \nthe use of Web sites, email chat rooms, and file-sharing applications.\n\n[[Page S1419]]\n\n  Major initiatives, including Operation Predator, an Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement office within the Department of Homeland Security's \nflagship investigative initiative for targeting sexual predators, child \npornographers, and child sex.\n  It includes the National Child Victim Identification System, which \nwas developed to assist law enforcement agencies in identifying victims \nof child sexual exploitation, and the virtual global task force and \ninternational alliance of law enforcement agencies working together to \nfight online child exploitation and abuse.\n  I realize this has been rather lengthy, but I thought it was worth \nmaking sure that all of our colleagues and anybody within the sound of \nmy voice who cared to listen understood what was in this important \npiece of legislation, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act.\n  To summarize, 200 organizations across the country who are focused \nlike a laser on the bane and evil that child sex trafficking is have \nendorsed this legislation. The original piece of legislation had 10 \nDemocratic cosponsors, about an equal number--perhaps; I can't remember \nthe exact number--of Republican cosponsors, and it passed by unanimous \nvote of the Senate Judiciary Committee in February.\n  Coming to the floor, we had something that hadn't happened often \nenough, in my view, which was that Democrats and Republicans together \nagreed to bypass the usual cumbersome procedure to get a bill to the \nfloor, known as cloture, and we all agreed we should take up this bill \ntogether. That is when things went off the rails, sadly. But I am an \noptimistic person and I am hopeful cooler heads will prevail.\n  I have had some private conversations with a number of Senators who \nare really very disturbed by the possibility that legislation as \nimportant as this is to the victims of human trafficking might be \nkicked to the curb because of some phony diversion and argument about \nrestrictions on funding.\n  Again, the provisions of this bill that limit the use of the funds \nunder the Hyde amendment has been the law of the land for 39 years. It \nwas originally started in 1976. Basically, the Hyde amendment says that \nno taxpayer funds may be used for abortion services. This has been one \nof the rare areas in an area of great controversy--the subject of \nabortion--where Congress has come together on a bipartisan basis to say \nwe are going to draw a bright line there to say no matter what your \nviews are on abortion, we are not going to allow taxpayer funds to be \nused for abortion. Again, that started in 1976 and it has been the law \nof the land since that time.\n  Every appropriations bill that has passed, including the CRomnibus, \nthe continuing resolution omnibus bill that was passed last fall in the \nlameduck session of Congress, included a restriction known as the Hyde \namendment restriction in it. As a matter of fact, we specifically \nreferenced that provision in the Justice for Victims of Trafficking \nAct.\n  So you could imagine my surprise when I think it was yesterday that I \ngot calls, letters, and heard speeches that people were surprised--\nshocked--that this provision was in the legislation when it was filed \nin January--I think January 13--and made public to the world. If \nanybody thought it was hidden, it was hidden in plain sight to anybody \nwho cared to read it. And to me, what was so surprising about some of \nthe reaction is that this maintains the status quo. This doesn't change \nanything, and has been the law of the land for 39 years since the \noriginal Hyde amendment was adopted.\n  So my hope is we can break out of this terrible cycle of dysfunction \nwhich I think, frankly, reflects Congress in a very negative light. I \ncertainly hear it back home in Texas. People say: Well, can't you all \nget along? Can't you do anything? They don't want us to compromise our \nprinciples, and we won't. I don't think we should. But there are so \nmany areas like this where we are united together in trying to do \neverything we can to help law enforcement investigate and prosecute \nhuman trafficking and to help the victims of human trafficking to heal \nafter they are rescued--to heal, get better, and to get on with their \nlives. That is all this legislation does.\n  I say that is all. That is a pretty big deal. It provides $30 million \na year--not tax dollars. These are fines and penalties paid by the \npeople who commit these terrible crimes. It provides $30 million a year \nas funds that can go toward grants to faith-based organizations, child \nadvocacy centers--you name it--organizations that will spend their \nlives trying to help these children try to get better and get on with \ntheir lives. That money is available to them.\n  But if we don't pass this bill this week, that is not going to \nhappen. How tragic it would be if somehow we let the politics of the \nday and this feigned outrage over a provision that has been a law of \nthe land for 39 years derail us from doing our job.\n  I have every confidence that the heart of every Member of this body \nis in the right place when it comes to trying to help these victims of \nhuman trafficking. I just ask us to get our heads screwed on right. I \nknow our hearts are in the right place, but frankly I am a little \nworried about people's heads not being screwed on right when it comes \nto focusing on a solution that is within our reach and one that has I \nthink enjoyed so much support all across the country--as I mentioned, \nmore than 200 victims rights and law enforcement organizations across \nthe country. I am looking forward in probably the next 10 minutes or so \njoining a conference call with various members of these organizations, \nwhere I can update them on where they are and basically ask them for \ntheir help.\n  Call your Senator. Call your Congressman. Tell them we need to get \nthis done, because in all likelihood tomorrow we are going to have a \nvery important vote in the Senate.\n  I said I wasn't going to get mired down in procedure, but we do have \nan important vote tomorrow which is called a cloture vote. In other \nwords, in order to get to a final passage of this bill, we need to have \nat least 60 Senators out of 100 vote for ending debate on the bill. \nThat is called a cloture vote. But if we don't have 60 Senators vote to \nend debate on this bill, then basically we are dead in the water.\n  We have 54 Senators on our side of the aisle. There are 46 on the \nother side of the aisle. You would think on a bill that does as much as \nthis bill does for the victims of human trafficking and that is so \ndevoid of politics that we could get 60 votes or more. I wish we could \nget 100 votes to close off debate and finally pass this bill. If we did \nthat in short order, I know we could work with our colleagues in the \nHouse of Representatives, who have already passed a similar although a \nlittle bit different bill, to try to reconcile those two pieces of \nlegislation and get them to President Obama's desk for his signature. \nThe sooner we do that, the sooner these victims of human trafficking \nwill get the help they need that this bill would provide.\n  So I hope that Senators will think long and hard about their vote on \nclosing off debate tomorrow and getting us to the finish line on this \nlegislation. Again, we don't need everybody. We don't need 100 Senators \nto vote to close off debate tomorrow, but we do need 60. If we don't \nget 60, this bill is going to be dead in the water.\n  I would ask all of our colleagues to examine their conscience and to \nthink about what we are doing here and how much good we could do if we \ncome together. I know from talking to some of our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle, they have had some sleepless nights. Several \nof our colleagues have said they basically have had a hard time \nsleeping thinking about the human tragedy reflected in human \ntrafficking, and they worried whether we will actually be able to get \nthis bill over the finish line. I hope and pray we will. We will find \nout tomorrow.\n  This is something that is in our hands. We can't control a lot of \nthings in the world, but we can control whether we produce 60 votes \nhere in the Senate tomorrow to close off debate, to get to final \npassage by a majority vote in the Senate. And if we can, then we are \ngoing to be able to expedite the help these victims of human \ntrafficking need. We are going to be able to make sure the predators \nwho prey on innocent children and other victims of human trafficking \npay the price, but that out of that bad comes some good when children \nare rescued and these victims begin the process of healing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1420]]\n\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I was stunned a few minutes ago to hear \nthe assistant Republican leader on the floor speaking about trafficking \nlegislation that is now before the Senate. I am glad he is speaking \nabout the legislation. He has done that quite a bit. But as he spoke \nabout the bill, it is very stunning what he said.\n  He said:\n\n       This bill is being hijacked and being used to debate \n     something that it really doesn't have very much to do about, \n     and that is the subject of abortion.\n\n  I totally agree with my friend from Texas. This bill has been \nhijacked by an issue completely unrelated to human trafficking.\n  I suggest that the majority take it out. We can debate on how it is \nin the bill. Some said that it was by sleight of hand, and some said \nthat the Democratic staff should have seen that it was in there. It is \nin there, and it has to come out.\n  Unless that language is taken out of the bill, there will be no bill. \nWe cannot have this legislation hijacked by an abortion issue.\n  My friend the President pro tempore of the Senate and the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee said:\n\n       I can't believe that this Senate has become so political \n     that we would raise that issue at this time on this bill.\n\n  ``Raise the issue''--he took the words right out of my mouth. I can't \nbelieve it either.\n  I say to my friends the majority, take the abortion language out of \nthe bill. It has nothing to do with abortion.\n  I hope my Republican friends will choose to do the right thing and \neliminate this unrelated issue on an otherwise good piece of \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I wish to talk about a couple of \namendments on the legislation that we are considering this week, which \nis the human trafficking legislation.\n  Up to this point, this has been a bipartisan exercise. In fact, \nSenator Blumenthal, the Senator from Connecticut, and I started a \ncaucus here in the Senate on human trafficking about 3\\1/2\\ years ago, \nunderstanding that there was an increasing concern and awareness about \nthis issue around the country, and we wanted to bring colleagues \ntogether to talk about the issue. We now have many other Members of the \nSenate who are a part of that.\n  We had monthly meetings--holding up people who were doing great \nthings around the country--describing the problem so that all of us, \nMembers of the Senate and their staff, understand the seriousness of \nthis issue and why we need to address it. That has always been \nnonpartisan--not just bipartisan but nonpartisan.\n  I think it is time for us to move forward with this debate and to \nhave these amendments offered and to actually vote on this legislation \nthat would help to deal with this problem all around the country, and \nunfortunately it is everywhere.\n  Often people think that this is an international issue, that the only \nhuman trafficking concern we should have would be in Africa or Asia or \nother countries. But it actually happens right here, and it happens in \nmy home State of Ohio.\n  I first became involved in this issue when a school outside the city \nof Toledo came to me and told me their concern about it and how these \nyoung people were getting involved and engaged in it. The more we \nlearned, the more I looked into it, and the more I realized this is \nsomething which is very real in the communities I represent in Ohio, \nand unfortunately I believe the same is true in every State represented \nin this Chamber.\n  We have had an interesting debate so far. Sometimes we have gotten a \nlittle sidetracked, such as the issue we saw a moment ago, but for the \nmost part I have been pleased that over the last few days we have \ntalked about the scope of the problem, talked about some of the \nsolutions to it, and we talked about some of the good legislation that \nis in the underlying bill.\n  There are two pieces of legislation that I offered that are part of \nthe underlying bill, and I am happy about that. They are both \nbipartisan amendments. There are also a couple of amendments that I \nthink would be helpful for us to include in the legislation. I offered \nthose amendments earlier this week with the hopes that they would have \nalready been considered. They have not been considered yet, but I hope \nto move forward with this legislation. The longer we wait, the more \ndifficult it becomes for us to move forward. I hope we can resolve \nwhatever differences there are and go ahead and start voting on \namendments and moving this legislation forward so we can actually help \nthose victims of trafficking who are looking for our support. Again, if \nwe are not going to act here in the Senate and are not going to move \nthis forward in the House and get it to the President for signature--\nevery day more and more people are in danger, particularly children, of \nfalling into the hands of human traffickers.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 270\n\n  I have a couple of amendments I wish to talk about briefly today. The \nfirst amendment is called Ensuring a Better Response for Victims of Sex \nTrafficking. This amendment contains a piece of the legislation I \nactually offered a couple of years ago with Senator Wyden of Oregon. \nSenator Wyden's legislation and my legislation called the Child Sex \nTrafficking Data and Response Act was partly enacted into law last \nyear, and that was the data part of the bill--in other words, the part \nof the bill that relates to how we needed to improve the information we \nare getting on sex trafficking so we can better address the problem. \nLaw enforcement officials have been looking for better information \naround the country. They want to know what the best practices are and \nhow to deal with it. It is important to understand the problem in order \nto come up with solutions.\n  Now we need to get to the second part of the legislation that was not \nenacted last year, and that is on the response portion. The amendment \ndoes just that. The response portion of the bill changes the way we \ntreat victims of sex trafficking. Right now many of these victims are \nfalling between the cracks. Currently children are only eligible for \nhelp through the child welfare system if they are abused by their \nparents. Currently, because children are only allowed to be eligible \nfor help in that category, some kids just cannot get the help they \nneed. This legislation ensures that all children who are trafficked are \nconsidered victims of sexual abuse and can be eligible for services as \nthey go through what is sometimes a long and arduous process of \nrecovery.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 271\n\n  The second amendment I wish to include gets at some of the underlying \nproblems that make it more likely that a child will be trafficked. We \nheard a lot about this on the floor the last couple of days. I have \ntalked about it in terms of our missing children. One of the elements \nof the underlying bill is a bill we put forward in the last couple of \nyears on how to identify missing children. Why? Because those children \nwho are runaways or go missing tend to be some of the most vulnerable \nto sex traffickers. So the idea is to get the best information we can \non those kids as soon as possible so we can find them.\n  As an example, there have been about 67 kids who have gone missing in \nOhio in the last month and a half. Yet we only have records for, I \nbelieve, 26 kids in terms of photographs. This legislation would \nrequire photographs for all of these kids so that the kids who are not \ncurrently able to be found because we can't find a photograph of them \ncan be more easily found--not just by law enforcement but by citizens \nwho are being vigilant and diligent.\n  There is another issue, too, and it is something that is addressed in \nthis amendment, which is cosponsored by Senator Feinstein. The first \none is one from a Wyden-Portman amendment, and this is from a \nFeinstein-Portman amendment. These are bipartisan bills.\n  It currently is true that there is an over-narrow definition of \n``homelessness'' by the Department of Housing and Urban Development \nthat does not enable homeless kids to get the help they need. That is \ncurrent law. We are trying to change that to ensure that we can expand \nthat definition to include the kinds of children who unfortunately many \ntimes are vulnerable to trafficking.\n\n[[Page S1421]]\n\n  I will give an example of the scope of this problem. During this last \nschool year--2 years ago, 2012 to 2013--there were 24,236 kids in Ohio \nwho were homeless at one point during the school year; however, the \nFederal Department responsible for preventing child homelessness \ncounted only 4,700 cases. So we have over 24,000 kids who are homeless; \nyet this Department says only 4,700. In other words, the very program \nmeant to help these kids undercounted by a factor of five. So the \namendment simply updates the definition of ``homelessness'' to ensure \nthat these kids are not forgotten and do not fall between the cracks.\n  We know this action alone will not end child homelessness, but it \nwill help deal with this problem and will help to put a roof over their \nheads, for thousands of these kids and their families, and prevent some \nof the long-term emotional, developmental effects that are caused by \nhomelessness, as well as keep these kids off the streets and hopefully \naway from these traffickers so they are not vulnerable, as I said, to \nbeing sex-trafficked.\n  We hope for a day when every single child in America is protected, \nwhen every child is able to follow their dreams and can live in a home \nwith a family who is protecting and watching over them. We know that if \nwe are going to see that hope realized, we have to fight for it. In the \nmeantime, we have important work to do here on the floor of the Senate \nto ensure that we are doing everything we possibly can to protect these \nkids.\n  These two amendments will help make this underlying legislation even \nstronger. I hope my colleagues will support both of them. Again, I hope \nwe can now get over whatever is holding up movement on these \namendments, get the amendments enacted into law, and get the bill over \nto the House of Representatives. And I believe they will pass it and \nget it to the President for his signature so we can indeed begin to \naddress this horrific practice of human trafficking.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Cornyn for his important \nleadership on this issue. I thank Senator Klobuchar, whom I have \nenjoyed working with on a related bill, the Stop Exploitation Through \nTrafficking Act, which I hope will also be considered during the course \nof this debate.\n  We must commit to eliminating all forms of modern-day slavery and \nhuman trafficking. These are horrendous crimes that undermine the most \nbasic human right of freedom and sadly target the most vulnerable and \nat-risk individuals in our society.\n  For too long we in the United States have assumed this is a problem \nfor others but not for ourselves. We heard heartbreaking stories of the \nunderground trafficking of humans but believed this was a tragedy \nunique to places in the world where a poor economy and weak rule of law \nallow vulnerable women and children to fall into these unspeakable \ncircumstances. This is no longer the case. Reports and research have \nbrought this crime out of the dark here at home, revealing that \ntrafficking in humans is a reality in our own States and communities. \nIgnorance and denial are no longer options.\n  I am proud to support the legislation we are considering today which \nwould improve services and restitution available to victims of human \ntrafficking. It would make changes to our criminal law to allow law \nenforcement to hold accountable those offenders who perpetrate these \nheinous crimes and also better protect those at risk of becoming \nvictims.\n  I am proud to say that my home State of Arizona has been a leader on \nthis issue. In April 2013 then-Governor Jan Brewer launched a task \nforce on human trafficking which brought together local policymakers, \nlaw enforcement, nonprofits, think tanks, and universities in Arizona \nto examine the issue and explore ways to reduce trafficking and protect \nvictims. The work of this task force led to these results: In 2014 the \nArizona Human Trafficking Council was established to build on the \nefforts of the task force in the longer term by improving the State's \nawareness of human trafficking, promoting cooperation among law \nenforcement, State agencies, and the community, and improving victims' \nservices.\n  The task force yielded legislative accomplishments. Based on \nrecommendations of the task force, Arizona passed a law in April 2014 \nthat increased penalties for traffickers, makes it easier for \nprosecutors to hold accountable those engaged in prostitution with a \nminor, and protects victims' identities in criminal proceedings.\n  In an effort to equip those who are in a position to intervene, the \nmembers of the task force have worked to improve training for social \nworkers, health care providers, and probation officers, among others. \nThese efforts provide them with the knowledge and tools needed to stop \nthis exploitation and connect victims with resources to help.\n  I would be remiss if I failed to mention the hard work of my wife \nCindy to bring attention to the suffering of those who are victims of \nhuman trafficking. She has dedicated herself to their cause, and \nthrough her service on both the Arizona Human Trafficking Task Force \nand Council as well as international efforts to combat trafficking, she \nhas become a well-respected and persuasive voice on this vital issue, \ndriving change both in Arizona and abroad.\n  America's leadership furthering human rights around the world means \nthat we must hold ourselves to the highest standards when basic human \nrights are being undermined right here. I am grateful for the Senate's \naction. We must commit to continued efforts to restoring the freedom of \nthose caught in the horrors of modern slavery and eliminating this \ncrime wherever it occurs.\n  Finally, here in the Senate we have gridlock on numerous issues. \nThere are differences of opinion and philosophies. How in the world \nhave we got differences on an issue such as this? Is the issue of right \nto life or abortion such an overwhelming issue that we can't address an \nissue which is the most egregious crime against innocent women and \nchildren?\n  This is really not an honorable time or a laudable time for the U.S. \nSenate. We should be taking up amendments and passing this legislation \ntoday. We are letting partisanship over an issue that has been \ndiscussed and debated--and will be many times in the future--prevent us \nfrom moving forward with this legislation. It is not honorable. It is \nnot honorable for us to hold up this legislation because we have a \ndifference on the issue of abortion.\n\n  I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, let's not let \nthis issue prevent us from doing the right thing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, I wish to take a few minutes to discuss the budget \nsituation.\n  My understanding is that Senator Enzi, the chairman of the committee, \nintends to have a Budget Committee markup on Wednesday, March 18, and \nThursday, March 19. My understanding is the resolution will come to the \nfloor the following week of March 23. Unless I am mistaken, we will \nengage in what is called within the Beltway a vote-arama, where there \nwill be a very significant number of amendments that will be allowed to \nbe offered.\n  Before we discuss a budget, whether it is at the Federal level, the \nState level, or one's family, I think it is imperative to understand \nthe conditions that exist as one prepares a budget. A budget reflects \nwhat our country is about. It reflects our national priorities. It \nreflects how we attempt to address the problems we face. It attempts to \naddress how we go forward as a people into the future.\n  So the first issue at hand when we discuss a budget is to, in fact, \ndetermine what is going on in America today. What are our problems? \nWhat should we be doing and what should we not be doing?\n  I start off with the premise that I think is shared by the vast \nmajority of the American people, which is that the middle class of this \ncountry over the last 40 years has been disappearing; that people \ntoday, by the millions, in Vermont and throughout this Nation, are \nworking longer hours for low wages, despite a huge increase in \nproductivity. That is the reality that faces most people in this \ncountry. But there is another reality, and that is that the people on \ntop and the largest corporations are doing phenomenally well.\n\n[[Page S1422]]\n\n  Today, real median family income is almost $5,000 less than it was in \n1999 in inflation accounted-for dollars. Why is that? How does that \nhappen? The typical male worker--that man right in the middle of the \nAmerican economy--made $783 less last year than he did 42 years ago, \nafter adjusting for inflation. How does that happen? We have an \nexplosion of technology, a huge increase in productivity; we have the \nso-called great global economy, $3 trillion all over the world; and the \ntypical male worker--the guy in the middle of the economy--makes $783 \nless last year than he did 42 years ago.\n  The typical female worker is making $1,337 less than she did in 2007. \nToday, despite the modest gains of the Affordable Care Act--legislation \nI supported--40 million Americans continue to have no health insurance \nand we remain the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee \nhealth care to all people as a right.\n  Then we have today, because many people were driven from the middle \nclass into poverty, more people today living in poverty than almost any \ntime in the modern history of America. How does that happen?\n  Despite a very significant improvement in the economy since President \nBush left office, real unemployment is not 5.5 percent, it is 11 \npercent. Youth unemployment, which we never talk about, is 17 percent, \nand African-American youth unemployment is much higher than that.\n  Throughout this country, a significant number of young people have \ngiven up on the dream of college. Here we are in a competitive global \neconomy and we have bright young people from working-class families and \nthey are looking at the cost of college and they are saying, Sorry, \nain't for me. I am not going to come out of school $50,000, $60,000 in \ndebt. What sense does that make when we are engaged in enormous \neconomic competition with countries all over the world?\n  Then we have another group of young people graduating college or \ngraduate school in debt to the tune of $50,000, $100,000. I talked to a \nyoung doctor in Burlington, VT, some months ago. She graduated medical \nschool $300,000 in debt for the crime of wanting to be a primary care \nphysician. Does that make any sense?\n  While the middle class continues to disappear, the people on top and \nthe largest corporations have never had it so good. That is the other \nreality of America today. The middle class shrinks--a whole lot of \npeople living in poverty, people have no health insurance, kids can't \nafford to go to college--but people on top are doing phenomenally well.\n  Today, the top 1 percent earns more income than the bottom 50 \npercent. And since the Wall Street crash of 2008, over 99 percent of \nall new income goes to the top 1 percent. Over 99 percent of all new \nincome goes to the top 1 percent.\n  Corporate profits are soaring. The stock market is up. CEOs now earn \n270 times what their average employee makes. Today, the top one-tenth \nof 1 percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. The \ntop one-tenth of 1 percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 \npercent. And the wealthiest family in this country alone--one family--\nowns more wealth than the bottom 42 percent of the American family. \nDoes that sound like the America we want to see, that we believe in, \nwhere so few have so much and so many have so little?\n  It is an extraordinary fact that between 1985 and 2013, the bottom 90 \npercent of our people lost $10.7 trillion in wealth that it otherwise \nwould have had if the distribution of wealth had remained at the same \nlevel as it was in 1985. If we had the same distribution of wealth, the \nbottom 90 percent would have had close to $11 trillion more wealth. \nMeanwhile, the top one-tenth of 1 percent experienced an $8 trillion \nincrease in wealth as the distribution of wealth became increasingly \nunequal.\n  What a phenomenon, this huge transfer of wealth from working people \nto the millionaires and billionaires.\n  Now let me get to the budget, because when we deal with a budget, we \ncan't ignore that reality. If the rich get much richer and the middle \nclass declines, it makes no sense at all to say we are going to give \nmore tax breaks to the rich and we are going to cut programs for the \nmiddle class and working families. This is the Robin Hood principle in \nreverse. It is taking from the middle class and working families and \ngiving to the very rich.\n  I worry very much that this is exactly what will be in the Republican \nbudget that we debate next week in committee. I expect--and I may be \nmistaken and I hope I am but I don't think I am--I expect the \nRepublican budget in the Senate this year will be very close to what \nthe so-called Ryan budget did last year which was passed by the \nRepublican House. There may be nuances of differences, I don't know, \nbut I think it will be very close.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what the Republican budget will be about. \nThe Republican budget will oppose ending tax loopholes for the wealthy \nand large corporations--loopholes that allow billionaire hedge fund \nmanagers to pay a lower tax rate than electricians and schoolteachers. \nI expect that the Republican budget will continue to allow major \nprofitable corporations such as General Electric, Verizon, and many \nothers to go through a given year paying absolutely nothing in Federal \nincome tax. I expect that the Republican budget will attempt to \nvoucherize Medicare--end it as we know it to be--and I expect there \nwill be massive cuts in Medicaid, education, nutrition programs, Pell \ngrants, and the kinds of programs that working families absolutely \ndepend upon.\n  We need a very different budget than what I believe the Republicans \nare going to propose. We need a budget that stands for the working \nfamilies of this country and not just the millionaires and \nbillionaires.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what that budget should include, although I \ndon't think the Republican budget will include these ideas. When real \nunemployment is 11 percent, we need a budget that creates millions of \ndecent-paying jobs. In my view, and in the view of many economists, the \nfastest way to create those jobs and address a real national crisis is \nto rebuild our crumbling infrastructure--our roads, our bridges, water \nsystems, wastewater plants, airports, dams, levees, and expand \nbroadband to rural America. According to the American Society of Civil \nEngineers, we need to invest over $3 trillion to rebuild our \ninfrastructure. We are not going to do that, but we need to make a \nmajor investment. When we do that, we make America more productive and \nsafer, and we also create millions of jobs.\n  A serious budget needs to make our Tax Code fairer and to bring \nsubstantial new revenue into Federal coffers. We need a budget that \nends unfair tax loopholes and asks the wealthiest people and largest \ncorporations to pay their fair share of taxes.\n  Today at the hearing we had in the Committee on the Budget, a \nRepublican witness testified that he thought that corporate taxes \nshould be zero--zero. Well, that does not make a lot of sense to me.\n  We need a budget that understands when the Federal minimum wage is a \nstarvation wage of $7.25 an hour, we need to substantially raise the \nminimum wage. We need to deal with the overtime scandal we currently \nsee. We need to raise wages for low- and moderate-income families.\n  At a time when large numbers of our young people have given up on the \ndream of higher education and college is increasingly unaffordable, we \nneed a budget that says to every kid in America that if you have the \nability and you have the desire, you are going to get a higher \neducation regardless of the income of your family. At a time when \ncorporations have shipped millions of decent-paying jobs to China and \nother low-wage countries, we need a budget that rewards companies for \ninvesting in America and for creating jobs here, not abroad.\n  At a time when millions of people still lack health insurance, we \nneed a budget that ensures quality, affordable health care for all \nAmericans by supporting the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, \nstrengthening Medicare and Medicaid, and extending funding for the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, community health centers, and the \nNational Health Service Corporation.\n  Let me conclude by making this simple and obvious point: A budget is \nabout priorities. A budget is about choices. And what we have to \ndetermine is whether our budget coming out\n\n[[Page S1423]]\n\nof the Senate is a budget that represents the needs of the rich and \nlarge corporations and their wealthy campaign donors, or whether we \nproduce a budget which represents the needs of working families and the \nmiddle class and the millions and millions of families who are \nstruggling economically to keep their heads above water.\n  I hope we make the right choice. I hope we stand with the working \nfamilies of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in \nrecess from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am on the floor to discuss the Human \nTrafficking Survivors Relief and Empowerment Act, which is legislation \nI introduced last week to aid the recovery of survivors of human \ntrafficking.\n  This bill, which I have also filed as an amendment to Senator \nCornyn's Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, will make important \nstrides toward helping survivors of human trafficking free themselves \nfrom the social stigma that is associated with their victimization and \nhelp them rebuild their lives as productive members of society.\n  I wish to start by sharing the story of a young woman who was \nfeatured on NPR several weeks ago. She is a human trafficking survivor. \nHer story is far too common.\n  She was raped for the first time at age 11. At 13, she was lured away \nfrom her family and eventually forced into engaging in commercial sex. \nShe talked about the physical trauma she endured at the hands of her \ncaptor--her skull was cracked, all of her ribs broken, and she endured \nregular beatings and black eyes.\n  For roughly 7 years, her entire teenage life--a life she should have \nbeen spending in school and among friends--she endured the worst kinds \nof physical and emotional torture. Finally, at age 20, she was rescued \nby a thoughtful police officer nearly 1,400 miles from her home.\n  Fortunately, this young woman is now in the process of rebuilding her \nlife. She has moved home near her family, she has a young son, and she \nis hoping to go to school for nursing and to make a better life for \nherself and her family. However, she is constantly confronted by the \nreality of the criminal record she accumulated as the result of being a \ntrafficking victim. Every application she fills out, every job \ninterview she attends, she is forced to relive and explain the most \npainful moments of her life.\n  As this victim told NPR, ``I'm not ever going to forget what I've \ndone, but at the same time, I don't want it thrown in my face every \ntime I'm trying to seek employment.''\n  Human traffickers use force, fraud, and coercion to compel their \nvictims to engage in criminal activity, particularly prostitution, yet \nit is often the trafficking victims who are arrested, detained, \nprosecuted, and convicted.\n  My legislation is simple. It provides an incentive for States to \nenact laws that allow human trafficking survivors to clear their State \ncriminal records of prostitution and other low-level, nonviolent crimes \nthat result from being trafficked.\n  Specifically, these vacatur statutes allow trafficking survivors to \nfile a motion in court to expunge their criminal record for crimes they \ncan reasonably demonstrate were the result of being trafficked.\n  My colleague Senator Gillibrand has filed a similar amendment that \nwould address this issue at the Federal level or in Federal court. Her \namendment would ensure that victims charged with Federal crimes have \nthe opportunity to clear their record of the most serious types of \ncharges associated with trafficking.\n  My amendment would encourage States to provide a remedy for the most \ncommon types of charges that trafficking victims face.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my legislation and my amendment. I \nhope we can get trafficking legislation done in a way that will help \nthe victims in the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/11/senate-section/article/S1423-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of my remarks Senator Isakson be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, there are a lot of people--scientists, \ndoctors and health professionals, our military and security leaders, \nthe insurance and reinsurance industry, most of our major utilities, \neven faith leaders--who agree that climate change is a serious problem \nand an important priority.\n  In the private sector, many corporate leaders see climate change as \nboth a moral challenge and a financial opportunity. Indeed, as I rise \ntoday for now the 92nd time to urge my colleagues in Congress to wake \nup to the urgent threat of climate change, major American companies \nhave already begun to take action. They are not waiting around for \nCongress.\n  Ceres, for instance, is a nonprofit organization that helps to \nmobilize investors and business leaders to build a sustainable global \neconomy. Ceres reports that nearly half of Fortune 500 companies now \nhave their own clean energy targets.\n  Institutional investors are also committed to fighting climate \nchange. In 2003, there were just 10 of them. Ten years later, by 2013, \nthere were 110, holding $13 trillion in assets. Walmart uses about 25 \npercent renewable energy, Google is at 35 percent, and Apple nearly 75 \npercent. More and more companies are seeing the benefit of cleaning up \ntheir energy sources and investing in the future, and it is not just \nout of the goodness of their hearts. These are our most profitable \ncorporations. They have made a successful business model of saving \nmoney by reducing their carbon footprint.\n  Coca-Cola, for instance, knows how disruptive climate change can be \nto the water supply that is the most basic need of its bottling \nfacilities. Apparel giant VF Corporation understands the threat of \nchanging conditions to agricultural commodities such as cotton. And, \nyes, these companies also know that four out of five Americans support \naction on climate change. In other words, climate-friendly corporate \npractices are a hit with consumers, particularly younger consumers.\n  Since consumers want climate friendliness, there are also companies \nthat try to have it both ways. They try to look like good actors on \nclimate change without really being good actors. It is called green \nwashing, and the major oil and gas companies are classic green washers. \nLook at their public statements and their ad campaigns, and we might \nthink they were helping to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. But \nwhat they say and what they do, do not match up. Look at the green ad \ncampaigns that have been run by the big oil companies. Some of these \nmultimillion dollar campaigns still run today.\n  Here is Chevron saying, ``We agree,'' it is time for oil companies to \nget behind renewable energy. This campaign started in 2010 and is still \naround. For years Chevron said renewable energy\n\n[[Page S1424]]\n\nwas part of its business plan. It actually once built utility-scale \nsolar and geothermal projects, and it even made money doing it. But in \nthe end, Chevron's core business of drilling up oil and gas prevailed, \nand last year Chevron sold off almost all of its renewable energy \nbusiness, but they still pretend they are green. They still say ``We \nagree,'' but in real life they don't.\n  Not too long ago, BP styled itself ``Beyond Petroleum'' and told us \nto think outside the barrel. The company made industry-leading \ninvestments in wind farms and solar power in the billions of dollars. \nBut BP, too, has exited the solar business and has attempted to sell \nits U.S. wind farms in what a company spokesperson called ``part of a \ncontinuing effort to become a more focused oil and gas company.'' They \nwere just pretending to be green. Here is their logo. Look at this \nridiculous little green and flower/sunshine thing from oil extractors. \nIt is a total phony.\n  The pick of the fossil fuel industry litter is actually Shell. Public \npronouncements from Shell Oil have been sensational. Shell ads told us \nof the effort to ``broaden the world's energy mix.'' Well, in 2012, \nShell reported investing about $400 million into low-carbon \nalternatives, which seems like a lot until we realize that was out of \nnearly $23 billion that year spent by Shell--less than 2 percent. \nComparing that $400 million in 2012, Shell has spent at least $5 \nbillion in recent years to expand oil and gas drilling operations in \nthe Arctic. Shell is one of the largest holders of filthy tar sands \nrights in Canada.\n  But here is the champ when it comes to climate doublespeak. \nExxonMobil excels. Since at least 2008, the oil giant has run ads such \nas these, with scientific formulas and Lucite molecules and all these \ntechnological-looking things. I remember one with folks in lab coats. \nExxon executives and engineers tell us about the need to protect the \nenvironment and to move toward cleaner, more diverse energy sources \nsuch as wind and solar, as images behind them of wind turbines twirl in \nthe distance.\n  Exxon does not report transparently enough for a solid case to be \nproven, but there is at least a reasonable inference that could be \ndrawn that they spend more on advertising their green research than \nthey spent on their green research. The Wall Street Journal wrote: \n``Exxon's ads are part of a growing effort by the industry to counter a \npolitical backlash against rising oil prices and global warming \nworries.''\n  Faking it is not a solution, and this campaign is still running. The \nlatest ads are right there on Exxon's Web site, where the public is \nwatching. The Exxon Web site also tells us ``rising greenhouse gas \nemissions pose significant risks to society and ecosystems''--again, \nfor public consumption.\n  But when they filed comments with the regulators, in 2009, Exxon \nwrote: ``Support for the effects of climate change on public health and \nwelfare is almost nonexistent and engulfed in an extremely high degree \nof uncertainty.''\n  For years Exxon has been devoted to propping up climate denial and \nclimate deniers. The Union of Concerned Scientists found that between \n2002 and 2010 ExxonMobil contributed to and lobbied anti-climate \nMembers of Congress over pro-climate Members at a ratio of 10 to 1. \nRecent disclosures show that even after vowing that it would no longer \nbankroll groups that deny climate change, Exxon continued for years to \nfund the work of climate skeptic Willie Soon, an astrophysicist whose \nresearch is under investigation for failure to divulge his oil industry \nbacking.\n  Which Exxon are we supposed to believe? Remember the words of the \nExxon vice president who testified before Congress in 2008 that ``the \npursuit of alternative fuels must not detract from the development of \noil and gas.''\n  ExxonMobil's ads boast that the company is ``taking on the world's \ntoughest energy challenge.'' The toughest challenge we face is finding \na way to fuel the global economy without driving the climate to the \nbreaking point with our limitless, endless carbon pollution. ExxonMobil \nis committed to an oil economy that has no future. If only Exxon and \nthe other oil giants would devote more of their advertising budget to \nresearch and to the development of renewable fuels, we might be better \noff.\n  If you don't think that the big oil companies are bad enough on their \nown, once they get together they are downright dirty. These companies--\nChevron, BP, Shell, and ExxonMobil--are all members of the American \nPetroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry trade association. As we \nall know around here, the American Petroleum Institute is dedicated to \nobstructing action on climate change and even to spreading false doubt \nabout its existence, and API in turn funds some of the worst and most \nirresponsible climate denial front organizations.\n  Chevron, BP, Shell, and ExxonMobil also support something called the \nAmerican Legislative Exchange Council or ALEC. ALEC is an organization \nwhich works to undercut climate science and undermine climate progress \nat the State level, interfering in our State legislatures. ALEC has \ntried to roll back State renewable fuel standards and has handed out \nmodel State legislation to obstruct and tie up the President's Clean \nPower Plan.\n  So which way are they going to have it, the way they sell themselves \nin the ads with funny little sunbursts and Lucite molecules or their \nreal presence in State legislatures and in Congress spending money to \nshut down the climate debate and keep pumping the oil?\n  Major companies such as Google, eBay, Facebook, Yahoo, and even \nOccidental Petroleum have disassociated themselves from ALEC because of \nits destructive position on climate. Google's CEO Eric Schmidt has said \n``they are literally lying about climate change.'' But they keep \ngetting funding from Chevron, BP, Shell, and ExxonMobil.\n  The reality is these major fossil fuel companies are dedicated to a \nfossil fuel future that puts basic operating systems of our planet at \nrisk. All these ad campaigns and all these public statements to make \nthe companies look good are just a way to paper over that basic, dirty, \ncontinuing fact. It is a sham. It is a false front. It is phony PR, and \nall the green washing in the world shouldn't be able to cover it up.\n  But I will conclude by saying it does seem to be having its effect. \nWe have seen recently in the news in Florida that Florida Department of \nEnvironmental Protection officials have been ordered not to use the \nterms ``climate change'' or ``global warming'' in any official \ncommunications, emails or reports. That is according to DEP employees, \nDEP consultants, DEP volunteers, and State records, all dug out by the \nFlorida Center for Investigative Reporting.\n  Governor Scott of Florida has repeatedly said he is ``not convinced \nthat climate change is caused by human activity,'' despite the \nscientific evidence to the contrary. It is apparently a gag order about \nclimate change that was well known and distributed verbally statewide.\n  I guess Governor Scott has told reporters that he had not been \nconvinced about climate change and that he would need something more \nconvincing than what I have read. I would be interested to know what \nhis reading list was. So here we are in a world of fantasy in which the \nbig oil polluters put on this pretense that they are clean, that they \ncare about clean energy, that they are interested in a nonfossil fuel \nfuture, while they are supporting the very organizations that undercut \nthat work here in Congress and they are able to get behind people such \nas the Governor, apparently, in Florida--certainly his administration--\nwho are so paralyzed about climate change that they not only won't say \nthe words, but they won't allow State employees to even say the words. \nThat is a pathetic state of democracy.\n  I yield the floor, and I now turn to my friend from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I have nine grandchildren. Seven of them \nare 11 or under; two of them are in college. Those 7 who are 11 or \nunder represent the joy of my life and the life of my children. But \ntonight when you and I go to bed and each Member of this Senate goes to \nbed, somewhere back in our State, young women and young children the \nsame age as my grandchildren will be bought and sold into slavery. They \nwill be trafficked as human beings for sex workers, for pornography \nworkers, and for workers themselves. It is wrong for the greatest \nNation on\n\n[[Page S1425]]\n\nthe face of this Earth and the richest Nation on the face of this Earth \nto have the crime of human trafficking take place day in and day out.\n  I am so proud of Senator Cornyn and others from this Senate who \nbrought forward the bill that is before us today. I want to appeal to \nthose who are holding it up to go to cloture to ask themselves this \nquestion when they go to bed tonight: When you put your head on that \npillow, some child somewhere in your State is going to be trafficked \nfor sex purposes or pornography. Some young life, some life of \ninnocence is going to be ruined. I think it is time for us to put aside \nany differences we may have on this legislation and move it forward so \nthat we have for the first time the focus on human trafficking and the \nabuse of kids.\n  This is a serious problem in my State of Georgia. Atlanta has one of \nthe highest rates of trafficking of any city in the United States, I am \ntold. Our attorney general, Sam Olens, has said the following:\n\n       Human trafficking is a modern day slavery, plain and \n     simple. It robs children of their innocence and dignity.\n\n  We must combat this evil, and it is appropriate that the most \ndeliberative body in the world, the U.S. Senate, begin to put together \na framework where we confront child slavery, sex trafficking, and the \ntargeting of our children in multiple ways. We need to provide them \nwith benefits to be able to be protected. A lot of that is in terms of \nhousing and safe havens, but it also concerns other things. We need to \nincrease the resources for victims of trafficking, No. 1. A lot of kids \nwho are trafficked and can get out of trafficking and get out of \npossession end up having serious problems with PTSD and TBI. The \nproblem of being abused as a child is as rough as the battleground in \nAfghanistan or Iraq. We must provide the safe havens and the therapy \nand the mental health care that is necessary to help them bring back \ntheir life.\n  I gave a graduation speech 5 years ago to a young lady who was 22 \nyears old and just graduating from high school. She had dropped out of \nhigh school pregnant at the age of 15. She had come under the spell of \na trafficker who took her in, made her a sex worker, and she ended up \nhaving three additional children. She was almost lost for life. But \nfinally some good person found her. They brought her into the county \nschool system. They found her a way to go to the alternative school. \nShe ended up graduating No. 1 in her class and going to the Georgia \nInstitute of Technology in Atlanta. A life was saved, but it was only \nsaved because people reached out to her. We need to encourage that and \nproduce that.\n  Back in my home State of Georgia in my hometown of Roswell, GA, there \nis a guy by the name of Dave McCleary. Dave McCleary is a Rotarian who \n2 years ago took this project on as his passion--to be a spokesman for \nthose who are abused, those who are trafficked, and those who are \nthrown into prostitution and pornography. He has made a major \ndifference in Rotary clubs in Georgia, and now they are activating \nthemselves to pay attention to this terrible disease and this terrible \naffliction.\n  We need to recognize child pornography as a form of human trafficking \nso victims have access to support, and we need to require that \ntraffickers be treated as violent criminals to protect the victims and \nwitnesses. Most important of all, we need to help State and local \ngovernments fight human trafficking through increased shelters, law \nenforcement, task forces, and problem-solving cures for people with \nthese problems.\n  We also need to get to the floor for another reason. Senator Corker \nin the Foreign Relations Committee has a bill which would be an \namendment to this bill which expands our human trafficking response. We \ncan't get to that until we get to cloture, and we can't get to cloture \nuntil we get 60 votes.\n  So I appeal to Members of the Senate to find common ground to let \nthis debate come to the floor, so that when you lay your head on the \npillow tonight, instead of thinking about a child that is being abused, \nyou think about the abuse that you are avoiding because the Senate took \naction on human trafficking.\n\n\n                         Commending John Lewis\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, 2 years ago, on the 48th anniversary of \nthe crossing of the Edmund Pettus Bridge by a bunch of brave citizens \nwho challenged the United States to do what was right and make voting \nrights equal for everybody, I walked across the Edmund Pettus Bridge \nwith Congressman John Lewis from my State.\n  John Lewis is 75 years old this year, and he continues to be a leader \nfor civil rights and for passion. This past weekend in Selma, AL, he \nled the President of the United States, Barack Obama, the past \nPresident of the United States, George W. Bush, and over 100 Members of \nCongress across the Edmund Pettus Bridge for us to reflect and remember \nover the last 50 years what has happened in this country, where voting \nrights have gone from being a dream to a reality, where equality for \nmen and women and people of all races now exists. It would not have \nhappened were it not for a few good men and a few good women who at \ntheir time in history responded to history's call.\n  John Lewis was one of those people. I am proud to serve with him in \nthe Georgia delegation to the Congress, and I am proud of all he has \ndone to make America a better place to live.\n  So on this year when he celebrates his 75th birthday anniversary and \non the 50th anniversary of the crossing of the Edmund Pettus Bridge, I \npay tribute to a great citizen of Georgia, a great American, and a \ngreat humanitarian--John Lewis, the Congressman from the city of \nAtlanta and the State of Georgia.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while the distinguished senior Senator from \nGeorgia is on the floor, I wish to associate myself with what he had to \nsay about Congressman John Lewis.\n  Congressman Lewis has been a friend, a colleague, and a mentor to all \nof us on both sides of the aisle on the issues of civil rights. He is \none of the true heroes. We sometimes overuse the word ``hero.'' But I \nthink the Senator and I would both agree that this is a man who \ndeserves the word ``hero.''\n\n\n                            Lynch Nomination\n\n  Mr. President, we are talking about human trafficking. We have heard \nhorrific stories. Certainly those of us who are parents or grandparents \nhave to think how horrible it would be if these things had happened to \nour children or our grandchildren.\n  I am usually the only person on the floor who has prosecuted child \nmolesters--and I still have nightmares over some of the cases I have \nprosecuted--I wish we would never have another one of these awful \ncases.\n  So as we consider legislation about human trafficking and \nexploitation, we could take immediate action to show support for \nprotecting our Nation's most vulnerable from human trafficking by \nconfirming Loretta Lynch to be Attorney General. I say this because Ms. \nLynch has a proven track record in prosecuting human trafficking and \nchild rape cases.\n  Ms. Lynch's record in pursuing these cases is so well established \nthat even prominent FOX News hosts have praised her. One host at FOX \nNews called her a ``hero'' for the prosecution of a child rapist. \nAnother has described Ms. Lynch as a ``straight shooter'' for her \noverall service as a Federal prosecutor. And a third host on FOX News \nhas called for a vote on her nomination ``this week'', saying there \nshould be ``no more slow walking'' by the Senate. I couldn't agree \nmore.\n  As we go into this debate, I think about the fact that Ms. Lynch was \nrecently named one of ``New York's New Abolitionists'' by the New York \nState Anti-Trafficking Coalition. Why? Because of her leadership in \ncombatting human trafficking. She has emphasized anti-trafficking \nprograms at the U.S. Attorney's office that she leads. Over the course \nof the last decade, her office has not just talked about why they \noppose human trafficking, they have indicted over 55 defendants in sex \ntrafficking cases. They have rescued over 110 victims of sex \ntrafficking.\n  I will give you a couple of examples. In one case, her office \nobtained convictions against three brothers for sex trafficking. What \ndid they do? These brothers were sentenced to double-digit prison terms \nfor running a trafficking\n\n[[Page S1426]]\n\nring that enticed victims as young as 14 and 15 years old. They had \nthem transported illegally into the United States. Then they forced \nthem to work as prostitutes in New York City and elsewhere. The \ndefendants beat and sexually assaulted the victims to compel them to \nwork and then punished them for not earning enough money.\n  In another case her office obtained a conviction against an owner of \nseveral New York bars for his role in sex trafficking and forced labor \nring. The evidence at the trial established that the defendants \nrecruited and harbored scores of undocumented Latin American immigrants \nand forced them to work as waitresses at the owner's bars.\n  How did they compel them to work? His accomplices used violence, \nbeatings, and rape, as well as fraud and threats of deportation, to \ncompel the victims to work and to prevent them from reporting the \nillegal activity to the police. Because of Loretta Lynch, this monster \nwas arrested and sentenced to 60 years in prison. That is one way you \nstop this.\n  She has similarly prosecuted those who exploit children for sexual \nabuse to the fullest extent of the law. During her tenure, she has \ndirected prosecutors in her office to bring 173 prosecutions for child \nexploitation and child pornography in coordination with the \nDepartment's Project Safe Childhood. In one case, the office prosecuted \nand obtained a guilty plea from a pediatrician who sexually exploited \nthree of his patients under the guise of providing medical treatment. \nThat predator now faces 30 years in prison.\n  I am saying this because no Member of this body--Republican or \nDemocrat--no Member is in favor of sex trafficking. No Member is in \nfavor of the exploitation of children in this fashion. Why don't we \nshow we believe that, by confirming this highly qualified woman to be \nattorney general? She goes out and gets the people, she prosecutes \nthem, she convicts them, and she sends them to prison.\n  I sometimes think of those exploited children I represented in the \npast. In the better cases, we could tell the child that he or she was \nsafe and that we locked up the person who did this to them. But I also \nthink of one of the very first cases I had--within weeks of becoming a \n26-year-old State's attorney. I will never forget that case for as long \nas I live. We prosecuted the man. I convicted him. It was appealed to \nthe Vermont Supreme Court, and I argued and won that appeal. He was \nconvicted and went to prison for the rest of his life. But that does \nnot help his victim. I can only go to the grave of his 2-year-old \nvictim and say: We convicted the man who did this to you, but we can't \nbring you back to life.\n  Let's take the steps we need to stop this. We can do it. We stalled \nat one point on this bill. Let's find our way around that, and let's \nget this done. Let's give prosecutors the tools not just to prosecute \ncriminals when we find them--let's take the steps necessary to stop \nthis from happening in the first place.\n  When I think of that 2-year-old boy, if better steps had been in \nplace to stop the abuse from happening, he would have lived. The abuser \nwas prosecuted after the fact. There was no case in which I wanted to \nget a conviction more than I did in that case, but it didn't bring the \n2-year-old victim back to life. Some victims in the cases I worked on \nwere alive, and I saw how scarred the abuse left them.\n  We can prosecute those who commit these heinous crimes. Let's stop \nthe crimes from happening. Let's ensure that these homeless kids, \ninstead of going with anybody who will offer them a warm place and \nfood--where the warm place and food turn into a hell on Earth for \nthem--let's make sure there are shelters, people, and counselors who \ncan help.\n  Mr. President, I see our distinguished chairman is here, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss what I discussed \nearlier in the day. In fact, I think it was this morning when I spoke \nto the reason why this legislation is not moving along. I am not going \nto repeat what I said then, but since then the minority leader came to \nthe floor and gave reasons for this bill not moving along, and so I \nwill once again bring up some important issues about this legislation \nand rebut the other side on why we are not moving forward with this \nbill.\n  As we all know, this bill was unveiled in January after weeks of \nnegotiation among our respective staff. It has been in the public \ndomain since it was introduced in January. Since that time, we have \nfollowed regular order with respect to this legislation. We had a \nhearing on this bill. We scheduled a markup in February, and amendments \nwere offered to the bill at that markup. The ranking member offered an \namendment to the very same section of the bill that included this \nlanguage.\n  Numerous committee members took the opportunity to speak about the \nbill during the hearing and markup. The markup offered a prime \nopportunity for any member--including the minority members of the \nSenate--to ask questions and make changes and strip out language to \nwhich they might have objected. We promised regular order during floor \nconsideration as well, just as we have on practically every other piece \nof legislation that has been before the Senate since the new majority \nhas taken over.\n  The language which they now object to on the floor, weeks after a \ncommittee markup took place--I remind everyone that this bill passed \nwithout a single dissenting vote in committee--is referred to as the \nHyde amendment. We are talking about language that has been standard \nfor the last 39 or 40 years. It is included virtually every time \nCongress appropriates taxpayer dollars for health services. The Hyde \namendment has been and currently is the law of the land.\n  Hyde amendment language has been added to appropriations bills every \nyear for decades. We have heard: Well, it has been added to \nappropriations bills, but it has not been on authorization bills. That \nis not true because it has been included in more than one authorization \nstatute. I will give some examples, including laws authorizing the \nSCHIP program and programs in the Department of Defense. We negotiated \nthis bill and this language in good faith.\n  I urge the Members of this body not to impede passage of a measure \nthat over 200 groups have reviewed and endorsed. Yesterday I put \nletters from some of those groups or maybe even all of those groups in \nthe Record so everyone can see the wide support this bill has not only \nin the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee by being voted out unanimously, \nbut also outside groups support it as well. The 200 outside groups who \nparticipated in the hours of helping us reach a consensus on this bill \nhave made it clear that ending human trafficking is an important \npriority for all of them. We need to put aside partisan politics. We \nneed to pass this bill for their sake and the sake of trafficking \nsurvivors who are being subjected to degradation every day while we \nwait to act.\n  My asking that politics be put aside in order to get this legislation \npassed is not something new. Those politics were put aside in the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I hate to see this held up over just the \nHyde amendment. In somewhat similar legislation, the Republican House \nof Representatives was wise enough not to create this illusory \n``special assessment fund.'' The House-passed bill is an authorizing \nbill and does not contain the Hyde amendment.\n  I will yield the floor in a moment, but first I wish to quote from a \nstatement by ATEST, Alliance To End Slavery and Trafficking. They urged \nthe Senate, as I have, to reach a bipartisan compromise on the Justice \nfor Victims of Trafficking Act.\n\n       For well over a decade, the work to combat modern slavery \n     and human trafficking has been an example of Congress's \n     ability to put partisanship aside in the interest of tackling \n     a difficult and seemingly intractable problem. That \n     willingness to be thoughtful, practical, and balanced in \n     approach has proven successful in this work, and made \n     tremendous contributions to the fight against this heinous \n     crime. The debate that is emerging over the Justice for \n     Victims of Trafficking Act, S. 178, and the application of \n     the Hyde amendment to funds collected from perpetrators of \n     human trafficking jeopardize this pragmatic balance in favor \n     of a partisan confrontation that undermines the achievement \n     of our joint goal of ending modern slavery in the United \n     States and around the world.\n       For these reasons, we urge all members of the Senate to \n     turn away from this divisive\n\n[[Page S1427]]\n\n     debate and find a bipartisan approach to this new initiative \n     to protect and serve the needs of survivors.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that their statement be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                       Alliance to\n\n\n                                  End Slavery and Trafficking,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n\n   ATEST Urges Senate To Reach Bipartisan Compromise on Justice for \n                       Victims of Trafficking Act\n\n       For well over a decade, the work to combat modern slavery \n     and human trafficking has been an example of Congress's \n     ability to put partisanship aside in the interest of tackling \n     a difficult and seemingly intractable problem.

I agree that we should get away from the divisiveness the \nHyde amendment has created and find a way to go to the basic \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I see my friend from Tennessee in the Chamber, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont and \nthe Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor to offer an amendment to the \nlegislation, which I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am sorry, I didn't hear what the request \nwas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I sent an amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Did the Senator ask to set aside the pending amendment?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I did not.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have no objection.\n  Mr. President, I withhold that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee has the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Then I will object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Tennessee yield to me \nfor a question?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, am I correct that the Senator from \nTennessee is not asking the Senate to set aside the pending amendment \nbut wishes to file an amendment? Is that correct?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Vermont \nthrough the Chair that the answer is yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, under those circumstances, I will not \nobject.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. President, I have sent to the desk an amendment entitled the Stop \nSexual Abuse by School Personnel Act of 2015. It is sponsored by me and \nMr. Kirk, the Senator from Illinois.\n  In summary, what the amendment does is the following:\n  It requires States to have a criminal background check for all school \nemployees.\n  It allows States and local school districts to use Federal funding \nauthorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to \nestablish, implement, or improve policies and procedures on background \nchecks for school employees. Our amendment accomplishes this through \nthe following: providing States with the flexibility and resources to \nconduct searches of State and Federal criminal registries as determined \nby the State; empowering States to establish, implement, or improve \npolicies and procedures concerning the timely disclosure, notice, and \nappeal of background check results; supporting the development, \nimplementation, or improvement of mechanisms for assisting in the \nidentification of and response to incidents of child abuse, including \nby providing training and development for school personnel; and any \nother activities determined by the State to protect student safety.\n  In addition, the Alexander-Kirk amendment adopts the 2014 General \nAccountability Office report which recommended establishing the U.S. \nDepartment of Education as the lead agency to inform States of best \npractices. It also authorizes the U.S. Education Secretary to make \nreporting of student sexual abuse by school personnel a part of the \nannual Secretary's report card. Finally, it protects schools and school \ndistricts from being sued if they are in compliance with State \nregulations and requirements.\n  This is an enormously important subject and one of interest to every \nsingle Member of the United States Senate. There is at least one other \namendment on the subject by the Senator from Pennsylvania and the \nSenator from West Virginia. I expect there may be more amendments on \nthe same subject. They all have the same goal--preventing sexual abuse \nof the 50 million children in our 100,000 public schools by school \npersonnel.\n  These amendments are all under the jurisdiction of the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee, of which I am the chair. As \nchair of that committee, I believe there is a right way and a wrong way \nto reach this laudable goal. The right way is for the Federal \nGovernment to enable States and local governments to do a better job. \nThe wrong way is for the Federal Government to set itself up as a \nnational school board or as a human resources department to override \nState laws and dictate how to hire and fire six million teachers or \nother school personnel.\n  We have 6 million school personnel that could be affected by \nbackground check proposals. The question is, Can the local school board \nor can Washington, DC, do a better job of helping make children safe in \nUtah, in Iowa, in Tennessee, or in Vermont?\n  Senators Toomey and Manchin deserve our thanks and great credit for \nputting the spotlight on this issue that every single Senator cares \nabout. But, I am afraid their solution for background checks will try \nto accomplish this purpose the wrong way. It would override State laws \nin at least 46 States to dictate policies and procedures for 100,000 \npublic schools. Their approach and their amendment, if enacted, would \nbe the most extensive Federal takeover of local school personnel \ndecisions in our country's history.\n  Let me say that once more. Their amendment, if enacted, would be the \nmost extensive Federal takeover of local school personnel decisions in \nour country's history.\n  Now, I see on the floor the Senator from Iowa. I have spent some time \nin Iowa over the years and I know what a good education system they \nhave in Iowa. In fact, Iowans are very particular about their education \nsystem. I don't know of a State that was more upset with No Child Left \nBehind than Iowa when it passed because it dictated education policies \nfrom Washington. Iowans asked, ``Does Washington cherish the children \nof Iowa more than we do in Des Moines or in any other community in \nIowa? Why do the people in Washington think they can tell us what to do \nabout how to educate our children better than we do?'' That is the \nissue here: whether it is Washington imposing academic standards such \nas Common Core or deciding whether schools and teachers are succeeding \nor failing, or mandating a one-size-fits-all approach to employee \nbackground checks on 6 million school personnel in 100,000 schools. I \nbelieve the American people are tired of this Washington-knows-best \nattitude toward local schools.\n  Senator Kirk and I have the Stop Sexual Abuse By School Personnel Act \nof 2015--which offers an approach toward this laudable goal in the \ncorrect way. Let me explain why I say it is the correct way.\n  First, it requires every state to have background checks for its 6 \nmillion employees who have access to children, but it doesn't dictate \nto them how to do the checks. Repeatedly we have found that when \nCongress tells the U.S. Department of Education to do something, it \nthen proceeds to write a lot of\n\n[[Page S1428]]\n\nregulations about exactly how to do it. I will give you an example.\n  In No Child Left Behind, there are requirements about improving low-\nperforming schools. The law says there are six ways you must fix them. \nI put in the law last year a seventh way to fix schools: allowing the \nGovernor of the State to come up with his or her own way to do this. \nThen, the U.S. Department of Education Secretary can approve or \ndisapprove that approach. The Department, in its well-intentioned \nactivities, defined what a Governor of Tennessee or Utah or Iowa could \nsay about his or her own idea about fixing low-performing schools. That \nhappens all the time. It happens all the time. Over the last several \nyears we have created, in effect, a national school board in \nWashington, DC, by substituting the judgment of Washington for local \nschools. Achieving the laudable goal of stopping sexual abuse by school \npersonnel in the way suggested by the Senators from Pennsylvania and \nWest Virginia would only make that national school board bigger. In the \nwords of one teacher I spoke with, their proposal would only make the \nU.S. Department of Education more of a human resources department for 6 \nmillion local school personnel.\n  Last year, the Government Accountability Office found that 46 States \nrequire background checks for all public school employees. My amendment \nrequire all states to do them. It would also ensure background checks \nfor contractors who have unsupervised contact or interaction with \nchildren.\n  It would also let schools and school districts use Federal funding to \nexpand access to more registries since the cost of conducting the \nchecks sometimes keep them from doing so.\n  My amendment takes this broader approach because the Government \nAccountability Office report in 2014 that background checks alone are \nnot enough to prevent child abuse by school personnel. Background \nchecks are only as good as the databases used to conduct them. I \nunderstand sometimes those databases can have inaccurate or incomplete \ninformation. One report estimated that 1.8 million workers a year are \nsubject to FBI background checks that include faulty or incomplete \ninformation such as the final result of the case.\n  GAO's report also highlights that those charged with child abuse are \nonly a fraction of those who abuse children. For example, a risk \nmanagement company told GAO that few child abusers are caught the first \ntime they abuse, and many abuse children multiple times before they are \ncaught. Therefore, background checks alone are not enough to help \nprotect children from abuse.\n  Experts say, according to the GAO report, that training to prevent \nchild abuse is a key tool to help school employees recognize early \nwarning signs of abuse and they recommend that schools integrate \ntraining into their child abuse prevention efforts. Yet, because of \ncost constraints, GAO found that only 18 States required training. The \namendment Senator Kirk and I are offering would help more States with \nschools that offer training by allowing States and school districts to \nuse Federal funding to do it.\n  Third, the Alexander-Kirk amendment would establish the Department of \nEducation as a resource for States. The Department of Education is not \nsupposed to be the school board for Utah or Tennessee or Iowa; it is \nsupposed to be, if anything, an enabling resource. So another important \nway to prevent child abuse is to ensure schools are aware of \ninformation and resources that are already available to them by the \nFederal Government.\n  According to GAO, again: ``The Federal Government, through its \nexisting resources and expertise, is well positioned to assist States \nand localities and to help strengthen their prevention and response \nefforts.''\n  Yet, last year, more than 30 States surveyed by GAO were not aware of \nFederal resources available to schools to help address sexual abuse \nbecause no single agency was leading this effort, and coordination \namong the Federal agencies is limited. In one baffling example, a lead \nofficial who coordinates interagency meetings to talk about child \nmaltreatment said none of the meetings had focused on sexual abuse by \nschool personnel.\n  States are looking for help. Twenty-nine States said additional \nguidance and technical assistance could be useful, such as guidance on \ndeveloping professional standards and codes of conduct, examples of \ntraining models, and materials, and opportunities for grants. That is \nwhy the Alexander-Kirk amendment adopts GAO's recommendation to \ninstruct the Secretary of Education to lead an effort, in coordination \nwith other agencies, to develop and disseminate best practices that \nStates, districts, and schools can take to prevent and respond to \nsexual abuse by school personnel.\n\n  Fourth, the amendment would recommend that the Secretary of Education \npull together a dependable set of data on abuse by school personnel for \nthe Secretary's report card. GAO reported that several Federal agencies \ncollect data related to violence against children and students, but \nnone systematically identify the extent of sexual abuse by school \npersonnel. Therefore, my amendment also adopts the GAO recommendation \nthat the Secretary of Education work to identify ways to better track \nand analyze the prevalence of child abuse by school personnel and \nreport on it in the Secretary's report card.\n  This is an approach to solving the problem that respects the idea \nthat in my hometown, and in each Senator's hometown in 100,000 schools, \nthere are school boards, parents, and communities that cherish their \nchildren and they don't believe that Washington cherishes them more. \nThis proposal would give those parents, communities, teachers, and \nprincipals the tools they need to prevent child abuse. It would enable \nthem to do a better job of stopping sexual abuse of children by school \npersonnel.\n  In a meeting I attended earlier today, it was said that the Senate \nhas already passed the Toomey-Manchin amendment because we passed the \nchild care and development block grant. Let me talk about that a \nminute. The child care and development block grant went through the \ncommittee I now chair. There are three things wrong with the argument \nthat the Toomey-Manchin amendment has already passed. First, the child \ncare development block grant is funded 100 percent by the Federal \nGovernment. It affects 1.5 million children. It affects a little more \nthan 1 million children. The Federal Government funds about 10 percent \nof elementary and secondary education. So if we fund 100 percent of a \nprogram, the argument is strong that we can also write the rules for \nit. If we fund 10 of a program, the people who fund 90 percent might \nsay, ``What gave you the right to tell us what to do?''\n  Second, the argument was made that the child care and development \nblock grant contains basically the same set of background checks as the \nToomey-Manchin. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Toomey-\nManchin amendment is significantly different from the background check \nprovisions in the child care and development block grant. It is \ndifferent in terms of its scope, privacy provisions, mitigating factors \nin an appeals process, potential lawsuits against a school district, \nand materiality. Let me focus on these differences for a minute.\n  First, in terms of scope, the child care and development block grant \napplies to about 1.5 million children who receive vouchers to for \nchildcare. The Toomey-Manchin bill applies to all elementary and \nsecondary schools in States that receive funding under the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act. That is 100,000 public elementary and \nsecondary schools, 14,000 local school districts, and 50 State \neducation agencies.\n  Second, in terms of privacy, the child care and development block \ngrant ensures that the only information employers receive is whether \nthe prospective employee passed or failed the background check. The \nToomey-Manchin amendment has no similar protections and allows \nemployers to share the results of background checks with other \nprospective employers. That is a privacy concern.\n  Third, it differs in terms of what we call mitigating factors: The \nchild care and development block grant permits States to create a \nreview process through which disqualified employees can become eligible \nfor employment due to mitigating factors such as the length of time \nsince they committed a crime. The Toomey-Manchin bill\n\n[[Page S1429]]\n\ndoesn't permit States to conduct such reviews. My bill allows states to \ndo a review.\n  Fourth, private right of action provisions: The child care and \ndevelopment block grant expressly does not create a private right of \naction if the childcare provider is in compliance with all State \nregulations. The Toomey-Manchin bill does not contain similar language, \npotentially exposing schools to litigation. The Alexander amendment \ndoes include that.\n  Finally, materiality. The child care and development block grant \nprecludes hiring an employee if they make a material false statement on \na background check. The Toomey-Manchin bill has no such materiality \nrequirement.\n  I ask unanimous consent to include, following my remarks, these \ndifferences between the background check requirements in the child care \nand development block grant bill and the Toomey-Manchin amendment.\n  Finally, I am glad we are discussing the topic of protecting students \nfrom sexual abuse. I congratulate the Senator from Pennsylvania and the \nSenator from West Virginia for putting the spotlight on this issue. I \nhave worked with them to suggest changes to their bill.\n  We have fundamental differences in our approaches. I think, when it \ncomes to local schools, the limit of Washington's responsibility is to \nenable communities and schools to do a better job of educating our \nchildren.\n  Most of the discussion we are having in the Senate education \ncommittee today is reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct. The discussion is about who determines whether schools and \nteachers are succeeding or failing, local communities or Washington? \nThe theory is that local control of these decisions allows for more \ninnovation. This respects the fact that parents, communities, teachers, \nand principals cherish their own children. It certainly would be wrong \nfor us to say Washington cherishes their children more than they do.\n  I spend a lot of my time arguing with people--they are often \nDemocrats--who want to say: I have got a good idea. Now, let's impose \nit on all schools. For example, Common Core--we have 42 States \noperating under waivers from the U.S. Department of Education. In order \nto get that waiver, which they need to keep their schools from being \ndeemed as failing, states have to, in effect, adopt Common Core. This \nrequirement has created a general uprising in Tennessee; I imagine it \nhas in North Carolina; I suspect it has in Iowa, not so much because of \nwhat the standards are but because the very idea that Washington would \nbe telling local school districts it knows better than their state \ncapital and local school boards what their academic standards ought to \nbe. The same thing with teacher evaluation.\n  When I was the Governor of Tennessee in the 1980s, we became the \nfirst State to pay teachers more for teaching well. I had a year-and-a-\nhalf brawl with the National Education Association. When we defeated \nthem, and 10,000 teachers were gradually able to move up the career \nladder.\n  When I came to Washington, people thought I would require every State \ndo that. I said, absolutely not. That is not the way our constitutional \nfederalism works. States have a right to be right, and have a right to \nbe wrong on teacher evaluation and Common Core. Those are tremendously \nimportant issues, but it is hard enough to fairly evaluate a teacher \nwithout Washington trying to tell you how to do it.\n  Take the business of whether a school is succeeding or failing, \nwhether a school has made adequate yearly progress, or whether a \nteacher is highly qualified. We have had a 12-year experiment with \ntrying to make all these decisions at the U.S. Department of Education. \nOne teacher said it had become a human resources department for 100,000 \nlocal schools. It hasn't worked. It does help to know how the children \nare doing on their tests. It does help to aggregate the results so we \nknow whether children are falling behind. It does help for States to \nhave the results from the national assessment of educational progress \nso we can compare North Carolina to Tennessee. But it does not help to \nhave well-meaning people in Washington say: I know exactly how to make \nyour children safe, how to tell them what to learn, how to evaluate \nteachers, how to tell them whether schools are succeeding or failing, \nand how to fix them.\n  One other example. What about guns? Sexual abuse of children is a \nterrible tragedy. That is why we have at least two amendments on it, \nand maybe we will have a third. So are guns in schools. We have had \nsome terrible tragedies there.\n  What did the U.S. Congress do about that 20 years ago? They passed \nsomething called the Gun-Free School Zones Act. They whipped it right \nthrough Congress as if that was going to fix the problem of guns in \nevery school in America. There were two things wrong with it. The \nSupreme Court of the United States struck the bill down as \nunconstitutional, as a Federal overreach into local affairs. But the \nmain thing wrong with it was that is not how you make schools safe. You \ndon't make schools safe by passing a law in Washington and pretending \nyou have made 50 million children safe in 100,000 schools. This would \nsuggest that if there is a problem with school safety in my hometown in \nMaryville, TN, it is up to the U.S. Senate to fix that problem, to make \nthe schools safe. It is not. That is not how you do it. In my hometown, \nthey make that school safe because the community is involved. They win \nthe football games, they have good academic scores, and they have safe \nschools. Someone asked the principal when they won the football game \nwhy they did so well? The principal said, it is because we are a \ncommunity school. When something happens here, the community shows up.\n  If we want to fix the problem of abuse of children in schools, there \nis a right way to do it and there is a wrong way to do it. The right \nway is to recognize the problem, require States to have background \nchecks, and enable them to do a better job at using Federal funds to \naccess data registries and provide training for employees. In addition, \nthe U.S. Department of Education can be designated as the lead agency \nto provide best practices to local schools and to include data on the \nprevalence of child abuse by school personnel on Secretary's report \ncard. The wrong way to do it is to take over the personnel decisions \nfor 6 million employees in 100,000 schools and pretend that schools \nwill be safer. There is a fundamental difference of opinion by Senators \nwho agree on a laudable goal.\n  I believe it is more appropriate under our constitutional system of \nfederalism for Congress to limit itself to enabling schools to do a \nbetter job of their essential responsibilities rather than creating, in \neffect, a national school board that tries to run our schools and hire \nand fire those personnel.\n  I ask unanimous consent to include following my remarks a summary of \nthe Alexander-Kirk amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Differences Between Background Check Requirements in CCDBG and Toomey \n                                  Bill\n\n       The Child Care and Development and Block Grant (CCDBG), as \n     amended in 2014, and Senator Toomey's amendment to the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act both create a new \n     requirement that states, as a condition of receiving federal \n     funds under relevant programs, conduct comprehensive criminal \n     background checks for all prospective and current child care \n     or school employees. Key differences between the two \n     approaches include:\n       Scope:\n       CCDBG applies to all child care providers that receive \n     federal funding\n       Toomey's bill applies to all elementary and secondary \n     schools in states that receive federal funding under the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act. This includes:\n       100,000 public elementary and secondary schools\n       14,000 local school districts\n        50 state educational agencies\n       Privacy:\n       CCDBG ensures that the only information employers receive \n     is whether the prospective employee passed or failed the \n     background check.\n       Toomey's bill has no similar protections and allows \n     employers to share the results of background checks with \n     other prospective employers.\n       Mitigating factors:\n       CCDBG permits states to create a review process through \n     which disqualified employees can become eligible for \n     employment due to mitigating factors, such as the length of \n     time since they committed a crime.\n       Toomey's bill does not permit states to conduct such \n     reviews.\n       Private right of action:\n       CCDBG does not create a private right of action if the \n     child care provider is in compliance with all state \n     requirements.\n\n[[Page S1430]]\n\n       Toomey's bill does not contain similar language, \n     potentially opening schools to litigation.\n       Materiality:\n       CCDBG precludes hiring an employee if they make a material \n     false statement on a background check; Toomey's bill has no \n     such materiality requirement.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         The Stop Sexual Abuse by School Personnel Act of 2015\n\n\n                   What the Alexander Amendment Does\n\n       Requires states to have a criminal background check for all \n     school employees.\n       Allows States or local school districts to use federal \n     funding authorized under the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education act to establish, implement, or improve policies \n     and procedures on background checks for school employees, \n     including:\n       Providing states with the flexibility and resources to \n     conduct searches of State and Federal criminal registries, as \n     determined by the State;\n       Empowering states to establish, implement, or improve \n     policies and procedures concerning the timely disclosure, \n     notice, and appeal of background check results;\n       Supporting the development, implementation, or improvement \n     of mechanisms for assisting in the identification of and \n     response to incidents of child abuse, including by providing \n     training and development for school personnel; and\n       Any other activities determined by the State to protect \n     student safety.\n       Adopts the 2014 GAO report recommendation to establish the \n     U.S. Department of Education as the lead agency to inform \n     schools of best practices.\n       Authorizes the U.S. Education Secretary to make reporting \n     of student sexual abuse by school personnel a part of an \n     annual ``Secretary's Report Card.''\n       Protects schools and school districts from being sued if in \n     compliance with State regulations and requirements.\n\n\n                   Reasons to Support this Amendment\n\n       It requires states to have a criminal background check for \n     all school employees, help states and local school districts \n     do them, but does not dictate how they do it.\n       It will support what most states are already doing--\n     According to GAO, 46 States already require background checks \n     of some kind for all public school employees and 42 States \n     have established professional standards or codes of conduct \n     for school personnel.\n       Rather than mandating a one-size-fits-all approach for \n     14,000 local school districts and 100,000 public schools, it \n     will provide states with flexibility to establish, implement, \n     or improve background check policies and procedures that best \n     meet State and local needs.\n       It will support State and local efforts to increase \n     reporting of child abuse, limit the transfer of school \n     personnel implicated in abuse, as well as provide training on \n     how to recognize, respond to, and prevent child abuse in \n     schools.\n       It will protect schools and local school districts from \n     civil litigation resulting from background check decisions \n     that are otherwise in compliance with State regulations and \n     requirements.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis).\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/11/senate-section/article/S1430-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the nomination \nthat will be before the entire Senate next week, the nomination of \nLoretta Lynch to be the Attorney General of the United States of \nAmerica, and to urge all of my Senate colleagues to quickly confirm \nUnited States Attorney Lynch to this position.\n  Loretta Lynch has dedicated much of her life--many years of her \nlife--to public service, serving twice as the United States Attorney \nfor the Eastern District of New York. In this role she earned a \nreputation as a tough but fair prosecutor.\n  I would like to take a few minutes to outline some of Loretta Lynch's \nrecord. As United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, \nshe has kept communities safer by bringing serious, violent criminals \nto justice, prosecuting high-level gang members and drug traffickers. \nU.S. Attorney Lynch has also tirelessly fought public corruption. While \nshe was at the U.S. Attorney's Office, she was the lead prosecutor in \nmunicipal corruption cases on Long Island and supervised the \nprosecution of the New York State Senate majority leader recently.\n  During her time in private practice, Loretta Lynch did pro bono work \nas special counsel to the prosecutor of the International Criminal \nTribunal for Rwanda, further evidencing her commitment to public \nservice and to the enforcement of the law. Hers is a truly impressive \nrecord, and one that without question prepared United States Attorney \nLynch to serve as Attorney General Lynch upon confirmation by the \nSenate.\n  I had the opportunity to meet with Loretta Lynch this past January. \nShe and I discussed how the Department of Justice can do more to give \nlaw enforcement the tools it needs, also to eliminate witness \nintimidation--a major issue in cities such as Philadelphia and others \naround the country. Also, we talked about reforming the juvenile \njustice system, and finally reducing tensions between police, law \nenforcement and the communities they serve.\n  I was very impressed by United States Attorney Lynch. I believe she \nis well suited to address these and many other issues she will confront \nas the Attorney General of the United States. These issues, of course, \nare not only critical to Pennsylvania but also our whole country.\n  I am also confident that Loretta Lynch, when she is confirmed--and I \nbelieve she will be--will continue the important work of Attorney \nGeneral Holder to fairly enforce Federal voting and civil rights laws, \nto support equality for LGBT Americans, to work to reduce the over-\nincarceration of nonviolent offenders, and also to address disparities \nin our criminal justice system.\n  Despite Loretta Lynch's record as a prosecutor, serving twice as the \nUnited States attorney in the State of New York, and despite her record \nand countless expressions of support from law enforcement, from civil \nrights advocates, and past Attorneys General, Loretta Lynch's \nnomination has been pending for 122 days before the Senate. This is the \nlongest it has taken the U.S. Senate to vote on the nominee for \nAttorney General in 30 years.\n  This is especially surprising given that the Senate has already \nconfirmed Loretta Lynch twice. In both 2000 and 2010, the Senate \nconfirmed Loretta Lynch to be the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern \nDistrict of New York, as I mentioned earlier. In each case her \nconfirmation before the Senate was unanimous.\n  Loretta Lynch's nomination we know is historic for many reasons, but \nthe principal reason is she would be the first African-American woman \nto serve as the Nation's Attorney General. However, apart from the \nhistoric nature of her nomination, and I hope confirmation, Loretta \nLynch is supremely qualified for this position for all the reasons I \nstated earlier. They could be summarized in a few words: integrity, \nintellect, and experience. I could add more words to that, but they are \nthe qualities we want in any prosecutor and, of course, they are the \nqualities we want in an Attorney General. I believe we have those \nqualities with Attorney General Holder, and we want to have the \nconfirmation completed for the new Attorney General nominee, Loretta \nLynch.\n  I strongly support Loretta Lynch's nomination, and I am pleased the \nmajority leader has committed to considering her nomination on the \nSenate floor. I call on all of my colleagues to confirm Loretta Lynch \nwithout delay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/11/senate-section/article/S1430-3", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1430-S1432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HUMAN TRAFFICKING\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we live in a country of unparalleled \nopportunity. The blessings of liberty are the birthright of every \nAmerican, and the Framers ordained our Constitution to protect these \nrights. To deny any person these basic freedoms would seem almost \nunthinkable today. So the fact that even as I speak there are thousands \nof individuals living as slaves in our very own country is even more \nunthinkable. But it is undeniably true.\n  In this country, right now, there are thousands of human beings \nliving as slaves, men, women, and children, stolen from their homes, \nstripped of their God-given rights, and robbed of their human dignity. \nThese individuals live\n\n[[Page S1431]]\n\namong us. They live in our neighborhoods and our suburbs, our biggest \ncities and our smallest towns. They live in a world of silence, fear, \nhopelessness, and unspeakable suffering.\n  These individuals of whom I speak are the victims of human \ntrafficking, a heinous and abominable crime that we should call by its \nreal name: modern-day slavery. The State Department estimates that up \nto 17,500 individuals are trafficked to the United States every year. \nThe majority of these are women and children. Some of them are forced \ninto a life of unpaid servitude, many others into sex work. Worldwide, \nthe International Labor Organization estimates that 4.5 million people \nare currently enslaved through sex trafficking. These numbers are \nstaggering, but they illustrate the scope of the problem. The suffering \nof each individual victim should not be lost in a sea of statistics.\n  For victims of human trafficking, the surreal horror of their lives \nbears testimony to the gravity of the crime.\n  Consider the case of Holly Smith. When Holly was just 14 years old, \nshe met a man at a local shopping mall in New Jersey. With all the \ninnocence of youth, Holly confided in this man all the fears and \nanxieties of her adolescence, telling him how nervous she was to begin \nhigh school.\n  Holly could never have guessed that the man she had just met--the man \nshe had just trusted with her deepest feelings--was a human trafficker \ntrained to emotionally manipulate young girls to lure them into \nprostitution. This man promised Holly a life of glamor and excitement \nif she agreed to run away with him.\n  Holly took the bait. She ran away with the man who would later abuse \nher and intimidate her into prostitution. She was one of the many \nvictims of child sex trafficking.\n  Holly eventually escaped this nightmare and even had the courage to \ntell her story at a Judiciary Committee hearing on human trafficking \nlast month, but many are not so lucky. We must do more to help victims \nsuch as Holly. We must do more to combat the evils of human \ntrafficking.\n  As a legislative body, we made significant progress in the year 2000 \nwhen we passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. This legislation \ntook critical steps in providing greater protection to victims and \nlevying heavier penalties against traffickers. We have since \nreauthorized that legislation on four occasions.\n  In each instance, I have been passionately committed in the fight \nagainst human trafficking. My staff has also been equally devoted to \nthis issue, and I was especially proud when President Bush asked my \nformer Judiciary counsel, Grace Chung Becker, to head the very first \nhuman trafficking unit within the Justice Department's Civil Rights \nDivision. It is only fitting that the Justice Department established \nthis unit as a subset of its Civil Rights Division and not its Criminal \nDivision. Human trafficking is more than a mere crime; it is a \nfundamental violation of human rights.\n  It is not my intention to minimize the significance of the \nlegislation we have passed thus far, but we still have so much work to \ndo. We have recognized that human trafficking is a serious problem; now \nwe need a serious solution.\n  I am grateful for Senator Klobuchar's initiative in addressing that \nproblem. Her Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act properly \nidentifies children lured into prostitution as victims, not criminals. \nBy encouraging States to adopt safe harbor laws, we are better equipped \nto help victims receive the care and treatment they deserve.\n  Senator Cornyn's Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act also aids \nthese victims by establishing a special fund that will provide them \nmore of the resources they need to repair their shattered lives. \nSenator Cornyn's bill also imposes severe penalties on traffickers, \nincluding heavier fines that the Justice Department will direct toward \nvictim compensation.\n  I strongly support both of these bills, and I am grateful for my \ncolleagues' enormous efforts in building a coalition to combat this \nscourge.\n  Human trafficking is a complex problem, and solving it requires a \nmulti-front approach. It is a problem of both supply and demand. In \naddition to passing this legislation to address the problem of supply, \nwe must also address the problem of demand.\n  The prevalence of human trafficking is a moral stain on our country, \nand we can never eradicate this evil if we are only addressing part of \nthe problem.\n  Through stricter enforcement of obscenity laws, we can decrease \ndemand for sex trafficking. There is an undeniable link between illegal \nadult obscenity and sex trafficking, and I have long been an outspoken \nvoice on this issue.\n  Laura Lederer, former Senior Advisor on Trafficking in Persons at the \nState Department, observed that there are ``numerous links between sex \ntrafficking and pornography'' and that pornography is even ``used in \nsex trafficking and the sex industry to train women and children what \nto do.''\n  In 2011, I led 41 other Senators in sending a letter to Attorney \nGeneral Eric Holder calling for greater enforcement of Federal \nobscenity laws. In his response, even he agreed that hard-core \npornography is associated with sex trafficking. This type of obscenity \nnot only harms individuals, families, and entire communities, but also \nnormalizes sexual harm to children.\n  How long will we let this culture of perversion persist? How long \nwill we ignore the pressing problem of adult obscenity at the expense \nof the innocent women and children who are too often the victims of \nthis vice?\n  Enough is enough. Ignoring the problem of adult obscenity is ignoring \nthe problem of human trafficking, and ignorance will not free the \ninnocent women and children trapped in the clutches of modern-day \nslavery. The First Amendment does not protect adult obscenity, so the \nFederal Government is acting well within its power to impose greater \nenforcement. I firmly believe a consistent commitment to enforcing \nthese laws will have a significant impact in reducing the prevalence of \nsex trafficking.\n  I want to conclude by discussing this body's handling of this \nimportant bill. In my 39 years as a Member of this body, I have seen \nthe Senate at some of its best moments and at some of its worst \nmoments. Last year I came to the floor repeatedly to warn of how my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle--who were then in the \nmajority--had abused the legislative process for partisan political \ngain.\n  Since the beginning of the 114th Congress this January, we have made \nremarkable progress in restoring the Senate as an institution. By \nrestoring this body's traditions of fulsome debate, an open amendment \nprocess, and regular order through the committee system, our new \nmajority is putting the Senate back to work for the American people. \nWhile the sailing has not always been totally smooth--it rarely is in \nmy experience--the progress we have seen in restoring this institution \nto its proper role as a productive legislative body is real and \nmeaningful.\n  Given this headway, I have been extremely disappointed to see a \nlogjam develop and impede our progress on this vital piece of \nbipartisan legislation, something that should pass this body 100 to 0. \nMy colleagues on the other side of the aisle have threatened a \nfilibuster, claiming that we somehow ambushed them with a controversial \nabortion rider. That claim is absolutely ridiculous. The language they \nare suddenly so upset about has been in the bill the entire time, as \nthose of us on the Judiciary Committee can attest. My colleagues had no \ncomplaints about this language when the bill passed out of the \ncommittee; in fact, it passed unanimously. Moreover, not only was this \nlanguage in the bill from the beginning, but it has also been the law \nof the land for nearly four decades.\n  Democrats in this body have supported countless other bills--\nincluding even ObamaCare--with similar language, knowing that such \nprovisions are important to many people on both sides of the aisle.\n  This policy represents a sensible and appropriate compromise in an \nissue area characterized by conflicting and deeply held views. As such, \nthe notion that this provision should provoke my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle to grind the legislative process to a halt \nboggles the mind. It makes us wonder what in the world is going on \nhere.\n\n[[Page S1432]]\n\n  Even the most charitable interpretation of this move suggests that \nthe minority is once again resorting to outrageous my-way-or-the-\nhighway tactics to impose an extreme pro-abortion policy.\n  More disturbingly, this ploy plainly demonstrates the minority \nleadership's desire to pick a political fight over abortion and to muck \nup the majority's efforts to exercise reliable leadership. By resorting \nto this sort of obstruction, they have demonstrated just how \ndesperately they want to derail our efforts to legislate responsibly \nand instead resort to their tired and discredited war-on-women rhetoric \nto win cheap political points. I am unabashedly pro-life, and I have no \nqualms whatsoever about debating that issue.\n  If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are so desperate to \ndebate that issue and push an extreme plan to overturn the longstanding \ncompromise--that is the law of the land--let us debate such a measure \nat an appropriate time, but not on this bill. To hold this important \nhuman trafficking bill hostage is a deplorable approach.\n  The minority leader earlier came to the floor and tried to manipulate \nmy words to support his shameful gambit. For all of my colleagues who \nare tempted by this irresponsible strategy, let me repeat my previous \npoint.\n  It would be pathetic to hold up this bill. This bill is absolutely \ncritical to families and our children. I cannot believe the Senate has \nbecome so political that my colleagues would raise this issue--this \ntangential, long-settled issue--at this time--after the same \ntransparently clear language passed unanimously out of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  For my colleagues to hold up this bill in an effort to seek to impose \ntheir extreme policy, to overturn the law of the land that has long \nenjoyed bipartisan support, to pick a false fight over abortion, or to \ntry to embarrass the majority is itself embarrassing. They ought to be \nashamed.\n  I urge my colleagues in the minority, in the strongest possible \nterms, to reconsider their position and allow the Senate once again to \ndo the people's business.\n  Look, all of us are fed up with the delays and the problems of not \nlegislating the way we should in the Senate. All of us are fed up with \nsome of the tactics that have been used, but to use them on a bill such \nas this? Come on. This is a bill that will make a real difference, and \nthere should not be one Senator in this body voting against it, and \nthey certainly shouldn't vote against it because there is language in \nthere that is the law of the land today.\n  Yes, many Democrats don't like it. But I don't like them holding up \none of the most important bills for children and families and women \njust so they can make a cheap political point on abortion.\n  I care a great deal for my colleagues on the other side. They have \nspecial concerns just as we have special concerns. They have special \nchallenges just as we have special challenges. But this is one we ought \nall to agree on. Get it out of the Senate, get it going, and start \ndoing more to stop human trafficking in our society today.\n  This is something we ought to all quit playing games with. Just pass \nit, and get it through the Senate and the House.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/11/senate-section/article/S1432-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1432-S1434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT ON THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF BLOODY SUNDAY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

And John Lewis is one of my heroes.\n       Now, I have to imagine that when a younger John Lewis woke \n     up that morning 50 years ago and made his way to Brown \n     Chapel, heroics were not on his mind. A day like this was not \n     on his mind. Young folks with bedrolls and backpacks were \n     milling about. Veterans of the movement trained newcomers in \n     the tactics of non-violence; the right way to protect \n     yourself when attacked. A doctor described what tear gas does \n     to the body, while marchers scribbled down instructions for \n     contacting their loved ones. The air was thick with doubt, \n     anticipation and fear. And they comforted themselves with the \n     final verse of the final hymn they sung:\n       ``No matter what may be the test, God will take care of \n     you; Lean, weary one, upon His breast, God will take care of \n     you.''\n       And then, his knapsack stocked with an apple, a toothbrush, \n     and a book on government--all you need for a night behind \n     bars--John Lewis led them out of the church on a mission to \n     change America.\n       President and Mrs. Bush, Governor Bentley, Mayor Evans, \n     Sewell, Reverend Strong, members of Congress, elected \n     officials, foot soldiers, friends, fellow Americans:\n       As John noted, there are places and moments in America \n     where this nation's destiny has been decided. Many are sites \n     of war--Concord and Lexington, Appomattox, Gettysburg. Others \n     are sites that symbolize the daring of America's character--\n     Independence Hall and Seneca Falls, Kitty Hawk and Cape \n     Canaveral.\n       Selma is such a place. In one afternoon 50 years ago, so \n     much of our turbulent history--the stain of slavery and \n     anguish of civil war; the yoke of segregation and tyranny of \n     Jim Crow; the death of four little girls in Birmingham; and \n     the dream of a Baptist preacher--all that history met on this \n     bridge.\n       It was not a clash of armies, but a clash of wills; a \n     contest to determine the true meaning of America. And because \n     of men and women like John Lewis, Joseph Lowery, Hosea \n     Williams, Amelia Boynton, Diane Nash, Ralph Abernathy, C.T. \n     Vivian, Andrew Young, Fred Shuttlesworth, Dr. Martin Luther \n     King, Jr., and so many others, the idea of a just America and \n     a fair America, an inclusive America, and a generous \n     America--that idea ultimately triumphed.\n       As is true across the landscape of American history, we \n     cannot examine this moment in isolation. The march on Selma \n     was part of a broader campaign that spanned generations; the \n     leaders that day part of a long line of heroes.\n       We gather here to celebrate them. We gather here to honor \n     the courage of ordinary Americans willing to endure billy \n     clubs and the chastening rod; tear gas and the trampling \n     hoof; men and women who despite the gush of blood and \n     splintered bone would stay true to their North Star and keep \n     marching towards justice.\n       They did as Scripture instructed: ``Rejoice in hope, be \n     patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer.'' And in the \n     days to come, they went back again and again. When the \n     trumpet call sounded for more to join, the people came--black \n     and white, young and old, Christian and Jew, waving the \n     American flag and singing the same anthems full of faith and \n     hope. A white newsman, Bill Plante, who covered the marches \n     then and who is with us here today, quipped that the growing \n     number of white people lowered the quality of the singing. To \n     those who marched, though, those old gospel songs must have \n     never sounded so sweet.\n       In time, their chorus would well up and reach President \n     Johnson. And he would send them protection, and speak to the \n     nation, echoing their call for America and the world to hear: \n     ``We shall overcome.'' What enormous faith these men and \n     women had. Faith in God, but also faith in America.\n       The Americans who crossed this bridge, they were not \n     physically imposing. But they gave courage to millions. They \n     held no elected office. But they led a nation. They marched \n     as Americans who had endured hundreds of years of brutal \n     violence, countless daily indignities--but they didn't seek \n     special treatment, just the equal treatment promised to them \n     almost a century before.\n       What they did here will reverberate through the ages. Not \n     because the change they won was preordained; not because \n     their victory was complete; but because they proved that \n     nonviolent change is possible, that love and hope can conquer \n     hate.\n       As we commemorate their achievement, we are well-served to \n     remember that at the time of the marches, many in power \n     condemned rather than praised them. Back then, they were \n     called Communists, or half-breeds, or outside agitators, \n     sexual and moral degenerates, and worse--they were called \n     everything but the name their parents gave them. Their faith \n     was questioned. Their lives were threatened. Their patriotism \n     challenged.\n       And yet, what could be more American than what happened in \n     this place? What could more profoundly vindicate the idea of \n     America than plain and humble people--unsung, the \n     downtrodden, the dreamers not of high station, not born to \n     wealth or privilege, not of one religious tradition but many, \n     coming together to shape their country's course?\n\n[[Page S1433]]\n\n       What greater expression of faith in the American experiment \n     than this, what greater form of patriotism is there than the \n     belief that America is not yet finished, that we are strong \n     enough to be self-critical, that each successive generation \n     can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is in our \n     power to remake this nation to more closely align with our \n     highest ideals?\n       That's why Selma is not some outlier in the American \n     experience. That's why it's not a museum or a static monument \n     to behold from a distance. It is instead the manifestation of \n     a creed written into our founding documents: ``We the People \n     . . . in order to form a more perfect union.'' ``We hold \n     these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created \n     equal.''\n        These are not just words. They're a living thing, a call \n     to action, a roadmap for citizenship and an insistence in the \n     capacity of free men and women to shape our own destiny. For \n     founders like Franklin and Jefferson, for leaders like \n     Lincoln and FDR, the success of our experiment in self-\n     government rested on engaging all of our citizens in this \n     work. And that's what we celebrate here in Selma. That's what \n     this movement was all about, one leg in our long journey \n     toward freedom.\n        The American instinct that led these young men and women \n     to pick up the torch and cross this bridge, that's the same \n     instinct that moved patriots to choose revolution over \n     tyranny. It's the same instinct that drew immigrants from \n     across oceans and the Rio Grande; the same instinct that led \n     women to reach for the ballot, workers to organize against an \n     unjust status quo; the same instinct that led us to plant a \n     flag at Iwo Jima and on the surface of the Moon.\n       It's the idea held by generations of citizens who believed \n     that America is a constant work in progress; who believed \n     that loving this country requires more than singing its \n     praises or avoiding uncomfortable truths. It requires the \n     occasional disruption, the willingness to speak out for what \n     is right, to shake up the status quo. That's America.\n       That's what makes us unique. That's what cements our \n     reputation as a beacon of opportunity. Young people behind \n     the Iron Curtain would see Selma and eventually tear down \n     that wall. Young people in Soweto would hear Bobby Kennedy \n     talk about ripples of hope and eventually banish the scourge \n     of apartheid. Young people in Burma went to prison rather \n     than submit to military rule. They saw what John Lewis had \n     done. From the streets of Tunis to the Maidan in Ukraine, \n     this generation of young people can draw strength from this \n     place, where the powerless could change the world's greatest \n     power and push their leaders to expand the boundaries of \n     freedom.\n       They saw that idea made real right here in Selma, Alabama. \n     They saw that idea manifest itself here in America.\n       Because of campaigns like this, a Voting Rights Act was \n     passed. Political and economic and social barriers came down. \n     And the change these men and women wrought is visible here \n     today in the presence of African Americans who run \n     boardrooms, who sit on the bench, who serve in elected office \n     from small towns to big cities; from the Congressional Black \n     Caucus all the way to the Oval Office.\n       Because of what they did, the doors of opportunity swung \n     open not just for black folks, but for every American. Women \n     marched through those doors. Latinos marched through those \n     doors. Asian Americans, gay Americans, Americans with \n     disabilities--they all came through those doors. Their \n     endeavors gave the entire South the chance to rise again, not \n     by reasserting the past, but by transcending the past.\n       What a glorious thing, Dr. King might say. And what a \n     solemn debt we owe. Which leads us to ask, just how might we \n     repay that debt?\n       First and foremost, we have to recognize that one day's \n     commemoration, no matter how special, is not enough. If Selma \n     taught us anything, it's that our work is never done. The \n     American experiment in self-government gives work and purpose \n     to each generation.\n       Selma teaches us, as well, that action requires that we \n     shed our cynicism. For when it comes to the pursuit of \n     justice, we can afford neither complacency nor despair.\n       Just this week, I was asked whether I thought the \n     Department of Justice's Ferguson report shows that, with \n     respect to race, little has changed in this country. And I \n     understood the question; the report's narrative was sadly \n     familiar. It evoked the kind of abuse and disregard for \n     citizens that spawned the Civil Rights Movement. But I \n     rejected the notion that nothing's changed. What happened in \n     Ferguson may not be unique, but it's no longer endemic. It's \n     no longer sanctioned by law or by custom. And before the \n     Civil Rights Movement, it most surely was.\n       We do a disservice to the cause of justice by intimating \n     that bias and discrimination are immutable, that racial \n     division is inherent to America. If you think nothing's \n     changed in the past 50 years, ask somebody who lived through \n     the Selma or Chicago or Los Angeles of the 1950s. Ask the \n     female CEO who once might have been assigned to the \n     secretarial pool if nothing's changed. Ask your gay friend if \n     it's easier to be out and proud in America now than it was \n     thirty years ago. To deny this progress, this hard-won \n     progress--our progress--would be to rob us of our own agency, \n     our own capacity, our responsibility to do what we can to \n     make America better.\n       Of course, a more common mistake is to suggest that \n     Ferguson is an isolated incident; that racism is banished; \n     that the work that drew men and women to Selma is now \n     complete, and that whatever racial tensions remain are a \n     consequence of those seeking to play the ``race card'' for \n     their own purposes. We don't need the Ferguson report to know \n     that's not true. We just need to open our eyes, and our ears, \n     and our hearts to know that this nation's racial history \n     still casts its long shadow upon us.\n       We know the march is not yet over. We know the race is not \n     yet won. We know that reaching that blessed destination where \n     we are judged, all of us, by the content of our character \n     requires admitting as much, facing up to the truth. ``We are \n     capable of bearing a great burden,'' James Baldwin once \n     wrote, ``once we discover that the burden is reality and \n     arrive where reality is.''\n       There's nothing America can't handle if we actually look \n     squarely at the problem. And this is work for all Americans, \n     not just some. Not just whites. Not just blacks. If we want \n     to honor the courage of those who marched that day, then all \n     of us are called to possess their moral imagination. All of \n     us will need to feel as they did the fierce urgency of now. \n     All of us need to recognize as they did that change depends \n     on our actions, on our attitudes, the things we teach our \n     children. And if we make such an effort, no matter how hard \n     it may sometimes seem, laws can be passed, and consciences \n     can be stirred, and consensus can be built.\n       With such an effort, we can make sure our criminal justice \n     system serves all and not just some. Together, we can raise \n     the level of mutual trust that policing is built on--the idea \n     that police officers are members of the community they risk \n     their lives to protect, and citizens in Ferguson and New York \n     and Cleveland, they just want the same thing young people \n     here marched for 50 years ago--the protection of the law. \n     Together, we can address unfair sentencing and overcrowded \n     prisons, and the stunted circumstances that rob too many boys \n     of the chance to become men, and rob the nation of too many \n     men who could be good dads, and good workers, and good \n     neighbors.\n       With effort, we can roll back poverty and the roadblocks to \n     opportunity. Americans don't accept a free ride for anybody, \n     nor do we believe in equality of outcomes. But we do expect \n     equal opportunity. And if we really mean it, if we're not \n     just giving lip service to it, but if we really mean it and \n     are willing to sacrifice for it, then, yes, we can make sure \n     every child gets an education suitable to this new \n     century, one that expands imaginations and lifts sights \n     and gives those children the skills they need. We can make \n     sure every person willing to work has the dignity of a \n     job, and a fair wage, and a real voice, and sturdier rungs \n     on that ladder into the middle class.\n       And with effort, we can protect the foundation stone of our \n     democracy for which so many marched across this bridge--and \n     that is the right to vote. Right now, in 2015, 50 years after \n     Selma, there are laws across this country designed to make it \n     harder for people to vote. As we speak, more of such laws are \n     being proposed. Meanwhile, the Voting Rights Act, the \n     culmination of so much blood, so much sweat and tears, the \n     product of so much sacrifice in the face of wanton violence, \n     the Voting Rights Act stands weakened, its future subject to \n     political rancor.\n       How can that be? The Voting Rights Act was one of the \n     crowning achievements of our democracy, the result of \n     Republican and Democratic efforts. President Reagan signed \n     its renewal when he was in office. President George W. Bush \n     signed its renewal when he was in office. One hundred members \n     of Congress have come here today to honor people who were \n     willing to die for the right to protect it. If we want to \n     honor this day, let that hundred go back to Washington and \n     gather four hundred more, and together, pledge to make it \n     their mission to restore that law this year. That's how we \n     honor those on this bridge.\n       Of course, our democracy is not the task of Congress alone, \n     or the courts alone, or even the President alone. If every \n     new voter-suppression law was struck down today, we would \n     still have, here in America, one of the lowest voting rates \n     among free peoples. Fifty years ago, registering to vote here \n     in Selma and much of the South meant guessing the number of \n     jellybeans in a jar, the number of bubbles on a bar of soap. \n     It meant risking your dignity, and sometimes, your life.\n       What's our excuse today for not voting? How do we so \n     casually discard the right for which so many fought? How do \n     we so fully give away our power, our voice, in shaping \n     America's future? Why are we pointing to somebody else when \n     we could take the time just to go to the polling places? We \n     give away our power.\n       Fellow marchers, so much has changed in 50 years. We have \n     endured war and we've fashioned peace. We've seen \n     technological wonders that touch every aspect of our lives. \n     We take for granted conveniences that our parents could have \n     scarcely imagined. But what has not changed is the imperative \n     of citizenship; that willingness of a 26-year-old deacon, or \n     a Unitarian minister, or a young mother of five to decide \n     they loved this country so much that they'd risk everything \n     to realize its promise.\n       That's what it means to love America. That's what it means \n     to believe in America. That's what it means when we say \n     America is exceptional.\n       For we were born of change. We broke the old aristocracies, \n     declaring ourselves entitled not by bloodline, but endowed by \n     our\n\n[[Page S1434]]\n\n     Creator with certain inalienable rights. We secure our rights \n     and responsibilities through a system of self-government, of \n     and by and for the people. That's why we argue and fight with \n     so much passion and conviction--because we know our efforts \n     matter. We know America is what we make of it.\n       Look at our history. We are Lewis and Clark and Sacajawea, \n     pioneers who braved the unfamiliar, followed by a stampede of \n     farmers and miners, and entrepreneurs and hucksters. That's \n     our spirit. That's who we are.\n       We are Sojourner Truth and Fannie Lou Hamer, women who \n     could do as much as any man and then some. And we're Susan B. \n     Anthony, who shook the system until the law reflected that \n     truth. That is our character.\n       We're the immigrants who stowed away on ships to reach \n     these shores, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free--\n     Holocaust survivors, Soviet defectors, the Lost Boys of \n     Sudan. We're the hopeful strivers who cross the Rio Grande \n     because we want our kids to know a better life. That's how we \n     came to be.\n       We're the slaves who built the White House and the economy \n     of the South. We're the ranch hands and cowboys who opened up \n     the West, and countless laborers who laid rail, and raised \n     skyscrapers, and organized for workers' rights.\n       We're the fresh-faced GIs who fought to liberate a \n     continent. And we're the Tuskeegee Airmen, and the Navajo \n     code-talkers, and the Japanese Americans who fought for this \n     country even as their own liberty had been denied.\n       We're the firefighters who rushed into those buildings on \n     9/11, the volunteers who signed up to fight in Afghanistan \n     and Iraq. We're the gay Americans whose blood ran in the \n     streets of San Francisco and New York, just as blood ran down \n     this bridge.\n       We are storytellers, writers, poets, artists who abhor \n     unfairness, and despise hypocrisy, and give voice to the \n     voiceless, and tell truths that need to be told.\n       We're the inventors of gospel and jazz and blues, bluegrass \n     and country, and hip-hop and rock and roll, and our very own \n     sound with all the sweet sorrow and reckless joy of freedom.\n       We are Jackie Robinson, enduring scorn and spiked cleats \n     and pitches coming straight to his head, and stealing home in \n     the World Series anyway.\n       We are the people Langston Hughes wrote of who ``build our \n     temples for tomorrow, strong as we know how.'' We are the \n     people Emerson wrote of, ``who for truth and honor's sake \n     stand fast and suffer long;'' who are ``never tired, so long \n     as we can see far enough.''\n       That's what America is. Not stock photos or airbrushed \n     history, or feeble attempts to define some of us as more \n     American than others. We respect the past, but we don't pine \n     for the past. We don't fear the future; we grab for it. \n     America is not some fragile thing. We are large, in the words \n     of Whitman, containing multitudes. We are boisterous and \n     diverse and full of energy, perpetually young in spirit. \n     That's why someone like John Lewis at the ripe old age of 25 \n     could lead a mighty march.\n       And that's what the young people here today and listening \n     all across the country must take away from this day. You are \n     America. Unconstrained by habit and convention. Unencumbered \n     by what is, because you're ready to seize what ought to be.\n       For everywhere in this country, there are first steps to be \n     taken, there's new ground to cover, there are more bridges to \n     be crossed. And it is you, the young and fearless at heart, \n     the most diverse and educated generation in our history, who \n     the nation is waiting to follow.\n       Because Selma shows us that America is not the project of \n     any one person. Because the single-most powerful word in our \n     democracy is the word ``We.'' ``We The People.'' ``We Shall \n     Overcome.'' ``Yes We Can.'' That word is owned by no one. It \n     belongs to everyone. Oh, what a glorious task we are given, \n     to continually try to improve this great nation of ours.\n       Fifty years from Bloody Sunday, our march is not yet \n     finished, but we're getting closer. Two hundred and thirty-\n     nine years after this nation's founding our union is not yet \n     perfect, but we are getting closer. Our job's easier because \n     somebody already got us through that first mile. Somebody \n     already got us over that bridge. When it feels the road is \n     too hard, when the torch we've been passed feels too heavy, \n     we will remember these early travelers, and draw strength \n     from their example, and hold firmly the words of the prophet \n     Isaiah: ``Those who hope in the Lord will renew their \n     strength. They will soar on [the] wings like eagles. They \n     will run and not grow weary. They will walk and not be \n     faint.''\n       We honor those who walked so we could run. We must run so \n     our children soar. And we will not grow weary. For we believe \n     in the power of an awesome God, and we believe in this \n     country's sacred promise.\n       May He bless those warriors of justice no longer with us, \n     and bless the United States of America. Thank you, everybody.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/11/senate-section/article/S1434-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1434-S1435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRAIN DERAILMENT IN GALENA, ILLINOIS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, hundreds of firefighters are in town this \nweek to talk about legislative issues. I was honored to speak at the \nInternational Association of Fire Fighters conference and meet with \nfirefighters from Illinois on Monday to thank them for keeping us safe.\n  Their visit is particularly timely given a couple of serious train \naccidents in the past few days. One accident, a derailment, happened in \nGalena, IL, last Thursday. Twenty-one cars carrying Bakken crude oil \nfrom North Dakota derailed there and five of them caught fire. \nFortunately, the accident happened 2 miles outside the city, so no one \nwas killed or injured. It was a potentially deadly accident, though, \nand we are very lucky no one was hurt. The fire burned for days.\n  Brave men and women from the Galena Fire Department were the first on \nthe scene. Like many fire departments throughout the U.S., the Galena \nFire Department is an entirely volunteer force. The area where the \ncrash occurred is in a wetland where the Galena River meets the \nMississippi. The first responders had to use a bike path to get to the \ncrash site. I want to thank Galena Fire Chief Randy Beadle for his \nleadership in tackling this disaster. Galena Assistant Fire Chief Bob \nConley also helped coordinate the first response. While most people \nwould run away from something like this, firefighters run toward the \nflames. We owe a debt of gratitude to them.\n  I spoke with Galena Mayor Terry Renner the evening of the crash. I \nlet him know I was ready to help in any way I could. Others on the \nground whose efforts were critical to the local response include: \nGalena City Administrator Mark Moran, Jo Daviess County Board Chairman \nRon Smith, County Administrator Dan Reimer, County Sheriff Kevin \nTurner, and County Emergency Management Agency Director Chuck Pedersen.\n  First responders were not sure if the oil from the derailed train \ncars might make its way to the Mississippi River--just half a mile \naway. To be on the safe side, BNSF erected a berm in the river to catch \nany runoff, either from the train cars themselves or from runoff from \nfirefighters' hoses. Now the cleanup really begins. The EPA will vacuum \nup the spilled oil from the ground and test the soil below for \ncontamination. Even if the oil did not reach the Mississippi, this was \ntoo close a call.\n  These types of accidents are happening more frequently and the \npotential for catastrophe is great. This is not the first time Illinois \nhas seen such a derailment. In 2009, one person was killed in Cherry \nValley; and in 2011, 800 residents of Tiskilway were evacuated after a \nmassive explosion. The National Transportation Safety Board found the \nweakness of these cars added to the severity of both explosions.\n  Recently we have seen these dangerous derailments across the country \nand in Canada. It happened in West Virginia last month, and another yet \nthis weekend in Ontario, Canada. Of course, the most severe incident \noccurred in Quebec in 2013, when a train carrying crude oil derailed \nand exploded, killing 47 people.\n  I urge the administration to act swiftly to finalize rules that \nincrease safety standards for the train cars. We need to ensure these \ncars have the strongest safety measures and that the old tank cars are \ntaken off the track. Booming oil production in the Bakken region has \ncaused an exponential increase in crude oil shipments in recent years. \nLast year, railroads carried almost 650,000 carloads of oil. In 2008 \nthey carried just 9,500 carloads. Not only are the quantities greater, \nbut some of this crude oil is believed to be more volatile. More \ntraffic and more volatile crude means more disasters. Improving freight \nrail safety is more critical than ever before.\n  We feel this impact in Illinois, where we have the second most \nrailroad track in the country. Approximately 25 percent of all U.S. \nrail traffic passes through densely populated Chicago.\n  We are lucky that the fiery train derailment in Galena was not closer \nto homes, businesses, and schools. Trains just like the one that \ncrashed travel through cities and suburbs on a daily basis. If a wreck \nlike this one happens closer to a developed area, we might see \nthousands of people evacuated--not to mention the potential for \ninjuries or fatalities. It is not a risk we should be willing to take.\n\n[[Page S1435]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/11/senate-section/article/S1435-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n     CONGRATULATING A.B.

Combs \nLeadership Magnet Elementary School prides themselves on their \nleadership model program, which is based on Dr. Steven Covey's book \n``The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.'' It seeks to educate the \nwhole child, not just academically but socially, emotionally, and \nculturally.\n  A.B. Combs has set the standard for magnet schools. Annually, they \nhost an international leadership day, where educators from around the \nworld come to learn from their success. Magnet schools such as A.B. \nCombs provide parents with expanded options for their child's \neducation--options that will ensure students aren't confined to schools \nthat might not be serving their individual needs.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a copy of my remarks at the Hoover Institution.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Moynihan Report\n\n       I first met Pat Moynihan four years after he released his \n     explosive report on the circumstances of African-American \n     families in the middle of the civil rights era. I was 28 \n     years old then, and by a stroke of providence, had found \n     myself sitting at a desk in the West Wing of the White House \n     next to Bryce Harlow, President Nixon's first senior staff \n     appointment. My job was answering Mr. Harlow's mail, \n     returning his phone calls, and absorbing his wisdom. It was a \n     perfect PhD in politics and government for a young man.\n       Downstairs were two real PhD's. At one end of the Hall, \n     Gen. Alexander Haig performed the same sort of services for \n     Henry Kissinger. At the other end was Professor Daniel \n     Patrick Moynihan. By another stroke of Providence, President \n     Nixon had attracted these Harvard professors to the West Wing \n     where they joined one of the most talented and intellectually \n     diverse teams of White House advisers of any first term \n     President of the United States.\n       I have always thought, by the way, that if the president \n     had paid more attention to his wiser, more broad gauged \n     advisors in the White House--Harlow, Arthur Burns, Kissinger, \n     Moynihan, and cabinet officials George Schultz and Mel \n     Laird--instead of the advance men who guarded access to the \n     Oval Office that there never would have been a Watergate \n     affair.\n       The White House then was brimming with talent. Jim Keogh, \n     the former editor of TIME, shepherded a quartet of young \n     speechwriters: Bill Safire, Pat Buchanan, Lee Heubner, Ray \n     Price. Liddy Hanford--now Elizabeth Dole--worked in the \n     consumer affairs office.\n       And Pat himself brought with him from Harvard four of his \n     brightest students: Checker Finn, later the nation's foremost \n     education gadfly; the Rhodes Scholar John Price; Chris \n     DeMuth, later head of American Enterprise Institute; and Dick \n     Blumenthal, now my colleague in the United States Senate.\n       Steve Hess, Pat's Deputy in 1969, has detailed in his new \n     book, ``The Professor and the President'', how fascinated \n     Nixon was with Moynihan who ``advised the President on what \n     books to read, to whom he should award the Presidential Medal \n     of Freedom and how not to redecorate the Oval Office.'' \n     Moynihan persuaded Nixon to recommend the Family Assistance \n     Plan, a negative income tax that was the forerunner of \n     today's Earned Income Tax Credit.\n       Looking back 50 years, that the author of such a \n     controversial report could have been hired at all by a \n     president of the United States and then that later this \n     author could have been elected to the U.S. Senate three times \n     from New York suggests the wiliness and courage of this \n     professor with the cheerful soul of an Irish immigrant. Let's \n     just say Pat followed the advice of his favorite character, \n     Tammany Hall boss George Washington Plunkitt, ``I seen my \n     opportunities, and I took 'em.''\n       Today, 50 years after it was written, the trend Moynihan \n     was detailing--the rise of households led by single mothers--\n     has grown more dramatic and cuts across all racial groups. \n     Today more than four in 10 children in the U.S. are born \n     outside of marriage.\n       In 2013, the average income for households with married \n     couples was more than double that of households led by women \n     with no spouse present.\n       Today's panelists will discuss the implications of the \n     Moynihan Report released 50 years ago as well as the proper \n     policy responses. In my remarks, I will be less ambitious. I \n     will focus on what this trend means for the school--the most \n     important secular institution designed to help children reach \n     our country's goal for them--that every child, as much as \n     possible, have the opportunity to begin at the same starting \n     line.\n       And in case you want to step out for coffee at this point, \n     I can jump straight to my conclusion: the school can't come \n     close to doing it all. And neither can the government. If we \n     want our children to be at the same starting line, there must \n     be a revival of interest in these children and their parents \n     from traditional sources: the religious institutions, \n     families, and communities.\n       To begin with, what is a school supposed to do anyway? \n     Professor James Coleman is often quoted as having said that \n     the purpose of the school is to help parents do what parents \n     don't do as well. So what have our schools traditionally done \n     that parents did not do as well?\n       In 1988, I attended a conference in Rochester at which the \n     president of Notre Dame asked, ``What is the rationale for a \n     public school?''--schools which 90 percent of our children \n     attend. Albert Shanker offered this answer: ``A public school \n     is for the purpose of teaching immigrant children reading, \n     writing and arithmetic and what it means to be an American \n     with the hope they'll go home and teach their parents.''\n       But obviously in today's world, Shanker's vision of the \n     school does not come close to doing all the things that many \n     parents are not able to do for their children. In a \n     Washington Post story earlier this year, Sonya Romero-Smith, \n     a veteran teacher at Lew Wallace Elementary School in \n     Albuquerque, said this: ``When they first come in my door in \n     the morning, the first thing I do is an inventory of \n     immediate needs: Did you eat? Are you clean? A big part of my \n     job is making them feel safe.''\n       The article was reporting that, for the first time in at \n     least 50 years, more than half of public school students are \n     eligible for the federal program that provides free or \n     reduced-price school lunches. That means that their family's \n     income is less than 185 percent of the federal poverty line, \n     or below about $44,000 for a family of four. Many of them, of \n     course, are far poorer than that.\n       Romero-Smith said she helps her students clean up with \n     bathroom wipes and toothbrushes, and stocks a drawer with \n     clean socks, underwear, pants and shoes. The job of teacher \n     has expanded to ``counselor, therapist, doctor, parent, \n     attorney,'' she said.\n       If parents are unable to meet the needs of these children, \n     should the school try to meet those needs? If the school does \n     not, who does?\n       Part of understanding the answer to that question may come \n     from a study last year that was not unlike the Moynihan \n     report in that the news it delivered was uncomfortable but \n     important. This study came from the Equality of Opportunity \n     Project, made up of economists from Harvard and Berkeley, who \n     looked at intergenerational mobility across areas of the \n     U.S.--how likely a child from a low-income family is to make \n     more money as an adult than their parents did.\n       The researchers determined that we are, in fact, a \n     collection of societies--some of us live in ```lands of \n     opportunity' with high rates of [upward] mobility across \n     generations,'' and others in places where few children raised \n     in low-income homes escape poverty.\n       The researchers looked at the anonymous tax records of \n     millions of Americans born between 1980 and 1982, measuring \n     their income in 2011-2012, when they were roughly 30 years \n     old. They found five key variables that seemed to explain why \n     some places had more upward mobility than others:\n       The first was segregation: Areas that are more \n     residentially segregated by race and income have lower levels \n     of upward mobility. The second was income inequality. The \n     third was the quality of the K-12 school system, as measured \n     by factors like test scores and dropout rates. The fourth was \n     social capital--rates of civic and religious involvement.\n       The fifth was the strongest correlation--they found that \n     the strongest predictor of upward mobility is family \n     structure, such as the fraction of single parents in the \n     area. ``Parents'' marital status does not matter purely \n     through its effects at the individual level. Children of \n     married parents also have higher rates of upward mobility if \n     they live in communities with fewer single parents,'' the \n     researchers write. Put another way, if our goal is to help \n     every child begin at the same starting line, many children \n     raised in single parent families have a harder time getting \n     there.\n       The Equality of Opportunity Project also did a second \n     study. This one found that economic mobility has not changed \n     much over time and is lower in the U.S. than in most \n     developed countries.\n       They write: ``For example, the probability that a child \n     reaches the top fifth of the income distribution given \n     parents in the bottom fifth of the income distribution is \n     8.4%\n\n[[Page S1436]]\n\n     for children born in 1971, compared with 9.0% for those born \n     in 1986.'' In other words, your chances of moving up the \n     economic ladder depend a lot upon who your parents are, how \n     much money they make--and whether or not they're married.\n       These are not easy conclusions to reach or easy discussions \n     to have.\n       But the evidence of these long odds is strong enough that \n     our 100,000 public schools--as well as our private schools--\n     should do all they reasonably can to help today's American \n     children--and their parents--to succeed.\n       School policies can help low-income, single-parent families \n     get their children to the same starting line as children from \n     better off families.\n       Here are 8 ideas:\n       1. More parental choice of schools: The most obvious and \n     important step the federal government can take to improve the \n     education of children is to give their parents a choice of \n     schools.\n       First, we know that one of the best ways to lift a child \n     out of poverty is to give them a good education.\n       Second, we know that many low-income parents are seeking \n     these opportunities for their children and will work to get \n     their children into better schools if they are able.\n       A single mom who is busy working two jobs may have a harder \n     time getting to a parent-teacher conference, but we see in \n     the D.C. voucher program and elsewhere that some of the \n     fiercest advocates for school choice are single parents of \n     children enrolled in the program.\n       Researchers at the American Enterprise Institute conducted \n     a series of focus-group sessions and personal interviews with \n     low-income urban families enrolled in the D.C. voucher \n     program. They found that ``parents report that they want to \n     be respected as advocates of their child's education and will \n     fight hard to keep their child's private-school choice \n     program if that program's future is threatened.''\n       A 2007 study published in Education Next found that \n     ``parents in high-poverty schools strongly value a teacher's \n     ability to raise student achievement and appear indifferent \n     to student satisfaction.'' It was parents in schools serving \n     better-off families who seemed to place less weight on \n     academics when requesting a particular teacher for their \n     child.\n       2. More charter schools: One promising way to provide more \n     low-income parents with school choice is by creating more \n     charter schools. In fact, one of the most exciting \n     developments in American education in the past two decades \n     has been the emergence of a growing number of charter schools \n     that have demonstrated remarkable success educating \n     disadvantaged children. The success of these schools is \n     attributable to many factors, from close attention to student \n     behavior and discipline to the flexibility their leaders have \n     to put together an excellent teaching staff. But one thing \n     that many of them have in common is that they have expanded \n     the amount of time students spend in school, usually with \n     longer school days.\n       Low-income parents, many of them single-parents, are \n     rushing to enroll their children in these schools. I suspect \n     that one reason is school schedules that make it easier for \n     parents to make ends meet while knowing that their children \n     are well cared for.\n       3. Different school schedules: It shouldn't be just \n     charters that experiment with different schedules. School \n     schedules that follow traditional work schedules--year-round, \n     7 am to 6 pm--would make it easier for parents to keep full-\n     time jobs and still have the ability to be there with their \n     child before and after school to make sure they've had \n     breakfast in the morning, or make sure they've done their \n     homework in the evening.\n       4. Flexible workplace schedules: I intend to try putting in \n     statute authorization for employers to negotiate schedule and \n     overtime with employees, so they know they have the full \n     support of federal law in enabling employees to find \n     arrangements that suit their needs. This would help working \n     parents have the flexibility to attend parent-teacher \n     conferences.\n       5. Work-site day care: Years ago in my private life, I \n     helped start a company with Bob Keeshan of Captain Kangaroo, \n     and my wife and a couple of others that later merged with \n     Bright Horizons and became the largest work-site daycare \n     provider in the country. We recognized that the number of \n     mothers of young children working outside the home had \n     created a need, and we helped corporations provide worksite \n     daycare centers that were safe and good for those moms and \n     dads as well.\n       6. Work-site schools: A few dozen large U.S. corporations \n     have partnered with their local school districts to open \n     public schools in their corporate facilities. It's a similar \n     idea to work-site day care--it provides working parents with \n     choice, as well as makes it easier for them to be involved \n     with their children's care and education.\n       Federal policy ought to enable and at least not discourage \n     states and local school districts and businesses from these \n     kinds of arrangements. Policymakers can support states and \n     school districts to take these steps to enable low-income \n     families to get their children the education they deserve.\n       7. Better Teaching, Better schools: Over the long run, \n     improving schools so that they serve students well regardless \n     of their circumstances may have a direct effect on the \n     challenges of single parenthood.\n       For example, the Harvard economist Raj Chetty has done \n     studies showing that a good teacher improves earnings and, \n     for girls, reduces teenage pregnancy. A study at Promise \n     Academy in the Harlem Children's Zone found that girls \n     attending that school, a high-performing charter school, were \n     12.1 percentage points less likely to have a child as a \n     teenager.\n       Results like these show how great teachers and schools can \n     put their students on track to college and, eventually, the \n     kinds of jobs that enable them to move out of the cycle of \n     poverty.\n       8. Wraparound services: Professor Coleman's suggestion was \n     that if parents don't do it, schools should--in which case we \n     should look at a whole range of services schools ought to be \n     providing. This takes us far afield from the traditional role \n     of the school described by Albert Shanker.\n       There are today many social programs that are not school-\n     based--many funded by the federal government, other by the \n     states--that are designed to support families that need help.\n       For example, welfare programs, child-care vouchers, Earned-\n     Income Tax Credit, the housing allowance. The total amount \n     spent by the federal government on these kinds of safety net \n     programs was $398 billion in 2013, or about 12 percent of the \n     total federal budget.\n       Some suggest that these services should be ``wrapped \n     around'' the school--that the school should become the \n     dominant institution through which children whose families \n     are unable to provide basic supports receive them. I am not \n     so sure. There is a limit to what the school can do and, for \n     that matter, what the government can do.\n       If the challenges single parents face are so great, at the \n     very least the government can make sure it ``does no harm'' \n     and does nothing to discourage marriage. Yet there is strong \n     evidence that that is precisely what the government does.\n       In testimony before the Senate Budget Committee last year, \n     Robert Doar of American Enterprise Institute said that our \n     ``policies aimed at assisting low- and moderate-income \n     households with children often penalize marriage.\n       Doar said that ``A single parent with two children who \n     earns $15,000 enjoys an [Earned Income Tax Credit] benefit of \n     about $4100. The credit decreases by 21.06 cents for every \n     dollar a married couple earns above $15040. . . . [I]f the \n     single parent marries someone earning $10,000, for a combined \n     income of $25,000, [the tax credit] benefit will drop to \n     about $2,200. The couple faces a marriage tax penalty of . . \n     . $1,900.''\n       He continued: ``Similar penalties are embedded in Medicaid, \n     Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), food stamps, \n     housing assistance, and child care--all of which apply to \n     low-and moderate-income Americans. Efforts to mitigate \n     marriage penalties have largely taken the form of tax cuts \n     directed toward married couples. But . . . 81 percent of that \n     relief flowed to couples earning above $75,000.''\n       Doar suggests that a ``host of reforms could alleviate this \n     burden'' including: ``implementing a maximum marginal tax \n     rate for low-income families would tamp marriage-induced \n     hikes in rates. Providing a subsidy on individual earnings--\n     not combined earnings (like the EITC)--would enable a low-\n     wage American to marry someone with a child, but do so \n     without sacrificing significant income or transfer payments. \n     And mandatory individual filing, as done in Canada, \n     Australia, Italy and Japan, would either require or allow \n     low-income individuals to avoid income tax penalties.''\n       Perhaps the wisest advice comes from AEI fellow W. Bradford \n     Wilcox, who says this: ``Government's role when it comes to \n     strengthening marriage and family life is necessarily \n     limited. Any successful twenty-first century effort to renew \n     the fortunes of marriage in America will depend more on civic \n     institutions, businesses, and ordinary Americans than upon \n     federal and state efforts to strengthen family life.''\n       What would Pat Moynihan say today?\n       Well, surely it would be creative, entertaining, insightful \n     and probably controversial. And since those on today's panels \n     are among those who knew him best and know this subject the \n     best, we'll let them answer that question.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/11/senate-section/article/S1436-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1436-S1437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR.

He then served his country as a commissioned officer and civilian \nexecutive in the U.S. Air Force for almost 10 years and was named the \n1978 Air Force Audit Agency Outstanding Civilian Auditor of the Year. \nIn 1979, he received his master's degree in business administration \nfrom Old Dominion University and later his Ph.D. in higher education \nadministration from Kent State University. His commitment to leadership \nwas recognized in the form of the 2001 Distinguished Alumni Award from \nOld Dominion University and the 2011 Alumni Leadership Award for the \nCollege of Education, Health and Human Services Annual Hall of Fame \nAwards from Kent State University.\n  As president at Southeast Missouri State University, academic \nprograms have flourished and expanded, including the establishment of \nthe College of Science, Technology, and Agriculture and the Earl and \nMargie Holland School of Visual and Performing Arts. In addition, Dr. \nDobbins increased access to higher education in the university's 25-\ncounty service region through the development of new regional campuses \nin Sikeston and Kennett to serve place-bound students in rural \ncommunities. More than $400 million in capital construction and \nbuilding improvement projects have enhanced the university during Dr. \nDobbins' presidency.\n  Dr. Dobbins' knowledge and leadership have been valued by his peers \nin higher education.

Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate a \ncentury of the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, AGFC. Enjoying our \nwildlife and outdoors is a way of life for residents of the Natural \nState, and the efforts of AGFC help preserve this time-honored \ntradition through management of our State's fish and wildlife \npopulations.\n  In the early 1900s, maintaining healthy wildlife populations was \ndesperately needed in the State. Elk, bison, and swan populations in \nArkansas were extinct, and deer, duck, quail, and fish species were \nnear extinction.\n  Following the leadership of President Teddy Roosevelt, Gov. George \nWashington Hays signed Act 124 creating the Arkansas Game and Fish \nCommission on March 11, 1915. One of the commission's first orders of \nbusiness was improving hunting, fishing, and trapping regulations. \nThanks to these efforts we have seen extinct animal populations \nflourish, while creating an excellent environment for fishing and \nhunting. This has allowed tourism to become a leading sector of \nArkansas's economy. Our State now has a thriving elk population with a \nregulated hunting season. We have also seen growth in the deer \npopulation. More than 200,000 deer are harvested annually in Arkansas, \nup from just over 200 checked in the 1938 hunting season. Once known as \nthe Bear State, black bear in Arkansas neared extinction with fewer \nthan 50 believed to be in the State in the 1930s. Today there are more \nthan 5,000 bears in the State, making it one of the most successful \nreintroductions of a large carnivore in history.\n  The AGFC laid the foundation for Arkansas to become the ``Duck \nHunting Capitol of the World'' in 1948 with the establishment of Bayou \nMeto Wildlife Management Area. Today Bayou Meto WMA consists of 33,832 \npublicly owned acres, providing world class duck hunting that attracts \nhunters from all over the world.\n  The AGFC's five fish hatcheries help stock some of finest lakes, \nstreams, and rivers in Arkansas that attract anglers from around the \nworld. More than 12.5 million fish are harvested from these hatcheries \nannually.\n  While the mission is the same, the agency has experienced many \nchanges in the last century. The first nine game wardens were paid $80 \na month and had to provide their own horse. Today the agency operates \nan $88 million annual budget and employs thousands of Arkansans.\n  In the past 100 years, the AGFC has created policies that maintain \nthe natural beauty and abundance of wildlife in the Natural State so \nArkansans and visitors from across America and around the world can \nenjoy the great outdoors. From restoring habitat, managing wildlife and \nprotecting the public, the men and women of the AGFC help preserve the \nNatural State's beauty and natural resources. But this mission comes at \na cost: throughout its history AGFC has lost five brave officers in the \nlast line of duty.

    \n\n[Pages S1440-S1441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 702. A bill to strengthen the prohibitions on insider trading, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am joined by Senator Menendez in \nintroducing the Stop Illegal Insider Trading Act to finally define the \noffense of insider trading. The need for this legislation is long \noverdue because, in the absence of a statutory definition, an \ninconsistent and complicated body of common law has developed as the \ncourts have used varying interpretations of anti-fraud statutes in \norder to decide insider trading cases.\n  For illustrative purposes, consider the following example. A \nfinancial analyst receives information from an insider at XYZ \nCorporation, which contains XYZ's earnings before this information is \npublicly released. This analyst then shares this inside information \nwith his portfolio manager who subsequently trades in XYZ stock.\n  Based on this hypothetical, I suspect most Americans would be \nskeptical about someone who learned of a company's earnings before this \ninformation was publicly released and then subsequently traded on such \ninformation. Indeed, I believe most would agree that such a person was \ngiven an unfair advantage in our securities markets.\n  However, on December 10, 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe Second Circuit in United States v. Newman decided that the \nportfolio managers in this case were not guilty of insider trading \nbecause as the New York Times summarized it, ``prosecutors had to show \nthat both men knew that the original source of the inside information \nhad breached a fiduciary duty and had received a personal benefit in \nreturn.''\n  This decision defies common sense. It should not matter whether \nsomeone, who traded on material information that was not publicly \navailable, knew whether the source of such information breached a \nfiduciary duty and additionally received a personal benefit in return \nfor sharing this inside information. Such a decision is one of many \nthat has caused too many of our citizens to lose faith in government \nand our courts. Indeed, some prosecutors have noted that the Second \nCircuit's decision in Newman ``might make it difficult to file charges \nagainst a parent who passes on a confidential stock tip to one of his \nchildren without receiving anything in return.'' This is plainly not \nright and contributes to a larger sense of injustice.\n  The greater irony, however, is that those who deal with insider \ntrading law the most agree that something must be done to restore \nreason.\n  For example, Duke Law School Professor James D. Cox noted that ``all \nstudies of significant corporate events document that a significant \nportion of the market movement associated with corporate events occurs \nbefore the event is announced; for example, forty to fifty percent of \nthe price gain associated with a merger or takeover occurs before the \ntransaction's announcement . . . One can thus surmise not only that \ncorporate insiders are not very good about keeping secrets, but that \ntheir tippees are delighted that they do not. That is, remote tippees \nare likely both pervasive and truly are insidious. Newman pours gas \nonto this raging fire.''\n  Most ironically, Judge Barrington Parker of the Second Circuit Court \nof Appeals who delivered the Newman opinion remarked during oral \narguments, ``I'm concerned the government's position on key points of \nthe law seems to vary based depending on which judge you're talking \nto.''\n  Moreover, University of North Carolina Law School Professor Thomas \nLee Hazen recently stated, ``no matter how narrow or broad people \nbelieve the definition of insider trading should be, virtually everyone \nis now in agreement that we'd be a lot better off if Congress would \nsimply bite the bullet and define it . . . the situation is a mess. \nThat's how you end up with cases like Newman.''\n  This is precisely what Senator Menendez and I are doing in \nintroducing this legislation today. We are seeking to finally define \nthe offense of insider trading with a clear and simple bright line \nrule. Simply put, if a person trades a security on the basis of \nmaterial information that the person knows or has reason to know is not \npublicly available, then they have engaged in unlawful insider trading.\n  Under our legislation, it is irrelevant whether the trader knew of \nthe source's fiduciary duty or whether the source derived any personal \nbenefit. What matters is whether the trader knew or has reason to know \nthat such trader had an unfair advantage in being given material \ninformation that was not shared with the broader public. In addition, \nwe have taken care to ensure that those who take the time to \nindependently develop their own information from publicly available \nsources can trade on this independently developed information so that \npublicly available information can be analyzed and interpreted without \nfear of liability. Lastly, because there may be situations that do not \nnecessarily rise to the level of unlawful insider trading, we have \nprovided the Securities and Exchange Commission with the flexibility to \nprovide exemptions from insider trading liability as long as such \nexemptions are necessary or appropriate in the public interest and \nconsistent with the protection of investors.\n  In short, by making it an offense for those who contribute to a \nsecurities market rigged in favor of the well connected, our \nlegislation focuses on providing everyday investors with a fair shot at \nseeing some returns after investing their hard-earned savings. \nIncidents of insider trading, and the perceived pervasiveness of the \npractice, have for years served to validate the public's worst \nassumptions about Wall Street culture. It is time we clearly define \nwhat is appropriate under the law and take this meaningful step towards \nimproving the integrity of our securities markets for professional \ntraders and amateur investors alike.\n\n[[Page S1441]]\n\n  I would like to thank Senator Menendez for working with me on this \nlegislation. I also thank Public Citizen, Americans for Financial \nReform, and the Consumer Federation of America for their support, and I \nurge our colleagues to join us in supporting the Stop Illegal Insider \nTrading Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/11/senate-section/article/S1441-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 285.
