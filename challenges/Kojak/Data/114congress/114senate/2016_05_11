Mr. President, President Obama recently bragged to the \nNew York Times Magazine about his performance on the economy. He \nboasted about his economic legacy and actually claimed that, by his \nestimation, the administration managed the economic recovery better \nthan any peer economy facing a financial crisis--now listen to this--\n``on Earth in modern history.'' Well, that is a quote to remember.\n  The same day this story hit, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released \nits first quarter report showing only 0.5 percent economic growth. It \nis the latest reminder of the actual economy\n\n[[Page S2676]]\n\nthat Americans are forced to confront day in and day out.\n  President Obama has presided over the worst economic recovery since \nWorld War II. Growth is anemic, wages are stagnant for too many, \npoverty is up for too many, jobs are scarce for too many, and Americans \nare losing faith in the future.\n  Somehow President Obama doesn't seem to think any of this is his \nproblem or a problem at all. The issue isn't his policies or his \nrefusal to work across the aisle on solutions. No, to him it is just a \nmessaging problem. It is just that he was too busy to ``take victory \nlaps'' or explain things properly.\n  He believes ``the U.S. economy is in much better shape than the \npublic appreciates.'' As the magazine story I mentioned previously \nobserves, in fact, he claims that ``by almost every economic measure, \nwe are significantly better off.''\n  Well, many in the middle class feel quite differently. Just don't \ntake my word for it. Here is what Bill Clinton thinks of the Obama \nadministration economy. He said: ``Millions and millions and millions \nand millions of people look at that pretty picture of America he \npainted and they cannot find themselves in it to save their lives.''\n  That is Bill Clinton on the Obama economy. Hard-working middle class \nfamilies simply cannot find themselves in the picture this President \nhas painted of the American economy.\n  Median household incomes have shrunk under this President. Too many \nAmericans have given up even looking for work altogether, after years \nof failed attempts.\n  One survey found that more than half of Americans say that ``the next \ngeneration will be worse off than them financially.''\n  The middle class has now shrunk to such an extent under President \nObama that it no longer contains the majority of Americans. That is \nsomething none of us should take comfort in.\n  I will read a quote from the President. I am not sure he intended it, \nbut President Obama said something a few months ago that seemed to sum \nup his economic legacy. He said: ``There was a time I think when upward \nmobility was the hallmark of America.''\n  He is right. There was a time. There can be a time again.\n  We don't have to accept the Obama economy as the new normal in our \ncountry. Democrats may want middle-class families to keep their gaze \ndown and their expectations tempered, but we have a right to expect \nmore in this country. We have a right to believe in our future. It is \nclear we need a change to get America moving again.\n  The Republican-led Senate will continue to look for and pass real \nsolutions that aim to get our economy back on track--solutions to help \nfoster economic growth, solutions to help create jobs and strengthen \nour workforce, and solutions to help America prosper once more.\n  If President Obama wants to actually build an economic legacy for \nhimself and not just try to spin Americans on one, then I invite him to \nfinally join us.\n  My Republican colleagues will have more to say on the economy this \nafternoon.\n  I thank my colleague Senator Sullivan, who has been outspoken on this \nimportant matter.\n  I also thank Senator Coats for his work to strengthen our economic \npolicies as chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, as well as a \nmember of the Finance Committee.\n  These Senators know the costly toll the Obama economy has had on \npeople in their home States, and they are working to address it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/senate-section/article/S2676-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is interesting to hear my friend \nfictionalize what is going on in the world economy and in our American \neconomy especially.\n  We all know that when President Obama took office--the month after he \nwas elected in November, 8 years ago--the economy lost 800,000 jobs. It \nwas not 1 month. That continued. When President Bush took over the \neconomy, we had a surplus of $10 trillion over 10 years--a surplus.\n  My friend the Presiding Officer and, frankly, his good father have \ntalked about money that was spent by this country that shouldn't have \nbeen.\n  However, when Bush took office, we had a surplus. We had a balanced \nbudget under Bill Clinton--a balanced budget. We didn't need to \nlegislate it. It happened. Of course, with his leadership and the \nDeficit Reduction Act that we passed, it worked out very well.\n  But that was all wiped out by the spending of the Bush \nadministration. It was 8 years of 2 wars unpaid for and trillions of \ndollars--not hundreds of billions but trillions of dollars--paid for \nwith a credit card. Tax cuts were paid for with a credit card.\n  What did that bring to us? The collapse of Wall Street.\n  President Obama went to work. It was difficult, but we passed the \nAmerican Recovery Act, or the stimulus, as it was known. But for that, \nwho knows how difficult our situation would be.\n  In Nevada, we had the experience of what happened when Wall Street \ncollapsed. We weren't the only State. It happened all over this Nation. \nFor my friend to talk about how great the economy was during the Bush \nyears is simply fictional.\n  Are things perfect now? Of course not. We have had no help in the \nSenate. We had very little help in the House. For 7\\1/2\\ years, all \nRepublicans have done is try to oppose--they didn't try; they opposed--\neverything President Obama has attempted to do. We have been able to \novercome some of that.\n  Since Obama took office, the U.S. economy saw the longest stretch of \nprivate sector growth in its history, and it is still ongoing.\n  There were some complaints last month that only 160,000 jobs were \ncreated. That was 160,000 compared to 800,000 being lost during the \nBush administration. We need to do more. There is no question about \nthat, but we need some help.\n  Republicans are doing everything they can--and they have proven that \nin the last 7\\1/2\\ years--to make it tough for President Obama.\n  We have a lot of people who aren't being paid enough. How about those \npeople working on minimum wage and trying to survive? Yet Republicans \nrefuse to help us raise that.\n  How about paycheck fairness so that my daughter and my granddaughters \nare paid the same amount of money for the same work they do that a man \ndoes?\n  Student debt is unbearable. I am seeing it now with my grandchildren. \nIt is incredible. You are going to have to go borrow money.\n  It is Republicans who stood in the way of recovery in so many \ndifferent ways. So let's talk about the real world--not a fictional \nworld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/senate-section/article/S2676-4", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2676-S2677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last week, the senior Senator from Iowa \nconfirmed what Democrats have said all along: Senate Republicans want \nDonald Trump to fill the Supreme Court vacancy.\n  I am sorry to direct my attention to the Presiding Officer, but I \ncan't imagine how the Presiding Officer must feel with Donald Trump \nbeing the leader of the Republican Party. I can't imagine. I can't \nimagine what your good father thinks of Donald Trump leading the \nRepublican Party, but I can imagine, and I have a number of times.\n  In an interview with the Des Moines Register, Iowa's largest \nnewspaper, Senator Grassley said of Trump: ``Based upon the type of \npeople [Donald Trump would] be looking for, I think I would expect the \nright type of people to be nominated by him to the Supreme Court.''\n  That is fairly shocking, coming from a Senator who should know \nbetter. The\n\n[[Page S2677]]\n\nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee trusts Donald Trump to pick \n``the right type of people'' for the Supreme Court. I can't think of a \nworse idea than placing the power to pick the next Supreme Court \nJustice in the hands of an unhinged individual who derides women, who \ncalls them dogs and pigs. Look at the front page of the New York Times, \nat how he and Howard Stern decided how they were going to treat women. \nRead it. It is demeaning to my wife, my daughter, and my 9 or 10 \ngranddaughters. I have them mixed up. There are 19. It is an uneven \nnumber, but they are close. I can't think of a worse idea than placing \nthe power to pick the next Supreme Court Justice in the hands of this \nunhinged individual. He calls Latinos rapists and murderers.\n  This is the Supreme Court of the United States we are talking about--\nthe Court that decided Marbury v. Madison and Brown v. Board of \nEducation, the anniversary of which is coming up next Tuesday. This is \nnot Donald Trump's reality show. This is the real world. This is no \ngame. This is not a choice about whether Meatloaf or Gary Busey made a \nbetter art project; it is a choice about the future of America. The \nbalance of the Supreme Court has real-life consequences for all of us.\n  Rational people don't want Donald Trump filling a Supreme Court \nvacancy. Iowans don't. The American people don't. But Senate \nRepublicans obviously do, and Senator Grassley does--or I should say he \ndoes now. Two weeks ago, before Donald Trump wrapped up the Republican \nnomination to my dismay, the senior Senator from Iowa sang a much \ndifferent tune. Back then--all of 13 days ago--before Donald Trump was \nhis standard bearer, Senator Grassley said it would be a risk to let \nTrump pick a Supreme Court nominee. That was less than 2 weeks ago. \nThis is what he said: ``If Trump's elected president, it probably is a \nlittle more unknown. . . . I would have to admit it's a gamble.'' It is \na gamble, and it is not at a Las Vegas crap table or a slot machine. \nThat it is a gamble is an understatement.\n  Trump picking a Supreme Court nominee is a guaranteed recipe for \ndisaster. But now that Trump is the nominee, Republicans are marching \nin lockstep with him on the Supreme Court vacancy. Republicans want to \nput the Supreme Court in the hands of an unbalanced egomaniac.\n  Senator Grassley and his colleagues say they want the future of the \nhighest Court to be determined by an anti-woman, anti-Latino, and anti-\nmiddle-class billionaire who demeans women every day. Yesterday \nGrassley told a reporter that ``there's no problem with Trump \nappointing people to the Supreme Court.'' But what had he said 2 weeks \nearlier? That it is a gamble.\n  Donald Trump wants to ban all Muslims from even coming into our \ncountry. That is whom Republicans want picking the Justices to do the \nwork of our judiciary system, deciding questions about civil \nliberties--somebody who says Muslims shouldn't even come to this \ncountry. Trump encouraged supporters to physically assault protesters. \nHere is what he said: ``Knock the crap out of them.'' That is whom the \nRepublicans want to select Justices to interpret the law. It is insane \nthat my Republican colleagues are willing to entrust such an important \nresponsibility to this egomaniac.\n  Instead of relying on the whims of an unscrupulous real estate \ntycoon--who inherited his money, by the way--Senate Republicans should \ntrust in the Senate's time-honored process of considering Supreme Court \nnominees. Republicans can start by reviewing Judge Garland's nominee \nquestionnaire, which the Senate got yesterday. After that, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and Chairman Grassley should do their job and hold \na hearing. Then the Republican leader should bring Merrick Garland's \nnomination to the floor for a vote. A hearing and a vote--that is what \nwe need to have, and that is how we will get, in Senator Grassley's \nwords, the right type of people on the Supreme Court. Meet with the \nman, hold hearings, and vote.\n  This year the Republican Senate is on pace to work fewer days than \nany Senate in the past six decades--60-plus years. So in that we are \nnot doing much anyway, couldn't we just work in a little time to have a \nSupreme Court nominee?\n  Senator Grassley was right the first time. Letting Donald Trump pick \na Supreme Court Justice is indeed a gamble. It is a risk the American \npeople can't afford and shouldn't afford. Instead of waiting for Donald \nTrump, Republicans should just do their job and at least allow the \nCourt to have a full complement of nine Justices.\n  Mr. President, I see no one here on the floor, so I ask the Chair to \nannounce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/senate-section/article/S2677-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, but I ask \nthat the time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Boozman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, in about 5 or 6 minutes, the Senate \nwill proceed to the scheduled vote on the Cotton amendment on the \nEnergy and Water appropriations bill. Actually, it will be cloture on \nthe Cotton amendment. Before that vote, I ask unanimous consent that I \nfirst be allowed to speak for a few minutes, and following me, Senator \nFeinstein, and then we vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I will save most of my remarks for \nafter the vote, but I wish to make two kinds of remarks. One is to give \nan update on the bill, where we are. The second remark is to restate my \nreasons why I will not vote for cloture on the Cotton amendment. First, \nin terms of where we are, we have the Cotton amendment at 10:30. The \nSenator from California and I have agreed--and I think our staffs and \nthe Republican and Democratic leaders have discussed it--that there \ncould be a vote for Senator Cardin and Senator Fischer at 60 votes, a \nvoice vote on Senator Flake. That is it. Then we would have another \ncloture vote if we need it and a vote on final passage.\n  In my view, and I believe in terms of Senator Feinstein's view, we \nought to easily be able to finish the bill today. I think we should \nfinish it today. I thank the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, for \nstarting the appropriations process earlier this year than it ever has \nbeen started before. I thank the Democratic leader, Senator Reid, for \nworking with us through some difficult issues we had on this first bill \nthat we didn't expect and to make it possible for us to come to what \nlooks like a prompt conclusion.\n  This is an important bill. The Senators know that. We have had nearly \n80 Senators contribute parts of this bill. Some are very important to \ntheir States and this country. Whether it deepens the Mobile port or \nthe west coast ports or rebuilds locks in Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee \nor whether it properly funds the national laboratories across the \ncountry or moves ahead with our nuclear weapons program, this is one of \nthe most important appropriations bills that we have.\n  Today we will have spent 2 weeks on it, not counting the week we had \nfor recess. We will have processed 21 amendments, if I go through the \namendments I just described. If we succeed today in finishing the bill, \nit will\n\n[[Page S2678]]\n\nbe the first time since 2009 that the Energy and Water appropriations \nbill has gone across the floor in regular order.\n  Senator Feinstein and I have worked pretty hard together, and as she \nlikes to say, both of us have engaged in some give and some take in \norder to create a result that the Senate can be proud of and set a good \nexample for the next 11 appropriations bills. We have a lot waiting to \nbe done. The majority leader has already announced he would like to \nmove ahead with the transportation and military construction bill. On \nboth sides of the aisle, there is concern about moving ahead with Zika, \nwhich could be done during that bill. The Defense authorization bill \nneeds to be dealt with before we get to the next recess. We have nine \nmore appropriations bills to deal with, and there is a very important \nbiomedical research bill called the 21st Century Cures Act. I hope we \nget to that bill sometime before July.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3878\n\n  Mr. President, I have one other thing to say. Senator Feinstein and I \nhave worked hard to give all the Senators who had germane, relevant \namendments a vote on their amendments, and we succeeded very well with \nthat. We processed 21 amendments, and that includes the amendment by \nSenator Cotton, which prohibits the United States from using tax \ndollars to buy heavy water from Iran in the year 2017. I defended his \nright to have a vote on that amendment, which we are about to have, but \nI will vote no on that amendment because I don't believe it belongs on \nthe bill. No. 1, I think it should be considered first by the Foreign \nRelations and the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees because it \nis filled with national security implications. No. 2, if it were \nadopted, I think there would be dangerous complications because it \ncould increase the possibility that heavy water from Iran, which in the \nUnited States would be used for peaceful purposes, could be sold by \nIran to another country, such as North Korea, and used to help make \nnuclear weapons. I don't want to have the Senate approve an amendment \nthat would create that kind of possibility. No. 3, the President said \nhe will veto it, which would result in not only having the Cotton \namendment rejected, but the bill would fail as well.\n  The discussion of where Iran's heavy water goes is an important \ndiscussion, and the Senator has a right to bring it up. Iran has it, \nand we don't want them to have it because they could use it to make \nnuclear weapons. We don't produce it, but we need it for medical and \nscientific research, so it makes sense for us to buy it. In the great \nscheme of things, it is not a great amount of money. But the idea of \nletting it go on the international market and perhaps find its way to \ncountries building nuclear weapons is something I can't support, so I \nwill vote no.\n  I thank the Senator from California for working through all of these \nissues with us, and I am glad that following Senator Feinstein's \nremarks, we will vote on the Cotton amendment. I hope that with the \ncooperation of the majority leader and Democratic leader, we will be \nable to finish the bill today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Energy and Water Subcommittee for his leadership and willingness to \nsettle issues to get this bill to the point where it really is ready to \nbe voted on by this body. I think he has made the argument against the \nCotton amendment eloquently and correctly. I am very grateful for the \nfact that he did what I think is a noble thing and changed his vote and \nwill be voting against the Cotton amendment.\n  Let me say something about this process. Both the chairman and I have \nbeen here for a long time, and we were here when appropriations bills \nwere passed. The key to doing that is keeping poison pills off \nappropriations bills so they can be passed quickly. In addition to the \narguments made by the chairman, the White House had very strong \nfeelings and indicated they would veto this bill if it passed with this \namendment. How do we start an appropriations process with a \nPresidential veto in the wings? I don't think we do. Hopefully, the \nappropriate thing will happen in this vote, and cloture will be \ndefeated. I hope that it sends a signal--a strong signal--for the rest \nof the appropriations process. We want to show that we can run this \nplace and get business done and poisons pills have no place on \nappropriations bills. That is my very deep belief, and that is where it \nonce was.\n  Once again, I thank the chair for his help, cooperation, and \nleadership. It is quite wonderful to be able to work with the Senator \nfrom Tennessee, Senator Alexander, and I too urge a ``no'' vote on \ncloture.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Senate amendment \n     No. 3878 to amendment No. 3801 to Calendar No. 96, H.R. 2028, \n     an act making appropriations for energy and water development \n     and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2016, and for other purposes.\n         Mitch McConnell, Thad Cochran, Lamar Alexander, Johnny \n           Isakson, Marco Rubio, David Vitter, Patrick J.

Inhofe, Lisa Murkowski, Tom Cotton, Pat \n           Roberts, John Barrasso, John Hoeven.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on \namendment No. 3878, offered by the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. \nMcConnell, for the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Cotton, to amendment No. \n3801, as amended, to H.R. 2028, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 57, nays 42, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 67 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--57\n\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Blumenthal\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Burr\n     Capito\n     Cassidy\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Cotton\n     Crapo\n     Cruz\n     Daines\n     Donnelly\n     Enzi\n     Ernst\n     Fischer\n     Flake\n     Gardner\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heitkamp\n     Heller\n     Hoeven\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kirk\n     Lankford\n     Lee\n     Manchin\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Moran\n     Murkowski\n     Perdue\n     Portman\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rounds\n     Rubio\n     Sasse\n     Scott\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Sullivan\n     Thune\n     Tillis\n     Toomey\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--42\n\n     Alexander\n     Baldwin\n     Bennet\n     Booker\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Coons\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Heinrich\n     Hirono\n     Kaine\n     King\n     Klobuchar\n     Leahy\n     Markey\n     McCaskill\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murphy\n     Murray\n     Nelson\n     Paul\n     Peters\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Schatz\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall\n     Warner\n     Warren\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Sanders\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 57, the nays are \n42.\n  Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3878\n\n  Cloture not having been invoked on amendment No. 3878, under the \nprevious order, there will be 1 hour of debate equally divided in the \nusual form.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I regret that the Senators failed to \ninvoke cloture on my amendment, but I am gratified that a large \nbipartisan majority of the Senate agrees that we should not use U.S. \ntaxpayer dollars to subsidize Iran's nuclear program over and above the \nobligations of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\n  Now that cloture has not been invoked, my amendment is still pending, \nand I understand that Democrats denied cloture on the bill three times \nbecause my amendment is able to be called up after cloture on the bill.\n\n[[Page S2679]]\n\n  I want this bill to move forward, I want it to pass in an expeditious \nfashion, and therefore I intend later today to withdraw my amendment so \nit cannot be called up postcloture on the bill, leaving Democrats no \nreason not to agree to cloture on the bill and agree to final passage \nof the bill.\n  Finally, I want to thank the Senator from Tennessee as well as the \nSenator from Kentucky, the majority leader, for working with me to make \nsure we have the Senate on record on this important issue. I regret \nthat it took multiple days to get to a point we could have reached very \nearly on, as I had agreed to a 60-vote threshold 2 weeks ago, but I do \nthink it is important that the Senate has spoken on this most critical \nissue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas for \nwithdrawing his amendment. I defended his right to have the amendment. \nI opposed the amendment, and I explained before the vote why I did \nthat, so it is not necessary for me to say more about it.\n  As Senator Feinstein and I said before the vote, we are ready to \nfinish the bill. We have had terrific cooperation from Senators on both \nsides of the aisle. We will have included 21 amendments in the bill by \nthe time we are finished. More than 80 Senators have made a \ncontribution to the bill. It has importance to every part of our \ncountry. It is the first bill of a series of 12 that we need to deal \nwith. It is within the budget levels. It is not a part of the Federal \ndebt problem because the discretionary spending we are talking about is \nfairly flat.\n  It is a well-designed bill, and we are ready to finish the bill. When \nit will be finished, of course, is up to the majority leader and the \nDemocratic leader as they schedule.\n  All that remains to be done, since Senator Feinstein and I have \nrecommended that we have votes on the Cardin and Fischer amendments at \n60 and that we adopt a Flake-modified amendment by voice vote--then all \nthat remains is a cloture vote, if necessary, and final passage. In our \nview, that could be done today, but there may be larger issues that \nhave to do with the Senate schedule that would cause that to be put off \nuntil tomorrow, and we will wait for an announcement from the majority \nleader and the Democratic leader about what that schedule is.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. For the information of Senators and staff, there will \nbe a vote at noon. We expect a cloture vote at noon on the bill. There \nmay be other things to discuss at that time. Several Senators have \nasked me about votes, and I indicated that there were a couple and that \nthere might not be votes until after lunch, but the plan now is to have \na vote at noon on cloture on the bill. Perhaps by then we will be able \nto lock in some other votes, which would occur after lunch.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Zika Virus\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Zika virus and the \nurgent need for Congress to provide the $1.9 billion President Obama \nhas requested to combat this health crisis.\n  The Zika virus was first identified in Uganda in 1947. The virus is \ntransmitted by the same mosquito species that transmits dengue, yellow \nfever, and chikungunya. Prior to 2007, the Zika virus had no known \noutbreaks and only 14 documented human cases. However, in the spring of \n2007, scientists documented 185 suspected cases of Zika on Yap Island, \nMicronesia, followed by more than 30,000 suspected cases in French \nPolynesia and other Pacific islands between 2013 and 2014, and in May \n2015 the first case of Zika was reported in Brazil.\n  On February 1, 2016, the World Health Organization declared the \nongoing Zika outbreak to be ``a public health emergency of \ninternational concern.'' According to the World Health Organization's \nInternational Health Regulations, a public health emergency of \ninternational concern is a situation where the disease outbreak \n``constitutes a public health risk to other States through the \ninternational spread of disease, and potentially requires a coordinated \ninternational response.'' The World Health Organization predicts that 3 \nto 4 million people--3 to 4 million people--in the Americas will \ncontract Zika within 1 year.\n  There is a common refrain among scientists and experts studying Zika: \nThere is much they still do not know about Zika, and what they do know \nis worrisome. Until recently, the Zika virus has been viewed as a \nrelatively minor virus. The majority of individuals infected with the \nvirus are asymptomatic, and those who do experience symptoms often \ncomplain of fever, rash, joint pain or conjunctivitis.\n  However, newer research has shown the Zika virus can cause a number \nof previously undetected medical conditions, especially in regard to \npregnant women. Last month the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention confirmed the link between Zika infection during pregnancy \nand severe fetal brain defects like microcephaly. The World Health \nOrganization recently concluded that Zika can cause Guillain-Barre, a \nrare condition that attacks the body's nervous system, causing muscle \nweakness and even paralysis. Scientists have also recently confirmed \nthe virus can be transmitted sexually--a first for this type of virus.\n  As of April 2016, the World Health Organization documented Zika virus \ntransmission in 62 countries and territories around the world, \nincluding 33 in the Americas. Brazil has been hardest hit by the virus, \nrecording more than 91,000 cases of the virus and nearly 5,000 \nsuspected cases of Zika-related microcephaly. Across the U.S. \nterritories, nearly 600 people have contracted Zika, including more \nthan 400 in Puerto Rico. Here in the Continental United States, there \nhave been over 420 related Zika cases, including 12 in my home State of \nMaryland.\n  As we continue moving toward the summer months and the height of the \nmosquito season, the number of locally acquired and travel-associated \nZika infections in the United States and its territories will \nundoubtedly climb. Just last month, CDC Director Tom Frieden indicated \nthat clusters of locally acquired Zika were possible in the southern \nUnited States by the summer.\n  Last month, the administration officially announced they would \ntransfer $510 million from the remaining Ebola funds to jump-start the \nZika response while waiting for congressional action. While $510 \nmillion is a good start, it is just a fraction of what is needed to \nmount a full response to Zika. Congress does need to act because the \n$510 million Ebola fund isn't just found money. Those dollars were \nsustaining efforts to detect and prevent another Ebola outbreak in West \nAfrica while also helping developing countries better respond to \noutbreaks on their own. It is unacceptable that we would force our \npublic health professionals to choose between addressing Ebola or \naddressing Zika.\n  There is no question the United States must take the threat of Zika \nseriously and mount an urgent, aggressive, and sustained response to \nthe virus. As we speak, a Federal interagency task force, led by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, is working around the clock to \nmitigate the impact of Zika. Within the task force, the CDC is working \nclosely with laboratories in affected countries, in the United States, \nand its territories to enhance laboratory and surveillance capacity and \nimprove diagnostics.\n\n[[Page S2680]]\n\n  The CDC is also engaging in public health studies and is providing \nguidance to health professionals and educating the general public about \nprevention. The agency is also working with local authorities in the \nUnited States to improve mosquito control efforts.\n  In Maryland, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious \nDiseases at the National Institutes of Health is supporting preclinical \nand clinical development of vaccines for the mosquito virus and other \nmosquito-borne diseases. The Institute is also collaborating with \nstakeholders to conduct vital research that will allow us to better \nunderstand the origins and pathology of Zika and bring us closer to \ndeveloping a vaccine.\n  The Food and Drug Administration is working to improve and refine \ndiagnostics for the Zika virus. Most notably, the FDA recently issued \ntwo Emergency Use Authorizations for two newly developed Zika \ndiagnostic tests. To date, more than 25 States and the District of \nColumbia have verified their ability to test for Zika using these \nmethods, which will enhance our ability to monitor this growing \nepidemic. The FDA is also working closely with the Biomedical Advanced \nResearch and Development Authority to advance vaccine research and \ndevelopment.\n  I am also pleased the U.S. Agency for International Development, \nUSAID, is working with UNICEF to develop and implement communication \ncampaigns and community mobilization for behavioral change related to \npersonal protection against mosquitos, as well as community-based \nmosquito mitigation and elimination efforts--commonly referred to as \nvector control--in areas hardest hit by the virus. The agency is also \npartnering with the World Health Organization and its South American \narm, the Pan American Health Organization, to implement and monitor \nvector control programs.\n  In addition to providing personal protection commodities, USAID is \nalso working closely with the international health partners to develop \nand adopt guidelines for addressing Zika in at-risk populations, \nparticularly pregnant women.\n  This is just a fraction of what a Zika response looks like. I would \nbe here much longer if I were to go through every detail of what our \nagencies are doing to respond to the threat. Suffice it to say, this is \nan all-hands-on-deck emergency, and we cannot implement and sustain an \nadequate response without fully funding the President's request.\n  More than 2 months have passed since the President sent his request \nto Congress. The Zika virus is not some nebulous foreign threat. It is \nalready on our shores. Congress needs to act. I call on my fellow \nSenators to come to an agreement on a robust and comprehensive Zika \nsupplemental that enables us to better prevent, treat, and respond to \nthe virus both at home and abroad, while also replenishing the critical \nEbola funds.\n  When it comes to global health pandemics, which know no borders, the \nCongress of the United States can and must act to protect American \ncitizens and people around the world.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, within a few minutes, we will be voting \nfor the fourth time on cloture on the bill. This time I expect it to \npass. The Cotton amendment has been disposed of. Following that, if it \nis successful, Senator Feinstein and I have recommended to the majority \nleader and the Democratic leader that we move to a vote on the Cardin \nand Fischer amendments, at 60 votes, and a voice vote on the Flake \namendment. Then, all that would be remaining would be a final cloture \nvote, which may or may not be necessary, and final passage. None of \nthose votes have been agreed to yet, and we will let Senators know when \nthey are. But in the opinion of the bill managers, we are ready to \nfinish the bill, and we thank Senators for their cooperation to get us \nto this point.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3878 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from Arkansas, \nMr. Cotton, I withdraw the Cotton amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Senate amendment \n     No. 3801 to Calendar No. 96, H.R. 2028, an act making \n     appropriations for energy and water development and related \n     agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and \n     for other purposes.\n         Mitch McConnell, Bob Corker, Tom Cotton, Thom Tillis, \n           Mike Crapo, Joni Ernst, Jerry Moran, John Boozman, \n           Lindsey Graham, John Thune, Daniel Coats, Chuck \n           Grassley, Shelley Moore Capito, Thad Cochran, Lamar \n           Alexander, Richard Burr, Roy Blunt.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on \namendment No. 3801, offered by the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. \nAlexander, as amended, to H.R. 2028, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Zika Virus\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nthe threat that the Zika virus poses--a threat to the health of \nAmericans and to people around the world.\n  Every day we learn more about this virus. The Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention has confirmed a link between Zika and \nmicrocephaly. That is a condition where babies are born with smaller \nheads and with brain defects. It is a devastating problem that we are \nall facing.\n  Studies have linked Zika to something called Guillain-Barre \nsyndrome--a condition I studied in medical school and have seen \npatients with. It can lead to paralysis, which is another very serious \ncondition.\n  Last week the Centers for Disease Control also confirmed the first \nZika-related death in Puerto Rico.\n  Because this virus is mostly spread by mosquitoes, the potential risk \nis only going to become more urgent as the weather turns warmer. So we \nmust do what we can now--today--before this turns into a true epidemic \nrather than the threat it is today. America's drug companies and \nresearchers need to continue working on treatments, tests, and \nvaccines. Our cities and towns need to start taking aggressive measures \nto control mosquitoes. Doctors can help to educate people who are at \nrisk of contracting the disease--this virus--but we really do need all \nhands on deck.\n  Washington has an important part to play, and Republicans in the \nSenate are ready to address this issue. Congress has already passed \nlegislation that adds Zika to what is called the priority review \nvoucher program. This program awards financial incentives to the \nsponsor of a new drug that is approved to prevent or treat a tropical \ndisease. That is a good way Congress can help speed up the research \nprocess in dealing with Zika. Congress has also approved the transfer \nof nearly $600 million in existing, unobligated funds for an immediate \nZika response, so the money has already been moved to help.\n  We can also make a big difference by cutting through redtape, and \nthere is significant redtape in this city that actually makes it harder \nto kill mosquitoes that carry this virus. We would think we would want \nto make it easier to kill mosquitoes, but there is redtape in \nWashington, DC--bureaucrats making it harder to kill the mosquitoes \nthat carry the virus.\n  Today it is hard to believe that there are requirements for permits \nthat I think are absolutely unnecessary and that make it more difficult \nand more expensive to spray for mosquitoes in the United States. So if \na farmer or a rancher, a city or a community wants to spray for \nmosquitoes, they have to use a pesticide that has been approved by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency; that is No. 1. In a lot of cases, \npeople who want to spray for mosquitoes also have to get a separate \npermit under the Clean Water Act. That is No. 2. There are two steps--\none, to get the permit to spray, and two, to get the EPA approval of \nwhat they are going to spray with. This doesn't add any benefit to the \nenvironment, and it certainly doesn't help protect anybody from the \nZika virus. It is Washington getting in the way. It adds another hoop \nfor people to jump through before they can get rid of the mosquitoes \nthat carry the Zika virus.\n  Senator Mike Crapo from Idaho has written legislation that would \neliminate this second unnecessary requirement. It is not saying that \nanyone can go out and spray whatever they want. The pesticide would \nstill have to be approved so that we know they are safe. But the \nlegislation says that we don't need this second permitting process that \nWashington demands. It is a commonsense change. It is the kind of thing \nwe could do to help local officials on the ground make the best \ndecisions about how they can fight these mosquitoes and this virus in \ntheir communities, in the places they know the best, and do it quickly.\n  The Crapo bill has 18 cosponsors, and I am proud to be one of them. \nIt is a bipartisan bill with bipartisan support, and it has already \npassed the Environment and Public Works Committee. We should take up \nthis bill and pass it and get these tools into people's hands as \nquickly as possible.\n  I know that some of what America can do to help fight Zika--and \npeople understand this--is going to require us to spend money, and I \nsupport that. That is why the Appropriations Committee is looking at \nthe need for additional funding, additional spending to address this \nthreat. Regular appropriations bills are the best way for us to \ncarefully look at where the priorities are for spending the taxpayers' \ndollars. That is how we should be paying for things around here, not \njust another\n\n[[Page S2682]]\n\ncontinuing resolution or some emergency measure.\n  When something new comes up, we can look at it, figure out how to \nbalance the costs, and if we have to do an emergency bill to get some \nmoney out the door more quickly, we can take a look at that as well, \nbut we can't do that without at least having a plan from the \nadministration on where and how this money they are requesting is going \nto be spent.\n  The Obama administration has not yet given us the level of \ninformation we need to make an informed decision. It appears that the \nadministration is trying to take advantage of this Zika emergency to \ngive itself an additional $2 billion to use however it wants--maybe to \nfight Zika but maybe to do other things. What the administration is \nsaying is that they want the money to be used for ``assistance or \nresearch to prevent, treat, or otherwise respond to Zika virus . . . or \nother infectious diseases.'' The wording is much too vague. It would \nallow the administration to use these emergency funds on other \npriorities well beyond a Zika response.\n  The President's request for emergency funding goes on to say that \nmost of the money, they say, could be transferred to other parts of the \ngovernment, like the Environmental Protection Agency and even the \nDepartment of Defense. It includes a lot of expenses that don't \nnecessarily qualify as emergency spending outside the regular \nappropriations process.\n  Both sides of the aisle know the Zika situation is serious, and both \nsides want to do what we can to help. But Congress also has an \nobligation to make sure that our taxpayer dollars are being spent \nresponsibly, that there is accountability. We shouldn't be writing a \nbig check for the Obama administration to cash without adequate \nexplanation and adequate accountability. We deserve that. The American \npeople deserve it. They will expect it, and they deserve it.\n  I want to be clear. Zika is a very real public health threat, and it \ndeserves serious discussion. It deserves urgent action. This fight \nagainst the Zika virus should not be turned into a political game. So I \nthink it is a terrible sign that some Democrats in the Senate have \nbegun to treat this devastating health issue like just another \npolitical talking point. That is what they have done here on the floor \nof the Senate. A couple of weeks ago, Democrats actually held a press \nconference calling on Congress to approve emergency funds for Zika. \nThen these same Democrats turned around and blocked passage of the \nEnergy and Water appropriations bill for a number of days.\n  The appropriations process is the best way for us to fund the Zika \nresponse, and the Senate Democrats are holding up this process for \npolitical purposes. We need to get moving beyond this appropriations \nbill to the next one that is going to address the issue of Zika. Then \nwe hear that the minority leader might want to wait until next week to \nget on this bill. We need to get on this bill now.\n  So the Democrats have made it clear that they don't even want to talk \nabout offsetting any of the Zika funding. The Obama administration \ncontinues to stonewall our reasonable requests for adequate information \nabout how it wants to spend these taxpayer dollars.\n  Senate Republicans are going to keep asking for this information. We \nare going to keep pushing to use the appropriations process the way it \nis intended, and we are committed as Republicans to addressing the \npublic health threat posed by the Zika virus. We will continue working \nacross the aisle to respond to the threat and to do it in a way that is \nreasonable, responsible, and accountable.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Nomination of Merrick Garland\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I come to the Senate floor to once \nagain urge my Republican colleagues to listen to the vast majority of \nthe people across the country, do their job and allow us to do ours: \nfulfill our constitutional responsibilities, hold hearings for Judge \nMerrick Garland, and give him a vote.\n  We owe that to the people we represent. It is simply the right thing \nto do. Two months ago, the President did his job. He selected a \nnominee. For 2 months, Judge Garland has been ready and willing to meet \nwith any Senator who will make the time. Yesterday Judge Garland did \nhis job by submitting a questionnaire to the Senate Judiciary Committee \noutlining his background and his work history, which is standard for \njudicial nominees.\n  What about the Senate? In complete disregard of what so many Members \ncontinue to hear in their home States across the country, Republican \nleaders are refusing to act. Senate Republicans will not say they are \nopposed to Judge Garland. They are refusing to even live up to their \nconstitutional responsibility and consider him. This kind of pure \nobstruction and partisanship is so wrong. People across the country are \nnot going to stand for it. We are now at an unbelievable 88 days into \nthis Supreme Court vacancy. Especially after knowing what I do after \nmeeting with Judge Garland and what many Republicans know after meeting \nwith him as well, his distinguished career and work history show that \nhe is, without a doubt, someone who deserves fair consideration by all \nof us in the Senate.\n\n  Judge Garland led a massive investigation of the Oklahoma City \nbombing and supervised the prosecution of Timothy McVeigh. He called \nhis work for the Justice Department, following the Oklahoma City \nbombing, the most important thing he has ever done in his life.\n  His fairness and diligence earned him praise from Members of both \nparties, from victims' families, law enforcement officers, and even \nfrom the lead lawyer who was defending McVeigh. As a prosecutor, he \nensured proper respect for the rights of criminal defendants.\n  He was confirmed to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals in 1997 with a \nstrong bipartisan vote of 76 to 23. Several of those who confirmed him \nin 1997 still serve in the Senate today. Clearly this is less about \nJudge Garland as a nominee and more about political obstruction and \npartisanship, especially after one Republican Senator admitted that if \nit looks as if Donald Trump will lose the November election, we should \nquickly confirm Judge Garland. This comes after weeks of saying the \nSenate should not do its job until we have a new President.\n  Evaluating and confirming Supreme Court Justices is one of the most \nimportant roles we have in the Senate. I have heard from people all \nover my State of Washington who want the Senate to do its job.\n  If Republicans continue to refuse to do their jobs, they aren't \nsaying the people should decide; they are saying they believe the \nRepublican Presidential nominee should. That is just wrong, especially \nafter we heard from the presumptive Republican nominee last night on \nFOX News.\n  Recently, he said that he thinks women should be punished for \nexercising their constitutionally protected reproductive rights.\n  Last night he went a step further. He would only appoint ``pro-life'' \nJustices who would overturn Roe v. Wade. Let me repeat that. The \ncandidate Republicans would like to see in the White House nominating \nSupreme Court Justices has committed to taking our country back to the \nDark Ages.\n  That is appalling, and it is something I know millions of men and \nwomen across the country are scared of. It is just one more reason that \npeople will continue demanding that Senate Republicans do their jobs \nnow.\n  Washington State families should have a voice right now. Families \nacross America should have a voice right now. The tea party gridlock \nand dysfunction that has dominated too much of our time and work in \nCongress should be pushed aside right now.\n  I hope Republicans will reconsider. I hope they will meet with Judge \nGarland, hold a hearing, and give him a vote. We need nine Justices \nserving on the highest Court in the land.\n\n[[Page S2683]]\n\n  The American people deserve a fully functioning Supreme Court.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about a very \nimportant responsibility that the Senate has to deal with in an \nexpeditious manner--a Supreme Court nomination.\n  In a practice consistent with every single Supreme Court nominee \nbefore him, President Obama's nominee to fill the vacancy, Judge \nMerrick Garland, submitted his completed questionnaire yesterday to the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. Inside 6 boxes were 141 pages--with 2,066 \npages of appendices--in which Judge Garland provided incredibly \nthorough answers to the standard questions asked of every Supreme Court \ncandidate.\n  He detailed the highlights of his career, his published writings, the \nmany honors and awards he received, the cases he litigated, the \njudicial opinions he gave, as well as his speeches and his interviews.\n  Despite the fact that Senate Republicans have forced Judge Garland \ninto an unprecedented limbo, he remains focused on the task before him. \nHe has acted with the greatest decency, thoughtfulness, and \nbipartisanship while agreeing to meet with 46 Senators, including 14 \nRepublicans.\n  Judge Garland respects the process. Why can't Senate Republicans?\n  President Obama clearly respected the process when he picked Judge \nGarland, who--as Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia, the second most important court in the country--\nhas more Federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court \nnominee in history.\n  Let me repeat that. Judge Garland, the nominee from our President, \nwho was duly elected not once but twice, has more Federal judicial \nexperience than any other Supreme Court nominee in history.\n  Judge Garland has committed much of his life to public service, from \nhis days leading the successful prosecutions of the Oklahoma City \nbombers and the Unabomber, to his nearly two decades as a Federal \nappellate judge. He is brilliant and he is evenhanded.\n  The Congressional Research Service called him ``pragmatic'' and \n``meticulous,'' a nominee who prioritizes ``collaboration over \nideological rigidity.''\n  Let me repeat that. He is a nominee who prioritizes ``collaboration \nover ideological rigidity.''\n  He has also received high praise from some Republican Senators, and \nthat praise deserves repeating.\n  Senator Lindsey Graham said: ``He's honest and capable, and his \nreputation is beyond reproach.''\n  Senator Jim Inhofe, the chairman of the committee on which I serve as \nranking member said: ``I think a lot of him.''\n  Senator Rob Portman: ``He's an impressive guy.''\n  Senator Jeff Flake said: ``Nobody has a bad thing to say about him.''\n  Yet in the same breath, these are some of the very same Republicans \nwho refuse to hold a hearing and schedule a vote on Judge Garland's \nnomination, even though article II, section 2, clause 2 of the \nConstitution says that it is the Senate's job to provide ``advice and \nconsent'' on the President's Supreme Court nominees.\n  This is what gets me--that my Republican friends say they care about \nthe Constitution. They love the Constitution. They abide by the \nConstitution. They want a literal reading of the Constitution. Well, \nlet's read it together--article II, section 2, clause 2: The President \n``shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, \nshall appoint . . . judges of the Supreme Court.''\n\n  It doesn't say the President ``may nominate''; it says the President \n``shall nominate.'' It doesn't say the Senate ``may give advice and \nconsent''; it says they ``shall.'' The President shall, by and with the \nadvice and consent of the Senate. They also shall appoint Ambassadors, \nother public ministers and consuls, and judges of the Supreme Court.\n  So here it is. This clause wasn't put in some bottle and miraculously \nwashed up on the shore and read--this is what our Founding Fathers \nwanted. It is in the Constitution. It doesn't say ``may.'' It doesn't \nsay to the Senate: ``And by the way, p.s., if you don't like the \nPresident, forget it.'' No, no, no. It is not in there. I looked. It \ndoesn't say: ``Well, if you think that a President isn't a good \nPresident and that you are going to get a better one, you can put it \noff.'' No, it doesn't say that.\n  The American people have three words for the Republicans who are \ndisrespecting this process, disrespecting our Constitution, \ndisrespecting our President, and threatening to create a man-made \ncrisis at the Supreme Court. And it is a crisis. If they deadlock, it \nis a crisis. We will have one set of laws in one part of the country \nand one set of laws in the other part of the country, or we are not \ngoing to have a ruling on a very important issue. It doesn't matter \nwhat your ideology is, you are setting up deadlocks.\n  It is bad enough that there is obstruction here. I know my friend, \nthe Senator from Illinois, will talk about the obstruction when it \ncomes to judges and Ambassadors and the like because we face it every \nday. That is bad enough. But the highest Court in the land, governed by \nthis Constitution--it doesn't say: ``Look at the other side of the \npaper. You really don't have to act.'' No.\n  Across party lines, the American people are saying three words to my \nRepublican friends: Do your job. Do your job.\n  Since 1916, when the Senate Judiciary Committee began holding public \nconfirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominees, the Senate has never \ndenied a Supreme Court nominee a hearing and a vote. Let me say that \nagain. Since 1916, the Senate has never denied a Supreme Court nominee \na hearing and a vote. The Democrats never did it, and the Republicans \nnever did it--until now. And this is from the very people who say: \n``Oh, I carry the Constitution in my heart. I am a strict \nconstructionist.''\n  If you are such a strict constructionist, read this and follow the \nConstitution.\n  I am not sure about this. I think I read that somebody is either \nthinking about filing a lawsuit or they have filed a lawsuit because of \ninaction. I tell you, if I wasn't here, I would truly think about that. \nYou can't read this Constitution and come up with any conclusion other \nthan that what they are doing is unconstitutional--the very same people \nwho say: ``Follow the Constitution.''\n  So in closing, which are the words my friend is waiting for, here is \nwhat I want to say. Our Republican friends have to rethink their \nobstructionist approach because they are going to do lasting damage to \ntwo of our country's most important institutions--the Senate and the \nSupreme Court. I know they love their country. I know they may not like \nthis nominee, even though a lot of them seem to like him quite a bit. \nMaybe they are waiting for Donald Trump to put someone up. I hope that \nnever happens. But I am going to tell you now that you are obstructing. \nYou are obstructing the will of the people. You are obstructing a \nPresident who was elected twice. You are obstructing justice for the \nAmerican people, and they all hate what you are doing, including the \nRepublicans who have been polled.\n  My Republican colleagues have to end these political games. It is \ntime to give Judge Garland the same consideration as every other \nnominee before him. It is time to bring some respect back to the Senate \nand to the Supreme Court nomination process. The American people are \ngoing to hold my Republican colleagues accountable for this because you \ncannot do this. This is not right.\n  If you want to vote against a nominee, fine. I have done it. Of \ncourse, vote against the nominee. But as much as I have opposed \nnominees before--and I have--I have never suggested, nor has any other \nDemocrat I know of ever suggested, that you don't go forward with the \nprocess.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor, noting that my friend from \nIllinois is going to address us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Presiding Officer tell us what \nthe order of business is.\n\n[[Page S2684]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is postcloture on amendment No. \n3801.\n  Mr. DURBIN. There are no time limits agreed to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is evenly divided until 4:30 p.m.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n  Mr. President, the Executive Calendar is sitting here on the table \nfor each Member of the Senate to take a look at. I have renamed it. It \nis no longer the Executive Calendar; it is the political obituaries.\n  These are men and women who have been nominated to serve in positions \nof our government, who are excited about the opportunity to be public \nservants, many of whom have gone through extensive background checks, \nFBI checks, with staff having taken a look at their resumes, asked hard \nquestions, demanded answers, and put these nominees through hearings. \nMany went through extensive periods of investigation and hearings and \nthen were reported--20 of them, 20 judicial nominees--by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee to the floor of the Senate. Were they \ncontroversial? No. All 20 came to the floor by unanimous vote.\n  Think about it. Here is a Senate divided--54 Republicans and 46 \nDemocrats--and 20 judicial nominees made it through what I just \ndescribed to the Executive Calendar of the Senate, Wednesday, May 11, \n2016. And there they sit, day after weary day, month after weary month, \nthinking they might have a chance to serve this Nation but realizing \nthe clock is running out. What do I mean by that? In this Congress we \nhave approved 17 judges--2 circuit judges, those at the appellate \nlevel, and 15 at the district level. Twenty still sit on the calendar. \nAnd across the United States, we have 87 judicial vacancies, including \n29 that are in districts we think are in serious trouble if they aren't \nfilled quickly.\n  The Republican majority in the Senate puts these men and women \nthrough this process, reports them out of committee, and then lets them \nlanguish on the floor of the Senate. They will not call them for a \nvote. What are they waiting for? Well, it is a political decision. Here \nis what it comes down to. There is an unwritten rule--you will not find \nit in our rule book--called the Thurmond rule. It relates to Senator \nStrom Thurmond of South Carolina. He must have articulated this at some \npoint in his career, but he said: When it comes to an election year--\nlike this one--we will stop approving nominations as of the beginning \nof the political conventions.\n  Well, in this year, that is going to be about the middle of July. So \nif you do the countdown of when we are in session, we have probably 5, \n6 weeks left to consider nominations before they die under the \nunwritten Thurmond rule. So what the Republicans are doing is running \nout the clock on these 20 people. We shouldn't be surprised. If they \nwould do this on a nomination to fill a vacancy on the highest Court of \nthe land, it shouldn't surprise us they would do the same thing when it \ncomes to these 20 nominees. What are they waiting for? Why don't they \nwant to approve these noncontroversial judges? They are waiting in \nprayerful reflection for the election of Donald Trump as President.\n  Mr. President, you know that many people in your party have mixed \nfeelings about the candidacy of Mr. Donald Trump. But I would say, \nstepping aside from the merits of his candidacy, we shouldn't have \nmixed feelings when it comes to the Constitution, and the Constitution \nis explicit when it comes to vacancies on the Supreme Court. The \nFounding Fathers, in the Constitution--quoted a few minutes ago by my \ncolleague from California--in article II, section 2, didn't mince words \nor equivocate. They said the President shall appoint nominees to fill \nvacancies on the Supreme Court, subject to the advice and consent of \nthe Senate.\n  We both have a role. The President is required by the Constitution to \nappoint someone to fill a vacancy. And 3 months ago, the untimely \npassing of Justice Antonin Scalia created that vacancy. Two months \nago--56 days ago--President Obama nominated Merrick Garland to be the \nnext Justice on the Supreme Court. The President met his constitutional \nresponsibility. But the Republicans in the Senate announced, hours \nafter Justice Scalia was found to have passed away, they would not even \nconsider a nominee by this President to fill that vacancy--not a \nhearing, not a vote.\n  You might say to yourself: Well, that is politics in Washington. \nShould we expect anything different? Should we expect a Republican \nSenate to approve a nominee from a Democrat? Come on, this is hard ball \nhere; this isn't bean bag.\n  Well, let me tell you a little story. In 1988, with a vacancy on the \nSupreme Court, Republican President Ronald Reagan, in his last year in \noffice, nominated Anthony Kennedy to fill that vacancy and sent the \nnominee to this Chamber in the Senate when it was controlled by the \nDemocratic side. What did the Democratic majority say to the Republican \nPresident, trying to fill a Supreme Court vacancy? We know our \nresponsibility. And that Senate, under control of the Democrats, took \nup the name offered by the Republican President, approved him, and sent \nhim to the Supreme Court in 1988.\n  So to argue ``This is just typical politics. Don't make a lot of \nnoise. We do this all the time''--let me make it clear: What the \nRepublican Senate majority is doing today has never--underline that \nword ``never''--happened in the history of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  This is disrespect for a constitutional provision that is explicit. \nThis is disrespect for a Court which now sits with 8 members on the \nCourt--a Court which could find itself--and already has in several \ninstances--tied 4 to 4. How important is that? Let me read a quote from \nback in 1987: ``Every day that passes with the Supreme Court below full \nstrength impairs the people's business in that crucially important \nbody.'' Who made that statement? Republican President Ronald Reagan. \nWhat he said then applies now.\n  What the Republican majority is doing in the Senate--refusing Merrick \nGarland a hearing and a vote, holding up on the calendar 20 nominees \nwho should be on the Federal bench--is obstructionism at its worst. It \nis what the people are sick of across this country. It is disrespectful \nto the Constitution, it is obstructionism, and it is pure politics.\n  Why? Why are they so determined to keep this vacancy? Some of them, \nas I said, are dreaming of the possibility of a President Trump picking \nthe next Justice on the Supreme Court. I will let your mind race away \nwith the possibilities if ``The Donald'' is going to choose the next \nJustice on the Supreme Court, but others really bring it down to a much \nmore basic level.\n  There are special interest groups who want to make sure the next \nJustice on the Supreme Court is their friend. They do not want to run \nthe risk that someone is going to be put on the Court who will not rule \nin their favor. So they are praying their political prayer: Hang on, \nhang on, Senate Republicans. Take the grief that two-thirds of the \nAmerican people think you are wrong in what you are doing and be \nprepared to accept that grief if you want the support of these special \ninterest groups.\n  That is what this comes down to. It is the sad reality of politics in \nWashington today. And I will tell you, there is blame for both sides on \nmany issues, but on this one there is crystal-clear clarity. The \nPresident has met his constitutional responsibility. The Senate \nRepublican leaders, for the first time in the history of the United \nStates of America, are denying a Supreme Court nominee a hearing and a \nvote. That is fundamentally wrong under the Constitution and \nfundamentally unfair to Merrick Garland.\n  Merrick Garland was born in Illinois, so maybe I am partial to him a \nlittle bit, but he has quite a record. He has been touted as one of the \nbest nominees in terms of qualifications. He is now the chief judge of \nthe D.C. Circuit Court, right below the Supreme Court. That is a big \njob, but he is the man for it, according to people from both political \nparties.\n  Solicitors General of the United States of America just sent a letter \nto the Senate. Nine of them signed, Democrats and Republicans. These \nare men and women who have argued before the Supreme Court representing \nthe United States of America--attorneys who are familiar with that \nCourt, the gravity of the decisions they face, the requirements to \nserve on the Court--and\n\n[[Page S2685]]\n\nunanimously, Democrats and Republicans, they said to the Senate: \nMerrick Garland is the right man to serve on the Supreme Court.\n  We come today with sadness, and even more with a sense of injustice \nthat the Republicans would allow this political gambit to continue. To \nthink that they are waiting for President Donald Trump to fill this \nvacancy is almost impossible to say or to believe, but it is a fact.\n  I will close by saying I have checked the Constitution, and I check \nit regularly. There has been no change in the provision that says, in \nNovember of 2012, Barack Obama was reelected President of the United \nStates to serve for 4 years--4 full years--and that would include this \nyear. The Republican argument that he is out of business now and we \nwill wait for the next President defies the verdict of the American \npeople in that election. By 5 million votes they said: Barack Obama, \nyou are the President of the United States for 4 years, with the powers \nattendant to that office. The denial by Republicans of that \nconstitutional reality is a reflection on their feelings about a \ndocument which they have sworn individually to uphold and defend.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago we received the initial report \non economic growth in the first quarter of 2016. The news was not good. \nAs my colleague, the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Sullivan, has pointed out \nmany times on the floor and in many forums, our economy grew at a \ndismal rate of one-half of 1 percent during the first 3 months of \n2016--one-half of 1 percent economic growth. In other words, the \neconomy barely grew at all.\n  While this report was particularly terrible, the truth is, weak \neconomic growth has become the norm under the Obama administration. \nSince the recession ended in June of 2009, the economy has grown at an \naverage rate of just 2.1 percent. In the typical post-1960 recovery, by \ncontrast, economic growth averaged 3.7 percent. That is a huge \ndifference. It is the difference between a stagnant economy and a \nflourishing economy--and, for millions of American families, it is the \ndifference between surviving and thriving.\n  Middle-class families are making 6.5 percent less than they were \nmaking in 2007, before the start of the great recession. A large part \nof the reason for that is the sluggish economic growth we have \nexperienced in the Obama recovery. For too many families, this slow \nrecovery has meant the end of cherished dreams--the dream of owning \ntheir own home, the dream of sending their kids to college, the dream \nof a secure retirement--and the kind of growth we need to escape from \nthese economic doldrums is nowhere in sight.\n  In fact, the Obama economy has led some economists to wonder if 2 \npercent growth is the new normal. Right now, the Federal Reserve is \nprojecting the economy will grow at a median rate of just 2.2 percent \nin 2016 and 2.1 percent in 2017. I would argue, based upon the 0.5 \npercent economic growth the first quarter of this year, they may be \ndramatically overshooting the rate of economic growth if the current \ntrend continues, and the St. Louis Fed expects that weak growth to \ncontinue for the next decade. That is very bad news for American \nfamilies who are facing a less prosperous future with less economic \nopportunity and mobility.\n  During the entire postwar period from 1947 to 2013, our Nation \naveraged 3.3 percent economic growth. At that pace, Americans' standard \nof living almost doubles every 30 years, incomes rise, financial \nsecurity increases, and more people are able to afford homes, take \nvacations, and save for higher education. On the other hand, at the \npace of growth we have seen since 2007, it will take far longer for the \nstandard of living to double.\n  Fortunately, we are not condemned to weak economic growth. If we look \nat the President's record, it is easy to see why our economy is still \nsputtering along: We had a failed $1 trillion stimulus program; $1.7 \ntrillion in new taxes; the President's health care law, which raised \npremiums for families and increased costs for small businesses; more \nthan 2,700 new Federal regulations--and counting, we are not done yet--\nget added to by the day; and a Federal debt that has nearly doubled on \nthe President's watch and more.\n  The President's policies don't have to be permanent. We can repeal \nObamaCare and the incredible burdens it is placing on so many families \nand small businesses. We can replace it with something that makes more \nsense, creates competition, gives consumers more choices, and drives \ndown prices.\n  We can replace the President's tax hikes with comprehensive tax \nreform that focuses on lowering taxes for families and making America \nthe best place in the world to do business, we can take serious action \nto address the spending that is fueling our national debt, and we can \nrepeal some of the thousands of burdensome regulations the President \nhas imposed during his tenure.\n  It is easy to forget that every regulation the government imposes, no \nmatter how small, has a cost--and those costs are paid by American \nfamilies and American businesses. Take the national energy tax the \nPresident imposed on coal-fired powerplants. This rule will potentially \ndrive up electricity bills for families by hundreds of dollars each \nyear, and it will be especially harmful to low-income families and \nseniors who are living on fixed incomes.\n  Take the President's decision to allow the EPA to regulate ponds and \nditches on private land. This regulation will have significant economic \nimpacts for farmers and property owners who will likely be hit with new \nFederal permits, compliance costs, and the threat of significant fines. \nOver the past 7-plus years, the Obama administration has imposed more \nthan 2,700 regulations, including hundreds of major regulations. When I \nsay ``major,'' those are regulations that cost American families and \nbusinesses more than $100 million each year. Out-of-touch Washington \nbureaucrats reaching into our States and imposing regulatory burdens \nfrom afar has become all too common in the Obama administration. \nRepealing some of the worst of these regulations would drastically \nreduce the burdens facing American families and businesses, and that \nwould put more money in American families' pockets and free American \nbusinesses to do what they do best; that is, to innovate and create \nnew, good-paying jobs.\n  If we continue on the path we are on right now, we might be the first \ngeneration of Americans to leave the next generation of Americans worse \noff, but we don't have to be. We can reverse the course the President \nhas set during his administration and put in place the kind of policies \nthat will create conditions that are favorable to economic growth, to \ngrow our economy and lift the burdens on American families.\n  Republicans in the Senate have already been working to undo the worst \npolicies of the Obama administration. We are going to continue to fight \nuntil our Nation's economy is thriving and all families have the \nopportunity to achieve the American dream.\n  If we can just achieve 1 percentage point additional growth in the \neconomy each year, we are told by leading economists that would add 1.3 \nmillion jobs to our economy, raise wages by $9,000 a year, and generate \nan additional $300 billion of Federal revenue that would make our \nfiscal picture look a lot smaller by comparison.\n  We have to get spending under control. We have to reform entitlement \nprograms that are unsustainable, that are going to bankrupt future \ngenerations of Americans, to get our fiscal house in order, but we also \nhave to grow the economy at a faster rate. One-half of 1 percent is not \nadequate--nor is 1 percent, nor is 2 percent. We need to get back to a \nnormal growth period in our economy. As I said, since the end of World \nWar II, 3.3 percent has been the average, 3.7 percent has been the norm \nin a recovery coming out of a recession. If we get to that level of \ngrowth, we will see millions of new jobs in our economy, we will see \nAmerican families getting their wages back to where they are growing \nwith the economy, better paying jobs for American workers, and a fiscal \npicture that looks a lot more manageable than the one we face today.\n  Economic growth is key to so many things that affect Americans' lives \non a\n\n[[Page S2686]]\n\ndaily basis. We in the Senate ought to be focused like a laser on what \nwe can do to put the right policies in place that would encourage and \npromote economic growth, rather than coming up with new ways to make it \nmore difficult and more expensive in this economy to create jobs. Far \ntoo often, everything that happens in Washington, DC, today leads to \nmore expenses, more mandates, more requirements, more regulations, and \nhigher taxes, making it more difficult for our economy to get to that \nfaster growth that is so important if we are going to make Americans' \nstandard of living and quality of life better and hand off to the next \ngeneration a standard of living they deserve and that will improve on \nthe one we enjoy today. That is what this is all about, and that is \nwhat we ought to be focused on.\n  I am pleased the Senator from Alaska is here. I am told the Senator \nfrom Indiana will be joining him in just a minute to discuss the \nsubject. The Senator from Alaska, Mr. Sullivan, has been a great \nadvocate of growth in our economy and has been down on the floor \ntalking about the implications of a half percent of growth and what \nthat means; that if we don't change that trajectory and change it soon, \nwe are going to continue down a path that makes it more and more \ndifficult for American families to get ahead. That needs to change--\nfaster growth, higher growth, the right kind of policies--to make that \npossible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I compliment my good friend from South \nDakota, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, for coming down and \nleading the discussion on a very important topic that, to be honest, we \nare not talking about nearly enough in the Senate--and certainly the \nObama administration is not talking about nearly enough--and that is \nthe importance of our economy.\n  I was on the floor a couple weeks ago and I made a prediction. I said \nthere is going to be big economic news coming out, and my prediction \nwas that nobody in the administration was going to talk about it and \nnone of our friends in the media were going to talk about it. \nUnfortunately, my prediction came true.\n  The big news, as Chairman Thune said, is that last quarter we grew at \n0.5 percent GDP growth. We essentially didn't grow. We didn't grow. The \ngreat American economy, the thing that has made us great as a country \nfor 200-plus years, just stalled--and nobody talked. The Obama \nadministration didn't talk about it. The media didn't talk about it.\n  When we talk about gross domestic product, this is essentially the \nhealth of the economy. It is the measure of opportunity in America. \nUnfortunately, what we saw last quarter was additional proof that the \nObama administration on this critical issue--economic growth for our \ncitizens--is one of the worst in U.S. history. It is not just me saying \nthat. People should take a look at these numbers. These numbers are \nactually from the administration and other administrations. This looks \nat recent economic growth for the last 50 years, starting with \nPresident Kennedy's administration, but as my colleague from South \nDakota said, the average growth for the United States in our 200-plus-\nyear history has been about 3.7 percent GDP growth.\n  We look at this chart--and this is very bipartisan, of course--almost \n4 percent GDP growth average for the country. This is what has made us \ngreat, strong. We look at this chart, and it shows the ups and downs. \nThis red line is 3 percent GDP growth, which is considered pretty good. \nIt is not great but pretty good. We certainly should be targeting that.\n  Look at the Obama administration right here in the corner. It has \nnever even hit 3 percent GDP growth--not once, not even in one \nquarter--ever.\n  What we are seeing right here, in the almost 10 years of President \nObama, relative to any other administration, Democratic or Republican--\nJohnson, Nixon, even Carter, Reagan, Clinton, real strong growth \nthere--clearly, the Obama administration has been, by any measure, a \nlost decade of economic growth. Unfortunately, you don't hear the \nadministration talking about it at all. You can understand why. It is \nan abysmal record. But the truth is, if you look back in history and \nthat news came out--whether it was a Democratic or Republican \nadministration--the Secretary of the Treasury would have said: Don't \nworry America, we know you are hurting; we have a plan. The Secretary \nof Commerce would have said: We have ideas on growing the economy; we \nknow that 0.5 percent GDP growth--essentially flat growth, no growth--\nis not the historical tradition of America. Historically, Cabinet \nmembers in any administration would have told us: We know it is a \nproblem, and here is how we are going to fix it.\n\n  When this news came out 2 weeks ago, we heard nothing from this \nadministration--nothing. When they do talk about the economy, there are \ntypically three types of responses: One is, as my colleague from South \nDakota mentioned, there is this talk in Washington about the ``new \nnormal.'' In my view, it is one of the most dangerous phrases being \nbantered about in DC. The new normal says that we know America has been \ngrowing at this robust rate, almost 4 percent GDP growth for most of \nour history, but there are new factors, and we should not expect that \nanymore. We shouldn't even expect 3 percent. Let's just dumb down our \nexpectations.\n  They talk about the new normal. The new normal should be about 1.5, 2 \npercent GDP growth, maybe. The people in Washington are telling the \nrest of the country: You guys should be satisfied with that. We \nshouldn't be. That is a surrender of the American dream. So that is one \nresponse--the new normal.\n  The second thing the President has done for a while, but he can't do \nit anymore, unfortunately. He has looked around the world and said: \nWell, at least we are growing better than Europe or Japan or Brazil. \nReally, the only measure that actually matters is not another country; \nit is how do we stack up against America? He does not want to talk \nabout that, so he talks about Europe. He can't talk about Europe \nanymore because we are growing at 0.5 percent GDP growth, and last \nquarter Europe grew at 2.2 percent. It is not great, but it is \ncertainly better than ours. Obviously, they have to get rid of that \ntalking point.\n  The third thing they do is come out and try to tell us: Hey, you know \nwhat, you are actually doing better. I know you are feeling horrible \nand your wages haven't gone up, but you are doing better, trust me.\n  In a New York Times article, the President recently lamented that, \nlooking back, he didn't sell all the great stuff he was doing on the \neconomy. He didn't sell it better. I don't think he needs to sell it. \nMost people feel it, and it is not great. He even said:\n\n       Anybody who says we are not absolutely better off today \n     than we were just seven years ago, they're not leveling with \n     you. They're not telling the truth. By almost every economic \n     measure, we are significantly better off.\n\n  I think it is astounding that the President of the United States is \nsaying that kind of stuff to the American people because it is simply \nnot true.\n  Let me provide some facts. The story they tell is of a country that \nby almost every economic measure is actually worse off than we were \nwhen the Obama administration started. In the past 8 years, the labor \nforce participation rate has slid to its lowest measure since the mid-\n1970s. Essentially, that is people who have quit looking for a job \nbecause they can't find one.\n  According to the most recent census data, the percentage of Americans \nbelow the poverty line in the last 8 years has grown. It is up almost 4 \npercent. Real median household incomes in the last 8 years have \ndeclined from $54,900 to $53,600. Since the President took office, food \nstamp participation has actually soared. It is up by almost 40 percent. \nThe percentage of Americans who own homes--a marker of the promise of \nthe American dream--is down 5 percent. This is all in the 8 years, 7\\1/\n2\\ years, since President Obama has been in office.\n  The late Vice President Hubert Humphrey once said:\n\n       Propaganda, to be effective, must be believed. To be \n     believed, it must be credible. To be credible, it must be \n     true.\n\n  No matter how much this administration uses soaring speeches or \narticles from media sources that have been favorably disposed toward \nthem or\n\n[[Page S2687]]\n\nclever tweets insisting that the economy is doing well, it simply is \nnot. These are the facts, and Americans know it. Americans know it.\n  We are spending more on housing and food. Wages are stagnant. As I \nhave mentioned, many have given up looking for good jobs. Some are \nquestioning the ability to put their kids through college.\n  What is interesting is that Washington, DC, is doing fine. When you \ngrow the government the way we have in the last 8 years, this part of \nthe country actually never had a recession. It is not one of the \nrichest places in America, right here in Washington, and that is why so \nmany in the DC press corps weren't writing about this. The President \nsays the economy is doing well, so it must be doing well.\n  I think the good news is that even now the media is starting to pick \nup on this because the problem is so pervasive. In this election \nseason, this is what we are hearing Americans talk about.\n  Here is a heading from a recent Atlantic article: ``The lonely \npoverty of America's white working class.'' Here is another one from \nthe same publication: ``The Resurrection of America's Slums.'' Here is \none from another publication: ``Poverty in America: the Deepening \nCrisis.''\n  Recently, there have been numerous articles about how poverty leads \nto addictions and to higher mortality rates. The New Yorker had an \narticle entitled ``Life-Expectancy Inequality Grows in America.''\n  The Washington Post is now starting to do some heartbreaking stories \nabout poverty, death, and economic despair in our great country. \nTalking about the recent West Virginia primary election, the Washington \nPost stated: ``But many poorer, less-educated folks who have been left \nbehind in the 21st century--the ones who have seen their wages \nstagnate, their opportunities for upward mobility disappear and their \nlife expectancies shorten--are looking to disrupt a status quo that has \nnot worked for them.''\n  What does this mean for our great country, our citizens? One \nindication is, in poll after poll, Americans are telling us they are \nrunning out of hope. Sixty-five percent of Americans now believe the \ncountry is on the wrong track. That is not surprising. We never hit 3 \npercent GDP growth in the last decade.\n  The vast majority of Americans don't believe their kids are going to \nbe better off than they are. They are telling us that the quality that \nhas made America great, the quality that is in the DNA of the United \nStates, and that is progress, is losing out to this idea of the new \nnormal. It is a new normal where our children are not going to be \nbetter off than we are, where we can't grow the economy. The American \ndream is all about progress. We need to remember that. We can't settle \nfor another lost decade of economic growth. We can't settle for \nstagnation.\n  A number of my colleagues, particularly on the other side of the \naisle, come to the Senate floor--and I have respect for everybody in \nthis great body--and they talk about the moral imperatives they believe \nare important, moral imperative on this topic, moral imperative on \nanother topic, but they rarely talk about the moral imperative of \ngrowth and opportunity. To me, that is the biggest moral imperative we \nhave, with the exception of national defense in this body.\n  It is a moral imperative to recognize that we have experienced a lost \ndecade of economic growth. We have a moral imperative to talk about the \npervasive poverty, what that does to our citizens, how it creates holes \nin the social fabric that holds us together, and how, when our own \ncitizens fall through those holes, a piece of all of us goes with them \nbecause although we are individuals, we are all Americans together.\n  We have a moral imperative to tell our fellow citizens that working \ntogether we don't have to accept this, the new normal. We have the \nmoral imperative to lift up American workers with policies that \nactually help them.\n  Like most Americans, I was shocked when Presidential candidate \nHillary Clinton said that under her administration she would put coal \nminers out of work. Here is the quote: ``We are going to put a lot of \ncoal miners and coal companies out of business.'' That is shocking. \nThink about that. I come from a State where there is a lot of mining. \nThese are great jobs. These are important jobs. These are important for \nthe national economy of America. To have a candidate say that she \nintends to put coal miners out of work is part of the problem.\n  As Senator Thune mentioned, the other part of the problem is that \nWashington is no longer a partner in opportunity for coal miners, for \nworkers, for growing the economy, but it has become an obstacle.\n  We have to do a lot to get this economy moving. My colleague from \nSouth Dakota mentioned a number of ideas. We are going to be on the \nfloor talking about them--the moral imperative to provide economic \nopportunity and hope for Americans.\n  One thing for certain we have to do is get control of the Federal \nGovernment that wants to regulate every single aspect of our lives and \neconomy. This is a chart that shows how Federal rules from this town go \nstraight up. Every year there are more. As a matter of fact, the Obama \nadministration is going to be the first in U.S. history to have \nproposed in a single year 80,000 pages of new Federal regs. If you \nthink that is going to help the coal miners or other Americans or \nworking-class families with hope and opportunity, that is not the right \nsolution. What we need is less government and more economic freedom and \nthe truth about what is going on with this great economy of ours in our \ngreat country. That is what we are going to continue to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alaska, Senator \nSullivan, for what he just presented to us here. He hit the nail right \non the head. Along with our colleague from South Dakota, I want to add \nmy voice to what has been said here.\n  As chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, we pay a lot of \nattention to the state of the economy. We are presented with numbers \nand facts about where we are as a nation. The refrain that is becoming \nall too familiar; that is, we really are in a stagnant position, not \ngoing anywhere.\n  Of all the statistics that come to us, two stand out here just \nrecently. One is the fact that the April jobs report was significantly \nlower than it needs to be in order to provide meaningful jobs for \nAmericans who are searching for jobs, and for Americans trying to move \nfrom part-time jobs to full-time permanent jobs, to put some certainty \ninto their lives. With just 160,000 jobs created in April, basically \nthat covers those who are retiring--maybe fewer than that--but \ncertainly not the number of new jobs that give an indication of growth \nin the economy. That was a disappointing number, and obviously Wall \nStreet paid attention to it. Hopefully it won't be repeated, but it is \na worrying signal that we are not creating the kind of dynamic growth \nin the economy that will put our out-of-work individuals across this \ncountry back to work, that will provide opportunities for our young \npeople who are graduating from college and high school this month and \nnext month. That is nowhere near the number of jobs we need to even \nreach an average growth rate over the years, as my colleague from \nAlaska said.\n\n  I think we have had eleven major recessions from World War II to the \npresent. The recovery rate out of each of those recessions has been at \n4 percent. That rate of growth provided new hope for the people who \nlost their jobs and new hope for those coming out of educational \ninstitutions to secure a good job and begin the process of building a \nfamily, buying a home, and living the American dream. Yet this \nrecovery--from a recession that began in late 2007 with the collapse of \nLehman Brothers and the bank failures has been long. It was a deep \nrecession. And it has taken a considerable amount of time to get moving \nin the right direction.\n  Clearly, after the last 7\\1/2\\ years of the Obama administration, we \nhave not begun to achieve the kind of recovery that has been the \naverage of all the recoveries since the end of World War II. We've been \nabout half of that, and because the recoveries have been half of that, \nwe have not been able to provide opportunity for the American people.\n  I think what we have seen here can best be defined as a result of the \nfailed policies by this administration. We\n\n[[Page S2688]]\n\nhave policies that have raised taxes significantly on the American \npeople even though their incomes have not increased. We have had \npolicies of overspending here in Washington to the point where our \nnational debt--based on years of deficit spending--has almost doubled \nfrom $10.7 trillion when this administration began to over $19 trillion \nafter their 7\\1/2\\ years of governing and putting policies in place \nthat have clearly failed.\n  You can come to no other conclusion, despite what the White House \nputs out. The American people know better because their situation is in \ncontrast to the White House saying that things are going well and that \nwe are on the march forward. When the American people compare that with \ntheir situation, there is no comparison to be made whatsoever.\n  Deficit spending, plunging into debt, and overregulation are \nburdening innovators and burdening businesses from having the ability \nto expand their business. Overtaxing and clearly overspending. Those \nthree policies determine economic growth.\n  I have had the great privilege of representing a State that has done \njust the opposite. Under Republican leadership, our State has \ncontrolled spending, controlled regulations, and put innovative \nprocesses in place that have allowed our State to thrive and grow. We \ncame out of a deep deficit situation some years ago and have turned \nthat around to the point where we now have a triple-A credit rating. We \nwent from deficit spending, which caused borrowing, to a surplus well \nover $2 billion. We have become an attractive State to live and do \nbusiness in.\n  Let me state a couple of things that have been said about our State. \nChief Executive Magazine recently named Indiana one of the top five \nStates in the Nation for business. The magazine asked 513 chief \nexecutive officers to rank the States they were familiar with on tax \nand regulatory regime, workforce quality, and living environment. Let \nme state a couple of their quotes.\n\n       Indiana . . . has its act together and is impressive.\n       Indiana . . . has consistently ranked in the top 3 in \n     offering not just competitive incentives for business, but \n     also packages that improve the skill sets to hire a \n     qualified, work-ready workforce.\n\n  Don Brown, chief executive officer of Indianapolis-based Interactive \nIntelligence, Inc., recently said that the State's low costs and low \ntaxes allow job creators to invest more resources into their businesses \nand their employees. He went on to say:\n\n       Limited regulations make it easy to grow here, freeing up \n     time, which is perhaps an entrepreneur's most coveted gift. . \n     . . We have great universities turning out lots of talented \n     graduates. . . . The public and private sectors work \n     effectively together in an effort to improve conditions for \n     everybody.\n\n  How I wish that quote would reflect what is happening here in \nWashington. How I wish I could use that quote to say this is what is \nhappening across the United States. I wish I could use that quote to be \nable to say that under the direction of this President and with the \nsupport of this Congress, we have reined in our overspending, tamped \ndown our overregulation, put incentives in place to create jobs, and \nput policies in place that to create economic growth. Unfortunately, \nthat is not the case, as has been made clear by my colleagues, and the \ncase I am trying to make now.\n  The contrast between a geographic entity called a State and the \nFederal Government and the policies which govern that State and govern \nour Federal Government in the three areas of taxation, regulation, and \nspending is dramatic. Why wouldn't we look at the States that have \nsucceeded? Why wouldn't we look to the policies implemented by a State \nthat has succeeded and demonstrated dynamic economic growth over the \nsame timeframe as the Federal Government, who has done exactly the \nopposite relative to taxation, regulation, and spending, and draw the \nclear conclusion that the policies that have been implemented by this \nadministration have failed?\n  Let's stop pointing fingers at what the motives are. Let's just look \nat the results, and the results are very clear: We have a stagnant \nnational economy, people not receiving opportunities to increase their \nincome. If you go back to what the average earnings in America per \nfamily were at the start of this administration, it was $3,000 higher \nthan it is today.\n  Whatever releases come out of the White House or whatever the \nspokesman for the President says or the President himself says just \nsimply doesn't match up to the facts. The facts are related to the \npolicies that either have been put in place. It is clear that in the \nremaining months of this administration, those policies are not going \nto change. Simply there is denial of the fact that the country is not \ngrowing at a rate that provides opportunity and gives us hope for the \nfuture.\n  But we do have a model, and my State is not the only model. We have \nmodels of States that have done exactly the opposite of that. Yes, they \nhave regulations, but they are there for safety and health. They are \nbeneficial and were not put in place to micromanage how businesses \noperate. States have been careful with the tax dollars and revenue that \ncome in, and they balance their fiscal budget on an annual basis. They \ndon't throw themselves ever deeper into debt. They recognized that is \nnot the path to growth, and they spend the taxpayers' money wisely.\n  Overtaxation, overregulation, and overspending clearly are not the \npath to economic growth. It is clear that the path is just the opposite \nof that.\n  In the remaining months I have here, I will keep talking about this \nissue. I hope my colleagues will pay attention and make decisions on \nthe basis of fact, not on the basis of ideology or what they have been \ntold by the administration or the President. They need to look at the \nresults, and the results are dramatic in terms of application of the \nbasic principles that stimulate economic growth and provide hope for \nthe American people.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                 Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act\n\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, when Senators rise on this floor, typically \nwe are identifying problems, we are talking about how to solve them, \nand we are talking about how prior actions haven't quite worked. Today \nI have the pleasure of rising for the opposite reason. I am here to \ntalk about something that has worked, something that we did, something \nthat we worked on together on a bipartisan basis that has made an \nenormous difference for the students of our country.\n  In the spring of 2013, there was an impending deadline. The interest \nrate on student loans, which in the past had been set by statute by \nCongress without regard to what the underlying economics were at the \ntime or what the borrowing rate of the Federal Government was--it was \nan arbitrary number set by Congress, and it was due to double. In July \nof 2013, it was due to double to 6.8 percent.\n  There was a proposal put forward by the leadership and by the Members \non this side of the aisle which did not get sufficient votes. There was \nanother proposal put forth by the Senators on the other side of the \naisle which also didn't get enough votes. We were left with a situation \nwith no proposal on the floor and an impending deadline that would have \ndoubled rates for student loans for millions of students across the \ncountry. At that point, a small, bipartisan group of us got together \nand said: There has to be a better way to find a solution. We can't let \nthis happen to our students.\n  This is a particularly important time of the year to talk about this \nbecause this is when students are finding out where they are going to \ncollege next year, they are making their arrangements for financial \naid, and they are thinking about what their commitment will be. Well, \nas of this afternoon, those students are going to be able to breathe a \nbit of a sigh of relief because we just learned that the interest rate \non student loans taken out for next year based upon the cost of \nborrowing for the U.S. Government will be 3.76 percent. That is the \nlowest it has been in a decade, and it is considerably below--by almost \nhalf--what it would have been had we not come to that solution on that \nhot summer day in the middle of the summer of 2013.\n  The group of people who worked on this and put it together were, as I \nsaid, a bipartisan group. The group consisted of Senator Richard Burr \nof North Carolina; Senator Manchin; Senator Tom Coburn, my friend from \nOklahoma; Senator Alexander; Senator\n\n[[Page S2689]]\n\nTom Carper; Senator Dick Durbin; and Senator Tom Harkin. We had a lot \nof meetings, discussions, negotiations, and ultimately worked together \nto determine a fair and equitable way to set the rate for student loans \nfrom the Federal Government based upon the Federal Government's own \ncost of borrowing money and combined the best ideas from both plans. We \ngot the strong support of the President, who encouraged the Democratic \nMembers of our group to join in these negotiations, and we reached a \nconsensus. The Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act passed this body \nwith something like 80 votes, and that has made a real difference for \nour students.\n\n  Here are some numbers: $50 billion, $5 billion, $275 million. Those \nare the answers. What are the questions?\n  The first is, $50 billion is the amount of money students will save \nover the next 10 years based upon the difference of what the interest \nrate would have been and what it is going to be. This says 3.8 percent. \nWe made this yesterday. It is actually lower; it is 3.76 percent. But \nthis differential over 10 years equals $50 billion in the pockets of \nstudents across this country. That is a $5 billion-a-year difference in \nwhat they will have to pay in interest and what they would have paid \nhad the law not been changed. That is an enormous amount of money for \nour students. In the State of Maine, the New America Foundation has \nestimated that this translates into over $275 million in interest \nsavings to students just in the State of Maine.\n  Well, those are big numbers: $275 million, $50 billion, $5 billion. \nSo what does it mean in reality to an individual student? Here is what \nwe are talking about. Under the old law, an individual typical \nundergraduate would have paid $17,000 in interest as opposed to \n$10,000. That is at least $6,000 that goes into the pockets of our \nstudents. That is going to make a real difference.\n  I am delighted that we have had this success and that we have been \nable to report something that has actually been done right around here \nand then has truly benefited millions of students across this country, \nbut we have plenty of work still to do. College is still too expensive. \nThe burden of student debt generally is very heavy and weighs on not \nonly the students but our economy. We need to reauthorize the Higher \nEducation Act. We need to enact meaningful changes in the whole \nstructure of how colleges can keep their prices affordable. We need to \ngive students the tools they need to succeed. We also need to look at \nthe structure of student loan programs to simplify, A, how you apply, \nand B, how you pay them back, how the structure is, and have simple, \neasily understood techniques to pay back according to your means, \naccording to what you are earning at the time, an earnings-based \nrepayment schedule so that students don't exit college with this \nenormous burden. One student told me: Senator, I feel like I have a \nmortgage but no house. That is essentially what is happening.\n  So what I am talking about today is truly good news, but it is not \nthe end of the story and we should not say: Well, we have taken care of \nthat issue. Let's move forward.\n  I do think every now and then it is important to acknowledge that \noccasionally the policies work out, and this is one that has worked out \nspectacularly for the students of America. Fifty billion dollars over \nthe next 10 years will be saved by students who would otherwise be \npaying that money in interest, and that is money they can invest in \ntheir own futures and so can make a better life for themselves, their \nfamilies, and our country.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to acknowledge the work that was done by \nthis entire body and by the House and by the President to resolve what \nwould have been a true crisis for our students and to move it toward a \nmuch more manageable solution. I look forward to continuing to work on \nthis issue and to keeping in touch with Chairman Alexander and Members \nof this body who are interested in continuing to work on this issue of \nthe cost of college and how student loans are structured in order to \nmake them work most effectively and fairly for the young people of this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3888\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my amendment No. \n3888. I am proud to join my colleagues from Nebraska, Kansas, and \nColorado to offer this bipartisan amendment. Our three States are \nsignatories to the Republican River Compact, which allocates the water \nresources from the Republican River Basin as it travels across our \nStates.\n  Through this allocation process, our States work closely with the \nRepublican River Compact Administration and the Bureau of Reclamation \nto help ensure the most efficient utilization of our waters as they \nhead to families and businesses across the region. In Nebraska we value \nclean water. Our citizens go to great lengths to preserve and protect \nthese resources.\n  However, in recent years, the Bureau of Reclamation has violated \nadministrative orders issued by Nebraska, Kansas, and Colorado with no \njustification for their actions. This lack of accountability from the \nBOR is costing money. It is limiting citizens' access to precious water \nresources.\n  Our bipartisan amendment that is before us would halt funding for the \nBOR when it violates State orders. Federal law already requires the BOR \nto comply with the States through interstate compacts. Our amendment \nwould hold this agency accountable for its actions. Our States have a \nright to manage their own water resources for the benefit of compact \ncompliance.\n  But through its action, the BOR has effectively altered those \ncompacts. This agency was not created to operate unilaterally and exert \nveto power over the decisions States make to comply with compacts. Our \namendment will ensure that Nebraska, Colorado, and Kansas retain \ncontrol of their waters. It will protect other States that have these \ninterstate compacts from the consequential actions of an unaccountable \nFederal agency.\n  Nebraska and its neighbors in Kansas and Colorado are good stewards \nof natural resources. We protect our water. We protect it at the State \nand the local levels. These States should be free to preserve their \nresources without unjustified intervention by the Federal Government. I \nurge all of my colleagues to consider this amendment, to consider the \nimpact of a Federal agency overreaching and violating the rights of \nStates to determine how to control, how to manage, how to work \ntogether, and how to work within compacts in order to meet the \nobligations they have.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Moran). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Department of Education Rulemaking\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I have come across an embarrassing \nsituation. The U.S. Department of Education has apparently earned an F \nfrom the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service in its first \nattempt to write a regulation under the new law fixing No Child Left \nBehind that passed this body with 85 votes last year, passed the House \noverwhelmingly, and that President Obama signed into law in December \ncalling it ``the Christmas miracle.''\n  Most of us will remember this law. I know the Senator from \nPennsylvania had a major role in some provisions in it. This was a law \nto fix a law that everybody wanted fixed. It was 8 years overdue.\n  The law that needed to be fixed was called No Child Left Behind. Over \nthe last several years, what had happened was that the U.S. Department \nof Education had become, in effect, a national school board. Everybody \nwas upset with how much those who worked in the Department of Education \nwere telling teachers, school boards, states, and students in 100,000 \npublic schools what to do. They were telling them what to\n\n[[Page S2690]]\n\ndo about how to evaluate teachers, what to do about what their academic \nstandards should be--adopt common core--telling them what to do about \nhow to use test scores, and saying how to fix a school that might be in \ntrouble. There are seven defined ways to fix a troubled school. People \ngrew so upset with it that we had a massive bipartisan uprising in the \nCongress.\n  It is not easy to get 85 Senators on behalf of a big complex piece of \nlegislation, but we did. The Wall Street Journal said that it was the \nlargest transfer of power from Washington, DC, to the States in 25 \nyears. Almost everybody liked it except some people in the U.S. \nDepartment of Education, who set about almost immediately to try to \nrewrite the law as if they had actually been elected to something.\n  We anticipated that. In this law we took the extraordinary step--we \nin Congress who under article I of the Constitution are elected to \nwrite laws--to write prohibitions into the law.\n  For example, in the law there is a specific provision that said the \nU.S. Department of Education may not tell Tennessee or Pennsylvania or \nany other State what its academic standard must be specifically. It may \nnot tell it that it must adopt common core. That is in the law. That is \na specific prohibition.\n  What I want to talk about today is a report by the Congressional \nResearch Service that Congressman Kline, chairman of the House \nEducation and the Workforce Committee, and I released today that says \nin the very first attempt by the Department to write a regulation \nimplementing the new law, they flunked the test. Those are my words, \nnot those of the Congressional Research Service, but their words are \nnearly as plain as mine.\n  A new report by CRS says that their proposed ``supplement not \nsupplant'' regulation goes beyond ``a plain language reading of the \nstatute'' and is likely against the law.\n  Congressman Kline said:\n\n       The administration spent years dictating national education \n     policy and failed to deliver the quality education every \n     child deserves. Now, the department seems determined to \n     repeat its past mistakes. There is no question this \n     regulation would violate both the letter and intent of the \n     law, and it must be abandoned. Congress and the \n     administration promised to reduce the federal role and \n     restore local control, and we will use every available tool \n     to ensure that promise is kept.\n\n  Mr. President, I know, Congressman Kline knows, and the Members of \nthis body know that a law is not worth the paper it is printed on \nunless it is implemented properly. I am determined, as the chairman \noverseeing the Committee on Education, to make sure that this law is \nimplemented properly.\n  We will have this year six hearings on implementation of this law. \nThere is a coalition of organizations that includes the Nation's \nGovernors, the National Education Association, the American Federation \nof Teachers, the Council of Chief State School Officers, and others. \nThese are people who don't always agree on education policy. They \nhelped pass this law, and they are equally determined to make sure it \nis implemented correctly.\n  They are not just working at a national level. The Governors in \nTennessee and in other States are working with coalitions of those same \norganizations to make sure the law is implemented properly.\n  On April 12, we had a hearing in the Education Committee, and I \ntalked with the newly confirmed Education Secretary about this. I urged \nthe President to appoint an Education Secretary because I wanted \nsomeone there who was accountable to the Senate, and he was confirmed. \nHis responsibility is to discharge his duties faithfully according to \nthe law, but based upon this first regulation, no one seems to be \ntaking that seriously.\n  Let me be specific about it. There is a provision in the law that \ngoes back to about 1970 that says that if you are going to get money \nfrom the Federal Government--we call that title I money--that you have \nto provide at least comparable services with state and local funding in \nschools that get the money and schools that don't, except that teacher \nsalaries may not be included in that computation. That is in the law. \nThat has been there for decades now.\n  Now we had a debate in our committee and on the floor about whether \nwe should change that law. The Senator from Colorado, Mr. Bennet, feels \nvery strongly about it. He said that we ought to change the law to say \nthat teachers' salaries should be included in comparing spending in \ntitle I schools and non-title I schools. I had a different proposal. I \nsaid: Well, I agree with your point, Senator Bennet, but my proposal I \nwould call Scholarship for Kids. Let's just take the Federal dollars in \nTennessee, Pennsylvania, or Maryland and let the States decide to \ncreate $2,100 scholarships--the amount it could be--and follow each \nlow-income child to the school that the child attends. Neither Senator \nBennet's proposal nor my proposal could be adopted by the Senate. So we \ndid not change the law.\n  We then put specifically into the law a provision that said to the \nDepartment of Education that it may not write a regulation in such a \nway that requires parity or equal spending among school districts. That \nis in the law as well. Yet what happens? In the first regulation that \nthe Department of Education sought to do in what we call a negotiated \nrulemaking process, they came up with a scheme, because as the \ndeparting Secretary said, his lawyers are smarter than the people in \nthe Senate or the people who work here. They came up with a scheme and \nrequirements that would violate the law, and the method they chose to \nrequire is prohibited by another provision in the law. I don't call \nthat being clever. I call that just ignoring the law, and I am not \ngoing to put up with it. I am not going to allow the Department of \nEducation to sit here and watch us in both bodies of Congress--by big \nbipartisan majorities and supported by Governors, as well as teachers \nunions--decide that we don't want Washington dictating every little \nthing that happens in the schools, and as soon as the President himself \nsigns the law, they start rewriting it over in his own Department.\n  If this one provision, this rule that the Department came up with, \nwere adopted, these are some of the consequences.\n  It would, No. 1, require a complete costly overhaul of almost all of \nthe State and local finance systems in the country. Maybe they need to \nbe overhauled, but we did not decide that they needed to be, and no one \nis elected in the Department of Education to require that.\n  No. 2, it would require the forcing of thousands and thousands of \nteachers to transfer from one school to another school. Perhaps they \nshould transfer, but there are 100,000 public schools and there are 3.5 \nmillion teachers, and we did not decide in our law that they had to \ntransfer, and the Department can't decide that either.\n  It would require States and local school districts to move back to \nthe burdensome practice of detailing every individual cost on which \nthey spend money to provide a basic educational program to all \nstudents, which is exactly what we were trying to free States and \ndistricts from under the law. We heard from superintendents and from \nschool boards that this nit-picking, ``mother may I'' approach of the \nDepartment bureaucrats was wasting the time of superintendents, school \nboards, and teachers. So we wrote more flexibility into the law. The \nDepartment now wants to take it back.\n  According to the Council of the Great City Schools, this new proposed \nrule would cost $3.9 billion just for the 69 urban school systems to \neliminate the differences in spending between the schools.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks a copy of a statement that Congressman Kline of \nMinnesota, the chairman of the House Education Committee, and I made \nconcerning the report of the Congressional Research Service that says \nlikely that the Department has ``exceeded its statutory authority and \nappears to go beyond what would be required under a plain language \nreading of the statute.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record following my \nremarks a statement I made in connection with the April 12 hearing with \nour Education Committee in the Senate, when Secretary King testified.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record following my \nremarks an editorial from the Wall\n\n[[Page S2691]]\n\nStreet Journal entitled ``Obama's Ed-Run'' that was published on April \n18 of this year.\n  The Wall Street Journal said, among other things, that ``the \nadministration is now rewriting the parts of the law it doesn't like.'' \nA law passed with big bipartisan majorities.\n  This is an intolerable situation. This is a complete flouting of the \nspecific bipartisan intent of large majorities of the Senate and the \nHouse by a small group of people in a single department who know better \nthan to do this. They know better than to do this. They are ignoring \nwhat we have written into law.\n  They are not elected to anything. If they would like to be in the \nCongress or the Senate, they can resign their positions and the \nelections come up this year. They can run, and they can try to change \nthe law. It took us 8 years to debate. We debated these provisions with \nvery good people. The Senator from Colorado, who weighed in on this \nwhole question of parity of spending between school districts, is a \nformer distinguished superintendent of the Denver school district. He \nfeels very passionate about it. I used to be the U.S. Secretary of \nEducation myself. I have a different proposal about how to fix it, and \nI feel pretty passionate about it. But I feel even more passionate that \nif we are going to decide the answer to the question, we are going to \ndecide it here, and it is not going to be decided down the street by \nregulations that are not authorized by law and in a method that is \nspecifically prohibited by the provisions of a law that was signed by \nthe President in December.\n  So this is the first such regulation, but there will be more. I would \nhope that the Secretary of Education and the men and women who work for \nhim would stop and take a deep breath and realize that we were serious \nwhen we passed this law, that we have the broad support of the entire \neducation community across the board, and that I am not going to rest \nuntil I make sure that this law is implemented in the way it was \nwritten. That means that we are going to continue to hold the remainder \nof our six hearings this year. I am going to work with the coalition of \nGovernors, teachers organizations, chief State school officers, and \nothers to put a spotlight on the Department. I am going to urge the \nState departments of education to begin to write their own state \neducation plans, which they then later submit to the Department in \norder to obtain their Federal dollars under the law. Then, if the \nregulations are not consistent with the law, I don't believe they \nshould follow them. That means the State should ask for a hearing. And \nif the Department persists, then the State should go to court to sue \nthe Department.\n\n  If the Department persists, we have our own remedies in the Senate \nand the House of Representatives. We have something called the \nCongressional Review Act. It only takes 51 of us to overturn a final \nrule that we believe is not consistent with the law. We can do that. I \nwill be at the head of the line in trying to do it. We have an \nappropriations process. The U.S. Department of Education has to come \nbefore us and be accountable to us for all of the money they receive.\n  I expect from here on out for those who write the rules to follow the \nlaw. It is not just me saying this, it is not just Congressman Kline \nsaying this, we have the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service \nthat has examined this regulation. I hope my colleagues will look at \nthis report. They have concluded that the regulation the Department \nproposed does not follow the plain language reading of the statute that \nwas enacted and signed into law only last December, and is likely \nagainst the law.\n  This is the first shot across the bow, as far as I am concerned. I am \ngoing to be watching every single one of these regulations. I hope this \ndoes not happen a second or third time or there will be a large number \nof us seeking to do anything we can do to make sure the law is \nimplemented the way it should be.\n  This was the most important law passed by the U.S. Congress last \nyear. It affected 50 million children, 3.5 million teachers, and \n100,000 public schools. It restored to the people closest to the \nchildren the authority for dealing with those children. Everybody \nwanted that. Virtually everybody wanted that except a few people in the \nU.S. Department of Education who cannot keep their hands off America's \n100,000 public schools. They need to do that. They need to learn to do \nthat. They are supposed to create an environment in which teachers, \nstudents, and school boards can succeed; they are not supposed to serve \nas a national school board.\n  Congressman Kline, the chairman of the House committee, and I \nreleased this report today. I call it to the attention of my \ncolleagues. I call it to the attention of the Governors, teachers, \norganizations, and all who care about our schools.\n  I can guarantee you that we are going to keep our eye on the ball and \nmake sure that future regulations are within the authority of the law \nwe passed and that this law--the most important law passed last year by \nthis Congress and signed by the President--is implemented the way \nCongress wrote it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Alexander, Kline: Nonpartisan Government Analysis Confirms Education \n          Department's Proposed Regulation Is Against the Law\n\n       Washington, May 11.--A new report by the non-partisan \n     Congressional Research Service (CRS) finds the Department of \n     Education's proposed ``supplement not supplant'' regulation \n     goes beyond ``a plain language reading of the statute'' and \n     is likely against the law.\n       The CRS report was prepared in response to broad \n     congressional interest in the proposed regulation on the new \n     law that replaced No Child Left Behind and whether the \n     department has the legal authority to issue the regulation. \n     The report found that the department's ``interpretation \n     appears to go beyond what would be required under a plain \n     language reading of the statute,'' and that proposed \n     regulation ``appear[s] to directly conflict with this \n     statutory language, which seems to place clear limits on [the \n     Education Department's] authority.'' The CRS report also \n     states that a ``legal argument could be raised that [the \n     Education Department] exceeded its statutory authority if it \n     promulgates the proposed [supplement not supplant] rules in \n     their current form.''\n       Senate education committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-\n     Tenn.) said: ``This report from the non-partisan \n     Congressional Research Service confirms that what the \n     Education Department is proposing is against the law. So now \n     Congress has told the education secretary it's against the \n     law, a government agency has researched it and said it's \n     against the law, and members of the negotiated rulemaking \n     committee who rejected it said it was against the law. I will \n     use every power of Congress to see that this law is \n     implemented the way Congress wrote it.''\n       House Education and the Workforce Committee Chairman John \n     Kline (R-Minn.) said: ``The administration spent years \n     dictating national education policy and failed to deliver the \n     quality education every child deserves. Now, the department \n     seems determined to repeat its past mistakes. There is no \n     question this regulation would violate both the letter and \n     intent of the law, and it must be abandoned. Congress and the \n     administration promised to reduce the federal role and \n     restore local control, and we will use every available tool \n     to ensure that promise is kept.''\n       In writing the new law last year, Congress debated and \n     ultimately chose to leave unchanged a provision in the law \n     often referred to as ``comparability.'' This provision in the \n     law says school districts have to provide at least comparable \n     services with state and local funding to Title I schools and \n     non-Title I schools.\n       A separate provision, known as ``supplement not supplant'' \n     or SNS, is intended to keep local school districts from using \n     federal Title I dollars as a replacement for state and local \n     dollars in low-income schools.\n       The department's proposed supplement not supplant \n     regulation attempts to change comparability by forcing school \n     districts to include teacher salaries in how they measure \n     their state and local spending and require that state and \n     local spending in Title I schools be at least equal to the \n     average spent in non-Title I schools.\n       The department proposed the regulation to a negotiated \n     rulemaking committee in March, but the committee could not \n     reach agreement on the proposal. Wisconsin Superintendent \n     Tony Evers, a member of the rulemaking committee, warned that \n     ``Congressional intent isn't necessarily being followed \n     here.''\n       On the question of the department's legal authority for its \n     regulations, CRS says: ``The Supreme Court often recites the \n     `plain meaning rule,' that, if the language of the statute is \n     plain and unambiguous, it must be applied according to its \n     terms. Thus, if the language of the statute is clear, there \n     is no need to look outside the statute to its legislative \n     history or other extrinsic sources in order to ascertain the \n     statute's meaning or underlying congressional intent.''\n\n[[Page S2692]]\n\n       ``In the draft proposed rule . . . the Education Department \n     (ED) provided only a limited discussion of how this statutory \n     language gives ED the legal authority to require parity in \n     expenditures in Title I-A and non-Title-I-A schools. \n     According to ED, the reason that the proposal requires that \n     Title I-A schools receive at least as much in state and local \n     funding as non-Title I-A schools is `so that Title I funds \n     can provide truly supplemental support in Title I schools.' . \n     . . . On its face, however, the plain language of the SNS \n     provisions does not appear to require such a result. Notably, \n     the statutory language does not establish any type of \n     standard or requirement regarding how to demonstrate that a \n     Title I-A school receives all of the state and local funds it \n     would have received in the absence of Title I-A funds. . . . \n     ED's interpretation appears to go beyond what would be \n     required under a plain language reading of the statute.''\n       On the question of whether the law specifically prohibits \n     the department from requiring equalized spending, the report \n     says: ``(The Every Student Succeeds Act) retained the Title I \n     prohibition that states: `Nothing in this title shall be \n     construed to mandate equalized spending per pupil for a \n     State, local educational agency, or school.' The proposed SNS \n     regulations, however, appear to directly conflict with this \n     statutory language, which seems to place clear limits on ED's \n     authority. This prohibition against equalized spending thus \n     raises significant doubts about ED's legal basis for \n     proposing regulations that would require Title I-A per pupil \n     expenditures to meet or exceed those of non-Title-I-A \n     schools. . . . Congress's decision to expressly prohibit ED \n     from requiring equalized expenditures among schools indicates \n     that Congress did not intend to impose such a requirement in \n     the SNS context, particularly in light of the absence of \n     explicit language to the contrary.''\n       On the question of Congressional intent for the department \n     to address comparability, the report says: ``Meanwhile, the \n     legislative history behind Title I's comparability provisions \n     raises similar questions about ED's legal authority to \n     establish the proposed SNS regulations in their current form. \n     Over the eight-year period during which Congress considered a \n     comprehensive reauthorization of the ESEA, several bills and \n     amendments were introduced that would have modified the \n     comparability provision to require that actual school-level \n     expenditures be used in the determination of comparability, \n     but none of these proposals have been adopted. Most recently, \n     during consideration of S. 1177 in the Senate Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Senator Michael \n     Bennet offered and withdrew an amendment to require that \n     comparability determinations be based on state and local per-\n     pupil expenditures (including actual personnel and non-\n     personnel expenditures). Ultimately, the ESSA, which \n     comprehensively reauthorized the ESEA, did not make any \n     changes to the comparability requirement, leaving in place \n     the statutory prohibition on the use of staff salary \n     differentials for years of employment when determining \n     expenditures per pupil from state and local funds or \n     instructional salaries per pupil from state and local funds. \n     In other words, the ESSA did not alter the existing statutory \n     language that prohibits the use of staff salary differentials \n     for years of employment when determining expenditures per \n     pupil from state and local funds or instructional salaries \n     per pupil from state and local funds in making comparability \n     determinations.\n       ``Thus, the proposed SNS regulations appear to effectively \n     require (local educational agencies) to use actual teacher \n     salaries for SNS purposes despite the fact that the ESSA did \n     not address this matter. Because a reviewing court could view \n     this legislative history as relevant evidence of \n     congressional intent to maintain current statutory \n     requirements related to comparability determinations, a court \n     could potentially conclude that ED lacks the statutory \n     authority to attempt to impose a similar requirement via \n     other methods, including promulgation of the proposed SNS \n     regulations.''\n       The report concludes: ``Based on the plain language of the \n     above provisions in conjunction with the legislative history \n     and the statutory scheme as a whole, it therefore seems \n     unlikely that Congress intended section 1118(b) to authorize \n     ED to establish regulations that would require Title I-A per-\n     pupil expenditures to meet or exceed those of non-Title-I-A \n     schools. Given some of the concerns identified above, it \n     seems that a legal argument could be raised that ED exceeded \n     its statutory authority if it promulgates the proposed SNS \n     rules in their current form.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n   [From the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions]\n\n  Chairman Alexander: Already ``Disturbing Evidence'' That Education \n                   Department Is Ignoring the New Law\n\n       Washington, DC, April 12.--Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-\n     Tenn.) today said there is already ``disturbing evidence'' \n     that the Education Department is ignoring the law that \n     Congress passed in December and told the Education Secretary \n     he would use ``every power of Congress to make sure the law \n     is implemented the way we wrote it.''\n       Alexander said that in a negotiated rulemaking session, \n     ``your department proposed a rule that would do exactly what \n     the law says it shall not do . . . Not only is what you're \n     doing against the law, the way you're trying to do it is \n     against another provision in the law.''\n       Alexander was chairing the second of six planned oversight \n     hearings on the law passed last year to fix No Child Left \n     Behind. Education Secretary John King was today's witness.\n       ``As Secretary, you have sworn to discharge your duties \n     faithfully, and in your confirmation hearing, you said you \n     would `abide by the letter of the law.' The importance of the \n     hearing today is to make sure that you and your employees are \n     doing just that,'' Alexander said.\n       In writing the law last year, Congress debated and \n     ultimately chose to leave unchanged a provision in the law \n     often referred to as ``comparability,'' first put in there in \n     1970, that says school districts have to provide at least \n     comparable services with state and local funding to Title I \n     schools and non-Title I schools.\n       The law specifically says that school districts shall not \n     include teacher pay when they measure spending for purposes \n     of comparability.\n       At today's hearing, Alexander said: ``To accomplish your \n     goals on comparability, you are using the so-called \n     `supplement not supplant' provision that is supposed to keep \n     local school districts from using federal Title I dollars as \n     a replacement for state and local dollars in low-income \n     schools.\n       ``The department is forcing school districts to include \n     teacher salaries in how they measure their state and local \n     spending and require that state and local spending in Title I \n     schools be at least equal to the average spent in non-Title I \n     schools.''\n\n\n               The chairman's prepared remarks are below\n\n       Mr. Secretary, I urged the president to nominate an \n     Education Secretary because I thought it was important to \n     have a confirmed Secretary when the department was \n     implementing the new law fixing No Child Left Behind.\n       As Secretary, you have sworn to discharge your duties \n     faithfully, and in your confirmation hearing, you said you \n     would ``abide by the letter of the law.''\n       The importance of the hearing today is to make sure that \n     you and your employees are doing just that.\n       Last year this committee worked to pass a bill that fixed \n     No Child Left Behind. The legislation signed by the president \n     passed the House 359-64. It passed the Senate 85-12. The \n     president called it a Christmas miracle.\n       The reason we were able to achieve such unusual unanimity \n     and consensus is that people had gotten tired of the \n     Department of Education telling them so much of what they \n     ought to be doing.\n       It wasn't just Republicans or governors who were fed up, it \n     was school superintendents, teachers, principals, parents, \n     state legislatures, school boards, and chief state school \n     officers.\n       There hasn't been a broader coalition that's helped to pass \n     a law in a long time.\n       The Department of Education had become a national school \n     board, telling Washington state how to evaluate teachers, \n     telling Kansas what their standards must be, and telling \n     Tennessee how to fix failing schools.\n       The legislation we passed got rid of all that. And then--it \n     went further--to the extraordinary length of putting in \n     statute explicit prohibitions on the department in \n     anticipation of another effort at regulatory overreach.\n       It's a dramatic change in direction for federal education \n     policy--the Wall Street Journal read it and said it's the \n     ``largest devolution of federal control to the states in a \n     quarter-century.''\n       But it isn't worth the paper it's printed on if not \n     implemented properly.\n       Today, we're holding our second hearing of at least six to \n     oversee the implementation of this law and already we are \n     seeing disturbing evidence of an Education Department that is \n     ignoring the law that each of this committee's 22 members \n     worked so hard to craft.\n       It wasn't easy to pass a law that most of us could agree \n     to. As I said last year, there were crocodiles at every turn.\n       One of them was an issue people call ``comparability.'' \n     They're talking about a provision in the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act, first put in there in 1970, that \n     says school districts have to provide at least comparable \n     services with state and local funding to Title I schools and \n     non-Title I schools.\n       The law specifically says that school districts shall not \n     include teacher pay when they measure spending for purposes \n     of comparability.\n       This committee has debated several times whether or not \n     teacher pay should be excluded. Senator Bennet felt very \n     strongly about his proposal to address this, and I felt \n     strongly about mine.\n       Ultimately the United States Congress made two decisions \n     about this issue, as reflected in the law we passed:\n       First, we chose not to change the comparability language in \n     law, so the law still says teacher pay shall not be included:\n       Second, we added a requirement that school districts report \n     publicly the amount they are spending on each student, \n     including teacher salaries, so that parents and teachers know \n     how much money is being spent and can make their own \n     decisions about what to do with it, rather than the federal \n     government mandating it be used in comparability \n     calculations.\n       The law that the president signed in December didn't do one \n     thing to change the law that teacher salaries not be \n     included.\n\n[[Page S2693]]\n\n       But here's what your department did on April 1--you tried \n     to do what Congress wouldn't do in Comparability by \n     regulating another separate provision in the law.\n       In a negotiated rulemaking session, your department \n     proposed a rule that would do exactly what the law says it \n     shall not do--that is, force districts to include teacher \n     salaries in how they measure their state and local spending \n     and require that state and local spending in Title I schools \n     be at least equal to the average spent in non-Title I \n     schools.\n       If your proposed rule were adopted, it would:\n       1. Require a complete, costly overhaul of almost all the \n     State and local finance systems in the country.\n       2. Require forcing teachers to transfer to new schools.\n       3. Require states and school districts to move back to the \n     burdensome practice of detailing every individual cost on \n     which they spend money to provide a basic educational program \n     to all students, which is exactly what we were trying to free \n     states and districts from under this law.\n       4. According to the Council of Great City Schools, it would \n     cost $3.9 billion just for their 69 urban school systems to \n     eliminate the differences in spending between schools.\n       But I'm not interested in debating today whether what \n     you've proposed is a good idea or a bad one--the plain fact \n     of the matter is that the law specifically says you cannot do \n     it.\n       Not only is what you're doing against the law, the way \n     you're trying to do it is against another provision in the \n     law.\n       To accomplish your goals on comparability, you are using \n     the so-called ``supplement not supplant'' provision that is \n     supposed to keep local school districts from using federal \n     Title I dollars as a replacement for state and local dollars \n     in low-income schools.\n       According to a Politico story published on December 18, the \n     former Secretary of Education said: ``Candidly, our lawyers \n     are much smarter than many of the folks who were working on \n     this bill.''\n       We in Congress were smart enough to anticipate your \n     lawyers' attempts to rewrite the law.\n       So we included specific prohibitions in the ``supplement \n     not supplant'' provision that would prohibit you from doing \n     the very thing you have proposed.\n       Section 1118(b)(4), says ``Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to authorize or permit the Secretary to prescribe \n     the specific methodology a local educational agency uses to \n     allocate State and local funds to each school receiving \n     assistance under this part.''; and\n       Section 1605, says ``Nothing in this title shall be \n     construed to mandate equalized spending per pupil for a \n     State, local educational agency, or school.''\n       I'll use every power of Congress to make sure the law is \n     implemented the way we wrote it, including our ability to use \n     the appropriations process and to overturn such regulations \n     once they are final.\n       In addition, if you try to force states to follow these \n     regulations that ignore the laws we wrote, I'll encourage \n     them to request a hearing with the department. And if they \n     lose, I'll tell them to take you to court.\n       Second, I'm not the only one who can read the law. You're \n     going to come right up against the broad coalition of groups \n     who helped pass this law--the governors, school \n     superintendents, teachers, principals, parents, state \n     legislatures, and school boards.\n       They've already sent you a letter saying that ``Regulations \n     and accompanying guidance should clarify how supplement, not \n     supplant is separate and distinct from maintenance of effort \n     and comparability, and steer clear of anything that would \n     change or modify any of those provisions beyond the statutory \n     changes already signed into law.''\n       Wisconsin Superintendent Tony Evers, a member of the \n     rulemaking committee, said last week that ``Congressional \n     intent isn't necessarily being followed here.''\n       Noelle Ellerson of the school superintendents association, \n     says that the prohibitions in the law, ``in tandem with \n     Congress' deliberate act of leaving comparability unchanged, \n     makes a seemingly tight case against expanding supplement not \n     supplant.''\n       You've testified here and in the House of Representatives \n     that you will ``abide by the letter of the law.''\n       It's not abiding by the letter of the law to require local \n     school districts to use teacher salaries and equalize \n     spending between Title I and non-Title I schools when the law \n     prohibits you from doing that.\n       It's not abiding by the letter of the law to use the \n     supplement not supplant provision to achieve your goals for \n     Comparability when Congress debated this issue and chose to \n     not make any changes in the law.\n       I'm making a point of this today because we're at the \n     beginning of the implementation of a law that affects 3.4 \n     million teachers and 50 million students in 100,000 public \n     schools.\n       I'm determined to see that the law is implemented the way \n     Congress wrote it.\n       I think it's important at the beginning of this \n     implementation to make sure that you and those who work at \n     the department understand that.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From Wall Street Journal, Apr. 18, 2016]\n\n  Obama's Ed-Run--The Administration Tries To Dictate State and Local \n                             School Funding\n\n       President Obama has no inhibitions about rewriting laws he \n     doesn't like--even those he's signed. Witness the \n     Administration's revision of the Every Student Succeeds Act \n     to allow the feds to regulate state and local school \n     spending.\n       The law--which passed Congress last year with large \n     bipartisan majorities--devolved power to the states and \n     rolled back some federal mandates. In doing so, Congress \n     rebuffed the White House's previous attempts to direct local \n     education policy with No Child Left Behind waivers.\n       Mr. Obama nonetheless hailed the law as a civil-rights \n     success that ``reflects many of the priorities of this \n     administration.'' One notable achievement was giving local \n     school districts more discretion over Title I funds, which \n     target poor students. Federal policy dating to 1970 requires \n     that Title I funds must supplement, rather than supplant, \n     state and local spending.\n       This requirement isn't controversial, but school districts \n     still complained that the cost of completing the federal \n     paperwork to comply diverted resources from instruction. \n     Congress eased the burden by letting school districts \n     establish their own methodology to show compliance. The law \n     also prohibited the Secretary of Education from prescribing \n     the ``specific methodology a local educational agency uses to \n     allocate State and local funds'' or mandating ``equalized \n     spending per pupil for a State, local educational agency, or \n     school.''\n       The Administration is now rewriting the parts of the law it \n     doesn't like. The Education Department recently proposed \n     assessing the local school district's compliance with the law \n     by whether a Title I school ``receives at least as much in \n     State and local funding as the average non-Title I school.'' \n     In other words, the Administration is trying to do exactly \n     what the law prohibits it from doing.\n       Progressives want to force local school districts to \n     equalize spending among schools. Regardless of the policy \n     merits, this is impractical since staff compensation \n     represents more than 80% of school spending. Younger teachers \n     with lower base salaries are more likely to work at low-\n     income schools due to seniority rules in labor agreements and \n     state laws.\n       This is why the law forbids the feds from considering \n     ``staff salary differentials for years of employment'' when \n     assessing comparability between Title I and non-Title I \n     schools. Mandating equalized spending in Title I schools as \n     non-Title I schools would force states to rewrite their \n     education funding formulas and districts to redo their labor \n     agreements.\n       Experienced teachers earning higher salaries might have to \n     be forcibly transferred to low-income schools. Or teachers at \n     Title I schools would have to be paid more. Another \n     alternative--and the goal on the left--is to compel school \n     districts to employ more staff at low-income schools. Alas, \n     the quantity of employees is a poor proxy for the quality of \n     education.\n       This Administration line-item veto violates both the letter \n     and spirit of a law that was intended to reduce federal \n     control over education rather than increase it.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3871\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to take this time to speak on an \namendment I have authored, amendment No. 3871, which will be voted on \nshortly--at 4:30 p.m. this afternoon.\n  I was listening to my friend Senator Alexander. I know he was not \ntalking about my amendment--he was talking about a different subject--\nbut I always listen to Senator Alexander because he always makes such \nimportant points. I couldn't agree with him more that laws are not \nworth the paper they are printed on unless they are implemented \nproperly. That was a comment he made. That is the reason I filed \namendment No. 3871.\n  I wish to point out that Congress passed the Fish and Wildlife \nCoordination Act in 1958. It was that act which requires all Federal \nagencies to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the \nDepartment of the Interior and the head of the applicable State fish \nand game departments on water projects.\n  The concern we have today is that we have many water projects that \nare being initiated--it could be a dam project, a levy project being \ndone by the Army Corps--and they are required to work with the \nrecommendations of Fish and Wildlife as it relates to the impacts these \nprojects have on fish and wildlife. In fact, they are not doing it. \nThat is the reason I authored this amendment, to carry out \ncongressional intent--not congressional intent--what we wrote into the \nlaw so that it is very clear that as part of the consultation, U.S. \nFish and Wildlife and the States are to determine the potential impact \nto wildlife resources, describe the damages that will be caused by the \nproject,\n\n[[Page S2694]]\n\nand develop mitigating measures to prevent those damages and improve \nwildlife resources. That is the current rule.\n  The problem is that the Federal agencies are not required to adopt \nthe recommendations. I understand that, but they must give the \nrecommendations full consideration, and they are not doing that today. \nAt least they are not doing it as much as we think they should be. That \nis the purpose for this amendment, to make it clear that we meant what \nwe said when we passed the law--similar to what my good friend said in \nregard to the education bill we passed last year.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act review is a longstanding and \ncritically important component of water resources planning. Utilization \nof expert recommendations in these reviews makes sense.\n  Let me underscore what we are talking about. Water projects are very \nimportant. I know that. I serve on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, which is the authorizing committee on many of these issues, \nto get these water projects moving. I understand the challenges. But \none of the purposes is to make sure we preserve fish and wildlife.\n  Every year, hunting and fishing contribute $200 billion to our total \neconomic activity, to our Nation's economy. It is a huge part of the \nreason we require that type of consultation and working together--in \norder that when these projects move forward, the recommendations that \nare made by Fish and Wildlife and our local government entities are \ntotally consistent with our local communities, that they are heeded and \ntaken into consideration so that we not only get the needed water \nprojects but we also preserve our fish and wildlife habitats so that we \ndon't endanger the species as part of the project.\n  I wish to emphasize that not only is this an environmental issue, \nthis is about State involvement. Not only does the Army Corps need to \nensure that projects meet Federal environmental requirements, it needs \nto respect each State's unique situation. If State fish and wildlife \nexperts express concern about a project, my amendment reiterates what \nthe law already is. The Army Corps must listen. That is what it says. \nIt is as simple as that.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It has the strong \nsupport of many of our wildlife federations. The National Wildlife \nFederation supports it. Izaak Walton League of America, the Theodore \nRoosevelt Conservation Partnership, Trout Unlimited, and wildlife \nfederations from many of our States support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter in support of my amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   April 25, 2016.\n     Re: Support Cardin Amendment 3871 to the Energy and Water \n         Appropriations Bill.\n\n       Dear Senator: As organizations representing a broad range \n     of conservation, sportsmen and women, recreation, and outdoor \n     interests, we urge you to support Amendment 3871 to the \n     Energy and Water Appropriations Bill. This common sense, \n     cost-effective amendment will protect fish and wildlife, make \n     federal water projects better, and give a real voice to the \n     nation's state and federal fish and wildlife experts.\n       Every year, hunting and fishing contribute $200 billion in \n     total economic activity to our nation's economy. Ensuring \n     that water resources projects are designed, built and \n     operated to sustain and improve fish and wildlife populations \n     is critical to this economy and to our sporting traditions.\n       Since 1958, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act has \n     fully integrated state and federal fish and wildlife expert \n     review into the Army Corps of Engineers water resources \n     planning process. As part of the water resources project \n     review process, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service evaluates \n     the impacts of proposed water resources projects and makes \n     recommendations to reduce the harm to fish and wildlife \n     resources. State fish and wildlife experts are also \n     encouraged to provide input under this process.\n       Despite the extensive work undertaken by the Fish and \n     Wildlife Service and the states in analyzing projects and \n     developing important recommendations, the Army Corps of \n     Engineers often does not follow the expert recommendations \n     that are developed. When this happens, federal water projects \n     can cause significant, and entirely avoidable, harm to the \n     nation's fish and wildlife. Failing to follow these expert \n     recommendations also leads to mitigation plans that do not \n     work.\n       Amendment 3871 would ensure that the recommendations of the \n     nation's fish and wildlife experts are fully accounted for \n     during the planning of water resources projects. This is a \n     common sense, cost-effective way to protect our nation's \n     wildlife and make water projects better for all of us. Our \n     organizations urge you to vote yes on amendment 3871.\n           Respectfully,\n       National Wildlife Federation, Izaak Walton League of \n     America, Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, Trout \n     Unlimited, Arkansas Wildlife Federation, Conservation \n     Federation of Missouri, Nebraska Wildlife Federation, North \n     Carolina Wildlife Federation, South Dakota Wildlife \n     Federation, Wisconsin Wildlife Federation.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. I encourage my colleagues to read the language of this \namendment. It carries out current law. That is simply what it does. \nCurrent law requires this consideration by Fish and Wildlife on these \nprojects.\n  This amendment makes it clear that we want the Federal agencies to \ncomply with the law. That is why we wrote it that way. And this \namendment would make sure the intent of Congress in implementing the \nstatute is, in fact, carried out.\n  Mr. President, with that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING Officer. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Zika Virus\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I come to the floor again today to discuss \nthe Zika virus, which has been in the news quite often in my home State \nof Florida and internationally.\n  In a moment, I want to enter into the Record a number of articles \nthat have appeared just in the last week in papers across the State of \nFlorida.\n  On May 7, the newspaper in Pensacola had this headline: ``Panhandle \nconditions create a Zika 'powder keg.''' The argument it makes is that \npart of the State--as are many of the areas in the South--is an area \nwhere you find prevalent a species of mosquito which is the primary one \nthat is now transmitting the Zika virus. It goes on to say that as \ntemperatures rise and rainfall increases--these are the two elements \nthat mosquitoes need to spread. So there is going to be a massive \nspread--as there is every year--in the specific species of mosquitoes \nthat transmit the Zika virus in the panhandle of Florida.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe Pensacola News Journal article.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    [From http://www.pnj.com/story/news/local/2016/05/07/panhandle-\nconditions-create-zika-powder-keg/83698034/, May 7, 2016]\n\n             Panhandle Conditions Create Zika `Powder Keg'\n\n                          (By Carlos Gieseken)\n\n       Nine out of 10 mosquito bites in Northwest Florida can be \n     attributed to the culprit known to scientists as aedes \n     albopictus and colloquially as the Asian Tiger.\n       It is black and white and measures about a quarter of an \n     inch in length. It is the sister to aedes aegypti, best known \n     as the Yellow Fever Mosquito because of its past success at \n     delivering that disease. It is behind the numerous outbreaks \n     that caused panic and killed thousands in Pensacola between \n     1765 and 1905.\n       Today the two are once again in the spotlight for all the \n     wrong reasons--they carry Zika, a virus suspected of causing \n     birth defects in Brazil and other Latin American countries as \n     well as the Caribbean.\n       Aedes aegypti was prevalent in the Florida Panhandle until \n     the mid 1980s, said John P. Smith, a medical entomologist \n     with Florida State University at Panama City who has studied \n     insects that affect public health for more than 30 years.\n       At that time, the Asian Tiger began to assert itself when \n     it came to the United States from Southeast Asia via the used \n     tire trade.\n       ``They are both bad guys, no doubt about it,'' Smith said. \n     ``Or should I say bad girls. Only the females bite.''\n       Both mosquitoes also spread yellow fever, dengue and \n     chikungunya.\n       The Asian Tiger is found in high concentrations on the Gulf \n     Coast, creating a potential powder keg. This is because Zika\n\n[[Page S2695]]\n\n     spreads when mosquitoes bite multiple people after biting an \n     infected person.\n       To date, the Panhandle mosquito population has not been \n     infected. According to the Florida Department of Health, \n     there has been one case of Zika in Santa Rosa County in a \n     person who was infected while traveling abroad. As of Friday, \n     there have been 105 travel-related cases of Zika in Florida.\n       A great deal of media ink and broadcast time has been spent \n     on the disease, but how worried should the Panhandle be?\n       ``I think it is a real concern,'' Smith said, ``and worth \n     doing something to prevent it.''\n\n\n                           Year-round concern\n\n       But mosquito control technicians in Escambia and Santa Rosa \n     counties wage a year-round war against the tiny, slender \n     pests.\n       When temperatures regularly hit 60 or above in March or \n     April, the teams start spraying to knock out the adult \n     mosquitoes who have hatched and begun their warm weather \n     pursuit for food, i.e. blood.\n       But during the winter months, even in the coldest frost of \n     January or February, mosquito larvae can lie dormant, \n     stunting their own development to wait for warmer \n     temperatures before emerging.\n       Keith Hussey and Temika Wilkes are the mosquito control \n     directors at Santa Rosa and Escambia counties, respectively. \n     Their staffs are out inspecting those places where mosquito \n     larvae lie like baby vampires through the brisk weather \n     months.\n       They inspect drainage ditches, holding ponds and woodland \n     pools. They also do neighborhoods sweeps in search of man-\n     made mosquito nurseries like old tires or other containers, \n     foreclosed homes and abandoned swimming pools.\n       Larvicide and gambrusia fish, which are the size of guppies \n     and thrive in stagnant water where they feed on mosquito \n     larvae, are effective weapons.\n       ``You can get more mosquitoes killed in a small pond of \n     water than you can when they fly away all over the place,'' \n     said Matthew Mello, Escambia County mosquito control \n     supervisor.\n       FSU's Smith monitors 12 sites in Santa Rosa County. The \n     mosquito control personnel in that county use his data to \n     help strategize where and when they treat for mosquitoes. He \n     and his staff also test the mosquitoes for diseases they are \n     known to carry.\n       Escambia County's mosquito control budget for fiscal year \n     2015 to 2016 is just under $620,000. Santa Rosa County's \n     budget this year is $495,000, and has proposed a budget of \n     $594,518 for next year.\n       Smith said that because of the size of the area that needs \n     to be covered, ``The programs in Northwest Florida are some \n     of the poorest funded throughout the state.''\n       Bay County and other counties have specific taxing \n     districts that are used to raise millions of dollars to \n     combat mosquitoes. Their programs include aerial spraying \n     from helicopters and fixed wing aircraft, public education \n     programs and more staff who can cover more area.\n       The amount of local funding is enough to handle day-to-day \n     and regular mosquito season needs, officials from Escambia \n     and Santa Rosa counties say. But is it enough should a Zika \n     infection break out locally, instead of from a far flung \n     place?\n       ``The county's mosquito control program has adequate funds \n     to fulfill its mission and has successfully protected the \n     residents from disease spread by mosquitoes for many years,'' \n     said Ron Hixon, environmental manager for Santa Rosa County \n     in a statement. ``Every year the county reviews its funding \n     for mosquito control based on prior years mosquito data to \n     ensure adequate funds are available.''\n       ``Please be assured that the Santa Rosa County \n     Environmental Department staff, specifically its Mosquito \n     Control division staff, are actively monitoring the Zika \n     situation and that the SRC Board of County Commissioners are \n     ready to deploy whatever resources are necessary to protect \n     the residents of Santa Rosa County,'' he said.\n       The Florida Department of Health said in a statement that \n     it has an incident management team in its central office in \n     Tallahassee. It coordinates with the state departments of \n     agriculture and environmental protection as well as the \n     Division of Emergency Management, the governor's office, \n     VISIT Florida and others. Escambia County's Wilkes said \n     ``operations are currently funded at a level that supports \n     effective mosquito control. However, just like during a \n     hurricane or other natural disaster, if we were to have a \n     Zika outbreak and a subsequent state of emergency, we would \n     need additional funding for supplies and overtime costs.''\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. The second article says: ``Zika findings could be 'game \nchangers,' opening doors to research.'' It begins by saying:\n\n       Two groups of scientists reported Wednesday that fetal mice \n     infected with Zika showed brain damage, a finding that \n     confirms the prevailing view that the virus can disrupt the \n     development of fetal brains in humans and provides a clearer \n     avenue to study the problem.\n       The work should put to rest lingering doubts in some \n     quarters that the Zika outbreak sweeping through Latin \n     America and the Caribbean is responsible for a surge in \n     babies born with microcephaly and other brain anomalies.\n\n  It goes on to quote an associate professor of pathology at the \nUniversity of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, who says:\n\n       Let me put it bluntly: These are game changers. . . . We \n     need to move forward now.\n\n  There is an article dated May 10 in the Miami Herald: ``Two new Zika \ncases in Miami-Dade raise state total to 109.''\n\n       Florida health officials confirmed two new Zika infections \n     in Miami-Dade on Tuesday, raising the statewide total to 109 \n     people who have contracted the virus this year, more than any \n     state.\n       In Miami-Dade, where most of Florida's Zika cases have been \n     reported, 44 people have been infected with the virus, said \n     the state health department, but the disease has not been \n     transmitted locally by mosquito bites. Broward County has \n     reported 15 cases of Zika.\n\n  At about 5 o'clock today, I will meet with the Governor of our State, \nwho is here asking for Federal aid to prepare for and combat the virus \nin the State of Florida.\n  The Governor said:\n\n       It's going to get warmer, we're going to have more \n     rainfall, we're probably going to see more mosquitoes in our \n     state. Our federal government has a variety of plans they're \n     talking about. . . . We've got to address the Zika issue. \n     Hopefully, we can get ahead of it.\n\n  But it isn't just limited to Florida. This is an article from USA \nTODAY dated May 6, 2016: ``Gulf Coast could be ground zero for Zika.''\n\n       The Gulf Coast may know hurricanes, but this year the \n     region of 60 million people could find itself unprepared and \n     at ground zero for a different type of storm: a mosquito-\n     borne Zika epidemic.\n       A look at the region's urban hubs, small towns and rural \n     outposts shows a patchwork of preparedness. Cities such as \n     Houston have robust plans in place, while smaller towns, such \n     as Corpus Christi, Texas, struggle with fewer resources.\n\n  This is just part of painting an overall picture of this very serious \nproblem.\n  I would just say that the notion that we should only be worried about \nFlorida or the States on the gulf coast alone would not be wise. \nMosquitoes that infect people are found in 30 of the 50 States in this \ncountry. There are now Zika infections and Zika cases in multiple \nStates across the country.\n  We now know that Zika isn't just transmitted from mosquitoes but can \nalso be sexually transmitted. In fact, the only case of transmission in \nFlorida was one that was sexually transmitted in Central Florida.\n  As we debate all these other important issues, this is a looming \npublic health crisis. This is the situation we are now facing in this \ncountry. The time to act has come. The moment to act has come because \nright now in this body and in Washington, DC, we are facing a debate \nabout this issue, about how much money we are going to spend on it.\n  Look, the President has proposed $1.9 billion to deal with it. About \n$500 million of that is designed to pay back the Ebola funding that has \nbeen used in the short term to fill in the gap, but the rest of it is \nfor real programs that go into dealing with this issue and particularly \ndealing with it on the island of Puerto Rico, which has been \ndisproportionately impacted. When I hear people say there haven't been \nany cases of Zika transmitted in the United States, they are wrong. \nPeople of Puerto Rico are American citizens. They travel to the \nmainland extensively. It is our responsibility to also fight and care \nfor them in this process.\n  But the bottom line is that it is not a question of if, it is a \nquestion of when. There will be a mosquito transmission of Zika in the \ncontinental United States at some point over next few days, weeks, or \nmonths. We cannot get caught unprepared to deal with the consequences. \nThe consequences, by the way, are not just to pregnant women, which in \nand of itself is reason to act--I don't mean to diminish it. The impact \non pregnant women and their unborn children is extraordinary and \ndevastating. The science on that is indisputable. We are seeing \nevidence of it all across the world and especially the Western \nHemisphere being impacted by it. That alone is reason to act. But there \nis now a definitive link between Zika and Guillain-Barre syndrome, \nwhich is a debilitating, often fatal neurological condition that we \nknow is associated with this.\n  By the way, these children who are being born after being infected in \nthe womb with Zika, we don't know what the long-term prognosis is. Just \nbecause they are not born with\n\n[[Page S2696]]\n\nmicrocephaly does not mean they will not suffer from other neurological \ndeficiencies or other neurological conditions in the years to come. We \nsimply don't know. It is not just a first-trimester threat anymore. We \nnow know Zika can be transmitted and can do serious damage in the \nsecond trimester as well.\n  We know that soon the Olympic games will be played in Brazil, and \nthat means hundreds of thousands of people will travel from and through \nthe United States to the Olympics and back. We know we have constant \nvisitors coming in and out of this country. How else would we get 109 \ncases in Florida? These are people who have either traveled abroad or \nhave been infected by a partner in the one case I have cited.\n  This is an issue we should jump on with a real sense of urgency. It \nis a Federal responsibility to be involved in this. It is the job of \nthe Federal Government to keep our people safe from external threats, \nand Zika today is an external threat spreading to this country--a \ncountry that is at the epicenter of global commerce and transit. It is \njust a matter of time before someone contracts Zika through a mosquito \nbite in the United States, and we have not prepared for it.\n  Localities and States are doing the best they can with their limited \nresources, but they do not have the comprehensive resources the Federal \nGovernment can bring to bear. They do not have the resources for \nresearch the Federal Government can bring to bear. They do not have the \nability to deal with it at the ports of entry the way the Federal \nGovernment can. These are important priorities I hope we will move on.\n  In the last few hours, I have heard encouraging reports that there \nare a number of efforts going on behind the scenes in the Senate--at \nleast one of them in a bipartisan way--to begin to address this issue. \nOver the next few hours, we will meet with the different stakeholders \nand others who are engaged in this issue to see if we can come up with \na way forward.\n  Here is what I hope we will not do. I hope we will not politicize \nthis issue. Zika is not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. It \nshouldn't be a campaign issue, although I promise it will become one if \nwe have a Zika outbreak in the United States and we are back home doing \nour constituent work and not here voting. People are going to ask: Why \ndid you do nothing on this issue? You knew it was coming. It was \nclearly broadcasted and predicted. All the indicators were there and \nnothing happened. Inaction on this is, quite frankly, inexcusable. I \ndon't believe voters will excuse us for refusing to act on this.\n  This should not be a political issue. It should not be a partisan \nissue. It shouldn't be used for one party to beat up on the other. \nThere are so many other issues we can fight over but not on this--not \nwhere the real lives of real people are at stake. My hope is very \nsoon--and I mean in the next couple of days--we can bring before this \nbody a way forward on this issue that brings both parties together and \nthat deals with this public health crisis in a responsible way.\n  Let me say, look, we are running a debt in this country. So if there \nis a way to pay for it--and I believe there can be a way to pay for \nit--I am all for that. I have ideas about how we can come up with some \nof that money. We can find $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion, $1.9 billion to \npay for this, and I think we should endeavor to do so, but even if we \ncannot, we should never allow the inability to agree on how to pay for \nit to stand in the way of addressing a public health crisis that \nthreatens to become a public health catastrophe. I prefer that we pay \nfor it. I am for that, but I am not going to let an objection to that \nstand in the way of addressing this issue.\n  So through all the other issues we are debating today, from \nPresidential campaigns to water projects, I still do not believe we \nhave given sufficient intensity, urgency or attention to this \nburgeoning issue that threatens the safety and security of our people. \nSo it is my hope that over the next few hours and days we can come \nforward in a bipartisan way with a way forward, and I will continue to \nwork to address and to achieve that.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to address the issue of vacancies \non the Federal bench in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n  In the 5\\1/2\\ years I have been in the Senate, I have sought to find \ncommon ground with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, with \nconsiderable success--and sometimes we continue to search for that \nsuccess--whether it is legislation to prevent pedophiles from \ninfiltrating our classrooms or working to fight this terrible scourge \nof opioid abuse and overdoses in Pennsylvania or trying to keep guns \nout of the hands of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill.\n  One of the accomplishments of which I am most proud is the work I \nhave done with Senator Casey to fill vacancies as they have occurred on \nthe Federal bench in Pennsylvania. Senator Casey and I have developed a \nfairly elaborate process. We are blessed to have very talented men and \nwomen who have volunteered their time, energy, and expertise to help us \nidentify and vet candidates when a vacancy occurs, to recommend those \ncandidates, and to begin a process by which we can get some of the best \nand brightest people in Pennsylvania who are able and willing to serve \non the Federal bench to do exactly that.\n  Using this process, Senator Casey and I have gotten together, we have \nagreed, and we have recommended to the President, the President has \nthen nominated, and this Senate has confirmed 16 men and women to the \nFederal bench in Pennsylvania; 14 are district court judges, 2 circuit \ncourt judges. There are only two States in the Union that have \nconfirmed more Federal judges in this period of time, and those are the \nvery large States of California and New York, which have had \nconsiderably more vacancies. This makes a difference for the people of \nPennsylvania.\n  For instance, because Senator Casey and I have cooperated this way, \nwe have been able to fill empty courthouses--Federal courthouses which \nhave sat vacant where people do not have convenient access to justice. \nIn the cities of Reading, Williamsport, and Easton, vacant courthouses \nare no longer vacant because through our work we now have Federal \njudges sitting, hearing, and trying cases, and providing justice in \nthose communities.\n  Despite what has been a very successful record so far, we have more \nwork to be done. We have vacancies in Pennsylvania now. As a matter of \nfact, there are currently four district court--district court--\nnominations for Pennsylvania that are pending in the Senate. Two are \nstill being reviewed by the Judiciary Committee, and two have been \napproved by the committee. They have had their hearing, they have had \ntheir markup, they have voted, they have been successfully reported out \nof committee, and they are on the Executive Calendar.\n  For some time, Senator Casey and I have been working to get all four \nof these nominees through the process and confirmed, and I strongly \nbelieve all four should be confirmed.\n  Today, I want to focus in particular on two, and those are the two \nwho have already been successfully reported out of committee. They are \nnow listed on the Executive Calendar. These are vacancies that are \nespecially concerning to me, because in one case the Federal courthouse \nin Erie, PA--the fourth biggest city in Pennsylvania--has a vacant \ncourthouse. It is vacant. It has been vacant for almost 3 years. For \nalmost 3 years, there has been no Federal judge able to hear cases, and \nso the people in Erie and the surrounding counties have very long \ntravel distances. They have to go all the way down to Pittsburgh or \ntake a very long drive to get to another Federal courthouse, and that \nis not right. It is not right for the people of Erie, and it is not \nright for the people of Northwestern Pennsylvania generally. We\n\n[[Page S2697]]\n\nhave another district judgeship in the Western District of Pennsylvania \nthat likewise has been vacant for almost 3 years.\n  Here is what I want to stress: The two nominees for these judgeships \nwho I am talking about would fill judgeships that have been vacant far \nlonger than any other pending on the Executive Calendar. There are \nother nominees pending on the Executive Calendar. I get that. There are \npeople who want to confirm every one of them. I understand that, but no \nvacancies have been outstanding for as long as these two vacancies for \nwhich we have two qualified candidates who have been successfully \nreported out of committee, and they are very well-qualified nominees. \nIn fact, I want to talk briefly about each of them.\n  Judge Susan Baxter has a very impressive 34 years of legal \nexperience, including over 20 years serving as a Federal magistrate \njudge and over a decade as a practicing lawyer in both the public and \nprivate sectors. She spent 3 years as a teacher. She completed her \neducation at two of Pennsylvania's very impressive schools, getting her \nlaw degree from Temple and her undergraduate degree from Penn State. \nJudge Baxter has agreed to sit in the Erie courthouse, which would \neliminate the problem of a vacant Federal courthouse in the city of \nErie.\n  Marilyn Horan is the other judge. Judge Horan likewise has extensive \nlegal experience for 37 years, 20 of those years as a judge in the \nPennsylvania Court of Common Pleas in Butler County, PA; 17 years as a \npracticing lawyer, including 14 as a partner in a law firm. Judge Horan \nlikewise attended two terrific Pennsylvania schools. She got her law \ndegree from the Pittsburgh School of Law and her undergraduate degree \nfrom Penn State.\n  There is no question in my mind, both of these women will make \noutstanding additions to the Federal bench in Pennsylvania. I believe \nthe seats they will fill, if they are confirmed by the Senate, have \nbeen vacant too long. Three years is just far too long.\n  Yesterday my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Casey, made a \nunanimous consent request for these 2 Pennsylvania judges but also 9 \nothers, for a total of 11. I was not on the Senate floor at the time. \nHad I been, I would have voiced my support for that request, and I \nwould have agreed to that vote. Unfortunately, Leader McConnell \ndisagreed and raised an objection. So we find ourselves stuck at zero: \nWe have nobody pending for confirmation. We have our colleagues on the \nother side saying let's have 11 judges confirmed.\n  I am suggesting a slightly different course. How about we try a step \nin the right direction? How about we vote on these 2 judges, 2 of the \n11? That is not the entire slate, but it is not zero. They are the two \njudges who would fill the vacancies that have been vacant the longest.\n  These women represent real bipartisan cooperation. One was initially \nsuggested to the President by Senator Casey. I suggested the other. One \nis a Democrat. The other is a Republican. The other seats have had \nvacancies for far shorter periods of time.\n  So I think this would be progress if we could simply agree to have a \nvote on these two nominees, then see where we go from there. Let's get \noff this all-or-nothing, 0-or-11 situation, and let's confirm the two \njudges who would fill the vacancies that have lasted the longest.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider the following nominations: Calendar Nos. \n460 and 461 en bloc; that the Senate vote on the nominations en bloc \nwithout intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the motions to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table en bloc; that the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the \nSenate then resume legislative session without any intervening action \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  On the Executive Calendar, there is a queue of judges who have come \nout of the Judiciary Committee and are ready for floor action. By my \ncount, along that queue, the two Pennsylvania judges my distinguished \ncolleague refers to are Nos. 9 and 10; Senator Jack Reed's and my Rhode \nIsland judge is No. 8. We would very much like to enter into an \nagreement where these judges start to be moved in regular order--as we \noften say we like around here--through the queue, as is the tradition \nin the Senate, so we can get them all cleared.\n  The senior Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Casey, as the junior \nSenator mentioned, came here to move a larger block. I would not object \nto this request if it were amended to include all 10 of those judges on \nthe Executive Calendar, down to and including the two Pennsylvania \njudges to whom my distinguished colleague refers. That would be \nCalendar Nos. 307, 357, 358, 359, 362, 363, 364, the all-important 459 \nfrom Rhode Island, and 460 and 461.\n  So if the Senator from Pennsylvania would amend his unanimous consent \nrequest to accommodate that, then I would not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator so modify the request?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, parliamentary question.\n  I am not sure whether the majority leader's objection was to Senator \nToomey's unanimous consent request or to my attempt to modify it. If it \nwas to the former, we are moot, and this conversation has concluded. If \nnot, then I will object if I cannot get the regular order for the \njudges ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard on the modification.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, my understanding--what I intended to do \nwas to object to the modification offered by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, with that clarification, I must \nregrettably object to the unanimous consent request propounded by the \njunior Senator from Pennsylvania. But I do hope very much that we can \nfind a way to work toward getting these judges confirmed. These are \njudges who came out of the Judiciary Committee, which is a fairly \ncontentious committee, unanimously. They are district judges. If we \ncan't move them, then I suggest the Senate is really not working the \nway it ought to, and I very much hope we can get to a place where we \ncan move them all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I think it bears repeating again what I \nhave said the last few days. If you look at the Barack Obama years--he \nwill ultimately have 8 years in the White House--and the George W. Bush \n8 years in the White House, and you draw a line at this point in their \nPresidencies, Barack Obama has gotten 21 more lifetime appointments, \nFederal judges, than George W. Bush did during the same period. By any \nobjective standard, President Obama has been treated more than fairly \nduring the course of his Presidency--much more fairly than George W. \nBush was treated during the same period of his Presidency.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I want to make it clear that I did not \nhave an objection to the modification of the unanimous consent request \nthat was made by the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  I think Senator McConnell makes a valid point about judicial \nvacancies that have occurred under President Obama. But where we \ndisagree is that I think right before us we have excellent candidates \nwho have been vetted by both sides. They have been chosen by both \nsides. They have come through the process. They have had their \nhearings. They have been reported out by the committee. It does not \nserve the people of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to have to \ncontinue to wait.\n  I am not finished in this effort. I am stymied today. I must say that \nI am disappointed that my friends on the other side can't agree to make \nsome progress. It is not as though I am, for instance, asking that only \nRepublican judges be confirmed or only judges who are chosen by \nRepublicans. I am not\n\n[[Page S2698]]\n\nasking that. We have a Democrat and a Republican, chosen by my \nDemocratic colleague and myself, and I understand they are not in the \nsequence that is traditionally dealt with. But we are at an impasse \nhere. They are the two judges who would fill the vacancies that have \nlasted the longest, through no fault of their own. I am trying to find \na way to get somewhere between 0 and 11, neither of which is accepted. \nThis is a very frustrating and disappointing moment, but I am not going \nto give up trying.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, let me add to what the distinguished \nSenator from Pennsylvania has said by noting first that the impasse to \nwhich he refers is created by his own leadership, which refused to \nbring up judges that have come out of the Judiciary Committee \nunanimously.\n  There is a problem here. It is one that can be solved within the \nRepublican caucus. We can't very much help with that, but we hope that \na solution comes.\n  The second point is that the question here should not be viewed only \nas to whether the President is being treated fairly but that there are \nvacancies on Federal courts, and it is our responsibility to provide \nadvice and consent. We have a duty of fairness to the constituents who \nhave empty seats in courtrooms, and we have a duty of fairness to the \ncandidates--the nominees--who have put their lives on hold with the \nexpectation that they would be treated fairly by the Senate. That is \nour job--to treat nominees fairly and to see to our constituents' \nneeds. It is not just a question of numbers and who is President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I appreciate the persistence of both colleagues from Pennsylvania, \nand I am sure we will continue to do this until we make some headway.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, today is an excellent day for students \nacross the country who are taking out college student loans. For the \nupcoming school year, the Treasury auction just took place on 10-year \nnotes. Some folks might ask: What is the connection with student loans \nand Treasury notes?\n  Three years ago, Senator Alexander, myself, Senator Manchin, Senator \nKing, and others said something very simple: We are going to get \npoliticians out of the business of setting student loan rates, and we \nare going to let the marketplace do it. That was a wise decision, as \nwas the law we passed--the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act. Since \n2013 it has saved students and their parents $36 billion in taking out \nstudent loans. We will save another $10 billion again this year. That \nmeans that 200,000 North Carolinians--students and their parents--are \nsaving even more on student loans. Those 200,000 North Carolinians take \nout about $500 million in student loans to attend universities and \ncolleges. Because of this law, they have been saving. Because of \ntoday's Treasury auction, they are going to save even more. They are \ngoing to save about $1.1 billion across my State alone because of the \nreduction in the Treasury note from a little over 4 percent on the 10-\nyear to 3.76 today.\n  Congressional Research Service tells us that about $4,500 less will \nbe paid out for a 4-year degree. I hold this up because I think this is \nindicative of where we are this year--the lowest student loan rate \nsince the year 2004. I know this is a debate not only within the body \nof the Senate and the House but also on the campaign trail for our \nPresidential candidates.\n  Prior to 2013, interest rates had been written into law by \npoliticians and were essentially set at 6.8 percent. Many of us looked \nat it and said: This is insane. For the protection of American \ntaxpayers, it ought to be tied to some financial instrument. So we tied \nit to the 10-year bond. Since that point, taxpayers--specifically, \nstudents and their parents--have saved $36 billion because we decoupled \nit from the political process here.\n  In fact, those interest rates have dropped significantly since last \nyear--4.29 percent to 3.76 percent today. That means about $40 more per \nmonth in the average graduate's pocket. It means $4,500 more overall in \nsaved costs.\n  What would have happened if we hadn't come together to pass this law? \nStudents would have shelled out another $46 billion in student loan \ninterest payments. This is one thing that Congress can hold up, and we \ncan highlight the fact that we did something responsible. For those who \nclaim we haven't done anything about the high cost of student loans, \nlet me suggest to you that we have done a lot. We have saved parents \nand students $46 billion. We probably could save them more than that \nif, in fact, we didn't divert some of the proceeds that the Government \ngets off of student loans to the Affordable Care Act by about $2 \nbillion a year.\n  We ran into significant pushback from several Members of this body. \nIn fact, 18 Members of this body, mostly from the other party, opposed \nthis law. The junior Senator from Vermont called it a disaster for \nyoung people in our country looking to go to college. This law was also \nvocally opposed by the senior Senator from Massachusetts. But today, it \ndemonstrates the shortsightedness that was displayed then. Today, \nbecause of what we did in a bipartisan fashion passed by this body, \nparents and students have saved $46 billion, and in North Carolina this \nnext year, it is projected that they will save another $1.1 billion in \ninterest payments on their student loans. This is a day that Congress \ncan be proud of because we have done something good for the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the Senator from \nNorth Carolina. He was the leader in 2013, along with Senator Manchin \nand Senator Coburn, who was here at the time--I was a little bit \ninvolved at the time--and Senator Angus King from Maine. We worked with \nthe President and with the House. The Senator is exactly right. The \ndecision that Senator Burr and others made, persuading this Congress \nand working with the President in 2013 to take the student loan \ninterest rate out of politics and tie it to a certain rate, today \nreduces the rate by 0.5 percent for nearly 6.4 million students and \nsaves millions and millions of dollars on student loans.\n  There is a lot of talk about student loans and the cost of them. Some \npeople don't look at all aspects of them. In Tennessee, the independent \ncolleges and universities have pointed out to me that the new overtime \nrule proposed by the Department of Labor would add as much as $850 per \nstudent to the cost of tuition at all of the independent colleges in \nTennessee, which is an outrageous thing to be doing.\n  Here is an example of real leadership, real action, and real results \nby the Senator from North Carolina, the Senator from Maine, and the \nSenator from West Virginia, who by their action in 2013, working with \nthe President, have reduced the cost of going to college for 6.4 \nmillion American students. A lot of people can talk; some people can \nget a result.\n  The Senator from North Carolina, the Senator from Maine, and the \nSenator from West Virginia got a result. I thank them for it. Let's \ngive credit where the credit is due. President Obama was instrumental \nin that decision. He worked with Senator Harkin and with others in \nhelping us come to an agreement.\n  For those who think that things can't get done, things do get done \nhere, and sometimes they help people who would like to have the help. \nCongratulations to Senator Burr for saving millions of dollars for \nstudents who are taking out student loans.\n  Mr. President, in just a moment, we will have two votes on the Energy \nand Water appropriations act. The first is on the amendment by the \nSenator from Maryland, Mr. Cardin. The second vote is on the amendment \nby the Senator from Nebraska, Mrs. Fischer. Other than a voice vote on \nSenator Flake's amendment, those are the last votes on amendments that \nwe have for the Energy and Water appropriations bill.\n  As soon as the majority leader and the Democratic leader agree that \nwe can schedule the vote on final passage--either later today or \ntomorrow--\n\n[[Page S2699]]\n\nfor the first time since 2009, we will have completed an Energy and \nWater bill in regular order across the floor of the Senate, which every \nsingle Member of this body has a chance to participate in, rather than \njust having the 30 members of the Appropriations Committee and then \neverybody else being presented with a great big omnibus bill at the end \nof the year, which they really don't have a chance to change.\n  Everybody had a chance to weigh in on this. About 80 Senators did \nbefore it came to the floor. We will have considered about 21 more \namendments. It has been a very good process. There were a couple of \nbumps, but this is the Senate. We deal with the bumps. I thank Senator \nCardin for his contributions and Senator Fischer for hers. When we are \nthrough with that, we hope to finish the bill.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 3871\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 3871, offered by the Senator from Tennessee, \nMr. Alexander, for the Senator from Maryland, Mr. Cardin.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time \nto be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the \nDemocratic leader, the Senate proceed to executive session for the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 307; that there be 60 minutes for debate \nonly on the nomination, equally divided in the usual form; that upon \nthe use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the nomination \nwithout intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the \nSenate then resume legislative session without any intervening action \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am pleased to report to the Senate, \non behalf of Senator Feinstein and myself, that basically we are \nfinished with our work on the Energy and Water appropriations bill. The \nfinal vote--all that remains to be done--will be set whenever the \nmajority leader and the Democratic leader agree it can be.\n  I will have more to say about the bill tomorrow, but I thank Senators \nfor their cooperation on this. If we are able to pass it tomorrow, this \nwill be the first time we have taken this bill--the Energy and Water \nappropriations bill--across the floor in the regular order since 2009. \nWhat that means is that every single Senator has had a chance to weigh \nin on it--first in the committee, where we received recommendations for \npolicy from 80 or so Senators on both sides of the aisle, and then we \nprocessed another 21 amendments here on the floor. I hope it is a good \nmodel for the other 11 appropriations bills that we have.\n  When we voted for the fourth time on whether to end debate on the \nbill, I was pleased to see that the vote was 97 to 2. I hope that is an \nindication of what the final vote will be when the leaders set it. I am \nconfident that Senators will vote for it in big numbers because we have \nhad an open and fair process. We have had a full amendment process.\n  Almost every Senator is represented in the bill, and many Senators \nhave already been home taking credit for what is in the bill. So I hope \nthey will now vote for what they have been taking credit for when they \nhave an opportunity--hopefully tomorrow.\n  So we will wait to see when the majority leader and the Democratic \nleader decide to set the vote, but other than the final passage of the \nbill, we have completed our work on the Energy and Water appropriations \nbill, and I thank the Senate for the opportunity to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am encouraged that the Senate will soon \ncomplete consideration of the Energy and Water Development \nappropriations bill. This legislation funds important components of our \nnational defense, invests in our waterways and flood control \ninfrastructure, and supports a safe and affordable domestic energy \nsupply.\n\n[[Page S2700]]\n\nI commend the managers of the bill, the senior Senator from Tennessee, \nMr. Alexander, and the senior Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein. \nThey make a good team. They have been persistent and they have worked \ndiligently to ensure that all Senators' interests have been considered \nin drafting this legislation.\n  I look forward to continued progress on appropriations bills in the \nweeks ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, southern Illinois lost a legend and one of \nits brightest lights. Last week, Barbara Brown passed away at the age \nof 61. Barbara was blessed with every God-given gift one could ask for: \nintelligence, strength, compassion, kindness--just to name a few. She \nhad it all.\n  She was a remarkable woman who wore many hats during her political \ncareer: vice-chair of the Democratic Party of Illinois, precinct \ncommitteewoman, chairwoman of the Randolph County Democratic Central \nCommittee, and treasurer for the Pierre Menard Democrat Club. She also \nhelped found and lead the Southwestern Illinois Democratic Women and \nthe Southern Illinois Democratic Women, two grassroots organizations \nworking toward a more equitable representation of women in all levels \nof government. Barbara Brown was an exceptional leader.\n  Born in Red Bud, IL, Barbara spent her life working for the people of \nsouthern Illinois. In 1985, she earned her doctorate from Southern \nIllinois University, at Carbondale, and a love for teaching. Barbara \ntaught political science at SIU for more than 30 years. And when she \nmade a commitment to something, she saw it through. Barbara began \nplaying the organ when she was 14 years old at St. Mary's Catholic \nChurch of Ellis Grove. She became a lifelong parishioner and continued \nplaying the organ for more than 40 years.\n  The highlights of her life were her family. She and her husband, \nDick, had three sons: Jay, Matt, and Nate. The tribute Nate gave to his \nmother at her funeral service was every mother's dream: a salute to a \nlife of values, caring, support and love.\n  Even outside her home, Barbara was the quintessential teacher by the \nbook and by her example. She gave up many summers to teach classes in \nAmerican Government and democracy for international students through a \nprogram funded by the U.S. State Department. Her legendary energy made \nher an inspirational professor and at the same time a tireless public \nservant. She was a trailblazer. Barbara ran for office when many women \nheld back. She was a two-time candidate for the Illinois State Senate \nand a nine-time delegate to the Democratic National Convention, \nincluding playing key roles in the Presidential campaigns for Bill \nClinton and Barack Obama. And from 2000-2012, Barbara Brown was the \nclerk of courts for Randolph County, IL.\n  Outside of politics, Barbara was a cofounder and president of the \nIllinois Women's Institute for Leadership and helped establish the \nAmerican Cancer Society's Relay for Life in Randolph County. She was a \nforce of nature. Through her many leadership roles, Barbara became a \nprominent voice for the rights of women, the underprivileged, and the \nmost vulnerable in the community. And that is what public service meant \nto Barbara Brown.

Mr. President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget \nscorekeeping report for May 2016. The report compares current law \nlevels of spending and revenues with the amounts the Senate agreed to \nin the budget resolution for fiscal year 2016, the conference report to \naccompany S. Con. Res. 11, and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, P.L. \n114-74, BBA 15. This information is necessary for the Senate Budget \nCommittee to determine whether budget points of order lie against \npending legislation. It has been prepared by the Republican staff of \nthe Senate Budget Committee and the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, \npursuant to section 308(b) of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  This is the fourth report that I have made this calendar year. It is \nthe first report since I filed the statutorily required fiscal year \n2017 enforceable budget limits on April 18, 2016, pursuant to section \n102 of BBA 15, and the eighth report I have made since adoption of the \nfiscal year 2016 budget resolution on May 5, 2015. My last filing can \nbe found in the Congressional Record on April 6, 2016. The information \ncontained in this report is current through May 9, 2016.\n  Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee \nexceeds or is below its allocation for budget authority and outlays \nunder the fiscal year 2016 budget resolution and the fiscal year 2017 \nenforceable budget levels filing. This information is used for \nenforcing committee allocations pursuant to section 302 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, CBA. For fiscal year 2016, which is \nstill enforced under the 2016 congressional budget resolution, Senate \nauthorizing committees have increased direct spending outlays by $2.7 \nbillion. Over the fiscal year 2017-2026 period, which is the entire \nperiod covered by the fiscal year 2017 enforcement filing, Senate \nauthorizing committees are unchanged from assumed levels. Prior to \nupdating the budget window, however, this table would have shown that \nSenate authorizing committees violated their allowable outlay levels by \n$147.9 billion over the fiscal year 2016-2025 period. This breach is \nlargely attributable to the nonappropriations provisions, extensions of \nthe tax expenditure policies originally found in the American Recovery \nand Reinvestment Act of 2009, included in last year's consolidated \nomnibus appropriations bill, most of which were charged to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Table 2 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations exceeds or is below the statutory spending limits for \nfiscal year 2016. This information is used to determine points of order \nrelated to the spending caps found in section 312 and section 314 of \nthe CBA. On December 18, 2015, the President signed H.R. 2029, the \nConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, P.L. 114-113, into law. This \nbill provided regular appropriations equal to the levels set in BBA 15, \nspecifically $548.1 billion in budget authority for defense accounts, \nrevised security category, and $518.5 billion in budget authority for \nnondefense accounts, revised nonsecurity category.\n  Table 3 tracks the same enforcement information as Table 2 for fiscal \nyear 2017. While no appropriations bills have been enacted, \nsubcommittees are charged with permanent and advance appropriations \nthat first become available for fiscal year 2017. These include \nspending on veterans healthcare, special and K-12 education, housing \nassistance, job training, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. \nThe discretionary limits, which were increased by a combined $30 \nbillion in BBA 15, split evenly between defense and nondefense \naccounts, are $551.1 billion for defense and $518.5 billion for \nnondefense.\n  Table 4 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations is below or exceeds its allocation\n\n[[Page S2701]]\n\nfor overseas contingency operations/global war on terrorism, OCO/GWOT, \nspending for fiscal year 2016. This separate allocation for OCO/GWOT \nwas established in section 3102 of the conference report for S. Con. \nRes. 11, and is enforced using section 302 of the CBA. The consolidated \nappropriations bill included $73.7 billion in budget authority and \n$32.1 billion in outlays for OCO/GWOT in fiscal year 2016. This level \nis equal to the revised OCO/GWOT levels that I filed in the Record on \nDecember 18, 2015. There is no equivalent enforcement of OCO/GWOT for \nfiscal year 2017. Instead, the handling of OCO/GWOT-designated spending \nwill revert back to the traditional treatment with the chairman of the \nBudget Committee making dollar-for-dollar adjustments to levels for \ncongressional enforcement and the Office of Management and Budget \nmaking statutory adjustments to the limits if the President agrees with \nthe congressional designation of spending as OCO/GWOT.\n  The fiscal year 2016 budget resolution established two new points of \norder limiting the use of changes in mandatory programs in \nappropriations bills, CHIMPS. Tables 5 and 6 show compliance with \nfiscal year 2016 limits for overall CHIMPS and the Crime Victims Fund \nCHIMP, respectively. This information is used for determining points of \norder under section 3103 and section 3104, respectively. Enacted CHIMPS \nare under both the broader CHIMPS limit, $1.3 billion less, and the \nCrime Victims Fund limit, $1.8 billion less. While the Crime Victims \nFund limit is enforced only for fiscal year 2016, the overall CHIMPS \nlimit remains in effect for fiscal year 2017 and is displayed in Table \n7.\n  In addition to the tables provided by the Senate Budget Committee \nRepublican staff, I am submitting additional tables from CBO that I \nwill use for enforcement of budget totals agreed to by the Congress.\n  Because legislation can still be enacted that would have an effect on \nfiscal year 2016, CBO provided a report for both fiscal year 2016 and \nfiscal year 2017. This information is used to enforce aggregate \nspending levels in budget resolutions under section 311 of the CBA. \nCBO's estimates show that current law levels of spending for fiscal \nyear 2016 exceed the amounts in last year's budget resolution by $138.9 \nbillion in budget authority and $103.6 billion in outlays. Revenues are \n$155.2 billion below the revenue floor for fiscal year 2016 set by the \nbudget resolution. As well, Social Security outlays are at the levels \nassumed for fiscal year 2016, while Social Security revenues are $23 \nmillion below levels in the budget.\n  The significant breach of aggregate spending levels in fiscal year \n2016 is attributable to increased spending unaccompanied by action on \nany of the deficit reduction assumed in the budget resolution. The \nviolation of revenue levels stems from the tax provisions from last \nyear's final appropriations and tax extenders bill. A point of order \nwas raised against this violation, but Congress waived the budget \ndiscipline by a vote of 73 to 25, rollcall vote No. 338 of the 114th \nCongress, First Session. Of the 73 votes that waived budget discipline \non this bill, 37 were from the majority, and 36 were from the minority. \nIn voting no, I was joined by 15 other members of the majority and 9 \nmembers of the minority.\n  For fiscal year 2017, CBO estimates that current law levels are below \nthe fiscal year 2017 enforcement filing's allowable budget authority \nand outlay aggregates by $974.3 billion and $592.4 billion, \nrespectively. The allowable spending room will be reduced as \nappropriations bills for fiscal year 2017 are enacted. Revenues are at \nthe level assumed for fiscal year 2017. Finally, Social Security \noutlays and revenues are at the levels assumed in the fiscal year 2017 \nenforcement filing.\n  CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate's \npay-as-you-go rule. As part of the fiscal year 2017 enforcement filing, \nthe Senate's pay-as-you-go scorecard was reset to zero. The scorecard \nwill reflect the deficit effects of legislation over the fiscal year \n2016-2021 and fiscal year 2016-2026 periods. Prior to updating the pay-\nas-you-go scorecard for the new budget window, the scorecard showed \ndeficit reduction of $20.4 billion and $95.7 billion over the fiscal \nyear 2015-2020 and fiscal year 2015-2025 periods, respectively. This \nbalance was largely attributable to counting the offsets contained in \nBBA 15 but not the spending, which was discretionary and subject to \nfuture appropriations actions, and omitting legislation from the \nscorecard that increases the deficit, for instance section 1001(b) of \ntitle X of division O of P.L. 114-113, which kept most of revenue and \ndirect spending provisions included in the bill from being counted. The \nSenate's pay-as-you-go rule is enforced by section 201 of S. Con. Res. \n21, the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution.\n  All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n TABLE 1.--SENATE AUTHORIZING COMMITTEES--ENACTED DIRECT SPENDING ABOVE\n                   (+) OR

Mr. President, we wish to highlight an issue of \nimportance to Colorado and its community of senior citizens. Earlier \nthis month, Congress passed the Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act \nof 2016 and sent it to the President for his signature. This \nreauthorization ensures that a wide range of social and nutritional \nservices directed to assist senior citizens is not disrupted. While the \nreauthorization improves the status quo for the State of Colorado, we \ncontinue to have concerns about the disproportionate level of funding \ngoing to our State in comparison to the rest of the country.\n  Mr. BENNET. I agree with my colleague from Colorado. In an attempt to \nprotect certain States with guaranteed funding levels, in 2006 Congress \nchanged the Older Americans Act funding formula to ensure States \nreceived a guaranteed funding level based on senior populations. Due to \nColorado's growing senior population and this provision from 2006, \nColorado saw massive cuts during sequestration, when other States did \nnot.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Instead of allowing the funding to go to States with \ngrowing senior populations, the hold-harmless funding formula in the \ncurrent reauthorization continues the disproportionate trend by \npreventing funding in States with lower senior populations from going \nto States with growing levels of senior citizens. While we are \nsupportive of the services provided by the Older Americans Act, \nCongress's priority should be ensuring the stability of the programs \nthat millions of seniors around the country depend upon.\n  Mr. BENNET. We believe that, moving forward, it is imperative that \nsteps are taken in future reauthorizations to safeguard services for \nall seniors regardless of their State of residence. It is our hope that \nas Congress continues to address issues that are important to all \nsenior citizens, we find a path forward to address the issue we have \nraised here today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/senate-section/article/S2704-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL TAMHRA HUTCHINS-FRYE\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate \nTamhra Hutchins-Frye on her recent promotion to brigadier general in \nthe Arkansas Air National Guard.\n  Brigadier General Hutchins-Frye was born in Bakersfield, CA, and \nentered the Air National Guard in November 1984 as an airman first \nclass. She received her commission in August 1989 through the Academy \nof Military Science in Knoxville, TN, and has held various assignments \nin the 188th Fighter Wing in Fort Smith, AR, the 189th Airlift Wing at \nthe Little Rock Air Force Base, and Arkansas Air National Guard and \nJoint Force Headquarters at Camp Robinson in North Little Rock.\n  She was deployed to Kabul, Afghanistan, in support of Operation \nEnduring Freedom as the chief of staff of the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization's Afghanistan Transformation Task Force and then the \nHeadquarters International Security Assistance Force, where she helped \nlead the transformation of the Government of the Islamic Republic of \nAfghanistan as it transitioned to self-rule.\n  Tamhra earned a bachelor of science in elementary education from \nArkansas Tech University in 1983 and a master of arts in human resource \nmanagement from Webster University in 2012. She has also completed \nnumerous trainings and programs during her time in the Air National \nGuard.\n  As a dedicated member of the Air National Guard, Hutchins-Frye has \nbeen awarded the Legion of Merit and a Bronze Star. She is also an \nactive member of her community and takes a proactive role in giving \nback and investing in the lives of others as displayed by her roles as \ncochairman of the Women's Foundation of Arkansas's Girls of Promise and \nas a member of the board of directors of Heart of Arkansas United Way, \namong other types of service.\n  It is also important to note that Brigadier General Hutchins-Frye is \nthe first woman to obtain this rank in the Arkansas Air National Guard. \nBy virtue of this latest achievement in her impressive and \ndistinguished career, she serves as role model for many, including the \nyoung women in our Armed Forces, of how hard work and professionalism \ncan lead to historic and ground-breaking achievements.\n  I offer my sincere congratulations to BG Tamhra Hutchins-Frye on this \nmomentous occasion, and I applaud her continued commitment and \ndedication to our Nation's readiness. I know she will continue to make \nArkansas proud in this new chapter of her career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/senate-section/article/S2704-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2704-S2705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNIZING THE BENTONVILLE POLICE DEPARTMENT\n\n   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the \n100th anniversary of the Bentonville Police Department, which was \nestablished on May 9, 1916, when community leaders adopted an ordinance \nto create the Office of Watch to protect its 2,000 citizens.\n  As the community grew, so did the need to increase police personnel. \nIn 1951, community leaders approved expanding the department by adding \na chief of police, two patrolmen, and the first patrol car. A lot has \nchanged with the Bentonville Police Department in the last century. \nToday there are 99 men and women in the police department providing \nservices that extend beyond the description of the 1916 department, and \nthey are doing things only imagined at that time.\n  The talents and abilities of the men and women serving in today's \ndepartment are put to good use to protect the 44,000 Bentonville \nresidents. They work tirelessly to ensure the public is safe as members \nof investigative units, forensic analysis teams, K9 teams, a bomb \nsquad, a bicycle team, a SWAT team, and a crisis negotiations team. \nTheir commitment to the community is exemplified by the numerous \nprograms and outreach efforts they offer to the people of Bentonville.\n  The wide range of calls members of the Bentonville Police Department \nrespond to shows the need for preparation and training. These officers \nare\n\n[[Page S2705]]\n\namong the most visible public servants and risk their lives to protect \nthe community.\n  I offer my congratulations on this milestone and thank Bentonville \nPolice Chief Jon Simpson and the officers and staff who serve and \nprotect the citizens of Bentonville for their service to the community. \nThey have made Bentonville one of the safest communities in Arkansas \nand in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/senate-section/article/S2705-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO AL RANKINS, SENIOR\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to commend Al \nRankins, Sr., of Greenville, MS, for his service and contributions to \nthe State of Mississippi while serving as the 80th president of the \nDelta Council. Since its founding in 1935, this important organization \nhas grown into a widely respected economic development collaborative \nrepresenting the business, professional, and agricultural interests of \nthe Mississippi Delta region. I am grateful to Delta Council for its \ncontinuous role in meeting the economic and quality of life challenges \nin this unique part of our country.\n  Al Rankins' tenure as council president began in May 2015, and he has \nbeen a notably strong advocate for the Delta Council's role in water \nresources development. His effective leadership on flood control issues \naffecting the alluvial floodplain has served the area well. His former \nservice as a local public official has provided him a unique \nperspective on the needs of proper access to healthcare, workforce \nreadiness, educational progress, and important matters related to \ntransportation infrastructure in this rural, predominantly agricultural \nregion.\n  A native of Washington County, MS, Mr. Rankins graduated from Simmons \nHigh School in Hollandale, MS, and later received a bachelor's degree \nin criminal justice from Mississippi Valley State University. Prior to \nhis contributions as president of Delta Council, Mr. Rankins served his \ncommunity as a law enforcement officer, an elected county official, \npast president of 100 Black Men of the Mississippi Delta, and active \nparticipant in the local Boys and Girls Club. Mr. Rankins' dedication \nto the future of the delta and all of those who live there is laudable. \nI am pleased to join the people of my State in commending Al Rankins \nand sharing our appreciation with his wife, Mary, and their children, \nCeCelia, Alfred, Jr., Ansel, and Anthony, as the 81st annual meeting of \nthe Delta Council organizational membership convenes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/senate-section/article/S2705-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE IMMIGRANT AND REFUGEE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this year marks the 40th anniversary \nof the Immigrant and Refugee Community Organization, IRCO, a nonprofit \norganization that serves the many immigrant and refugee communities \nthat come to Oregon seeking a new and better life.\n  Since its founding in 1976, IRCO has been helping individuals and \nfamilies who come to the United States with few resources and little \nsupport. Established by refugees, for refugees, the organization has a \nlong track record of providing vital housing, healthcare, and \nemployment services. IRCO staff offer peer-to-peer assistance and \nculturally specific services through programs like the Asian Family \nCenter and Africa House. IRCO served more than 28,000 people in 2015 \nalone, helping these new Oregonians integrate into communities across \nour State while maintaining an important connection to their rich \nheritage and traditions.\n  Beyond offering immediate support for those starting a life in the \nUnited States, IRCO has also become an advocacy arm for Oregon's \nimmigrants and refugees. Its leadership development programs have \ngraduated many individuals who have worked with key decisionmakers to \npursue change in Oregon and beyond.\n  As many in this Chamber know, I am the son of immigrants who fled \nNazi Germany to avoid persecution. The act of helping immigrants and \nrefugees resettle, to become contributing Americans, is close to my \nheart. I know firsthand how this country thrives by harnessing the \nideas, energy, and hard work of those who come to our shores--in fact, \nI stand here today as the proof. That is why I will continue to do what \nI can to support organizations, like IRCO, working day-in and day-out \nto ensure everyone gets a fair shot at success.\n  I conclude by congratulating IRCO on 40 years of tremendous service \nand by wishing all of its staff, volunteers, and partners continued \nsuccess in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/senate-section/article/S2705-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/senate-section/article/S2705-4", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/senate-section/article/S2705-5", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:30 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 32.

A bill to amend the Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 and the \nIndian Law Enforcement Reform Act to provide for advancements in public \nsafety services to Indian communities, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Tribal Law \nand Order Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2016. Senator \nMcCain and I are introducing this important piece of legislation to \nenhance public safety efforts in American Indian and Alaska Native \ncommunities.\n  I want to thank Senator McCain for his leadership, as a former \nChairman and a current Member of the Senate Committee on Indian \nAffairs, on this issue. He has been a staunch advocate for safe Indian \ncommunities, particularly for the children.\n  This bill would build on the improvements made by the Tribal Law and \nOrder Act of 2010 passed by Congress to address the unconscionably high \ncrime rates in these communities. The Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 \nwas intended to be a first step in the right direction in improving the \neffectiveness of criminal justice systems in Indian Country.\n  The Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 was based on five fundamental \nprinciples: to increase the Federal response and accountability; \nencourage greater cooperation between tribal, Federal, and State law \nenforcement; provide tribal justice officials with additional tools to \ncombat crime; improve Federal programs to strengthen tribal justice \nsystems; and improve data collection and information sharing relating \nto Indian Country crime.\n  Since that time, numerous reports have been issued by the Departments \nof the Interior, Justice, and Health and Human Services as required by \nthe act. The Committee has held oversight hearings on public safety \nissues in Indian communities, including a field hearing in my home \nstate of Wyoming on the Wind River Indian Reservation. The Committee \nalso held a roundtable with many stakeholders regarding the next steps \nneeded for improving justice systems in these communities.\n  The testimony and discussions were clear that the crime rates have \ndiminished some but still remain unacceptably high on too many \nreservations. Likewise, barriers for Indian law enforcement agencies \nstill exist to accessing criminal databases, sharing information, \nreceiving required reports, training, and technical assistance. The \nCommittee received testimony on the need for more resources to develop \nvarious part of tribal justice systems including jury trials and public \ndefenders services.\n  Most notably, the testimony indicated that alcohol and substance \nabuse were contributing factors in nearly all crimes in Indian \ncommunities. Several witnesses, including U.S. Attorney Christopher \n``Kip'' Crofts from my home state of Wyoming, highlighted the need to \naddress this problem to improve public safety.\n  The most troubling aspect of the reports, the discussions, and the \nhearings is that the children face the most heartbreaking situations. \nIn particular, American Indian and Alaska Native juveniles are \noverrepresented in Federal and State juvenile justice systems. In \naddition, there is a lack of training, collaborgion, communication, and \ncooperation among agencies regarding juvenile justice for these youth.\n  The tribal youth in the Federal system may spend more time in secure \nconfinement than youth in the state systems, sometimes by several \nyears. Tribal youth in the Federal system may also be placed in \nfacilities which can be located far away from their communities and \nfamilies. On top of this, appropriate services for tribal youth in the \nFederal system may be unavailable as well.\n  Tribal leaders have expressed concerns to me that they do not want to \nlose a generation of their people. It is incumbent upon Congress and \nthe administration to do everything we can to help these young people \nturn their lives around.\n  For these reasons, we introduced this bill to work toward safer \ncommunities and provide more accountability from the Federal agencies \nwhich have a trust responsibility to the Indian tribes and their \nmembers.\n  The bill would address Federal accountability; increase data sharing \nand access to data bases; support alternatives in detention; \nreauthorize and build on resources for public safety efforts; and \nimprove justice for Indian youth. It would also assist Indian tribes in \naddressing violent and drug crimes through Federal courts.\n  This is the type of bill that we can all get behind and get signed \ninto law this year. I urge Members to join me in the effort to improve \nthe lives of Indian people through these stronger public safety \nmeasures.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/11/senate-section/article/S2710-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      committee on armed services\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.
