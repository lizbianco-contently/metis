Mr. President, I have been pleased to see the progress \nwe have made on the FAA Reauthorization Act, and I appreciate the \nSenators who have worked to process amendments such as those that \nbolster airport security. Last evening we processed another set of \namendments to help make this good bill an even better one.\n  One such amendment, offered by Senator Flake, would help improve \ncommunication between the FAA and local airports in order to provide a \ngreater say for local stakeholders in the management of the airspace \nnear their own airports. This will benefit communities and airports \nacross the country, including at Kentucky's own Louisville airport. I \nappreciate Senator Flake's leadership on this issue and was pleased to \nsee this provision included in the overall bill.\n  I encourage Members who have ideas they think can strengthen the bill \nto continue working with the bill managers to move this legislation \nforward. Let's continue working today to take the next steps in seeing \nthis consumer-friendly FAA reauthorization and airport security bill \nthrough to passage.\n  This bill contains a number of important measures to increase \nsecurity in our airports and the skies. It also takes more steps to \nlook out for airline passengers. Here is how: It will improve \ninformation about seat availability and create a standard for \ninformation on fee disclosures. It will require airlines to offer \nrefunds to customers whose bags are lost or who have paid for services \nthey didn't receive. It will also maintain rural access and help \nimprove travel for passengers with disabilities.\n  There are some who think we should go further and reregulate the \nairline industry, but we know deregulation has helped make air travel \nmore accessible and more affordable for families and business travelers \nto get from point A to point B. I know there are some who think \nWashington bureaucrats should define what constitutes a reasonable fee, \nbut we want consumers to make that choice for themselves. That is why \nthis bipartisan bill includes the important consumer protection \nprovisions I mentioned earlier. We know this bipartisan legislation is \na result of months of dedicated work by Chairman Thune and his \ncounterpart Senator Nelson. It sets new requirements for making sure \ncustomers understand what fees they could face for certain ancillary \nservices, and then, importantly, it holds airlines accountable for \ndelivering to consumers.\n  This is commonsense legislation. It is the product of Senators \nworking across the aisle on behalf of the American people. Let's \ncontinue working together to move forward.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last Thursday the senior Senator from Iowa \ncame to the floor to declare that he is feeling no pressure in blocking \nPresident Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick Garland. \nHowever, Senator Grassley's actions paint a far different picture.\n  On Monday the chairman of the Judiciary Committee took to the Des\n\n[[Page S1882]]\n\nMoines Register, the very newspaper that has pointedly and repeatedly \ncriticized his unprecedented obstruction, but the case Senator Grassley \nmade in his op-ed only left Iowans scratching their heads. In effect, \nthe senior Senator from Iowa said it is no big deal that we only have \neight Justices on the Supreme Court. It is no big deal that our \nNation's highest Court is deadlocking on important cases. With all due \nrespect, that is the type of argument one makes knowing that logic and \nreason is not on your side, when you know the Constitution is not on \nyour side.\n  The senior Senator from Iowa seemed to understand the Senate's \nresponsibility to act when a Republican was in the White House. In 2006 \nhe came to the floor and said:\n\n       A Supreme Court nomination is not a forum to fight any \n     election. It is the time to perform one of our most important \n     constitutional duties and decide whether a nominee is \n     qualified to serve on the Nation's highest court.\n\n  Now he has reversed himself--and that is an understatement. From the \ntime he allowed the Republican leader to seize control of the Judiciary \nCommittee and dictate his actions as committee chair, Senator Grassley \nhas done everything to deflect responsibility on himself personally.\n  He forced his committee members to sign loyalty oaths. He tried to \nforce the committee to do its work away from the public eye. When \nDemocrats objected, he canceled the meeting altogether. He tried to \nshut down debate from the Presiding Officer's chair in the Senate, \nwhich is unprecedented. He blamed conservative Chief Justice John \nRoberts for politicizing the Supreme Court. These are just a few of the \nthings.\n  This morning Senator Grassley finally met with Judge Garland. He met \nin private, far away from the public eye. These are not the actions of \na Senator and chairman who is confident in his decision to block the \nSupreme Court nominee. This is the behavior of a Senator who knows he \nis on the wrong side of the Constitution and wrong side of history. \nWouldn't it be easier for the senior Senator from Iowa just to do his \njob?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/12/senate-section/article/S1882-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL EQUAL PAY DAY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are 102 days into 2016, but because of \nwage discrimination, working American women are still stuck in 2015. \nToday is National Equal Pay Day, a date that symbolizes how far into \nthe year women must work to earn what their male counterparts earned \nlast year for doing the very same work. That is because, on average, \nwomen make only 79 cents for every $1 their male colleagues make doing \nthe very same job. That means our wives, daughters, and granddaughters \nhave to work an additional 3 months and 11 days to make the same salary \ntheir male counterparts make in a single year.\n  This pay disparity between men and women for doing the same work is \nknown as the wage gap and it is to our national shame. No woman should \nmake less money than a man for doing the exact same work.\n  Democrats have tried repeatedly to pass Senator Barbara Mikulski's \nPaycheck Fairness Act, which would provide women with the tools they \nneed to close this wage gap. The Republicans have made it clear they \nhave no intention of fighting wage discrimination. They have \nstonewalled Senator Mikulski's legislation five times in recent years--\nfive filibusters--and when Republicans finally got around to offering \nlegislation they claim will address this important economic issue, it \nis anemic and devoid of actual reform.\n  The bills offered by the junior Senators from New Hampshire and \nNebraska are a case in point because the legislation does nothing to \nclose loopholes employers use to justify paying discriminatory wages, \nit does nothing to help victims of wage discrimination recoup lost \nincome, and it does nothing to incentivize employers to follow the law. \nThis legislation is only designed to look good, to say they are trying \nto do something about this, when in fact it does nothing. Just about \nthe only thing the Ayotte and Fischer bills actually do is make it \nharder for women to discuss wage discrimination at work. Their \nrespective bills so narrowly define what a woman can and cannot say \nabout wage discrimination that it completely ignores the reality of the \nsituation.\n  Factually, many women learn of wage disparities through casual \nconversation at work. In the famous Lilly Ledbetter case, that is how \nshe learned about it. They shouldn't be punished for realizing they are \nbeing discriminated against by their own employer. In short, the Ayotte \nand Fischer bills will not close the wage gap. Where the Republican \nlegislation fails, the Mikulski Paycheck Fairness Act succeeds.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act would help close the wage disparity by \nempowering women to negotiate for equal pay. This bill would give \nworkers stronger tools to combat wage discrimination and bar \nretaliation against employees for discussing salary information. This \nlegislation would help secure adequate compensation for victims of \ngender-based pay discrimination. These are commonsense proposals that \nare supported by the American people--not just women.\n  Later today President Obama will announce the designation of the \nBelmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument, which is located a few \nhundred yards from where I stand. Formally known as the Sewall-Belmont \nHouse and Museum, this national monument will honor the work of the \nNational Women's Party founder Alice Paul, who rewrote the Equal Rights \nAmendment. I think it is important that is done. President Obama says \nthis designation is a reminder of the many women who have fought for \nequality.\n  As we recognize Equal Pay Day, I hope my Republican colleagues will \ncome to their senses and address this injustice that hurts millions of \nAmerican families. Working women deserve more than just a half measure \nfrom Republicans. They deserve our best efforts to right this egregious \nwrong, because American women deserve equal pay.\n  I apologize to my distinguished friend from Vermont for having him \nwait while Senator McConnell and I were having conversations on the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/12/senate-section/article/S1882-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The distinguished Senator from Nevada owes me no \napologies. I am delighted to hear what he had to say and I agree with \nhim.\n  Mr. President, today we Vermonters and our neighbors, Americans \nacross the country, are going to recognize Equal Pay Day, a day that \nshines a spotlight on the glaring pay disparity between men and women. \nThe United States is often looked to as a leader in the global \nlandscape, setting the gold standard for others to follow. \nUnfortunately, our country fails to lead when it comes to pay parity. \nAmerican women continue to be treated unequally and unfairly in the \nworkplace.\n  On average, women are only paid 79 cents to every $1 paid to men. It \nis somewhat better in Vermont, but there is still a disparity of 83 \ncents to a dollar. Over a career, this means a woman is compensated \nhundreds of thousands of dollars to millions of dollars less than a man \nwith no other explanation for the disparity than their gender. This \npractice is unacceptable, and it runs contrary to American values.\n  The fight for equal pay for equal work has spanned generations and \ncontinues to impact nearly every corner of our country. From corporate \nboardrooms to locally owned small businesses, women have long fought \nfor their right to be treated with the same respect and dignity as \ntheir male counterparts.\n  When I think of this fight, I think of Lilly Ledbetter, a person whom \nI greatly admire and consider a friend. She\n\n[[Page S1883]]\n\nhas changed the lives of millions of Americans with her courage to \nstand up for equal pay. It has been nearly 9 years since five Justices \non the Supreme Court ruled, by just a one-vote majority, that her pay \ndiscrimination claim was invalid--not because of the facts. She had a \ngood pay discrimination claim, but the narrow majority said she did not \nfile a suit against her employer within the Federally mandated time \nperiod, even though the way the employer ran things, made it so she had \nno way of knowing she was being discriminated against at that time. I \nwas proud to work with Senator Mikulski and others to overturn this \ninjustice. We wrote and passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. This \nimportant legislation clarified the statute of limitations for filing \nan equal pay lawsuit regarding pay discrimination. I was proud to stand \nwith President Obama when he signed this into law, the very first law \nhe signed as President.\n  The progress achieved 7 years ago was important, but the fight for \nequal pay for equal work continues today. I am proud to cosponsor \nSenator Mikulski's Paycheck Fairness Act, an important bill to assure \nequal pay for equal work--a principle that people say they agree with \nbut for too long has failed to be a reality.\n  Today women from all over Vermont will assemble at the Vermont State \nHouse. They will highlight the initiative known as Change the Story, \nwhich aims to improve the economic status of women in my State. They \nwill note that while in Vermont women fare slightly better than the \naverage around the country, at the current pace, the wage gap will not \ndisappear before the year 2048. That is far too long for anybody to \nhave to wait.\n  I would also point out that in Vermont, women are twice as likely to \nlive in poverty in their senior years, when their savings amount to \nonly one-third of that of their male counterparts.\n  Every year, Marcelle and I present the Vermont Women's Economic \nOpportunity Conference. For two decades, it has helped support women-\nowned businesses. It encourages good-paying, nontraditional careers. \nBut as we prepare to mark the 20th anniversary of the Women's Economic \nOpportunity Conference in June, I would much prefer if we could \neliminate the need for such a conference. I look forward to the day \nwhen there is no gender wage gap and when career opportunities are \navailable to all women, but until that day comes, Marcelle and I will \ncontinue to present that conference.\n  Pay equality has recently received considerable attention at the \ninternational level. Why? In large part, due to the leadership of the \nU.S. Women's National Soccer Team. We can all recall the thrill last \nyear when this team of world-class athletes won for a third time \nsoccer's most coveted title, the FIFA World Cup.\n  I remember, and I remember my children and my grandchildren watched \nthat thrilling victory. It was the most widely viewed women's soccer \ngame in our Nation's history. Like so many other Americans, men and \nwomen, I took pride in their historic win. But then fans from across \nthe world were shocked to learn that members of the U.S. women's team \nreceived only $2 million for winning the 2015 Women's World Cup, while \nthe men's 2014 World Cup champions were awarded $35 million.\n  We were also astonished to learn that our 2015 world champion women's \nteam received $7 million less than the U.S. men's team that lost in an \nearly round of the men's 2014 World Cup. Even though this sports team \nmade enormous amounts of money from the television rights, the women \nwho earned those rights did not. They got paid less than the men who \nlost. They got paid less for winning than the men who lost.\n  So, as a result of this alarming inequity, I introduced a Senate \nresolution calling on FIFA to eliminate its discriminatory prize award \nstructure and to award all athletes with equal prizes. It was \ndisappointing that not a single Republican was willing to cosponsor \nthis resolution. When I tried to get it passed to support fairness for \nour champion women's team, when I tried to get this passed to say that \nwe should treat women fairly--we should treat the women athletes the \nsame as men athletes--Senate Republicans blocked it from going forward.\n  As more Americans learn of this unfairness, I am hopeful that \nSenators will join me to support this passage and that Republicans will \nstop blocking it. Senators should not be afraid to be on record \nsupporting equal pay for equal work for all athletes--in fact, equal \npay for equal work for all women.\n  Opponents of an equal prize award structure in sports have pointed to \nrevenue as the reason behind this gross disparity. This is \nunacceptable. Tennis icons such as Billie Jean King and Venus Williams \ndid not accept these arguments; instead, they fought for equal prize \nawards in the face of overwhelming adversity.\n  Their impressive efforts led to equal prize awards at the U.S. Open \nTennis championships and Wimbledon, which now provides all athletes, \nmen and women, with the respect they deserve. So I am proud to stand in \nsupport of the U.S. Women's National Team in their fight for equal \nprize awards from FIFA and for equal treatment from the U.S. Soccer \nFederation.\n  The disparities that exist in these organizations are outrageous. \nThey should be remedied immediately. They should be arranged so that \nmen and women are treated fairly and equally. While every Democrat has \nsupported that, I hope Republicans will stop blocking it.\n  As we reflect on the important meaning of Equal Pay Day, I would note \nthat it is not just Republicans or Democrats--but all Americans across \nthe country who should continue to join the growing movement to \neliminate discrimination from the workplace. Hard-working women--our \nmothers, our sisters, our wives, our daughters, and our \ngranddaughters--deserve no less.\n  We should pass this resolution recognizing the achievement of the \nU.S. Women's National Team as the Women's World Cup champions. We \nshould pass Senator Mikulski's Paycheck Fairness Act, which I have \nproudly cosponsored. We should take these simple and straightforward \nsteps to guarantee pay equity protections against workplace \ndiscrimination. The time for equality is now. Let's be honest. Let's \nstand up and say: Both men and women should be treated equally.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as my friend, the top Democrat on the \nJudiciary Committee, is leaving the floor, I want to thank him so much. \nI think the example of women's soccer is so perfect. People do not \nunderstand this disparity. Some say that many more people follow the \nwomen's soccer than the men's. I want to thank him for his leadership \non that.\n  I also want to say that when it comes to equal pay for equal work, \nyou need to remember three numbers--just three numbers: 79 cents--that \nis one number. Remember that one and $11,000 and $400,000. OK. Remember \n79 cents, $11,000, and $400,000. And 79 cents on the dollar is what the \naverage woman makes compared to the average man. So the man makes $1; \nthe woman makes 79 cents for the same work.\n  We are not talking about different jobs; we are talking about the \nsame. It costs the average woman and her family $11,000 a year. When \nyou add up that disparity, it is $11,000 a year. Think of what that \ncould buy for a family. And $400,000-plus is what the penalty is for \nthe average woman against the average man in a lifetime--$400,000. That \ncould translate into a retirement that is not stressful.\n  We are going to be here later today talking about this. The Mikulski \nbill will resolve a lot of these problems. I hope we can get the \nRepublicans to help us.\n  You know, this Senate has a rating of about 18-percent approval. \nWell, it is because people don't see us doing anything to help the \naverage person. Most women work. We have not even raised the minimum \nwage. These Republicans fight for the wealthy few. That is the problem. \nWe have given them a beautiful way to deal with it: Sign onto \nMikulski's bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/12/senate-section/article/S1883-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1883-S1884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             PILOT FATIGUE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this morning, in addition to these \ncomments that I just made, I want to talk\n\n[[Page S1884]]\n\nabout an amendment I am trying to get a vote on to the FAA bill, the \nFederal Aviation Administration bill, which is before us. This issue is \nanother no-brainer.\n  Later this morning, I will meet with Captain ``Sully'' Sullenberger. \nI think you remember him. He was the ``Hero of the Hudson.'' He was the \none who miraculously landed U.S. Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson \nRiver on January 15, 2009. Because of his incredible skill, he saved \nthe lives of all 155 passengers and crew.\n  When it comes to safety--safety, in terms of our pilots being able to \nthink clearly and not be suffering from fatigue, who could be better \nthan Captain Sullenberger? I am going to stand with him. I am going to \nexplain the issue that he and I are fighting for.\n  I first got into this issue--which is safety standards for all \npilots--in 2009 when Colgan Airlines Flight 3407 crashed into a home \nnear Buffalo, NY, killing 50 people. After that tragic crash, Senator \nSnowe and I wrote legislation that updated pilot and fatigue \nregulations. They had been written originally in the 1940s.\n  Clearly, there is a lot of scientific research on what happens when \nyou have a lack of rest. We needed to see a new rule. So, because of \nthe efforts of Senator Snowe and me, the Department of Transportation \nissued a rule in 2011 to ensure adequate rest for passenger pilots, \nwhich was great.\n  Shockingly, they left out cargo pilots. So I am going to show you a \npicture of two planes--two planes. Look at those planes. They look \nexactly the same. They share the same airspace, the same airports, and \nthe same runways. But guess what? Because of the disparity in this rule \nfrom the FAA, the pilots are not treated the same. Now, passenger \npilots cannot fly more than 9 hours in a day, while cargo pilots have \nbeen forced to fly up to 16 hours a day. Let me say it again. The rule \nthat came out of the FAA said: If you are a passenger pilot, you can \nonly fly up to 9 hours a day, but if you fly a cargo plane the same \nsize, you can fly up to 16 hours a day. How does this make sense? It is \ndangerous. It is dangerous. I will show you how. But our top safety \nboard, NTSB, the National Transportation Safety Board, has made \nreducing pilot fatigue a priority, mentioning it is on their top 10 \nlist of most wanted safety requirements for years.\n  So follow me. In 2011, we had the rule. The rule left out cargo \npilots. Since then, I have been trying, along with colleagues \nKlobuchar, Cantwell, and others, to change this. Now, let's look at \nwhat Captain Sullenberger has said about this issue. He said it about \nour bill: You wouldn't want your surgeon operating on you after only 5 \nhours of sleep or your passenger pilot flying the airplane after only 5 \nhours of sleep. And you certainly wouldn't want a cargo pilot flying a \nlarge plane over your house at 3 a.m. on 5 hours of sleep, trying to \nfind the airport and land.\n  They are working up to 16 hours without adequate opportunity for \nrest, so what we say in our amendment is simple: We want parity. We \nwant the same periods of flying time for both pilots.\n  Now you say: Well, Senator Boxer, have there been any accidents? Yes. \nSince 1990, there have been 14 U.S. cargo plane crashes involving \nfatigue, including a UPS crash in Birmingham, AL, in 2013 that killed \ntwo crew members.\n  In that tragedy, the NTSB cited pilot fatigue as a factor. Let's \nlisten to the pilot conversation, which was retrieved after the crash. \nLet's hear what those pilots, who were exhausted, said to one another. \nThen, if the Senate does not want to have a vote on this, I am going to \nstand on my feet until we do because, for sure, one of these planes is \ngoing to crash, whether it is in California or Nebraska or Arkansas or \nanywhere else in this Nation.\n  Listen to this.\n  Pilot 1: I mean, I don't get it. You know, it should be one level of \nsafety for everybody.\n  Pilot 2: It makes no sense at all.\n  Pilot 1: No, it doesn't at all.\n  Pilot 2: And to be honest, it should be across the board. To be \nhonest, in my opinion, whether you are flying passengers or cargo, if \nyou are flying this time of day, you know, fatigue is definitely----\n  Pilot 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n  Pilot 2: When my alarm went off, I mean, I'm thinking, I'm so tired.\n  Pilot 1: I know.\n  Well, let's look at what happened to this plane after this \nconversation. Just look at what happened to this plane. I think it is \nimportant that everybody look at it. It went down. It went down. Now, \nwhen that flight went down, I honestly thought: The FAA is going to \nchange. They are going to pass a rule. They are going to make sure that \nall pilots get that necessary rest. But they did not. They did not. One \nhour after that conversation I shared with you, Mr. President, this is \nwhat happened to that plane.\n\n  This dangerous double standard risks lives in the air and on the \nground, and it cannot continue. That is why our amendment and our bill, \nwhich we base the amendment on, are endorsed not only by Captain Sully \nbut also by the Air Line Pilots Association, the Independent Pilots \nAssociation, the Coalition of Airline Pilots Associations, the \nTeamsters Aviation Division, and the Allied Pilots Association.\n  Let me just ask a rhetorical question. If we don't listen to pilots, \nwho are in those planes, on what they need to fly safely, who on Earth \nare we listening to? And yet I can't get a vote on this. So far, I \ncan't get a vote. I am hoping I will. Let people stand in the well and \nvote against this safety provision, and the next time there is a crash, \nthey will answer for it. Stand up and be counted. We need a vote on \nthis provision. One level of safety for all pilots is one level of \nsafety for the public.\n  I am proud to stand with Captain Sullenberger and all the pilots in \nAmerica and the organizations that represent them to say this: If this \nis an FAA bill, if this is the Federal aviation bill and we have all \nkinds of goodies and tax breaks and this and that in there--which is a \nwhole other conversation--the least we can do is to stand up for \nsafety. The least we can do is to stand up for safety. I will insist on \na vote. I will stand on my feet until I get a vote, and I know the \npilots are going to be all over this place today knocking on doors.\n  The American people don't think we are doing anything for them. We \nhave the worst rating. My friends beat up on President Obama, but he \nhas the same ratings as Ronald Reagan during his time in the same \ntimeframe--same ratings as Ronald Reagan, their hero. We are down in \nthe gutter with our ratings because we put special interests ahead of \nthe people.\n  Now, maybe there are a few special interests that don't want to pay \ntheir pilots enough money, that don't want to give their pilots rest--\ntoo bad. They are wrong. They are jeopardizing lives on the ground. It \nis penny-wise and pound-foolish to have someone suffering from pilot \nfatigue flying over your home wherever you live in America.\n  All I want is a vote. I am just asking for a vote. So far, I do not \nhave that commitment, but we are working hard. We are hoping to get it. \nThat is why I came here today, and that is why I will be standing with \nCaptain Sullenberger later this morning--to call for a vote to make \nsure that after 9 hours of flight, pilots get adequate rest--not after \n16 hours--and to make sure there is parity, fairness, and equality \nbetween those flying a passenger jet and those flying a cargo jet. The \nfact of the matter is they share the same airspace, they fly over the \nsame homes, and they deserve not to be exhausted as they maneuver their \nplanes.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/12/senate-section/article/S1884-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1884-S1886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL EQUAL PAY DAY\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the issue of \nequal pay for equal work. Today is National Equal Pay Day, and this \nprovides us an opportunity to talk about how we can promote policies \nthat will make life easier and more flexible for American families. It \nallows us to celebrate the amazing advancements that women have made.\n  Women have an incredibly positive story to tell. We now hold more \nthan half of all professional and managerial jobs, double the number \nsince 1980. We earn over 55 percent of bachelor's degrees, run nearly \n10 million small businesses, and we serve in Congress at record levels.\n  Some may be surprised to see a Republican speaking out to support \nequal\n\n[[Page S1885]]\n\npay. My friends on the other side of the aisle have made quite an \neffort to politicize this issue, claiming that Republicans don't care \nabout equal pay.\n  I am here to state unequivocally that is ridiculous. Equal pay for \nequal work is a shared American value. At its core, equal pay is about \nbasic fairness and ensuring that every woman, just like every man, has \nthe opportunity to build the life she chooses.\n  For over half a century, the Equal Pay Act and the Civil Rights Act \nhave enabled women to make significant economic strides. Any violation \nof these important laws are illegal, and they should be punished to the \nfull extent of the law. But I believe we can also go further. Congress \nnow has the opportunity to recommit itself to this issue and ensure \nthat these existing laws are better enforced.\n  Our country is stronger today because women have advanced in the \nworkforce. There are stories of young women who start off at entry-\nlevel jobs and rise to the top of corporate ranks because someone \nsomewhere recognized their potential. There are managers and mentors \ncommitted to their team. Men and women across the workforce are focused \non cultivating strengths and providing thoughtful feedback in areas \nthat need improvement.\n  Unfortunately, there are also stories of pain, discrimination, and \nbias. We all have friends and neighbors, sisters and mothers who were \ntreated unfairly at some point in their careers. But silence does not \nfoster progress. I want to help every woman and every man put a stop to \nunfair pay practices, and this starts by breaking the barriers to open \ndiscussion.\n  Few realize the extent of this problem. In 2003 the University of \nPennsylvania conducted a study on how salaries are discussed in the \nprivate sector. The survey found that over one-third of private sector \nemployers have specific rules prohibiting employees from discussing \ntheir pay with their coworkers. This was reinforced by another survey \nfrom the Institute for Women's Policy Research. Roughly half of workers \nreported that discussing wages and salaries is either discouraged or \nprohibited and/or could lead to punishment. It went on to note that pay \nsecrecy appears to contribute to the gender gap in earnings.\n  These studies point to a common problem--one that is fueling anger, \nresentment, and fear. The American workforce is lacking protections for \nemployees to engage in this open dialogue about their salaries. People \nare afraid to ask how their salary compares to their colleagues. \nMeanwhile, current law does not adequately protect workers against \nretaliation from employers who want to prevent those conversations \nabout their compensation.\n  If you want to know how your salary compares to your colleagues, you \nshould have every right to ask. This is as basic as the First \nAmendment. Ensuring transparency would not only make it easier for \nworkers to recognize pay discrimination, but it would also empower them \nto negotiate their salaries more effectively.\n  Wage transparency is not a new initiative. It already enjoys support \non both sides of the political spectrum. In fact, both President Obama \nand Hillary Clinton are in favor of it. But not all transparency is \ncreated equal. Earlier this year, the Obama administration proposed a \nnew regulation targeting businesses with over 100 employees. The Labor \nDepartment would use this rule to require businesses to submit large \namounts of data regarding race, gender, and other statistics to the \nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission. The administration believes \nthis will end discrimination.\n  I believe this is just another government mandate that intrudes into \nthe operations of a private business. We can't discount the burden this \nwill put on employers and job creators, and every--every--new \nregulation creates a new cost. I also have real doubts that this raw \ndata will give the administration what it is looking for. Instead, it \ndoes risk presenting a distorted picture of pay data. Moreover, it \nremains unclear how this information would even identify \ndiscrimination. The data does not take into account other factors, \nincluding years of experience, education level, and productivity, and \nthey are appropriately used to determine a person's wages.\n  Looking at big data alone fails to tell the whole story. I am \nconcerned that the rigid compensation structures resulting from the \nPresident's proposal could force businesses to provide employees with \nless flexibility, and that would deal an even greater blow to women. \nThe same is true with the Paycheck Fairness Act. While it is very well-\nintentioned, it will ultimately hurt flexibility for women to form \nunique work arrangements, and it will undermine merit-based pay. \nInstead, we should be empowering both employers and employees to \nnegotiate flexible work arrangements that best meet their individual \nneeds.\n  I agree we have more work to do on equal pay, but the way we can make \nmeaningful and lasting progress isn't through a misguided Executive \naction that could hurt women. To make a difference in the lives of \nworking families, we must focus on building bipartisan consensus. I \nhave been working hard to do just that by collaborating with my \ncolleagues and generating support for my bill, which is known as the \nWorkplace Advancement Act.\n  I believe every American worker should have the ability to discuss \ncompensation without fear of retribution. My legislation breaks down \nthe barriers to open dialogue, allowing employees to ask questions and \ngain information. Access to this information could enable workers to be \ntheir own best advocates and let them negotiate for the salaries they \nfeel they deserve. Knowledge is power. By freely discussing their \nwages, workers can negotiate effectively for the pay they want.\n  My proposal has received the support of almost every Senate \nRepublican and also five Democrats. But as we know all too well, in \nWashington anything that receives bipartisan support stalls with five \nwords: It doesn't go far enough.\n  The biggest critics of this plan say that it is too modest. They \nclaim that transparency is only the first step and that a second step \nwould require mandates. But the truth is, meaningful change cannot \nhappen without action, and it cannot happen, colleagues, without \ncompromise. By its very definition, it requires both agreement and \naccommodation. My bill can make a real difference for American workers, \nand, unlike legislation that is offered by Democrats, my bill can \nactually pass.\n  Others would argue that this change is unnecessary because the right \nto discuss salaries is protected under existing law. While it is true \nthat certain employees and certain conversations are protected, there \nis no reason why we can't apply the same freedom to all Americans. As I \ndiscussed previously, surveys suggest that over one-third of private \nsector companies have specific prohibitions in place.\n  I am encouraged by the support we have already garnered on both sides \nof the aisle for this bill, the straightforward update to our equal pay \nlaws. It is achievable. We are all here to find solutions that both \nRepublicans and Democrats can achieve for the American people. An all-\nor-nothing attitude--well, that only prevents progress, and it leaves \nus with the false choices and stereotypes that have persisted for \ndecades.\n  Last week I was encouraged to hear Senator Mikulski and several other \nDemocrats hold a press conference and discuss the importance of \nprotecting workers against retaliation for discussing their salaries. I \nagree. Protecting workers who seek this information is a crucial step \ntoward ensuring that women and men are compensated fairly.\n  With that in mind, I call on my friend from Maryland and any other \nMembers of this body to work together on solutions to this problem. \nWage transparency is an area of common ground. Democrats praised the \nPresident's Executive order in 2014, and my bill goes further: It \nprotects more American workers. If we are going to make real, \nmeaningful change, we are going to have to work together. We should not \nlet raw politics stand in the way of progress for working women.\n  Congress has a real opportunity to make a difference for both men and \nwomen who work hard every day to provide for their families. Above all, \nwe can help them succeed and prosper in the workforce while being \nsecure in the knowledge they are compensated fairly for their work.\n\n[[Page S1886]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/12/senate-section/article/S1886-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1886-S1887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I think Senators Thune and Nelson have \ndone a great job of putting together the reauthorization bill for the \nFAA. It is something that should have been done some time ago. We are \nhoping the House will adopt what we have or something close to it \nbecause we are getting ready to do this. It is significant.\n  I want to mention something that people may not be aware of. This \nmonth leaders from around the world are going to meet in New York to \nsign the Paris climate agreement--an agreement that hinges entirely on \nPresident Obama's commitments to reduce emissions in the United States.\n  In Paris, he said: We commit that the United States will reduce our \nCO2 emissions somewhere between 26 and 28 percent by 2025.\n  Of course, that is just not going to happen.\n  President Obama has three legacies, as his days are now numbered. One \nof them is to take away people's guns. We all know about Second \nAmendment rights. Every time something happens, they always try to \nrestrict gun ownership. He still wants to do that. Closing Gitmo is \nanother one. The third one we are trying to survive is his global \nwarming program.\n  While the President has been working to solidify his legacy on global \nwarming, he has chosen to ignore the reality that the United States \nwill not keep his carbon promises. The document that will be signed on \nApril 22--Earth Day--will soon be added to the president's stack of \nempty promises on global warming. This has been going on since 1997. \nWhile President Obama will undoubtedly issue a press release praising \nthe signing as a ``historic'' event--he won't even be attending. That \nshould be a good indication that he knows he is not going to be able to \ndo this. He is not even going to be there.\n  Once again, I want to make sure the international participants are \nwarned that the President's climate commitment lacks the support of his \nown government and it is going to fail. There is no question about \nthat. I can say that because history has already repeated itself. I \nhave been on the frontlines dating back to the failed Kyoto treaty of \n1997. For over 20 years, history has been repeating itself, and I have \nbeen on the frontlines dating back to that time.\n  This is kind of interesting. In 1997 President Clinton and Vice \nPresident Gore went to the Kyoto convention. They signed the treaty and \nthey thought: This is great. Everyone is going to have to do cap and \ntrade.\n  They got back here, and there was a little thing called the Byrd-\nHagel resolution. It passed this body 95 to 0. What did it say? It \nsaid: If you come back with the Kyoto treaty and it does one of two \nthings, we will vote against it. That was 95 Members; there were 5 \npeople absent that day.\n  They said they would not do it if two things were in it: No. 1, if it \nis an economic hardship on the United States of America, and No. 2, if \nyou come back with a treaty that doesn't treat developing countries the \nsame as developed countries. In other words, if we have to do something \nin the United States that China doesn't have to do, that India doesn't \nhave to do, that Mexico doesn't have to do, then we will vote against \nit.\n  Of course, they came back with something that violated both. So there \nwas never any possibility that it was going to pass, and it didn't. We \nsubsequently rejected four cap-and-trade bills in the following 13 \nyears.\n  This past year a bipartisan majority in both the Senate and the House \nspoke again when we passed two resolutions of disapproval formally \nrejecting President Obama's carbon regulations. There is a little thing \na lot of people don't know about called the CRA, the Congressional \nReview Act. That means if the President tries to do something that is \nagainst the wishes of the people through their elected representatives, \nthen you can pass a CRA--Congressional Review Act--that will reject the \nregulation. So we passed two resolutions formally disapproving what he \nwas trying to do.\n  So I say to the 196 countries that might show up here: Don't show up \nanticipating that something is going to happen, because it is not. This \nisn't even supported by a majority of the Members of the Senate or the \nHouse. Congress has continuously shown that the American people don't \nwant the Federal Government imposing harsh penalties like cap and trade \nto address the highly contested theory of manmade global warming.\n  The first attempt to enact cap and trade back in 2003 would have cost \nour economy upwards of $400 billion a year.\n  I say to our good friend from Alaska who is the Presiding Officer \nright now that every time I hear a large figure, I take the current \npopulation in my State of Oklahoma--those families who actually pay \nFederal income taxes--and I do the math. In this case, this would cost \nin the neighborhood of $3,000 per family, and of course, as I will \ndemonstrate in just a minute, they will get nothing for that.\n\n  In 2003 the first bill that came up would have cost upwards of $400 \nbillion. This has not been contested, and the numbers aren't much \ndifferent from what the President is trying to do right now with his \nClean Power Plan, which he is trying to do through regulation because \nhe knows it won't pass as legislation.\n  The Clean Power Plan--the centerpiece of the President's promise to \nthe international community that the United States will cut greenhouse \ngases between 26 and 28 percent by 2025--this plan, which attempts to \ndo through regulation what the President was unable to do through \nlegislation, stands on very shaky legal ground.\n  Most recently, the Supreme Court joined the chorus in signaling to \nthe President that the President's efforts on climate change are dead \non arrival. This is the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I think we owe it to the 196 countries to let them know that nothing \nis going to happen once they get here. I think it is nice if they all \nwant to come and tour America and spend their money, maybe take old \nHighway 66 down through my State of Oklahoma and see what America \nreally looks like. I would love to have them come. But I want to make \nsure they know that nothing is going to happen in terms of the \nPresident's Clean Power Plan or his broader international commitments.\n  The Supreme Court dealt the President's legacy a major blow when it \nvoted 5 to 4 in February to block the implementation of Obama's Clean \nPower Plan while it is being litigated by over 150 entities, including \n27 States, including Oklahoma, which are filing a lawsuit to make sure \nthis does not happen. So we have a majority of States in America \nsaying: Not only do we not want it, but we are suing them to make sure \nit is not implemented. There are also 24 trade associations, 37 \nelectric co-ops and 3 labor unions challenging EPA in court. They are \nall filing these lawsuits, so the Supreme Court comes along and says: \nUntil these are resolved, we are going to stay the regulation.\n  This decision delays implementation of the rule until the next \nPresident and completely upends Obama's Paris commitments. Without the \ncentral component of his international climate agenda, achieving the \npromises he made in Paris is a mere pipe dream. Even with the Clean \nPower Plan, the United States would fail to meet 45 percent of the \npromised greenhouse gas emission reductions. Now, with the Supreme \nCourt's stay on these regulations, there could be an even greater \ndeficit. If the Clean Power Plan is overturned, the United States will \nmiss the mark by about 60 percent. Furthermore, the litigation on the \nClean Power Plan won't likely get resolved until 2018. That means the \nregulations will be blocked for at least the next 2 years, as the chart \nshows.\n  First, on June 2, the three-judge panel on the DC Circuit will need \nto hear the case. The three-judge panel will issue a decision sometime \nthis fall, and it will almost certainly be challenged with a request \nfor an en banc review by the entire DC Circuit. A decision from an en \nbanc panel won't come until much later--likely by the end of the year, \nas we can see on the chart. This decision will almost certainly be \nappealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the Court decides to hear the \ncase, a final decision is expected in late 2017 or 2018.\n\n[[Page S1887]]\n\n  The DC Circuit has already decided to delay hearing the case on the \nClean Power Plan's sister rule on carbon controls for new power plants \nuntil after the November elections, signaling little appetite for \nallowing this to be an easy, quick legal review of Obama's carbon \nmandates.\n  Similar to the Clean Power Plan litigation, any decision on a new \nsource rule--new sources of power plants--would likely be appealed to \nthe Supreme Court, with a final decision expected in 2018. Critically, \nthe new source rule is a legal prerequisite for the Clean Power Plan, \nso without the new source rule, there is no Clean Power Plan.\n  The success of Obama's carbon mandates hinges not on just one but on \ntwo Supreme Court wins that will be decided well after he leaves \noffice. He will be long gone. And with a new administration needing to \nfill a vacancy next year on the Court--who knows how that will impact \nor delay consideration of pending cases.\n  We are clearly a long way off from knowing the outcome of the \nPresident's carbon regulations. You wouldn't know that when you hear \nthe releases that came from Paris saying this has been a great success. \nHe made the commitment as to what kind of reductions we are going to \nhave when he in his own mind knew for a fact that was not even a \npossibility.\n  So we are a long way from knowing the outcome of the President's \ncarbon regulations that were written to help fulfill his pledge to \ninternational communities. But, as I said, Obama will be long gone by \nthat time.\n  It is important for the 196 countries involved in the Paris climate \nagreement to understand what I am saying. The Congress, the courts, \nclimate experts, and industry are all pointing to the same conclusion: \nPresident Obama's climate pledge is unattainable, and it stands no \nchance of succeeding in the United States. For the sake of the economic \nwell-being of America, that is a good thing. Again, we still would \nwelcome the 196 countries to come over here and enjoy America, but \ndon't expect any of President Obama's climate promises to happen.\n  A few countries have taken note. Specifically, China and India, two \nof the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gas, are now second-\nguessing the legitimacy of Obama's commitments.\n  Navroz K. Dubash, a senior fellow at the Center for Policy Research \nin New Delhi told the New York Times that ``[the Supreme Court stay] \ncould be the proverbial string which causes Paris to unravel.''\n  Zou Ji, the deputy director general of China's National Center for \nClimate Change Strategy and International Cooperation, also told the \nNew York Times: ``Look, [if] the United States doesn't keep its word, \nwhy make so many demands on us?''\n  In another display of solidarity against Obama's climate agenda, I \nled 34 Senators and 171 House Members in an amicus brief filed in the \nDC Circuit arguing that the Clean Power Plan is illegal. The plan would \ncause double-digit electricity price increases in 40 States and have no \nimpact on the environment. Further, these regulations would prevent \nstruggling communities from accessing reliable and affordable fuel \nsources, which could eventually lead to poor families choosing between \nputting food on the table and turning the heat on in the wintertime.\n  Much of the focus this past year has been the Clean Power Plan and \nthe Paris Agreement that is reliant on its success. The administration \nhas the power generation sector in its crosshairs, but they will not \nstop there. We know that. We are keenly aware of Obama's war on fossil \nfuels--coal, oil, and natural gas.\n  If I don't have to be someplace in conjunction with my obligations \nwith the Senate Armed Services Committee, I go back home every weekend. \nThey ask questions you don't hear in Washington. They ask: Now, wait a \nminute, if we are reliant upon fossil fuels--coal, oil, and gas--for 85 \npercent of the power necessary to run this machine called America and \nif Obama is successful in killing coal, oil, and gas, then how are we \ngoing to run this machine called America?\n  That is a logical question, but not here in Washington. You don't \nhear that here in Washington.\n  The Clean Power Plan is a template for unauthorized action, and if it \nworks for one sector, future bureaucratic agencies will use it to \nrestructure every industrial sector in this country. The immediate \nthreat to future generations is not climate change. The climate is \nalways changing and will continue to do so regardless of who is in the \nWhite House.\n  Luckily, the American people have caught on to the President's \nclimate charade. But don't take my word for it; just look at the polls. \nI can remember back when the first bills were coming out. There was the \nMcCain-Lieberman bill in 2003, and we looked at the bill. At that time, \nthe polls showed that global warming was either the No. 1 or No. 2 \nconcern in America. That has all changed. A FOX News poll found just \nthe other day that 97 percent of Americans don't care about global \nwarming when they stack it up against terrorism, immigration, health \ncare, and the economy. Even an ABC News/Washington Post poll from last \nNovember found that the number of Americans who believe climate change \nis a serious problem is on the decline. According to the Gallup poll--\nthey have a big one every March--the Gallup poll in March of 2015 had \nglobal warming coming in dead last of environmental issues that people \nare concerned about. George Mason University did a poll of 4,000 TV \nmeteorologists, and it also dispelled the President's talking point \nthat there is 97-percent consensus among scientists that humans are \ndriving climate change. The survey found that roughly one out of three \nmeteorologists do not believe man is the primary cause--if, in fact, it \nis happening.\n  Overall, neither the American people nor Congress supports the \nPresident's detrimental climate change agenda and his attempt to \nbolster his personal legacy with empty promises.\n  Let me wind up and say that we welcome the international community to \ncome over here, but with regard to the Paris Climate Agreement, nothing \nis going to happen.\n  I wish to mention a couple other things. Many countries quickly \njumped on the global warming bandwagon that the United Nations was \ntrying to sell to the world and instill an obligation to impose \nassociated restrictions. Australia was one of the first countries to \njoin in. They did this several years ago--until they realized what it \ncost, and then they came back and passed legislation taking themselves \noff of this so that they are no longer legally obligated to do anything \nabout their emissions.\n  If you stop and think about China, every 10 days China is building a \nnew coal-fired power plant. This is the country the president is using \nto justify his own climate agenda while convincing the American people \nChina is making similar contributions to reducing greenhouse gases. The \nproblem with this is that China admits they are going to continue to \nbuild coal-fired plants and increase emissions until the year 2030 and \nthen they will consider reducing their emissions. We know it is not \ngoing to happen.\n  Lastly, I remember when Lisa Jackson was appointed by President \nObama. She was his first appointment as Administrator of the EPA. I \nremember talking to her in a public meeting live on TV, and I asked her \nthe question: Let's assume that one of these pieces of legislation \npasses on cap and trade or that through regulation they are able to do \nit. Is that going to have the effect of reducing overall emissions \nworldwide?\n  She said: No, because this isn't where the problem is. The problem is \nin China; it is in India; it is in Mexico.\n  In fact, you can actually say this could have the effect of \nincreasing emissions because as we chase our manufacturing base \noverseas, it may go to countries like China that have lower \nenvironmental standards and will ultimately increase emissions, not \ndecrease.\n  So the President's international climate commitment is not going to \nhappen. I want to make sure people are aware of that. We wouldn't want \nthem coming over here under the impression that something is going to \nhappen when it is not.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/12/senate-section/article/S1887-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1887-S1888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, I would yield the floor, but I don't see \nanyone else here.\n  I would like to comment on the FAA reauthorization bill. I had a \ncouple of amendments to it, and I want to mention that both of my \namendments have now been accepted. I feel very good about that. I think \nwe are currently considering a bill that is very necessary to go ahead \nand get passed.\n  I again commend Senator Thune and Senator Nelson for working \nyesterday to get through a number of important amendments that were \napproved by the Senate. Included in the group was an amendment I \noffered that would direct the FAA to establish rules to allow critical \ninfrastructure owners and operators to use unmanned aircraft systems to \ncarry out federally mandated patrols and to perform emergency response \nand preparation activities. This is one I feel very strongly about \nbecause there is a lot of controversy around drones, but we do know \nthere are some things that have to be done--pipelines, for example. It \nis just as easy for a drone to do it, and it can be done in all kinds \nof weather.\n  This amendment would apply to energy infrastructure, such as oil and \ngas and renewable electric energy. It would apply to power utilities \nand telecommunications networks. It would apply to roads and bridges \nand water supply systems operators.\n  This amendment provides needed congressional direction to the FAA \nwhere there is a clear and articulable need, and I am glad it was \naccepted yesterday. I thank Senators Booker, Heitkamp, Whitehouse, \nMoran, and King for cosponsoring this amendment with me.\n  I want to turn to a provision that is in the base text of the FAA \nbill that is of particular importance to Oklahoma but impacts the \nentire aviation community--the commercial, military, and general \naviators--and that is because it impacts air traffic controllers.\n  The FAA bill, which is the bill we are considering right now, \nincludes a provision to encourage the hiring and retention of high-\nquality air traffic controller instructors. This is particularly \nimportant to me because the FAA Academy, which is where all the air \ntraffic controllers are trained, is located in Oklahoma City. These \ninstructors, who are required to have prior experience as air traffic \ncontrollers, are discouraged from working full time due to existing \ngovernment regulations because they are former air traffic controllers. \nWithout full-time instructors, we need four times as many part-time \ninstructors to provide the needed instruction time to train for the \nnext generation of controllers to manage the air traffic at our control \ntowers, so that means the FAA must bear four times the cost of training \nnew instructors. I am glad this bill will remove the government \nregulations that discourage full-time instructors. I thank my \ncolleagues for working with me to address this problem.\n  Another one--and this is very significant. This is volunteer pilot \nprotection. Last week I offered an amendment for consideration that \nsupports volunteer pilots. This is a Good Samaritan law for pilots. \nAcross the country, there are a lot of volunteer pilots. I myself have \ndone this. I have been an active commercial pilot for 60 years. I can \nremember several times--once going down to an island just north of \nCaracas, Venezuela, that had been wiped out by a hurricane. I found 10 \npilots to take down with me, medical supplies, food, and all of that.\n  During that time, if something had happened, even though he was a \nGood Samaritan--he was doing it at his own expense--he could have been \nsued for any number of exposures that are out there.\n  People are generous with their time and provide at no cost air \ntransportation to someone in need of specialized medical treatment. We \nhave done that before too. This amendment would provide those volunteer \npilots limited liability protection as long as they follow appropriate \nprocedures, as long as they have the required flight experience and \nmaintain insurance. My amendment would not eliminate liability but \nwould limit it in certain circumstances. Furthermore, volunteer pilots \nwho do not meet all requirements or who are guilty of gross negligence \nor intentional misconduct don't have any protections. Furthermore, the \npilots are required to maintain liability insurance to qualify for the \nprotection.\n  In the 1997 Volunteer Protection Act, Congress recognized that the \nwillingness of volunteers to offer their services is deterred by a \npotential for liability actions against them. I think that makes common \nsense. I think we all understand that. This amendment remains true to \ncongressional intent and removes a disincentive that keeps pilots from \nvolunteering to fly financially needy medical patients, humanitarian \nand charitable efforts, or other flights of compassion to save lives \nand to provide great benefit to the public.\n  Pilots are not going to get more reckless or choose to act more \ndangerously because they have liability protection. Pilots are already \nat risk, and they are a risk-adverse group because every time they fly, \nthey take their own life in their hands--regardless of why they are \nflying. These pilots are acting out of the goodness of their hearts and \nwillingness to help.\n  Fortunately, accidents are infrequent, and anecdotally I am told that \nin the past 10 to 15 years, there have been perhaps five or six \nlawsuits involving volunteer pilots and volunteer pilot organizations. \nSo the problem isn't that that is actually going to happen, but it is \nthe fact that there is a deterrent there to discourage people from \ndoing what they want to do, what a Good Samaritan does. The volunteer \npilot organizations that work to coordinate volunteer pilots do not \nneed to maintain databases of lawsuits and the results of lawsuits \nprecisely because they are so infrequent. If there were a lot of \naccidents and resulting law suits, I think it is fair to say the FAA, \nNTSB, and volunteer pilot organizations themselves would be \ninvestigating whether volunteer pilot activity was a safe activity to \nbegin with.\n\n  The larger concern for volunteer pilot organizations is that pilots \nwill not volunteer for fear of being involved in a lawsuit, which would \nthen prevent a needy service from being provided. So it is more about \nwhat the lawyers say the potential could be, and that has a direct \nimpact on recruitment for volunteer pilots. Looking ahead, if a pilot \nwere ever successfully sued and his or her assets were at risk, it \nwould be too late to act to prevent a mass exodus of volunteer pilots.\n  This amendment is about making sure there continues to be volunteers \nwho are willing to provide much-needed assistance. The amendment is not \nagreed to yet, but it recognizes the value of volunteer pilots and \ntheir contribution to the public good. I urge my colleagues to be \nsupportive of this effort.\n  In conclusion, I thank Senator Thune for his leadership, as well as \nSenator Nelson, for bringing this bill to the floor. I look forward to \na robust amendment process.\n  In fact, I encourage anyone who has an amendment to come down, \npresent his amendment, and talk about it. One of the problems we had \nduring the highway bill was not being able to get Members to bring \ntheir amendments down, and it ended up delaying the bill for several \nweeks, which was totally unnecessary. I also encourage the House to \ntake up and pass this bill.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Hirono pertaining to the introduction of S. 2784 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. HIRONO. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n\n[[Page S1889]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/12/senate-section/article/S1889-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1889-S1893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL EQUAL PAY DAY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Hawaii for her \nleadership on this issue, and I will be yielding the floor to the lead \nsponsor of today's effort.\n  Our Nation is built on the belief that anyone who works hard should \nhave the opportunity to achieve the American dream. Yet there are women \nacross this country who are doing the same job as their male colleagues \nand being paid less. That is why today, on National Equal Pay Day, I \nstand with my fellow Senators to renew our efforts to ensure equal pay \nfor equal work.\n  Fifty years after the passage of the Equal Pay Act, women still only \nearn 79 cents on every dollar paid to a man. This wage gap is even \nworse for women of color. African-American women who work full time \nmake only 60 cents for every dollar paid to white males. Hispanic women \nearn only 55 cents.\n  Women are paid less even when factors such as age, education, \noccupation, and work hours are taken into consideration. In nearly \nevery occupation in our country, women's median earnings are less than \ntheir male competitors. It is no different for women in my State of \nIllinois. The median earning for Illinois women is $10,000 less than \nthe median earning for men. While African-American women in Illinois \nmake slightly more than the national average, Hispanic women are paid \neven less--48 cents on the dollar. Think about that. Hispanic women are \nmaking less than half the earnings of their male coworkers who have \nsimilar levels of education and do the same job. This isn't right, and \nit isn't fair.\n  The gender wage gap translates into nearly $11,000 less in median \nearnings for women each year and over $430,000 in lost wages over a \nlifetime. Now that women are the sole or primary breadwinners in 4 out \nof 10 families, this means less money for food, housing, and education. \nIt is no wonder the poverty rate for female heads of households \ncontinues to be disproportionately high.\n  This disparity follows women into their retirement since retirement \nsavings and Social Security are based on income earned. In Illinois, \nthe average weekly Social Security benefit for female retirees is 77.3 \npercent of the average for Illinois males per week. While female \nretirees receive less, on average, compared to men under Social \nSecurity, women tend to live longer and spend more on medical care, \nforcing them to do more with less.\n\n  What would happen if we closed this wage gap? Amazing things. Sixty \npercent of women would earn more if they were paid the same wages as \ntheir male counterparts, nearly two-thirds of single working mothers \nwould receive a pay increase, and the poverty rate for women would be \ncut in half. It would mean fewer families in poverty and fewer families \nwould need safety net programs. Equal pay for equal work would also \nmean women and their families would have more to spend on basic goods \nand services, and that is good for our economy.\n  So what do we have to do to close this wage gap? We can pass the \nPaycheck Fairness Act introduced by my colleague Senator Mikulski and \nmy friend and colleague Senator Murray. Employers still maintain \npolicies that punish employees who voluntarily share salary information \nwith coworkers. This makes it nearly impossible for employees to find \nout whether they are being paid fairly.\n  This bill would provide women the same remedies for pay \ndiscrimination as people who are subjected to discrimination based on \nrace and national origin. It would also close loopholes in current law \nthat still permit retaliation against workers who disclose their wages.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act would build on the success of the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act, which clarified the 180-day statute of \nlimitations for filing a lawsuit on pay discrimination that resets with \neach affected paycheck. This was the first bill signed into law by \nPresident Obama in 2009. The Senator from Maryland remembers that day \nbecause President Obama signed the bill, took the first pen that he \nused to sign it, and handed it to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I remember that because I stood there and thought: That \nis entirely appropriate that a Senator who has dedicated her life to \nthis kind of fairness and equality for women at work would receive the \nfirst pen from the first bill signed into law by this new President.\n  My Republican colleagues: Why aren't you with us on this issue? Don't \nyou agree that your daughter should be paid the same as your son for \ndoing the same work? It is a basic issue of fairness. It shouldn't have \nanything to do with party labels, so we invite you to join us. This \nshould not be a partisan issue at all. Certainly for women at work, it \nis not partisan. It is just a matter of fairness. I urge my colleagues \nto support this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I come to the floor to join my \ncolleagues in calling for equal pay for equal work for women.\n  I just left the President of the United States. He is right up the \nstreet at the Sewall-Belmont House. This is the home of the National \nWoman's Party in which so much organizing and strategizing took place \nto get women the right to vote. The President is there to declare that \nbuilding a national monument to commemorate the tremendous work that \nwas involved in getting suffrage, under the Antiquities Act, and that \nis his right to create that.\n  It is not only the building we want to preserve. It is not only the \nrecords of the battle for suffrage that we want to preserve and be able \nto display. It is what it stands for: the fact that women are included \nfully in our society.\n  We had to fight every single day in every single way to be able to \nadvance ourselves. Even when the men were in Philadelphia writing the \nConstitution, thinking great thoughts and doing great deeds, Abigail \nAdams was back in New England running the family farm, keeping the \nfamily together, and she wrote John a letter saying: Don't forget the \nladies because if you do, we will ferment our own revolution.\n  In our country, we call revolutions social movements where ordinary \npeople organize and mobilize to accomplish great deeds to move \ndemocracy forward. It took us over 150 years to get the right to vote \nin 1920. We are coming up on the anniversary of suffrage, but it is not \nonly that we got the right to vote, it is what that right to vote \nmeans. We wanted to be able to participate fully in our society. We \nwanted to be able to exercise our voice in terms of choosing leaders \nwho will choose the right policies. Along the way, we have been \nadvocating those policies.\n  In 1963, working with the President, who was committed to civil \nrights, Lyndon Johnson, the equal pay for equal work act was passed as \npart of a great step forward in three major civil rights bills. We \nthought we had settled the issue, but, no, 50 years later we have only \ngained 19 cents--19 cents. At that rate, it will take us until 2058 to \nget equal pay for equal work. That is not the way it should be. We need \nto make sure we eliminate the barriers and impediments that allow this \nto keep happening.\n  When we women fight for equal pay, we are often sidelined, redlined, \npink-slipped, harassed, or intimidated. We are often confronted with: \nWhy are you doing this? And then we are often harassed for doing it.\n  People may say: Senator Barb, didn't you take care of that when you \npassed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act in 2009. The Lilly Ledbetter \nlegislation, of which I am so proud, has kept the courthouse doors open \nby changing the statute of limitations, but now we need to pass \nlegislation to end the loopholes that are often strangleholds on women \ngetting equal pay in the first place.\n  I have legislation pending called the Paycheck Fairness Act. That \nPaycheck Fairness Act does three things. First of all, it stops \nretaliation for even sharing pay information in the workplace. Right \nnow, if you ask, you are forbidden to tell, or get fired. If you ask, \nyou are forbidden to tell, or get fired, or if you are a man working \nside by side with a woman and you want her to know that as a nurse, as \na computer software engineer, what your pay is, and there is an \nopportunity, she could get fired and he could get fired. This is wrong.\n\n  We also want to stop employers from using any reason to pay women \nless,\n\n[[Page S1890]]\n\nsuch as he has a better education. Use the same education for the same \njob. We are willing to compete. We are out there. More women are in \ncollege. More women are Phi Beta Kappas. More women are getting ahead.\n  Then we heard: He has to be paid more because he is the breadwinner. \nWhat are we, crumbs? If he wins the bread, we want to be winners too. \nVery often it is women in the marketplace who are now either the sole \nbreadwinner or also a significant breadwinner, and the men or the \npartner they love says: We want you to get equal pay for equal work as \nwell.\n  So we don't want to hear: He is the breadwinner. We don't want the \ncrumbs anymore. We want to be paid equal pay for equal work. We also \nwant punitive damages for women who are discriminated against. Backpay \nalone is not a strong enough deterrent.\n  I want my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to know they have \nideas. One of my colleagues spoke on the floor earlier today. I have \nsuch admiration for her. She is a fine Senator, and she agrees with the \nthrust of the press conference we had. We have faced this in the past, \nwhere we share the same goal, but we differ on means. My means, I must \nsay, are the way forward. These means are the way forward because they \nsolve the problems.\n  Of course, we will sit down and talk, have conversations, and see \nwhat we can do, but at the end of the day, we face this issue: It costs \nmore to be a woman. Women pay more for everything. Women pay more in \nmedical costs than men, given the same age and the same health status. \nWomen pay a significant amount of money for childcare. Guess what. \nWomen get charged more for dry cleaning. We have to pay more for our \nblouses being cleaned than men to have their shirts washed and pressed.\n  We are tired of being taken to the cleaners. We want equal pay for \nequal work. Whether we are U.S. Senators, whether we are nurses or \nexecutive assistants or others, we want equal pay for equal work.\n  We stand with the women's soccer team. They kick the ball around, but \nwe are tired of being kicked around. So give us equal pay for equal \nwork. Pass the Mikulski coeffort to get equal pay for equal work. I \nthink we can then move forward. Why should our women go to the Olympics \nwinning the gold, when they don't get paid the gold? So it is time for \na change, time for a difference, and time for something we can do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I wish to say a special thank-you to \nSenator Mikulski for her terrific leadership on all of this.\n  Today is Equal Pay Day. By the sound of it, one would think it is \nsome sort of historic holiday commemorating the anniversary of a \nlandmark day that our country guaranteed equal pay for women, but that \nis not what it is about--not even close--because in the year 2016, at a \ntime when we have self-driving cars and computers that fit on our \nwrists, women still make only 79 cents for every $1 a man makes, and we \nare still standing in the U.S. Congress debating whether a woman should \nget fired for asking what the guy down the hall makes for doing exactly \nthe same job.\n  So why do we recognize April 12 as Equal Pay Day? It took the average \nwoman working from January 1 of last year until today to make as much \nas the average man made in 2015. That means she had to work an extra \n3\\1/2\\ months in order to make what a man made last year, and that \nmeans, once again, she starts the year in a hole.\n  Equal Pay Day isn't a national day of celebration. It is a national \nday of embarrassment.\n  We hear a lot about how the economy is improving, and there is good \nnews to point to. Unemployment is under 5 percent, GDP continues to \nrise, the stock market is up, but too many families across the country \nfeel like the game is rigged against them. They work hard, they play by \nthe rules, and they still struggle to make ends meet. Here is the \nthing: They are right. The game is rigged against working families, and \npay discrimination is part of that.\n  For women, it has been a one-two punch in the gut. For decades, wages \nhave flattened out for American workers, and for women the wage gap \njust compounds that problem. If we closed both the productivity wage \ngap and the gender wage gap from 1979 to 2014, women's median hourly \nwages would be 70 percent higher today.\n  Even though we have solid data, the Republicans in Washington refuse \nto act. Heck, they would rather spend their time trying to defund \nPlanned Parenthood health clinics and cut women's access to birth \ncontrol than do anything--anything at all--to give working women a \nraise.\n  So, yes, the game is rigged when women earn less than men for doing \nthe same work. It is rigged when women can be fired for asking how much \nthe guy down the hall makes for doing the same job. It is rigged when \nwomen have to choose between healthy pregnancies and getting their \npaychecks. It is rigged when women can get fired just for requesting a \nregular work schedule to go back to school or get a second job. It is \nrigged when women earn less their whole lives so that their Social \nSecurity checks are smaller and their student loans are bigger. The \ngame is rigged against women and families, and it has to stop.\n  I am standing with my colleagues today. I am standing with women and \nfriends of women all over the country to demand equal pay for equal \nwork. It is 2016--not 1916--and it is long past time to eliminate \ngender discrimination in the workforce. This is about economics, but it \nis also about our values. It is about who we are as a people and what \nkind of country we are trying to build for both our sons and our \ndaughters.\n  Today, we recognize Equal Pay Day, and we fight today because we \ndon't want to have to recognize it year after year after year in the \nfuture.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today on Equal Pay \nDay to stand up and speak out about an issue that impacts women and \nfamilies in every State across this great country. I rise to give voice \nto the fact that there is paycheck inequality for working women across \nthis country, and it is time that we do something about it.\n  Working women make up over 50 percent of our workforce, and they are \nworking harder than ever to get ahead. But far too many are barely \ngetting by, and far too many women and children are living in poverty. \nIn Wisconsin, the economy is lagging behind other States. Household \nincomes are falling and communities across our State are experiencing \njob loss and layoffs. In fact, recent reports have concluded that \npoverty in Wisconsin has reached alarming levels.\n  The least we can do is to level the playing field and give women a \nfair shot at getting ahead, because they deserve equal pay for equal \nwork. So I am proud to join several of my colleagues today to deliver a \ncall for action to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n  I would like to share the story of Shannon. Shannon is a single \nmother of three from Two Rivers, WI. She is working hard to support her \nfamily. In order to help her family get ahead, Shannon has continued \nher education to advance her career as an interpreter in a school. But \nshe faces the grim reality that women teachers are often paid less than \ntheir male counterparts.\n  It is not just teaching. When we look at men and women working \nequivalent jobs across different industries, women are making less than \ntheir male counterparts across the country. This paycheck inequality is \nholding women back, and it is holding our entire economy back. Closing \nthe gender pay gap would give Shannon and her family more financial \nfreedom to better deal with the daily issues that working moms face. \nWhether it is an unexpected car problem or children outgrowing their \nclothing and their shoes, whether it is help to pay off student loan \ndebt or the ability to save a little bit of their paycheck to ensure \nthat their kids have a chance for a higher education, working families \nacross America need paycheck fairness to ensure they have a fair shot \nat getting ahead.\n  Millions of American women get up every day to work hard for that \nmiddle class dream--a good job that pays the bills, health care \ncoverage you can rely on, a home that you can call your own,\n\n[[Page S1891]]\n\nand a secure retirement. But instead, gender discrimination in pay is \nholding women and their families back.\n  Let's pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and strengthen families and our \neconomy by providing working women with the tools they need to close \nthe gender pay gap. By taking action, we will show the American people \nour commitment to building an economy that works for everyone, not just \nthose at the top.\n  Before I yield, I wish to take a moment to thank and recognize the \nsenior Senator from Maryland, Barbara Mikulski, for her tremendous \nleadership on this issue. It has been an honor to serve alongside such \na champion for women and families, and I am looking forward to \ncontinuing this particular fight together and winning this fight \ntogether.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me first thank Senator Baldwin for her \ncomments. I agree with her statement, and I am also grateful for the \nleadership of the senior Senator from Maryland and the leadership \nSenator Mikulski has shown on gender issues. The paycheck fairness \nlegislation is just a recent example of her extraordinary leadership \nthroughout her career on gender equity issues.\n  I particularly wanted to be here not only to say how proud I am of \nSenator Mikulski but also to state that the Paycheck Fairness Act is \nnot about women. It is about families, about our economy, and about \nfairness. It is about American values. It affects everyone in America. \nWe all should be personally engaged in making sure paycheck fairness \nbecomes law. To this Senator, it is outrageous that a woman has to work \n5 days at the same work that a man works in 4 days for the same pay. \nThat is inherently unfair and needs to be corrected. The Paycheck \nFairness Act would do that.\n  I note that today is Equal Pay Day, which basically reflects how long \na woman has to work--basically without getting a paycheck--in order to \nget paid for the same amount of work as a man does in a year.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, as a member of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, this Senator has the privilege of being the \nranking member on the committee. One thing we look at is how other \ncountries deal with basic rights. One of those rights is how they treat \ntheir women. One of the barometers for determining how well a country \ndoes is how well they are treating women. If they treat women well, \nthey are generally doing much better.\n  The truth of the matter is, in many cases women do better in \ninvestments than men. They invest in children, families, and economic \ngrowth, whereas men are more likely to invest in war. We see much more \neconomic growth where women are treated fairly in other countries.\n  It is an important value for America. We have promoted gender equity \nissues in our foreign policy, our development assistance, and in our \ndiplomacy. But for us to be effective globally, we first need to take \ncare of our issues at home.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act would do exactly that. It would deal with \nthe issue of fairness in the workplace in America. We are not where we \nneed to be. Everybody talks about the fact that women aren't paid as \nmuch; and that is true. But if you happen to be a minority, it is even \nworse. We need to take care of this for the sake of the American \neconomy, for our values, et cetera.\n  This Senator has introduced legislation that would allow us to pick \nup the ratification of the equal rights amendment so that we could have \nin the Constitution of the United States fairness with no gender \ndiscrimination. This would be a lot easier. We only need three States \nin order to ratify it and to become a part of our Constitution. The \nlate Justice Scalia noted accurately that there is nothing in the \nConstitution that requires discrimination against women; but there is \nnothing in the Constitution that protects discrimination based upon \ngender. We can do a better job with fundamental changes.\n  What we can do in this Congress now is to take on paycheck fairness. \nThat can get done in this Congress and can be effective this year and \ncan be the legacy of this Congress. I would urge my colleagues: Let's \ndo this. We all talk about gender equity issues. With the bill that is \npending on paycheck fairness, we can act and we can act now. We can \nmake a major change in American policy that will not only be fair to \nwomen but will be fair to all Americans and allow our economy to grow.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my esteemed \ncolleague from Maryland, who is here with a number of other people to \ntalk about the need to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act to make sure that \nwe end once and for all paycheck discrimination against women.\n  I think the American people believe very strongly in fairness, equal \ntreatment, and a level playing field for everyone, because these are \ncore American values. I think that is why people find it shocking and \nunacceptable that women in the United States continue to be denied \nequal pay for equal work.\n  More than half a century ago, President Kennedy signed into law the \nEqual Pay Act, yet today wage discrimination continues as an ugly \nreality across our Nation. Women earn only about 79 cents for every $1 \nmen earn. It is a disparity that exists at all levels of education, in \nnearly every industry, across hundreds of occupations, from elite \nprofessionals to everyday blue-collar workers. There are complex \nfactors that contribute to the gender pay gap, but according to a new \nstudy by the Joint Economic Committee, as much as 40 percent of the pay \ngap can be attributed to outright discrimination.\n  Probably, most people who have watched TV in the last couple of weeks \nhave seen one particularly egregious example that has been cited, and \nthat is the U.S. women's soccer team, whose members make only about \none-quarter of what their male counterparts make. Both the women's and \nmen's soccer teams work for the same employer, the U.S. Soccer \nFederation. The women's soccer team generates significantly more \nrevenue than the men's team. It has won the Women's World Cup three \ntimes, including last year. It has been the Olympic champion four times \nand has been the world's top-ranked team for nearly two decades. Yet \nthey are paid a quarter of what men make. It is hard to understand that \nunder any circumstances except outright discrimination.\n  As outrageous as that case is, the wage gap is even more damaging to \nthe 40 percent of American women who are sole or primary breadwinners \nin households with children, to the women who are waitresses and \ncertified nursing assistants, and to secretaries who work at jobs where \nequal pay is not only about fairness but it is also about providing \nadequately for their families. It is about being able to afford \nInternet access so their kids can do their homework. It is about paying \nfor their child's inhaler. There is a lot that women breadwinners can \ndo with that extra $10,800 that women would earn on average if it were \nnot for pay discrimination.\n  I also serve as the ranking member on the Senate's Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship Committee, and I have seen how similar gender gaps \nconfront women-owned small businesses. Just as women on average are \npaid 21 percent less than men, a recent Commerce Department study found \nthat the odds of businesses owned by women winning a Federal contract \nare about 21 percent lower than for otherwise similar companies--for \nmale-owned enterprises.\n  In workplaces across America, women are speaking out more and more \nand are demanding equal pay. It is time for Congress to do our job as \nwell. I know from experience that legislation can make a difference. As \nGovernor, I signed a law to prohibit gender-based pay discrimination in \nNew Hampshire and to require equal pay for equal work. We haven't made \nas much progress as I would like at this point, but at the time we \nsigned that law, women in New Hampshire were making 69 percent of their \nmale colleagues' wages. Today, they are making 76 percent or a little \nless than the national average.\n  Back in the early 1980s, I served on New Hampshire's Commission on \nthe\n\n[[Page S1892]]\n\nStatus of Women. I chaired a report on employment in New Hampshire. At \nthat time, women were only making 59 cents for every dollar a man \nearned. The conclusion of that report was that this has an impact not \njust on women, but it is an impact on, of course, their whole family. \nIt is something that their children, their husbands, and their entire \nfamily is affected by. If we can close this pay gap for women, it helps \nnot only the women who make up two-thirds of minimum wage workers, but \nit helps their families. It helps pull their kids out of poverty.\n  We need to do more at the Federal level, and that is why I strongly \nsupport the Paycheck Fairness Act. This legislation would empower women \nto negotiate for equal pay, it would close loopholes that courts \ncreated in the laws that are already in place, and it would create \nstrong incentives for employers to obey these laws.\n  This legislation is about basic fairness. It is about equal \ntreatment. It is about creating a level playing field in the workplace \nfor our daughters and our granddaughters and for every American. It \nalso is about making sure that their spouses, their children, and their \nrelatives benefit from making sure that they have the same access to \nequal pay as the men in the workplace do.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the Paycheck Fairness Act. Sixteen \nyears into the 20th century is way past time to make good on our \npromise of equal pay for equal work in the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are 103 days into 2016, and on Equal \nPay Day, that number takes on significant, unfortunate meaning. Women \nhave to work 103 extra days to match what men earned last year. That is \nunacceptable. Workers should be paid fairly for the work they do, \nregardless of their gender. Closing the wage gap would help grow our \neconomy from the middle out, not from the top down.\n  I am glad to be here today with my colleagues to recognize Equal Pay \nDay, to stand up on behalf of women across the country, and to renew \nour call to put an end to the wage gap. Last year, I heard from a woman \nnamed Sandy from Seattle. Right out of college, Sandy got a job at a \nlocal nonprofit. After a couple of months of work, she was just \nchatting with a male colleague and found out he was offered 20 percent \nmore in salary for doing the exact same job. She thought there had been \nsome mistake. But when she asked about it, her boss told her they could \nnot offer her a pay raise because of budget constraints.\n  Sandy's story is so common. On average, women today make 79 cents for \nevery dollar a man makes. The pay gap is even wider for women of color. \nThat is not just unfair to women; it hurts our families, and it hurts \nour economy. Today, 60 percent of working families rely on wages from \ntwo earners--60 percent.\n  More than ever, women are likely to be the primary breadwinner for \ntheir family. Women's success in today's economy is critical to \nfamilies' economic security and to our Nation's economy as a whole. We \nneed to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act to help close the wage gap. I so \nappreciate Senator Mikulski's tremendous leadership and passion on this \nissue. Her Paycheck Fairness Act would make it unlawful for employers \nto retaliate against workers for discussing pay. It does so in a \ncommonsense way that reflects today's reality in the workplace.\n  It would empower women to negotiate for equal pay. It would close \nsignificant loopholes in the Equal Pay Act. It would create strong \nincentives for employers to provide equal pay. Passing the Paycheck \nFairness Act is a critical stop on the long list of things we can do to \nbuild our economy from the middle out and make sure our country works \nfor all families, not just the wealthiest few.\n  No matter where they live, no matter their background, no matter what \ncareer they choose, on average, women earn less than their male \ncolleagues, even women soccer players on the U.S. Women's National \nTeam. The Women's National Team has won three World Cup titles. They \nhave won four Olympic Gold Medals. But despite all of their success, \nthey are not immune from the pervasive wage gap. In fact, on average as \nplayers, they earn four times less than their male counterparts. It is \nnot just about the men. Think about the message the wage gap sends to \nyoung girls who see women valued less than men for doing the same work \nand, in the case of the women's soccer team, doing it so much better.\n  I am glad members of the women's national soccer team are taking a \nstand to gain equal pay for the work they do. In the Senate, we are \ngoing to keep championing the Paycheck Fairness Act to make equal pay a \nreality for women across the country. I look forward to an Equal Pay \nDay in the future that we can actually celebrate, once we finally \nachieve pay equity regardless of gender.\n  Until then, my colleagues and I are going to keep fighting on behalf \nof all women and families until they get the equal pay they have \nearned.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be here with both \nof the Senators from Washington, one of the few States that have two \nSenators who are women. It is great to be here with both of them. I \nwould also like to thank Senator Barbara Mikulski for leading the \neffort for the Paycheck Fairness Act. She is the longest serving woman \nin congressional history. She has opened many doors for all of us.\n  When she first wrote her book about women in the Senate, it was \ncalled ``Nine and Counting.'' Well, today, our count is even higher, as \nthere are 20 women in the Senate. She was the first woman--Barbara \nMikulski was--to chair the Senate Appropriations Committee. Because of \nher groundbreaking work in this Congress, 10 committees have either a \nchair or a ranking member who is a woman.\n  Today, as the presiding officer knows, President Obama formally \ndedicated a new national monument to honor women's suffrage and equal \nrights. I am a cosponsor of the bill to have the Sewall-Belmont House \nnamed as a national historical site. The Belmont-Paul Women's Equality \nNational Monument is named after Alice Paul and Alva Belmont, two \nleaders of the National Woman's Party. It will house an extensive \ncollection that documents the history of the movement for women's \nequality.\n  What has happened in the last decade or so? Well, in 2009, we passed \nthe Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to make sure that workers who face pay \ndiscrimination based on gender, race, age, religion, disability, or \nnational origin have access to the courts. In doing so, we restored the \noriginal intent of the Civil Rights Act and the Equal Pay Act.\n  Now it is time to prevent that pay discrimination from happening in \nthe first place. We all know women have made big strides in our country \nand in our economy over the last few decades. Women are getting \nadvanced degrees. They are starting new businesses. The Fortune 500 now \nhas 20 women CEOs. That does not sound like much, but when you look \nback just a few decades, there were not any.\n  Yet, despite all of the progress we have made and all of the gaps \nthat we are starting to close, women in this country still earn only \naround 80 cents for every dollar a man makes. When two-thirds of \ntoday's families rely all or in part on the mother's income--and in \nabout 40 percent of families the mother is, in fact, the main bread \nwinner--this pay gap has real consequences for American families and \nour entire economy.\n  I wanted to focus on one issue at the end here, and that is \nretirement savings, which are maybe not the first things you would \nthink about when you think about a pay gap. It is probably not what our \nyoung pages think about. They don't think: Well, what about what the \nretirement gap? But, in fact, it is something everyone should be \nthinking about.\n  When I was the Senate chair of the Joint Economic Committee, I \nreleased\n\n[[Page S1893]]\n\na report showing how equal pay affects women's financial security. The \nreport showed that lower wages impact women all throughout their \nworking lives, and these lower lifetime earnings translate to less \nsecurity in retirement.\n  According to the JEC report, the average annual income for women age \n65 and older, including pensions, private savings, and Social Security, \nis $11,000 less than it is for men. Social Security retirement benefits \nare based on a person's lifetime earnings. The average monthly benefit \nfor female retirees is 77 percent less. The same thing goes for \npensions. A woman's pension income is 53 percent that of men. Women \nalso receive smaller pension checks from Federal, State, and local \ngovernment pension plans.\n  Finally, a recent study showed that the average woman was able to \nsave less than half of what the average man was able to save in an IRA. \nSo what we have here is, first of all, women are making less to begin \nwith. That is what we are talking about today. That means they save \nless and have less money in Social Security. Secondly, they live \nlonger. That is great, but it means they are going to have less money. \nThen, finally, we have the fact that they are often a single \nbreadwinner in 40 percent of households. The fact that they take time \noff often to have children--that is the third factor that leads to less \nsavings.\n  What we should be doing is looking at how we can address the savings \ngap. There are ways we can address it by making it easier to save and \nmaking it easier to set up 401(k)s and IRAs and looking at the \nmillennials and how we can respond to what is an increasingly different \neconomy for young people. But we also can simply make sure women make \nthe same amount as men when they do the same job.\n\n  It was the late Paul Wellstone of my State who famously said: ``We \nall do better when we all do better.'' I still believe that is true \ntoday and so do my colleagues who join me. We need to be focused on how \nwe can help more women share in our economic growth and share in the \nAmerican dream. I ask my colleagues to support and pass the Paycheck \nFairness Act.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor with my colleague \nfrom Minnesota and my colleague Senator Murray from Washington, along \nwith our other colleagues who have already been here to speak about the \nimportant issue of paycheck fairness.\n  It is truly shameful this kind of discrimination still exists. We \nhave heard the statistics about what the pay gap means, but literally \nover someone's career--over a 40-year career--a woman in my state could \nlose as much as $500,000 in income. An Asian American woman could lose \n$700,000 over a 40-year career and a Native American woman could lose \nas much as $900,000 over the same time period. So, yes, when women are \ndiscriminated against, it costs them and their families.\n  The gender pay gap issue is a family issue. Women are breadwinners \ntoo. Women today still earn only 79 cents for every $1 paid to a man. \nThis means less food on the table, less money to buy clothing for their \nchildren, or less money for insurance premiums. What we need to do is \nmake sure we are listening to these stories and taking action.\n  Here is a story from one of my constituents, Adrianna from Olympia. \nShe said:\n\n       In 1993, when I was in college, I was working at a \n     restaurant. . . . This job enabled me to pay my way through \n     school with no student loans. A young man several years \n     younger than me with less experience was making a larger wage \n     and I found out about it. I politely confronted the owner as \n     to why this fellow was making more money than me. The owner \n     was caught off guard and could give me no reason whatsoever. \n     . . . The thing that really stuck in my craw was that the \n     young man told me he only worked there so he could get money \n     to gamble. . . . Of course, I had no other choice and worked \n     7 days a week for 5 years to get a Bachelor's degree.\n\n  Unfortunately, this story isn't unique. Wage discrimination affects a \nwide range of professional fields, including realtors, educators, \nadministrators, and even CEOs. For example, male surgeons earn 37 \npercent more per week than their female counterparts. In real terms, \nthat female surgeon earns $756 less per week than her male colleagues, \nand this adds up. And this does not apply only to high-paying, male-\ndominated careers: Women are 94.6 percent of all secretaries and \nadministrative assistants. Yet they still earn only 84 percent of what \ntheir male counterparts earn per week.\n  My colleague Senator Murray brought up the U.S. Women's National \nSoccer Team that helped bring this issue to the forefront. Despite \nbeing more successful and attracting more viewers than the men's team, \nthe U.S. women's soccer team still is paid 25 percent less than the \nmen's team.\n  In fact, one of my constituents last week--an 11-year-old girl soccer \nplayer from Washington--asked: If I keep playing sports, am I going to \nget fair pay?\n  Young women are asking us to do our job and make sure we pass \nlegislation that helps. That is why we commend Senator Mikulski for \nintroducing the Paycheck Fairness Act and for her tireless efforts on \nthis legislation. I am proud to be one of its cosponsors.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act requires that pay be job related and not \ndiscriminate based on gender. It would strengthen the penalties for \ndiscrimination and give women the tools they need to identify and \nconfront unfair treatment. It would make sure we recognize women are \nbreadwinners, too, and that they get the equal pay they deserve.\n  That is why my colleagues are coming to the floor today to say we \nshould pass this bill this year. We don't need to commemorate another \nday of what women have done for our country; women need to receive \nequal pay for the equal work they are doing. I thank my colleagues for \nhelping to bring attention to this issue, and I encourage the passage \nof this legislation.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/12/senate-section/article/S1893-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         National Equal Pay Day\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, after another whole year, a very \nunfortunate milestone has once again arrived. Today is Equal Pay Day. \nThis is\n\n[[Page S1894]]\n\nthe day in 2016 when the average working woman, after all last year and \nthe first 3 months of this year, finally earns as much money as the \naverage man did only during last year. So if we started the clock in \n2015, the average woman had to work an extra 103 days to earn the same \namount of money as a man.\n  Imagine two people were both hired at a company. They both work hard. \nThey have the same amount of experience and the same qualifications, \nbut they have one very important difference: One of those workers is a \nman, and the other is a woman. As a result, they will not be paid the \nsame.\n  Right now, on average, for every dollar a man makes, a woman makes \nonly 79 cents. That is the average for all women. Many other groups of \nwomen have it even worse. Working mothers earn only 75 cents for every \ndollar working fathers make. African-American women earn just 60 cents \nfor every dollar a white male makes. And our Latina women have it the \nworst. They earn just 55 cents for every dollar a white male makes. The \nUnited States of America still doesn't pay its men and women equally \nfor the same exact work, and it is unacceptable that in the year 2016 \nwe are still fighting to fix this basic problem.\n  Think about how this pay gap affects our families. More women than \never are earning their family's paycheck. Four out of every ten mothers \nare either the primary breadwinner of the family or the only \nbreadwinner in their family. Because of this pay gap, their children \nare getting shortchanged.\n  We need equal pay for equal work. It shouldn't matter if you are a \nnurse or a lawyer or even one of the best female athletes in the world. \nJust a couple weeks ago, the women's national soccer team filed a \nFederal lawsuit against the U.S. Soccer Federation over wage \ndiscrimination. I strongly support these women, and they are doing the \nright thing. They are raising their voices about a serious injustice, \nand I urge all of my colleagues in this Chamber to listen to these \nwomen--listen to the women in their States, and listen to the women in \nthis country that deserve equal pay for equal work. The women on our \nnational soccer team are some of the most successful American athletes \nalive, and even they have to deal with this pay gap.\n  It is shameful and inexcusable that women are still paid less than \nmen for the exact same work in this country. I urge everyone here to \nsupport the Paycheck Fairness Act. Let's get with the times. Let's \nfinally make it illegal to pay our women less than our men for the very \nsame work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today to address the Senate's \nongoing effort to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration. The \nbill before us today was described in the Washington Post as ``one of \nthe most passenger-friendly FAA reauthorization bills in a generation'' \nthanks to its robust new consumer protections. But even more \nimportantly, this bill includes strong new security measures that \naddress the threat ISIS and other terrorist groups pose to airline \npassengers.\n  In the wake of the Brussels attacks, travelers are understandably \nnervous about the threats they face when flying, especially given \nterrorists' preference for targeting transportation. Here in the \nSenate, we are doing everything we can to address that threat. I am \nproud that this bill includes new protections to prevent an attack like \nthe one in Brussels from happening at a U.S. airport.\n  The FAA Reauthorization Act includes the most comprehensive set of \naviation security reforms since President Obama first took office. To \nprevent airport insiders from helping terrorists, we have included \nmeasures to improve scrutiny of individuals applying to work in secure \nairport areas. This is especially critical as many experts believe the \nbombing of a Russian passenger jet leaving Egypt had help from an \naviation insider.\n  We have also included provisions to better safeguard public areas \noutside security in airports and to help reduce passenger backups. \nThese reforms could help prevent a future attack like the one in the \nBrussels terminal last month, which targeted a crowd of passengers in \nan area where the attackers didn't even need tickets.\n  Because staying ahead of threats needs to be a priority, we also \nincluded additional cyber security provisions and added anti-terrorism \nsecurity features for new aircraft.\n  The security reforms in this legislation were actually developed \nmonths ago as followups to congressional oversight, independent \nevaluations of agencies, and the study of existing problems. But these \nreforms have gained new urgency in the wake of recent attacks by ISIS. \nWe need to constantly monitor and stay ahead of threats so that we can \ncontinue to ensure that our air transportation system is the safest in \nthe world.\n  More than any other reason, I support the Federal Aviation \nAdministration Reauthorization Act of 2016 because it will make the \ntraveling public safer. For all of the many ways it improves our air \ntransportation system, the provisions to keep Americans safe stand out \nas especially deserving of our support and as heightening the need to \nsend this legislation on to the House.\n  I yield back.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         National Equal Pay Day\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today is Equal Pay Day. I am proud of the \nfact that one of our Members on this side of the aisle, Senator Deb \nFischer, is taking the lead and pointing out that this is not a \npartisan issue. I know people find that hard to believe here in \nWashington, where everything seems like a partisan issue, but the fact \nis, both Republicans and Democrats and the unaffiliated believe that \npeople who perform the same work ought to be compensated in the same \nway. So I am proud of the work Senator Fischer is doing.\n  I just wanted to make note of the fact that this is Equal Pay Day. I \nknow some of our colleagues across the aisle maybe have a different \nview and think they have a better way to deal with this, but it is \npurely a difference in tactics, not in terms of goals, which is equal \npay for equal work.\n\n\n                  National Crime Victims' Rights Week\n\n  Mr. President, yesterday I spoke about the fact that this is also \nCrime Victims' Week, and that is what I want to talk about now a little \nbit more.\n  There are a lot of people who come to Washington--big companies, \npeople can hire lobbyists, lawyers, accountants, other experts--to try \nto make their case to Congress, but we don't have a crime victims' \nlobby per se. We have organizations--volunteer organizations, by and \nlarge--that try and provide a voice to the voiceless and people who \nneed to be represented here, but the fact is, by listening to those \nvictims of crime and to those who volunteer to help them here in the \nNation's Capital, we can make a big difference in the lives of crime \nvictims in this country.\n  I highlighted the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act as an \nexample of what we can accomplish when we get past the partisan talking \npoints and instead focus on a common goal. I pointed out that \nlegislation, which is the most--I think the major--the most significant \nhuman trafficking legislation passed in the last 25 years, actually \nbroke important ground. It uses the penalties and the fines paid by \npeople on the purchasing side of the sex slave trade to be able to fund \nthe resources to help heal the victims, typically a girl the age of 12 \nto 14, somebody who has maybe run away from home, who thinks maybe they \nhave fallen in love with somebody new, only to find themselves trapped \nin modern-day human slavery. We were able to pass that legislation by a \nvote of 99 to 0 in the Senate, and now it is the law of the land.\n  I mentioned yesterday that some of the provisions, including the hero \nprogram, which was designed to provide\n\n[[Page S1895]]\n\nincentives for returning veterans of the gulf war, Iraq, and \nAfghanistan--some of them bearing the wounds of those wars--to be able \nto use the skills they have acquired in the military to help go after \nchild predators and other people who would take advantage of the most \nvulnerable in our society. But I wish to talk about another opportunity \nwhere I believe Congress can come together to rally behind victims and \nmove legislation that could help save lives.\n  On the first day of December 2013, Kari Hunt Dunn brought her three \nyoung children to a hotel in Marshall, TX, a city east of Dallas near \nthe border with Louisiana, to visit with her estranged husband. Sadly, \nthis visit turned into tragedy. According to reports, Kari's estranged \nhusband started to attack her and while he did, one of Kari's daughters \ndid what her parents and family taught her to do in an emergency, which \nis to dial 911. She called for help repeatedly, but she didn't realize \nthat, as in many hotels, first you need to dial 9 before you can dial \nout. So she kept dialing 911 to no avail, not recognizing that she \nneeded to dial 9 to get an outside line. By the time help finally \narrived, Kari was unresponsive and later died, leaving her three young \nchildren behind.\n  Obviously this is a terrible, heart-wrenching story, and I wish I \ncould say it was an isolated event, but it is made that much more \ntragic because the family will never know what the outcome might have \nbeen had that first 911 call actually made its way to the proper \nauthorities.\n  Following her death, Kari's father Hank decided he had to do \nsomething to correct the problem so tragedies like this could hopefully \nbecome a thing of the past. This is where we have a role to play. I \nknow some people might say: Well, there are a lot more important things \nfor Congress to be doing than dealing with this issue, but this is \nsomething we can do. It is not partisan, and we should do it on an \nexpedited basis.\n  So earlier this year, I joined with several of my colleagues, \nincluding the senior Senators from Nebraska and Minnesota, to introduce \nlegislation called Kari's Law, a bipartisan bill that already has a \ncompanion in the House. This legislation builds on a law passed last \nyear by the Texas legislature, and several other States have followed \nsuit as well.\n  Before us we have a clearer, albeit a discrete, problem, and we have \nan obvious solution. This bill would ensure that people have the \nability to directly call 911, even in hotels and office buildings, \nwithout having to dial an extra number. By making this simple change, \nwe can ensure that children, like Kari's daughter, can make the call \nfor help, to call for the assistance of law enforcement and emergency \npersonnel to save valuable time that can make the difference between \nlife and death and the prevention of another tragedy.\n  We should follow the example of States like Texas that have already \ndone this. We could do this on a national basis. We know there are \nlives at stake, like Kari's, and I believe we have an obligation to act \nto keep tragedies like Kari's from happening again.\n  So as we continue to look for ways to better support victims of crime \nthis week, I hope we will take another small step to help victims by \nadvancing this legislation. In so many instances, they are what seem \nlike small steps that can have tremendous ramifications.\n  I mentioned yesterday the reforms we have been able to do in terms of \ntesting the rape kit backlog. It had been reported that as many as \n400,000 untested rape kits are sitting in evidence lockers in police \nstations or perhaps in labs untested, and I talked a little bit about \nthe fact that in Houston alone, thanks to the leadership of the then \nmayor and the city council, working with State and Federal authorities, \nthey were able to eliminate the rape kit backlog testing and come up \nwith 850 hits on the database that showed there were individuals whose \nDNA was tested and located on this forensic evidence that was already \nin this FBI background database known as CODIS. There are things we can \ndo that may seem small but can have a dramatic impact on the lives of \nour constituents.\n  So I suggest that we don't give up and we continue to do what we can, \nwhere we can, when we can, and passing Kari's Law would be another \nimportant step in that direction.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Tribute to Beverly Cleary\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today Beverly Cleary, a storied and award-\nwinning author, is going to be celebrating her 100th birthday. \nThroughout her 66-year career, Beverly Cleary has written more than 40 \nchildren's books, selling over 90 million copies by enchanting readers \nof all ages with the escapades of Ramona, Henry, Ralph S. Mouse, and so \nmany wonderful characters. With enduring and relatable themes of \nadventure, adolescence, and friendship, Ms. Cleary's novels have \nwithstood the test of time and have established their place in the \npages of Oregon's cultural heritage.\n  Beverly Cleary was born on April 12, 1916, in McMinnville, OR. At an \nearly age, she moved to Portland, where she developed a passion for \nOregon that shines throughout the pages of her stories. For years, \nBeverly Cleary's characters have called Portland home, and for the \ncountless children who grew up with her writing, Ms. Cleary's stories \nhave been their haven. Her book series ``Ramona'' and ``Henry Huggins'' \nare both set in Portland and continue to serve as important threads \nthroughout Oregon's literary fabric.\n  Ms. Cleary's impact on the State of Oregon and the city of Portland \nhave not gone unnoticed. Her honors include a public K-8 school in \nPortland, the Beverly Cleary School, which some of my staff actually \nattended, and a public art installation at the Hollywood branch of the \nMultnomah County Library which features many of her books' neighborhood \nlandmarks. Portland's Grant Park is home to a public sculpture garden \nwith bronze statues of Ramona Quimby, Henry Huggins, and Ribsy.\n  It is Beverly Cleary's unbound passion and dedication to children's \nliterature that have earned her numerous literary awards, including a \nNational Book Award, a Newberry Medal, and a National Medal of Art. In \n2000 the Library of Congress even named her a ``Living Legend.''\n  Just as original Beverly Cleary fans enjoyed reading about the lives \nand adventures of her characters, each new generation of young Beverly \nCleary readers finds a similar connection with those same characters. \nMs. Cleary's books have sparked the imagination of so many children \nacross America, helping instill literary skills that last a lifetime.\n  When it comes to literacy, the importance of reading at an early age \nsimply cannot be overstated. An early introduction to reading is one of \nthe most significant factors influencing a child's success in school. \nIt is linked to better speech and communication skills, improved \nlogical thinking, and increased academic excellence. It is clear that \nyoung children who develop a love for reading have an upper hand both \nin the classroom and later in life.\n  Thanks to Ms. Cleary, generations of kids across the world can \nexperience Oregon from a literary perspective. One would be hard-\npressed to find another author who has made such a lasting impact on \nchildren's literature. So it is an enormous honor and a great personal \npleasure for me to come to the Senate floor this afternoon to honor \nBeverly Cleary's contribution to literary history, to Oregon, and to \nchildren everywhere, and to wish her a very happy 100th birthday.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S1896]]\n\n  \n\n\n\n                          Gold King Mine Spill\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, last August several Western States and \nIndian tribes suffered an enormous environmental disaster. It was \ncalled the Gold King Mine spill. In this disaster, the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency caused a spill of 3 million gallons of \ntoxic waste water into a tributary of the Animas River in Colorado.\n  This photograph shows the before and after. People all across the \ncountry remember this picture and the poisoning of this river by the \nEPA. This plume of toxic waste threatened people in Colorado, New \nMexico, and Utah. It stretched to the land of the Navajo Nation and the \nSouthern Ute Indian Tribe.\n  When the Indian Affairs Committee held a hearing on the Gold King \nMine spill last September, we heard testimony from Russell Begaye. He \nis the President of the Navajo Nation, which has lands roughly the size \nof the State of West Virginia, a very large piece of land. President \nBegaye told our committee that for the Navajo people, water is sacred, \nand the river is life for all of us.\n  He said: Today, we are afraid to use the river--with an emphasis on \nthe word ``afraid.'' The EPA caused that spill more than 8 months ago \nbecause it made crucial mistakes, critical mistakes. It failed to take \nbasic precautions.\n  Well, we still have not gotten answers to some very important \nquestions. Now that the snow in the Rocky Mountains is beginning to \nmelt, people in this very area, in the course of this river, are \nworried that they are being victimized once again by the failures of \nthe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. They want to know if melting \nsnow is going to stir up the lead and the mercury and the other poisons \nthat have settled to the bottom after this poisonous spill.\n  They want to know if this blue river is going to turn bright yellow \nagain. Well, next week I am chairing a hearing in Phoenix, AZ, and it \nis a field hearing of the Indian Affairs Committee. We are going to be \nlooking at the Environmental Protection Agency's unacceptable response \nto Indian tribes. This includes inadequate handling of the Gold King \nMine disaster. It includes the Agency dragging its feet on cleaning up \nthe cold-water uranium mines across the Navajo and the Hopi \nreservations.\n  The members of these tribes deserve to hear directly from the EPA. \nThey want answers about what is being done to fix this blunder. From \nwhat I have seen lately, I expect the Environmental Protection Agency \nwill be doing its best to avoid giving any answer at all. When we, the \nIndian Affairs Committee, first invited the Agency to send a \nrepresentative to this hearing to update us, they refused. It is \nastonishing; they refused. They said they would send written testimony \ninstead.\n  I don't think the EPA understands how this works. We are holding this \nfield hearing to do oversight on this catastrophe that the EPA caused. \nThis is not optional for them. This is not supposed to be just another \nchance for the EPA to show how uncooperative and unhelpful they can be. \nSo tomorrow the Indian Affairs Committee plans to issue a formal \nsubpoena for the EPA Administrator, Gina McCarthy, to appear at the \nfield hearing.\n  Ms. McCarthy testified last year. When she testified before our \ncommittee in Washington last September, she said that the Agency was \ntaking--her words--``full responsibility'' for the spill. Today, the \nAgency will not even come and look these people in the eye. Does that \nsound as though it is taking ``full responsibility''?\n  When this disaster first happened, the EPA did not notify the Navajo \nNation until a full day after the spill. After 4 days, the EPA still \nhad not reported to the Navajo leaders that there was arsenic in the \nwater. This disaster happened more than 8 months ago. No one--no one at \nthe Agency has been fired. No one has even been reprimanded for their \nfailure.\n  What has the EPA done? Well, here is a headline from the Wall Street \nJournal on Friday, April 8: ``Toxic-Spill Fears Haunt Southwest.'' In \nthe southwestern part of the country, according to this article, it has \nbeen months since the Agency has been back to test the safety of the \nwell water for the families near the river. Officials in New Mexico and \nin Utah say the EPA has failed to spearhead a comprehensive plan to \nmanage the spring runoff or even to conduct long-term monitoring.\n  The States and the tribes are having to monitor the water quality \nthemselves. Why, you ask? Well, it is because the EPA was not planning \nto test enough sites or provide real-time data. That is what people \nneed. What good is the data if it is not telling people that the water \nthey are drinking right now is safe? Why tell people that the water \nthey drank a week ago or a month ago was contaminated? They need to \nknow about the water today.\n  There are 200,000 people who drink from the river system that the EPA \npoisoned last summer. Why has the Environmental Protection Agency \nwalked away from these families? Why is this Agency not taking full \nresponsibility for making sure this mess has been cleaned up? I am not \nalone in asking that. This article about the ``Toxic-Spill Fears Haunt \nSouthwest'' in the Wall Street Journal on Friday goes further.\n  They actually quote the State environment secretary from New Mexico, \nwho lives there, lives on the land, and knows the situation. This is \nthe State environment secretary. He says: The fundamental problem is, \nthere is no engagement from the EPA. None.\n  This is a specific, definite, concrete, environmental disaster. It \nwas caused by specific people at the Environmental Protection Agency. \nThis is about a government agency failing to do its job. They took \ntheir eye off the ball. They caused this toxic spill. They still have \nnot focused on cleaning up the mess that they caused.\n  Like so much in Washington, DC, the EPA has grown too big, too \narrogant, too irresponsible, and too unaccountable. People in America \ndeserve accountability. We all want a clean environment. That is not in \ndispute. We all know the original mission of the Environmental \nProtection Agency was a noble one. Somewhere along the line, this \nAgency lost its way. It got preoccupied with other things, and it lost \nsight of its real job, which is to protect the environment.\n  Instead, we get this. When President Begaye of the Navajo Nation \ntestified before the Indian Affairs Committee last fall, he was very \nclear. This is what he said: The Navajo Nation does not trust the U.S. \nEPA, and we expect it to be held fully accountable. Let me repeat. The \nNavajo Nation does not trust the U.S. EPA. We expect it to be held \nfully accountable.\n  I think the Navajo Nation and other tribes in the West are right to \nnot trust the EPA. They are right to expect it to be held fully \naccountable. That is exactly what we intend to do with this field \nhearing next week. Indian Country and all of America need to know if \nthe EPA can do its job. From what they see here, they have serious, \nserious doubts. These people do not need a written statement. They need \nto hear straight from the people in charge and that means from Gina \nMcCarthy, who is the head of the EPA.\n  Next Friday, April 22, is Earth Day. According to press reports, \nAdministrator McCarthy is planning to go to New York that day for a big \nmedia event around the Paris climate change treaty. That is what she is \nplanning for next Friday, the day of this important hearing--a day when \nthe EPA just wants to send written testimony.\n  It is her preference to be in New York talking about what happened in \nParis instead of going to Arizona to face the people her Agency has \nabandoned. That is what she thinks is more important. That is the way \nthis administration prioritizes its activity--a photo op in New York, \nnot meeting with the people whose lives her Agency has devastated. The \ndirector of the EPA still does not have her priorities straight. It \nshould not have to come down to a subpoena. The Environmental \nProtection Agency should have done the right thing from the very \nbeginning.\n  It is up to the EPA to do the right thing now. On Earth Day, of all \ndays, we need to hear from the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S1897]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Domestic Steel Industry Crisis\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the severity \nof the crisis facing our domestic steel industry. Workers are losing \ntheir jobs, families are losing their homes, and communities are \nsuffering.\n  For several years our domestic industry has been under constant \nattack. Our steel industry is in the midst of a crisis more severe than \nthe one experienced nearly two decades ago. Global demand for steel has \nnot kept pace with global production. As a result, many of the global \nproducers have come here to the United States to try to dump their \nsteel. As a result of that, domestic producers continue to lose ground, \nsurrendering a record-high 29 percent market share to foreign-made \nsteel last year. The industry currently has about a 65-percent capacity \nutilization rate, and in Indiana we saw an 8-percent downturn in \nproduction last year.\n  As a Senator from Indiana--a State that accounts for one-quarter of \nall domestic steel capacity--I visit with steelworkers and their \nfamilies to listen to their concerns about the impact of illegally \ntraded steel flooding our market. Hoosier families are worried. Steel \nplants are idling, and more than 1,000 Hoosier workers have been laid \noff as a direct result of the illegally dumped steel that flooded our \nmarket last year. These are workers who come up to me at church on \nSundays or stop by my office. They look me in the eye and ask me to \nexplain how other nations get to produce and sell steel under a \ndifferent set of rules. These workers have never asked me or anyone \nelse for a handout; they simply ask that all parties compete on a level \nplaying field because these Hoosier steelworkers know how valued their \nsteel products are here and abroad.\n  Congress and the Obama administration must work together to not only \nprevent further job losses but to allow the steel industry to grow. \nWhen families face the uncertainty of a plant idling, they must prepare \nfor the worst. All the while, small businesses that reside in \ncommunities relying on the steel industry's success suffer because \nfamilies are no longer able to purchase goods and services, such as \ngroceries and clothes and things for their home, because they are just \ntrying to survive.\n  The current situation only reinforces my long-held belief that strong \ntrade policies strengthen communities and ensure good employment for \nour workers, and they maintain a level playing field to foster the kind \nof fair competition that leads to robust markets. However, as we know \nall too well, such policies only work when everyone plays by the same \nrules.\n  I appreciate the work of my colleagues here in the Senate and across \nthe Capitol in the House who have come together and worked in a \nbipartisan fashion to provide the administration with the significant \ntools they need to combat this historic influx of foreign-made steel.\n  As my colleagues may recall, Congress recently passed the Leveling \nthe Playing Field Act and also the ENFORCE Act to help our steel \nindustry investigate and better fight unfair trade practices. While \nthere is more to be done, the administration should use these important \ntools we have provided to vigorously defend our domestic industry from \nthose who willingly do not play by the rules. Strict enforcement of the \nlaw is necessary to protect our domestic industry now and to deter bad \nactors from abusing the system in the future.\n  Good, strong communities and good, strong cities like Portage and \nGary and Crawfordsville and Rockport are relying on the Senate to do \nthe right thing. We must double down on our efforts to combat the \nillegally traded steel coming into our market. We must do so together \nnot only for the businesses and workers impacted by the onslaught of \nillegally traded steel but for the communities of children and families \nwho have been linked for generations to the success of our Nation's \nsteel industry. They are counting on us, and we cannot let them down.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Taxes and the National Debt\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, it is springtime in Missouri. Whether it is \nin our State that joins the Presiding Officer's State of Oklahoma or in \nIowa, we are seeing trees begin to bloom. It was great to be home the 2 \nweeks we were home and again last weekend and see the flowering trees \nsort of move from north to south and, I guess, south to north. It is \none of my favorite times of the year, as it is for a lot of people. \nParticularly during the 2 weeks we were home, we would not see the \nblooms of the Dogwoods, and then a couple of days later we would see \nthem farther north in the State than we had seen them before.\n  People like the spring. They like the great weather, they like to get \nout and do things with their family--only to be reminded sometimes just \nhow fickle the spring weather is. One thing a lot of people--including \nmost of us--dread at this time of year, however, is that spring comes \nat about the same time that they have to file their taxes. That date \ncomes this week, and if the weather is not predictable, the increasing \nreach of the Tax Code should be predictable and is predictable.\n  Ronald Reagan said that Republicans believe every day is the Fourth \nof July, and our friends on the other side believe every day is April \nthe 15th. We are having the income come in now and seeing what happens \nwith it. It is the time of year we ought to look at what is happening \nwith the hard-earned dollars American families work for.\n  It is estimated that Americans will pay about $3.3 trillion in \nFederal taxes and about half that in State and local taxes. A total of \nalmost $5 trillion--or 31 percent of all the national income in the \ncountry--goes to taxes. If, at various levels of government as a \ncountry, we are taking 31 percent of the money every family earns, we \nought to be thinking about what happens with that and justify every \npenny of it. Another way of looking at it is that Missourians, and \npeople across the country, will spend more on taxes this year than they \nspend on food, clothing, and housing combined.\n  A lot of people might ask where the taxes are coming from. After all, \nin 2001 and 2003 Congress cut taxes. But that doesn't seem to be the \ncase when we pay the tax bill. While we did cut taxes as a country in \n2001 and 2003, in 2009 we put a lot of taxes in place. One prime \nexample of what happened in 2009 is the $1 trillion tax hike in the \nPresident's health care bill. Now, $1 trillion over 10 years is a lot \nof money. It is $100 billion a year that the government hadn't been \ncollecting in taxes but now is.\n  A few years ago the Ways and Means Committee asked the Congressional \nBudget Office, along with the Joint Committee on Taxation, to look at \nwhat the ObamaCare taxes really meant, and they revised that estimate \nup. They listed 21 tax increases, including 12 tax increases on the \nmiddle class, and those 21 tax increases amounted to a $1 trillion tax \nhike. A few of those taxes have been delayed for a little bit. We were \nable to slow down the silly tax on medical devices. Whom they thought \nthat would help when people who voted for that bill and that tax, I \ndon't know, but an extra tax on medical devices seems unreasonable to \nme. I don't know a single person who ever bought a medical device \nbecause they thought they were going to have a good time with it. They \nbought a medical device because they thought it was necessary for their \nhealth.\n  Then, not only do we collect this money, not only do we collect 31 \npercent of all the money people work for in taxes, we see the national \ndebt continuing to increase. The national debt held by the public \nstands at about $13.5 trillion, but the national debt is really closer \nto $19 trillion because we owe a lot of money as a country and people \nto the places it has been borrowed from--the Social Security trust \nfund--and all $19 trillion has to be paid back.\n  It is hard for most of us to even begin to think how much money that \nis, $19 trillion, but the gross domestic product--the total value of \nall the goods and services produced in the country--is less than that. \nGDP is estimated to be about $17.9 trillion.\n\n[[Page S1898]]\n\n  Another way to look at the national debt is that we have managed to \naccumulate a national debt that is more than equal to everything the \ncountry produces in a given year. Everything Americans work to make, \neverything we produce--the value of not just the products we make but \nthe goods and services we make--is now exceeded by the national debt. \nThere is no credible economic measure that would indicate that a \ncountry is stronger if the debt is bigger than the value of what it \nproduced as a country.\n  We have the debt, and then we have the deficit spending. Deficits \noccur when the government spends more money than it generates in \nrevenue.\n  Balancing the budget two decades ago wasn't all that easy to do. It \nrequired hard choices. But we as a country were able to reach a \nbipartisan consensus that surpluses are preferable to deficits and that \na country is far better off as a result; that a growing economy is \nbetter than a stagnant economy; and that the economy is more likely to \ngrow if the government isn't constantly sapping, for no defensible \nreason, the economic opportunity of people spending their own money to \nadvance themselves and their families forward.\n  One thing that every model shows is that it is easier to pay off the \ndebt and it is easier to pay the bills of the country if you have an \neconomy that is growing. But regulators who are out of control, and \ndeficit spending hurts economic growth.\n  If we look at the first year of the Obama administration, adjusted \nfor inflation to today's dollars, that deficit ran about $1.6 trillion. \nFollowing that, during the first term it was $1.6 trillion, then $1.4 \ntrillion, then $1.3 trillion, and then $1.1 trillion. That sounds as if \nthe deficit is going down, but it is $1.1 trillion over a budget that \njust 20 years ago was balanced. It is $1.1 trillion over a budget that \na little more than a decade earlier had been a balanced budget.\n  If we accept this year's number, the average deficit over the last 8 \nyears is $963 billion--right at $1 trillion--and we are borrowing that \nmoney and the $19 trillion that came before it at almost the lowest \ninterest rate imaginable. What happens if the borrowing rate goes from \nwhere it is to, say, 5 percent? We already see that the interest on the \ndebt is quickly becoming the third biggest government payment--Social \nSecurity, Medicare, paying the debt. Things like defending the country, \na transportation system that works, health care research--all of those \nthings are way below just the interest we would have on the debt, and \nthat is at the lowest rate ever.\n  Federal borrowing is really nothing more than a tax on the future. \nFederal borrowing is nothing more than saying: We want to have what we \nwant to have right now, and we are willing for somebody else to pay the \nbill for what we want to have right now.\n  As people sit down and file their taxes over the next 48 hours or so \nand make final calculations and look at what they made and look at what \nthey are paying--as they have done over the last few weeks and will do \nover the next couple of days--it is an important time for them to talk \nto the people they elect to public office: What do you think you are \ngaining by not making the tough choices? What do you think you are \ngaining by not doing the things we have already agreed we need the \ngovernment to do and doing those really well rather than coming up with \nyet another program that may or may not produce results?\n  The health care plan is one of those. I had a hospital group in this \nmorning. They had done a calculation of what part of the bill people \nwere paying with their personal money as opposed to insurance that they \nhad to try to protect themselves against health care costs before the \nAffordable Care Act and what they are paying now. What they found is \nthat before the Affordable Care Act, they were paying 10 percent of the \nbill with personal money. After the Affordable Care Act, the average \nperson with insurance was paying 20 percent of the bill. So the \nhighest, fastest growing level of debt that hospital had was people \nwith insurance who weren't able to pay the bill because their \ndeductible was so high.\n  So we managed to raise $1 trillion in taxes, insure almost no one in \nterms of total numbers--we still have about 30 million people who are \nuninsured--and in many cases, the people who are insured don't have the \ncoverage they had before.\n  People need to be asking what we are doing to mortgage the future and \nwhat are we getting out of that. Just as Missourians have a \nresponsibility to ensure that their taxes are paid by April 15, we have \na responsibility to ensure that their tax dollars are wisely used or \nnot taken from them at all.\n  I think the fiscal policy of the Obama administration over the last 8 \nyears has been an irresponsible way to spend people's money. The cost-\nbenefit analysis we asked for comes back with silly things, like we \nevaluate how much people worry about something or we evaluate how much \npeople's feelings are hurt. What we ought to evaluate is what we get \nout of these excessive rules and regulations and regulators and \ninspectors that truly is a benefit as opposed to what do we get that is \njust one more additional burden that people are asked to pay for and, \neven worse than that, that then their children and grandchildren are \nasked to pay for by seeing this accumulated debt.\n  We hear from our friends on the other side that it was necessary to \nengage in excessive spending to keep the economy afloat following the \nrecession--the only way to do that is for the Government to play a \nbigger role in the economy. And what do we have to show for that? The \neconomy is still struggling, the recovery has been unbelievably \nsluggish at best, and wages are stagnant for middle-class families. \nWhy? One of the reasons is high taxes, combined with the onslaught of \nredtape, and regulators that are out of control. The policies coming \nout of this administration have really made any possible stimulated \ngrowth in the economy hard to find.\n  The challenges of getting healthy economic growth and getting our \nfiscal house back in order will only become more daunting as the direct \nand indirect costs of things like the President's health care plan \naccumulate. I think we ought to all commit ourselves here, as people \nare coming to the end of this tax-paying season, to work together, to \nwork on both sides of the Capitol and at both ends of Pennsylvania \nAvenue to find solutions for an overtaxed middle class, for out-of-\ncontrol spending, unsustained long-term debt and interest payments. We \nneed a flatter, fairer, less complicated, and more competitive tax \nstructure.\n  If we are going to ask the American people to send in 31 cents out of \nevery dollar they make at all levels--some people send in a lot more \nand some people send in a little less, but 31 cents out of every dollar \nof income in the country goes to government--the government has a real \nobligation to see that every one of those 31 cents is spent for a good \npurpose or not taken from people at all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Veterans Choice Act\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, just a month ago, I was on the Senate floor \ntalking about the struggles of a number of Kansas veterans as they \nattempted to utilize the Veterans Choice Program that Congress passed \nnearly 2 years ago. That program is being implemented by the U.S. \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. We looked for many opportunities to try \nto provide better service, more efficient service, more timely service \nto our veterans, and Congress ultimately came together and passed the \nVeterans Choice Act.\n  As I indicated a month ago and numerous times on the Senate floor, \nthat legislation, that law says if you are a veteran who can't receive \nthe medical services you are entitled to, you have the opportunity to \nreceive those services at a medical facility, a clinic, a physician, or \na hospital at home. As an individual Senator who comes from a State as \nrural as most and more rural than many--and certainly as rural as the \nPresiding Officer's home State and the home State of the Senator from \nMissouri--we have a real interest in trying to make certain our \nveterans who live long distances from a VA hospital can access that \nmedical care.\n\n[[Page S1899]]\n\n  I thought we took great satisfaction in the passage of that \nlegislation. I certainly did. What we have discovered since then in its \nimplementation has been one handicap, one hurdle, one bureaucratic \ndifficulty, and one challenge after another. While maybe it is \ndifficult for the Department of Veterans Affairs to implement this \nlegislation, they are the ones who ought to suffer the challenges of \ndoing so, not the men and women who served our country.\n  During my conversation on the Senate floor a month ago, I talked \nabout a number of veterans in Kansas and called them by name. One of \nthose veterans was Michael Dabney, a Kansas veteran from Hill City, KS, \nin northwest Kansas, in the part of the State that I grew up in.\n  A piece of good news is that Mr. Dabney is eligible for the Veterans \nChoice Program because he lives more than 40 miles from a VA facility. \nSo Mr. Dabney qualifies under that Veterans Choice Program, and Mr. \nDabney needed surgery and elected to use the Veterans Choice Program. \nThere is a community-based outpatient clinic hosted by the VA in Hays, \nwhich is about an hour away from his hometown. He was receiving care \nand treatment there. The indication was he needed the surgery, and they \nsuggested that he travel to Wichita--another couple hundred miles--for \nthat surgery. But Mr. Dabney suffers from PTSD and indicated that he \ndidn't feel comfortable and capable of traveling that extra 200 miles \nto receive the surgery.\n  His primary care provider at the outpatient clinic in Hays indicated \nto him this: Well, you live more than 40 miles from a facility. You \nqualify for the Veterans Choice Act. You can have these services \nprovided and this surgery provided at home.\n  Mr. Dabney elected to do that. Rather than driving another 200 miles \nfor surgery in a city far away, he had the surgery performed at home. \nThat seems like the way this is supposed to work. But the end result \nwas that, according to the VA, he didn't receive preauthorization. So \ndespite his primary care provider telling him that he qualified for the \nVeterans Choice Act, after getting the service at home, he then started \nreceiving the bills for that service.\n  In frustration, he then contacted our office, and the folks in my \noffice went to work. Here was an example that I thought we could be \nsuccessful in solving. The record clearly indicates that his primary \ncare provider, his VA primary care provider indicated he should utilize \nthe Choice Act and have the services, the surgery provided at home. He \ndid so. The VA then declined to pay for those services, and he began \nreceiving the bills.\n  So we went to bat for Mr. Dabney. Despite our efforts and despite his \nefforts, he has been told that those bills are due to be paid by him \nbecause he didn't get preauthorization. My point today is that the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs ought to be the Federal agency that \nbends over backwards to help our veterans.\n  I remember when the current Secretary testified before our Veterans' \nAffairs Committee in his confirmation hearing, and he indicated that he \nwas going to run the Department in a way that was all focused on \nmeeting the needs of veterans. Yet, just a few weeks ago, Mr. Dabney \nwas told this by the VA. I don't know if they said they are sorry. They \nsimply said: You didn't get preauthorization. You don't qualify. Those \nbills are your responsibility.\n  I am here once again trying to highlight what happened. We went to \nthe intermediary TriWest. They thought they could help us accomplish \nthis and get the information that Mr. Dabney acted on and that this \nought to be sufficient for the VA to pay the bill. And even with their \nhelp, the results from the Department of Veterans Affairs, through \ntheir Wichita hospital, said that Mr. Dabney obviously didn't \nunderstand the rules, and, therefore, they were not going to see that \nhis bills were paid by the VA.\n  This seems outrageous to me. The VA, through its employees, indicated \nhe qualified. He relied upon that information, their assurance that he \nqualified, to have the surgery done at home. He is a veteran who needed \nsurgery. He suffers from PTSD. He would be deserving of all the care, \nthe treatment, and the consideration that could be given a man who \nserved our country so well and suffered the consequences. Yet, despite \nthe assurance that he should use the program, this decision was made: I \nam sorry, but you didn't dot the i's and cross the t's.\n  I ask my colleagues to help me as we work our way through the \nimplementation of the Veterans Choice Act. It is discouraging to me--\nthe number of veterans who tell me how disappointed they are with the \nVeterans Choice Act--when I thought it was such a great opportunity for \ntheir care and well-being. The end result is that many are discouraged, \ngiving up on the Veterans Choice Act and not receiving the care and \nattention they need from the VA, deciding that the VA should not be \ntheir provider. The point is that we are failing them once again. We \nare failing them veteran by veteran, one at a time.\n  The consequence is that the program is still not working. You cannot \nnot meet the needs of a veteran and then have an expectation that we \nhave done something useful and beneficial for that veteran.\n  There is a discussion going on in the Veterans' Affairs Committee, \nand there are bills led by Senators Isakson and Blumenthal that address \nmany of the issues plaguing the VA, ranging from their appeals system \nto accountability, to remedying the problems associated with the \nVeterans Choice Act. I urge my colleagues not to allow this opportunity \nto bypass, to go away. We must take these actions. In my view, this is \nan example of this problem that the VA should solve on its own. They \nshould find a way to make this work. In their absence to do so, as \nMembers of the Senate--certainly, I, as a member of the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs--we have the obligation to continue to do battle for \nthose who battled for our freedoms and liberties.\n  I apologized to Mr. Dabney that he has been treated the way he has \nbeen by the Department of Veterans Affairs, by his government, and I \nwill continue to fight on a case-by-case basis. But we do have a real \nopportunity as Republican and Democratic Senators to come together and \nagree upon a legislative solution to these and many other problems that \nplague us and plague our veterans.\n  I simply am here to make the case, hopefully to the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, that they should find a way to care for this man who \nserved his country and also to ask my colleagues to work together to \nmake certain--in whatever ways legislatively we need act to meet the \nneeds of those who served our country--that we do so.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the opportunity to address this \nissue and the cause of this veteran and many others.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   filling the supreme court vacancy\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, before I turn to my prepared remarks, \nI wish to note that the minority leader came to the floor this morning \nto complain, again, that the Senate is following the Biden rules on the \nSupreme Court vacancy.\n  As I have said before, there is not much that makes the minority \nleader more mad than when his side is forced to play by its own rules.\n  So, I won't dwell on his daily missives. Most us around here have \ngrown used to it and don't pay him much mind, especially given his \nrecord of leading a Senate where even some Members of his own party \nwere never allowed to offer a single amendment. He voted 25 times to \nfilibuster judicial nominees--including a Supreme Court Justice, and at \nthe time argued there is nothing in the Constitution requiring the \nSenate to vote on nominees.\n  And, of course, he will be remembered as the leader who did more \ndamage to the Senate than any other leader in history when he invoked \nthe so-called nuclear option in November of 2013.\n  ``I think just from reading the cases you'll acknowledge that there's \npolitics in legal rulings.'' That is what President Obama said last \nweek when he visited the University of Chicago.\n\n[[Page S1900]]\n\n  The President met with law students and answered their questions. \nThey asked him about judicial nominations, including his decision to \nmake a nomination to fill Justice Scalia's seat on the Supreme Court. \nHis responses were revealing. I agree with President Obama that too \noften politics seep into legal rulings. He is right as a factual \nmatter. In fact, I said the same thing on the Senate floor a few days \nbefore the President did.\n   Oddly, those on the left who were up in arms over my remarks were \nsilent on the President's. I suppose that is because, unlike the \nPresident, I think it is a bad thing that there is politics in judicial \ndecisionmaking these days. Politics in judicial rulings means that \nsomething other than law forms the basis of those decisions. It means \nthe judge is reading his or her own views into the Constitution.\n  Unlike the President, I believe the biggest threat to public \nconfidence in the Court is the Justices' willingness to permit their \nown personal politics to influence their decisions. This isn't the \nfirst time the President has talked about how he believes Justices \nshould decide cases. He has repeatedly said they should decide cases \nbased on something other than the Constitution and the law. His views \non this subject are clear.\n  When Chief Justice Roberts was confirmed, then-Senator Obama said \nthat in the really hard cases, ``the critical ingredient is supplied by \nwhat is in the judge's heart.'' In 2009, President Obama said he views \n``empathy'' as an essential ingredient for Justices to possess in order \nto reach just outcomes. And before he made his most recent Supreme \nCourt nomination, the President said that where ``the law is not \nclear,'' his nominee's decisions ``will be shaped by his or her own \nperspective, ethics, and judgment.'' But what is in a judge's \n``heart,'' or their personal ``perspective [and] ethics'' have no place \nin judicial decisionmaking.\n  The President's idea of what is appropriate for Justices to consider \nis totally at odds with our constitutional system. We are a government \nof laws and not a government of judges. I have said before that we \nshould have a serious public discussion about what the Constitution \nmeans and how our judges should interpret it. President Obama and I \nhave very different views on those questions. Politics belongs to us--\nit is between the people and their elected representatives. It is \nimportant that judges don't get involved in politics. That is because, \nunlike Senators, lifetime-appointed Federal judges aren't accountable \nto the people in elections. It is also because when nine unelected \nJustices make decisions based on their own policy preferences, rather \nthan constitutional text, they rob from the American people the ability \nto govern themselves. And when that happens, individual liberty pays \nthe price.\n  To preserve the representative nature of our government and our \nconstitutional system, our judges need to return to their limited role, \nand decide cases based on the text of the Constitution and laws that \nthe people's representatives have passed.\n  President Obama last week described the justices' power as an \n``enormous'' one. That is true in a sense. But the Constitution limits \nthe Justices' power to deciding controversies in specific cases that \ncome before them. President Reagan talked about this on the day that \nChief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Scalia were sworn in. He recounted \nhow the Founding Fathers debated the role of the judiciary during the \nsummer of 1787. As President Reagan said, the Founders ultimately \nsettled on ``a judiciary that would be independent and strong, but one \nwhose power would . . . be confined within the boundaries of a written \nConstitution and laws.''\n  For decades now, the Supreme Court has been issuing opinions \npurportedly based on the Constitution where the Constitution itself is \nsilent. This kind of judicial decisionmaking usurps the right of \nAmericans to govern themselves on some of the most important issues in \ntheir lives. That is what happens, for example, when the Court \n``discovers'' rights in the Constitution that aren't mentioned in its \ntext and weren't observed when the Constitution was adopted. The same \nthing happens with ordinary statutes that Congress passes. If the \nJustices limited themselves to saying what the Constitution or statute \nsays about the case before them, their power wouldn't be so \n``enormous.'' President Obama says it is not so simple. He says the \ncases that really matter are the ones where there is some ambiguity in \nthe law. In those cases, President Obama thinks a justice needs to \napply ``judgment grounded in how we actually live.''\n  Again, I disagree. When judges ask what a law should mean, the \nmeaning of a law will change, depending on the judge's ``life \nexperiences'' or what judge happens to hear the case. The people lose \ncontrol of what their laws say. It is not consistent with our system of \nself-government.\n  James Madison--the ``Father of the Constitution''--explained the same \nthing in a letter to Richard Henry Lee. He said that ``the sense,'' or \nmeaning, ``in which the Constitution was accepted and ratified by the \nnation'' defines the Constitution. He said that is the only way the \nConstitution is legitimate. That is because, in Madison's words, ``if \nthe meaning of the text be sought in the changeable meaning of the \nwords composing it,'' the ``shape and attributes'' of government would \nchange over time. And importantly, that change would occur without the \npeople's consent. It wouldn't be consistent with the way we govern \nourselves through our representatives.\n  That is a very different view than the President suggested in Chicago \nlast week when he said that ambiguous cases ask a judge to consider \n``how we actually live.'' In President Obama's view, the judge isn't \nasking what a law meant when it was passed, but what it should mean \ntoday. President Obama described this as his ``Progressive view of how \nthe courts should operate.'' With respect to the President, it is my \nview that the courts shouldn't operate in a political way at all. Not a \nprogressive one, not a moderate one, not a conservative one. Instead, \nin my view, the courts should operate in a constitutional way that \nensures government by the people.\n  Again, when Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Scalia were sworn in, \nPresident Reagan touched on this very subject. He said that for the \nFounding Fathers, the question about the courts was not whether they \nwould be liberal or conservative. The question, President Reagan said, \nwas ``will we have government by the people?'' Judges have a role in \nensuring that we have government by the people. They fulfill that role \nwhen they try to understand what a law meant--either a statute or the \nConstitution--when the people's representatives enacted it. If the \nJustices decided cases that way, there would be a lot less politics in \nlegal rulings. Unlike the President, I think that would be healthy for \nour democracy. But more important, it was the understanding of those \nwho wrote and adopted our Constitution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nTester and I be allowed to engage in a colloquy for the next \napproximately 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I rise to encourage support for the \nHoeven-Tester air ambulance relief amendment, which is legislation of \nimportance to people living in both rural and urban communities who \nneed urgent and timely medical care. The need for this amendment arises \nfrom the fact that Federal law preempts States from regulating air \nambulance services pursuant to the Airline Deregulation Act, which was \npassed in 1979.\n  While some air ambulance providers enter into agreements with \ninsurers, a growing number have decided to operate as out-of-network \nproviders and practice what is known as balance billing. That means \nconsumers, not the insurance companies, are responsible for the \nmajority of the medical bill.\n  In recent years, State insurance departments have been fielding \nconsumer complaints related to large balances left to them from charges \nnot covered by insurance providers for air ambulance services. Patients \nin need of lifesaving air medical services have been\n\n[[Page S1901]]\n\nleft with balances of more than $25,000 when an air medical provider \nopts out of agreements with insurance providers.\n  Let me share a couple of examples of what I am talking about with my \ncolleagues. In one case, a young couple had a premature child who was \nin need of intensive care at another hospital. The couple was insured \nand assumed that the 1-hour helicopter flight to the other hospital was \ncovered by their insurance. The air ambulance company presented them \nwith a bill for almost $40,000, but because the company had not entered \ninto an agreement with the couples' insurance company, they were \nreimbursed only about $15,000 of that bill, leaving them $24,000 that \nthey needed to pay when they thought they had insurance coverage for \nthe bill.\n  In another case, a woman suffered a snowmobiling accident and was \nairlifted off a mountain. The charge was $40,000. Her insurance paid \nabout $15,000, and so she was responsible for the $25,000 balance to \nthe company. Now, in that case she negotiated with the company and got \nit down to a balance of $13,000, but that $13,000 she then had to pay.\n  In a third case, a father and his daughter were airlifted from the \nhospital where they were to another hospital because they needed \nadditional care. The young person's condition was deteriorating and she \nneeded specialized care so they had to airlift her to another hospital. \nThey had a single pilot who took them on the flight. After they \nreturned home by car, they got a check from the insurance company for \n$6,800, so the insurance company paid $6,800. That left them with the \nbalance of a bill that was almost $70,000. Again, they thought they \nwere covered under their insurance. So my colleagues can see that this \nis a real concern and a real issue.\n  Many consumers with health insurance coverage assume these medical \nbills will be taken care of and don't think to ask if the air \ntransportation company is a participating provider because obviously \nthey are in an emergency situation. Unfortunately, as a result, after \nthe patient has stabilized and is in recovery, they learn they will be \nfaced with an expensive medical bill they hadn't anticipated.\n  In the last session of our State legislature in our State, the State \nlegislature made an effort to address this problem in State law. What \nessentially the State law said was that the hospitals would have a list \nof providers that accept insurance as payment in full and insurance \ncompanies that do this balance billing, so then the hospital and the \npatient can be informed and make their decision as to the air ambulance \nprovider. The problem is the State law was struck down in Federal court \nbecause the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 took precedence, meaning \nit is a Federal issue, which we understand. Obviously, airplanes cross \nState lines, so we understand there is a Federal aspect to it.\n  Our amendment would allow hospitals to provide information so \npatients could determine which air ambulance providers accept the \ninsurance payment as payment in full and which ones don't. Then \nhospitals could have that information available and patients could make \ntheir decisions accordingly.\n  It is a very simple, straightforward amendment that would allow State \nlegislatures to make sure that information is available for patients in \ntheir State.\n  There are a number of organizations that are supporting this \ncommonsense amendment, including the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners, the American Health Insurance Plans, Blue Cross Blue \nShield Association, American Heart Association, American Stroke \nAssociation, Consumers Union, and Families USA.\n  That is the legislation in a nutshell, and I have taken a minute to \nexplain it.\n  Now I wish to turn to my colleague from the State of Montana and ask \nhim--as a cosponsor of this legislation I know he has run into this \nproblem with his constituents. So I would ask him to comment both in \nterms of the situations he has run into in Montana and his thoughts on \nhow we can best address it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from North \nDakota for working on this important issue that in fact speaks across \nthis country but especially in rural America.\n  Senator Hoeven and I are on the floor working this afternoon to \nprovide a voice to those who feel the well-being of ordinary Americans \nis being taken advantage of. These are folks who are honest and work \nhard and play by the rules, but they find themselves victims of an \nunchecked industry with too many bad actors. That is right. They are \nnot all bad actors, but some are. The folks who survive the fight of a \nlifetime are waking up the next morning only to find themselves in a \nnew fight--a fight to keep their home and their financial well-being.\n  In rural America, we are seeing more and more troubling reports of \nfamilies losing nearly everything to rising air ambulance bills. In my \nhome State of Montana, over the past 10 years, we have seen more out-\nof-State independent and for-profit air ambulance companies in \noperation. These companies are moving into my State, and they are not \naffiliated with local hospitals. They do not always have contracts with \ninsurance companies, and they are taking financial advantage of \nfamilies who are in crisis--families who may be forced to cash out \ntheir retirement accounts, drain their life savings, and even sell \ntheir homes to cover air ambulance bills that can climb up to $100,000. \nThis has been well-documented in the State of Montana. Occurrences of \npeople getting billed enormous sums of money after an air ambulance \ntrip have been well-documented.\n  So what is the upshot of all this? The upshot is we are a rural \nState. Oftentimes you can't get to a hospital in time by road, so you \nhave to call an air ambulance. If you call the wrong one, you end up \nwith a bill you can't pay. So people have to make literally life-and-\ndeath choices at a time when they shouldn't have to. Oftentimes, \nbecause of this experience they are saying: You know what. We are \nbetween a rock and a hard place. We will take a chance. The wife or the \nspouse may be purple because they can't breathe, but they say: We will \ntake a chance. They will pile in the car and drive an hour to the \nhospital and hopefully they will survive. A child may come in from an \naccident, having potentially lost a limb, who may be bleeding \nprofusely, but they say: We will take a chance and not call the air \nambulance.\n  This system is broken, and it needs to be fixed. It is broken for the \npatients, it is broken for the providers, and right now in this country \nthere is no tool to address it.\n  We have a solution. Senator Hoeven and I have an amendment to tackle \nthis issue and put it on the FAA bill and get it done. Our amendment \nwould provide States the ability to decide whether they want to create \nrules regarding air ambulance rates and services. Right now, States are \nprohibited from regulating air ambulances, but families have made it \nclear that something must be done to prevent these companies from \nraking families over and collecting exorbitant bills. A one-size-fits-\nall solution from Washington, DC, is not the answer, and that is why \nthe good Senator from North Dakota and I believe each State should have \nthe opportunity to address this growing problem in their own way.\n  Our amendment will provide incentives for these air ambulance \ncompanies to be better neighbors, as we like to say in Montana. It will \nencourage them to work with local hospitals and insurance providers to \nensure that the lifesaving services they provide will not cause that \nfamily to lose their home.\n  This amendment is supported by State officials across the Nation and \nby folks on both sides of the aisle.\n  With that, I ask Senator Hoeven to yield for a question.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Certainly.\n  Mr. TESTER. Why is this legislation so important to Senator Hoeven \nand his constituents in North Dakota?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I would respond to the good Senator from \nMontana that I think we have both described the importance in terms of \nthe costs that people may face, particularly in a time when they are in \nan emergency or crisis situation. It is very difficult for them \nalready. So, look, we need to do everything we can to make sure they \ncan get quality medical care and that they are as informed\n\n[[Page S1902]]\n\nas possible in making those decisions and trying to make those \ndecisions easier for them, particularly at a time when they are faced \nwith a life-threatening situation or crisis situation.\n  The good Senator from Montana really put his finger on it when he \nsaid that we are not asking for a Federal one-size-fits-all solution. \nInstead, we are saying: Let's empower the States to do what they can in \nterms of helping people when they are faced with this kind of emergency \nsituation.\n  So if one really looks at this amendment--and we have done a fair \namount of work on it with health care providers, talking to the \nambulance association and others, and we will continue to work on it. \nBut essentially we are saying: Make sure people have that information \nreadily available so that when they are in an emergency or crisis \nsituation, they can make a quick and good decision that fits their \nneeds, and let the providers compete for the business.\n  This goes to empowering people in terms of choice and deciding what \nkind of care they want, and then they can make an informed decision \nabout what they want. If they are in a situation where health insurance \nhas to cover it, then they make that decision accordingly. If they want \nsome other service in a particular circumstance and they are willing to \npay out of pocket, then they can make that choice too.\n  This really is about making sure that people have the information, \nparticularly at a critical time when they really need it, so they get \nthe health care they need and they also have some of those--what costs \nthey are going to face. That is what it is all about. That is true in \nour States, which are more rural States, but it is true in the urban \nStates as well.\n  Mr. TESTER. It certainly is, and I can say that what we have heard in \nMontana is that there is a problem out there. We need some help.\n  Last summer, I had a woman by the name of Christina from Missoula, \nMT, who called me. She and her husband both work full time. She pays \n$1,000 a month for her health insurance. She was being responsible, \ndoing everything she was supposed to do, but an emergency struck, which \ncould happen to anybody, and her daughter needed to be airlifted to \nSeattle, WA.\n  The cost of the flight was the last thing on Christina's mind. She \ncared only about the health of her daughter. In the back of her mind, \nshe knew she had health insurance, so she knew she would be OK. When \nChristina and her daughter returned from Seattle, they found a bill \nwaiting for them for $85,000, a little bit less than twice the average \nthat an American earns every year. Think about this--getting a bill \nfrom a service that you had no choice but to take and then finding out \nthat it cost you twice as much as you make in 1 calendar year.\n  Unfortunately, the story of Christina is not unique. Each year, more \nand more Montanans have a story exactly like Christina's. That is why \nit is critical that we get this problem addressed through this \nbipartisan amendment that will provide certainty and justice for \nfamilies like hers. These folks really have nowhere else to turn.\n  If we can get this amendment on the FAA bill--and I know we are \nworking with the committee right now, tweaking it, trying to make it \nwork so that people are more at ease with it--we can begin to address \nthis issue that has haunted too many families.\n  I would just tell you this. I had an accident when I was young, and \nit wasn't the kind of accident that was life threatening. My folks had \nonly a 15-minute drive to get to the hospital. I could tell you that if \nI had been a little bit more unlucky and we had put it into the 21st \ncentury and my folks would have had to get an air ambulance--which is \nabsolutely necessary in rural America sometimes; it is necessary \ndepending on what problem has happened--it would have put the family in \na position where they literally could have lost the farm. This isn't \nright. This isn't what this country is about. All it takes is just a \nlittle bit of tweaking, a little bit of knowledge, a little bit of \ntransparency, and that is what this amendment does. I think we can get \nthis problem fixed, and it is simply the right thing to do.\n  I want to thank Senator Hoeven for his leadership and his hard work \non this issue.\n  I yield back to Senator Hoeven.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Again, I would like to thank the Senator from Montana for \njoining in this bipartisan legislation and just ask that our colleagues \nwork with us to get a good commonsense solution to solve this very \nurgent need.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I would like to speak in support of \nseveral amendments that I am offering to the FAA reauthorization bill.\n  You may recall that in 2011 some of my colleagues and I offered a \nbipartisan amendment to a section of the bill that called for the FAA \nto develop a process to integrate unmanned aerial systems, UAVs or \nunmanned aerial vehicles, into the NAS, the National Airspace System.\n  That legislation included drafting a plan to develop air traffic \nrequirements for all unmanned aerial systems at test sites; \ncertification and flight standards at nonmilitary UAS test sites, as \nwell as the National Airspace System; and making sure that the U.S. \nintegration plan is incorporated in NextGen, the administration's \nproject to modernize the American air traffic control system.\n  Importantly, it also called for the agency to designate six test \nsites to help accelerate the NAS integration plan.\n  These test sites were established in December of 2013, following a \ncompetitive process that encouraged some of the very best in the \nfledgling field of unmanned aerial systems to apply and compete for the \ntest sites.\n  I am proud to say that Grand Forks in my home State of North Dakota \nmade the cut and is one of the premier test sites and hubs for UAS \nresearch and development in America. The work they have done there and \nat the other five sites across the Nation has been nothing less than \nremarkable, which is why I am here today to make the case for some \nadditional amendments to help them maintain their momentum.\n  The first is Hoeven amendment No. 3500, which extends authorization \nfor the six test sites for another 5 years. The previous FAA bill from \n2012 authorized the test sites for 5 years, and the legislation before \nus extends that just an additional few months, through September 30, \n2017. Our amendment would extend this authorization by an additional 5 \nyears, through September 30, 2022.\n  The Northern Plains UAS Test Site in North Dakota has some important \nachievements to point to: supporting NASA's UAS-related research; \nresearch and testing at up to 1,200 feet across the entire State of \nNorth Dakota, far above the limits for commercial small unmanned aerial \nsystems; nighttime UAS operations; and approval to fly multiple types \nof UAS in the same airspace. Nevertheless, there is plenty of work left \nto do in support of integrating UAS into the national airspace, and \nthat will require investment and support from industry partners. They \nwill be much more likely to use the FAA test sites if they can be sure \nthose test sites will be operational beyond the end of next year.\n  My second amendment is Hoeven amendment No. 3538, the private \naircraft exemption, which will help to expedite testing of private \nindustry aircraft by not requiring them to lease their aircraft to the \ntest site in order to fly.\n  The six UAS test sites are intended to work with the UAS industry to \nperform research necessary to integrate the UAS, unmanned aircraft, \ninto the national airspace. What are we trying to achieve here? We are \ntrying to achieve concurrent use of the NAS, national airspace. Right \nnow we obviously have manned aircraft flying all over the United \nStates, but where we are going is we will have manned and unmanned \naircraft flying at the same time, concurrently in the national \nairspace. We have to make sure that is done safely. We have to make \nsure that we address the privacy issues.\n\n[[Page S1903]]\n\n  There is a whole gamut of issues that have to be addressed to do this \nsafely and well. That is what the test sites are developing so that we \ncan move to that new paradigm. It is vitally important.\n  We fly unmanned aircraft all over the world through our military, but \nwe have to figure out how to do that safely and well in our airspace \nwith civilian aircraft. That involves a lot of things--commercial \naviation, general aviation, and unmanned aircraft for a whole myriad of \nuses. This is not an easy proposition, so we have to figure it out.\n  If we don't do this, we will pay a huge price because right now the \nUnited States is the aviation technology leader in the world. The \nUnited States leads aviation technology globally, but if we don't \nfigure out how to do this, somebody else will, and we can't afford to \nforfeit our leadership in aviation technology. We can't afford it from \na military standpoint, and we can't afford it from a civilian \nstandpoint if we are going to continue to lead in technology, job \ngrowth, the jobs of the future, and the strongest, most innovative, \ndynamic economy both now and in the future.\n  We are working on the test sites to make this happen, but currently \nyou have to lease your aircraft to the test site. You can't just come \nto the test site and get approval to fly. That is what we need to \nchange.\n  Currently, as I say, any private industry partner seeking to fly at a \ntest site must first lease their unmanned aerial system--their plane or \ndrone or whatever you want to call it, RPA, remotely piloted aircraft--\nthey have to lease that to the test site. As a public entity, it can \nthen clear the aircraft to operate as a public aircraft while at that \ntest site.\n  The problem is that the UAS industry is understandably reluctant to \nrelease their UAS aircraft to the test site for research work and has \nparticular concerns about losing proprietary information through the \nleasing process. Remember, this is the latest, greatest new technology. \nCompanies are investing hundreds of millions and billions of dollars in \nthis new technology. They want to keep it proprietary. They don't want \nto disclose it to all of their competitors. At our test site right now, \nwe have not only Northrup Grumman but General Atomics--manufacturers of \nGlobal Hawk, Predator, and Reaper--doing this kind of research and \ndevelopment. They need to protect those proprietary technology \ndevelopments.\n  Obviously this is an important issue for them as they are working to \ndevelop the aircraft of the future. My amendment would provide an \nexemption for the test sites to fly civil aircraft subject to whatever \nterms and conditions the FAA Administrator deems appropriate for public \nsafety and subject to the terms of the certificate of authorization \nalready granted to the test sites.\n  Remember, the test sites have to get approval from the FAA to fly all \nof these different aircraft at the test site, so the FAA has already \nprovided that prior authority. We don't need to have the additional \nwork of in essence making these test aircraft public aircraft. These \nterms govern the airspace and conditions under which the test sites can \noperate with unmanned aerial systems.\n  This amendment is common sense. Current procedures block the test \nsites from assisting industry in developing technology that integrates \ninto the national airspace. This amendment would enable the test sites \nto perform as originally intended; that is, as a bridge between \nindustry and the FAA to develop concurrent airspace use for unmanned \naircraft, which is a key part of the future of aviation.\n  Test sites will have the same responsibilities for safely managing \nthe operation of UAS under their certificate of authorization as they \ndo today. So this is about doing things in a more efficient way without \nany effect on public safety.\n  In addition, the FAA already grants numerous exemptions on a case-by-\ncase basis to industry partners, known as section 333 exemptions. This \namendment effectively serves as a test site 333 exemption, which should \nhelp decrease demand for the FAA to press the other exemption requests, \nagain streamlining the process, making it work.\n  Finally, I filed Hoeven 3543, which leverages test site and center of \nexcellence participation in the unmanned traffic management pilot \nprogram. The underlying FAA legislation establishes an FAA-led pilot \nprogram to develop an unmanned traffic management system, which will be \nessential to the final goal of integrating the UAS into the national \nairspace. This is how we manage traffic--manned and unmanned aircraft--\nin the same airspace. How do we manage that safely and well?\n  The amendment would require the FAA Administrator to leverage to the \nmaximum extent possible the capabilities of the FAA's UAS center of \nexcellence and the six UAS test sites when developing and carrying out \nthe pilot program. So we are saying to the FAA: Work with the test \nsites and the national center of excellence, which we have developed \nfor unmanned aerial systems to move this technology forward.\n  Right now, the FAA is behind the curve. The technology is racing \nforward, and we have to maximize our use of these resources to make \nsure that we are developing UAS the right way, in a way that the public \nfeels is safe, that respects privacy rights, and that addresses all of \nthe different potential concerns. Again, it is about doing things right \nand well with this new technology.\n  Again, this is a commonsense amendment. The FAA should use the \ncapabilities Congress has put at its disposal, along with its \ninteragency and industry partners, to advance development of unmanned \ntraffic management systems. My amendments give our UAS test sites the \ntools they need to stay up front, which will ultimately yield research \nbenefits on behalf of our country.\n  We have all seen and read in the media about how these remarkable new \naircraft are playing a big military role in the security of our Nation. \nThey achieve military objectives without putting our men and women in \nuniform in harm's way. We are also seeing how they play an important \nrole in border protection and other security operations. Less well \nknown is their use in precision agriculture, disaster mitigation, \ntraffic safety, building inspections, energy infrastructure monitoring, \nand many uses that have yet to be imagined.\n  The UAS industry is anxiously awaiting the approval of rules to begin \noperating small UAS at low altitudes. This is an important step, but it \nis just one step. It is limited, which is why we need the test sites \nfor the research and development necessary to move forward. The UAS \ntest sites and the center of excellence are in a position to stay ahead \nof the curve. Doing the research will enable the next phase in UAS \nintegration from flying at night and beyond line of sight to flying \nhigher and farther using larger aircraft.\n  These amendments are important for the success of an exciting and \nrapidly growing segment of aviation in our country. The goal is to make \nUAS a fully working component of not only America's larger aviation \nsystem but also of our economy. As I said, we are the world's leader in \naviation technology. We must continue to forge ahead to maintain that \nleadership.\n  I will close by saying that almost all of us now have an iPhone or \nAndroid--some type of phone in our pocket. It is so much more, isn't \nit? It is a full-blown computer. Think back 10 years. We had no idea \nthat we would all have these cell phones or that they would have all of \nthese amazing capabilities. But look at how much we use it every day in \nour lives. Well, I make that analogy with unmanned aircraft. What is it \ngoing to look like 10 years from now? What is it going to be like? \nWell, we don't know yet. We don't know what all these applications and \nwhat all these uses are going to be. But what we do know is that the \nUnited States needs to be the leader in aviation technology \ndevelopment. That is what we are talking about with these test sites--\nmaking sure that we can do it safely and well and that we can maintain \nthat global leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I would like to speak on an amendment \nI have submitted that will ensure the implementation of what is already \nrequired by statute: a biometric exit system for the United States. The \nlaw has\n\n[[Page S1904]]\n\nrequired a biometric--that means a fingerprint, as opposed to \nbiographic, which is name and birth date--system that allows us to know \nwho is coming into this country on a visa and whether they left when \nthey were supposed to leave. It is absolutely critical to the safety of \nthe United States. It is something the 9/11 Commission recommended as a \nhigh priority. Ten years later, when they did their Review Commission \nreport to see how their recommendations had been carried out, they \nnoted that one of their top concerns was the failure of Congress to \ncomplete the system.\n  Right now when you come into the United States, you put your hand on \na screen and they clock you in biometrically, and then when you leave, \nthere is no system that clocks you out.\n  It is just like going to work every day. You take one of these \niPhones. It has got this place on the bottom where you put your finger. \nI put my thumb on it. I don't have to put in my pass code; it simply \nreads my fingerprint. This is done all over America. These screens are \nnot expensive. They don't require a lot of space. It is something that \nshould be done. It has not been done.\n  The first requirement for this was in 1996 through the Illegal \nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. The requirements \nwere largely ignored, and eventually modified until the terrorist \nattacks on September 11 caused us to focus again on the issue.\n  Congress responded by once again demanding that government implement \nan exit system with the passage of the USA PATRIOT Act, which stated \nthat an entry and exit data system should be fully implemented for \nairports, seaports, and land border ports of entry ``with all \ndeliberate speed and as expeditiously as practical.'' Fifteen years \nago, that occurred. Congress then reiterated its demand for a biometric \nentry-exit system in 2002 when it passed the Enhanced Border Security \nand Visa Entry Reform Act. This bill required the government to install \nbiometric readers and scanners ``at all ports of entry of the United \nStates.'' Subsequently and consistent with the recommendations of the \nNational Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \nCongress passed the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of \n2004, which mandated that the entry-exit system be biometrically based. \nThat was 12 years ago.\n  Despite the relative successful implementation of a biometric entry \nsystem, the Department of Homeland Security has largely failed to \nimplement this required biometric exit system. To date, Homeland \nSecurity has only implemented a handful of pilot programs. They have \nhad one excuse after another, and failed to do so.\n  There have been some promising developments in recent months, I would \nnote.\n  Of primary importance is the fact that Congress passed the \nConsolidated Appropriations Act of 2016. This created a dedicated \nsource of funds for the implementation of a biometric exit system. It \nhas been estimated that this fund will result in approximately $1 \nbillion that will be available solely for the implementation of the \nbiometric exit system required by law. Yet, even with this significant \nsource of funding, the administration continues to dawdle. My amendment \nwill end that delay and bring this matter to a close. It will complete \nthe system that the 9/11 Commission said was essential for our national \nsafety and security.\n  My amendment simply states that no funds from the FAA bill that we \npass can be obligated or expended for the physical modification of \nexisting air navigation facilities--that is, a port of entry--or of the \nconstruction of a new air navigation facility intended to be a port of \nentry, unless the Secretary of Homeland Security certifies that the \nowner or sponsor of the facility has entered into an agreement that \nguarantees the installation and implementation of such a facility not \nlater than 2 years after the date of the enactment of the act. In other \nwords, they have to complete the contract to make this system work, and \nthen we give them 2 full years to accomplish it. That is more than \nenough time.\n  The amendment allows Customs and Border Protection officers at each \nairport that serves as a port of entry to create a solution that works \nspecifically for the needs of CPB and the airport. It gives them some \nflexibility to work these things out. It does, however, require--\nfinally and I hope fully--an agreement that guarantees that the system \nwill be installed and implemented at the airport in 2 years.\n  These airports drag their feet. Airlines drag their feet. They do not \nlike to be bothered about this. It is not in their priorities, but it \nis not going to cause them great problems. It is not going to cause the \nairplanes great problems.\n  Somebody needs to be representing the national interest around here, \nwhat is in the public interest. They don't get to undo a law passed by \nCongress 20 years ago that should have already been implemented years \nago. It is that simple.\n  This deal could be done in 6 months if we had an administration that \nwas determined to get it done. The equipment is already available all \nover the country. Many police officers have these screens in their \ncars. They arrest someone for DUI, and they make them put their hand on \nthe screen, and it runs a check throughout the United States. They find \nout that someone arrested in Alabama has a warrant for murder in New \nYork City. That is the way the system is working today all over the \ncountry. We can't make this work at an international airport to ensure \npeople who have a limited-time visa in the United States actually leave \nwhen they are supposed to? And when we find out someone may be a \nterrorist or connected with some illegal enterprise or terroristic \nplan, we want to know if they actually left the country or are still in \nthe country. This is something law enforcement--the FBI and Homeland \nSecurity--needs to know about.\n\n  I was told by one company that there are many competitors who would \nbid for this work. There are all kinds of systems out there. One \nmanufacturer suggested we should host in the Capitol a products day and \nlet all these companies bring in their systems so staffers and Members \nof Congress can go out and see what the possibilities are and erase \nforever this idea that this is somehow impractical, not feasible, and \ncan't be done.\n  If Apple and Samsung and others can implement technology on your cell \nphone, on your mobile phones to access them, you can be sure the U.S. \nGovernment could work with the airports to complete a biometric exit \nsystem, as the law has long required. Such a system will not have large \nspace requirements. U.S. Customs and Border Protection can work with \nthe larger airports with international terminals and install physical \nequipment at their departure gates. CBP can work with smaller airports \nto deploy handheld systems at gates handling international flights.\n  Ultimately, all a passenger exiting the United States needs to do is \nplace his or her hand on a simple screen or, with some devices, even \njust wave their hand in front of it. We had an expert tell us they have \na system you don't even have to touch the screen. You can wave your \nhand in front of it, it reads the fingerprints, and the device will \nbiometrically identify the passenger as the person exits.\n  Somebody can take your name, go to the airport, and exit the country \nwith some sort of ID and claim they exited as you were supposed to \nexit, without this biometric check, because you can use any name. If \nthey clear this screening area, they move into the boarding area. They \nwill be allowed into the boarding area. If there is a hit because the \nboarder is on some no-fly list because of some danger, the passenger \ncan be denied boarding or removed from the plane before it takes off, \nand their baggage can be removed from the plane. Importantly, the \nUnited States would then have a unified, automatically produced list of \nthose who have departed on time and those who have overstayed their \nvisas.\n  Colleagues, I would note we are having a huge surge in the number of \npeople who come to this country on a visa and don't go home. It now \namounts to over 40 percent of the people illegally in the country who \ncame on a visa, promising to go home at a certain time, yet who are not \ngoing home.\n  We had a Democratic debate a few weeks ago when former Secretary \nClinton said: Well, if you are found in the United States unlawfully \nyou should only be deported if you have been indicted or charged with a \nviolent felony.\n\n[[Page S1905]]\n\nHow did this become the law? You are not allowed to stay in the \ncountry. You can't stay in the country if you overstay your visa. That \nis the law. You are deportable right there, whether you are a good \nperson or not, and even if you never committed a traffic offense. Now \nwe have leadership in this country so detached from law, so detached \nfrom the will of the American people, they are saying you can come in \nand stay for years after overstaying your visa and only be deported if \nyou commit a violent felony.\n  This has to be brought to a conclusion. The American people want a \nlawful system of immigration--are they wrong to ask for that?--one that \nserves the interests of the American people, one that is worthy of a \nnation that validates the rule of law, or do we just give in? Do we \ncapitulate to lawlessness, and anybody who comes and can get into our \ncountry--even for a month, presumably--and who commits a $50,000 bank \nfraud is not going to be deported because it is not a violent crime, \neven though the law says otherwise?\n  Let me just note that for a host of reasons the system should be \nbased on the fingerprint system where we maintain our extensive \ndatabase. There are eye systems that will read your eyes, we have \nsystems that will read your face, but, colleagues, do not be led into \nthat. We are not ready to do that. There is no data system that \nsupports a face system. Let's stay with the fingerprints, as experts \nhave told us.\n  Let me also note that numerous countries around the world, including \nNew Zealand, Singapore, and Hong Kong, use a biometric system now. This \nis proven. There are approximately 17 countries.\n  Ending this failure has bipartisan support. My subcommittee--the \nSubcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest--held a hearing \non January 20 entitled ``Why is the biometric exit traffic system still \nnot in place?'' During the hearing, we got promises from the \nadministration but no commitment regarding when such a system would \nactually be deployed.\n  Just a few weeks later, Secretary Johnson of Homeland Security made \nstatements directing the Department of Homeland Security to begin \nimplementation of the system at our airports by 2018--begin the \nimplementation by 2018. So this is another mere promise--the kind of \npromises that have never resulted in the production of a system, and \nthat uncertainty must end. The obvious missing piece is an actual \ncompletion date. This bill would create that. It is these kinds of \nlulling comments we have heard for all these years that have kept us \nfrom actually following through on the system.\n  If Congress would like to know why the American people are not happy \nwith their leaders in Washington, this is a good example of it, a very \ngood example. Congress promises to fix a problem, we even vote for a \nbill to fix it, and in this case we voted for bills to fix it, they \npassed and became law and require the problem to be fixed, but it \ndoesn't happen. As decades go by, we sit by and nothing ever happens. A \nspecial interest group speaks up here and a special interest group \nspeaks up there and somehow it never happens.\n  It is time to fulfill the promise and commitment to the American \npeople. We promised the American people a system that would \ndemonstrably improve our national security. As noted by former \nCommissioners on the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the \nUnited States in a report issued in 2014, ``Without exit-tracking, our \ngovernment does not know when a foreign visitor admitted to the United \nStates on a temporary basis has overstayed his or her admission. Had \nthe system been in place before 9/11, we would have had a better chance \nof detecting the plotters before they struck.''\n  We have long known that visa overstays pose serious national security \nrisks. A number of the hijackers on September 11 overstayed their \nvisas. The number of visa overstays implicated in terrorism since then \nis certainly a significant number. A new poll came out earlier this \nyear that indicates that three out of four Americans not only want the \nObama administration to find these aliens who overstay their visas--not \njust the ones who have committed violent felonies--but also deport \nthem. The same poll indicates 68 percent of Americans consider visa \noverstays as a ``serious national security risk,'' and 31 percent \nconsider visa overstays as a ``very serious'' national security risk. \nAnd there is little doubt about why.\n  The risks to our national security are too high for us to maintain \nthe status quo. We are having more and more people traveling by air to \nthe United States from around the world. We simply allow them to come \non a very generous basis. They commit to leaving after a given period \nof time. Whether it is for a vacation or a job, they then plan to \nreturn to their home country, and we need a system to know if they are \ncomplying with that. We must fulfill the promise we made to the \nAmerican people and do all we can to complete this system. My amendment \nwould do so. It would finally bring this to a conclusion because it \nwould say to the Air Force: We have money to help you do your runways, \nexpand your airports, and do the kinds of things you would like to, but \nwe want this agreement in place first.\n  Mr. President, I understand that some on the Democratic side intend \nto object to calling up this amendment. It was my intention at this \ntime to call up this amendment. I don't see any Democrat here, but I \nhave been told that is what they want to do, and they passed that word \nalong. So in an act of courtesy, I will not call up the amendment at \nthis time, but we need to bring it up. Every Democratic member of my \nsubcommittee who attended the hearing--Senators Schumer, Feinstein, and \nFranken--all said they favored fixing this. I think we have a \nbipartisan agreement if we can get a vote, but, once again, we may not \nbe having a vote. That would be very distressing because I don't see \nhow anybody could oppose the final completion of this much needed \nproduct.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                         National Equal Pay Day\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise because it is Equal Pay Day, and I \nwould like to talk about the importance of finally ending gender-based \ndiscrimination in wages. It is unfortunate that in the year 2016, this \nis still an issue we need to address in this country, but it is.\n  I had the privilege of serving as our State's first female attorney \ngeneral. I think it is the right thing to do and the obvious thing to \ndo, and under our laws this already exists--that equal pay for equal \nwork should be the standard. All of us should be judged in the \nworkplace by our experience, our qualifications, and our capability of \ndoing our job and nothing else.\n  Women face many challenges in balancing work and family life. I know \nthat firsthand, being the working mom of two young kids. On top of \nthose challenges, no woman, whether she is a mother or not, should ever \nface gender-based pay discrimination in the workplace. Today, more than \nhalf of New Hampshire's women serve as the primary or coearner in their \nhousehold. That just underscores the serious need to address this \nproblem.\n  Men and women should receive equal pay for equal work. It is that \nsimple. Your salary should be based on how you do your job. Because of \nthat, I introduced the Gender Advancement in Pay Act, or GAP Act, along \nwith Senators Capito, Portman, Burr, and Heller, and I thank my \ncosponsors for supporting this effort.\n  What we did is we built on a highly successful bipartisan pay equity \nlaw that was signed into law in my home State of New Hampshire in 2014. \nThe GAP Act makes it clear that employers must pay men and women equal \nwages for equal work, without reducing the ability of employers to \nprovide merit pay and reward merit, which all of us want. Having been \nthe first woman attorney general, I want to give women the opportunity \nto outperform their male counterparts as well because I know we can.\n  Today, there is a patchwork of laws that govern equal pay and an \nemployee's ability to discuss their pay without fear of retaliation, \nand differing court opinions have led to a situation where some \nemployees receive protections not available to others simply based on \nwhere they live. As such, the\n\n[[Page S1906]]\n\nGAP Act is a sensible approach to updating, clarifying, and \nstrengthening these laws.\n\n  For 20 years the Paycheck Fairness Act has been around in the \nCongress. It has never passed. One of the reasons, I think, was \ndescribed very well in 2010 by the Boston Globe. It said that the \nPaycheck Fairness Act, as a whole, was too broad a solution to a \ncomplex, nuanced problem, but that a narrower bill that would stiffen \nsome penalties and ban retaliation would be helpful. That is exactly \nwhat the GAP Act is--a bill that stiffens penalties, bans retaliation, \nand clarifies the law so that we can ensure we have equal pay for equal \nwork.\n  In short, my bill updates the Equal Pay Act's ``factor other than \nsex'' clause. Currently, employers can explain away pay differentials \nby pointing to a number of factors. One of those was ambiguously \nwritten to be a ``factor other than sex.'' Our bill closes this \nloophole and clarifies that any factor other than sex must be a \nbusiness-related factor, such as education, training, or experience. It \nmakes sense; doesn't it? Why would you allow a defense of a ``factor \nother than sex'' that has nothing to do with your job? To me, that \nseems to be inviting discrimination. That is why we should clarify the \nlaw to make clear that it has to be a factor related to your job--such \nas education, training, or experience. This would clarify the law for \nemployees and protect the rights of employees, and, also, employers \nwould clearly have this provision defined.\n  The GAP Act also creates a penalty for willful violations. This is \nactually one step further than New Hampshire's bipartisan pay equity \nlaw. So it would put teeth into it, and I think that is important. \nEmployers that knowingly act with the intent to discriminate should \nhave to pay a penalty. What we do with the funds from this penalty is \nto take the funds and, rather than putting them back in the General \nTreasury, we are going to study the wage gap issue, make sure we have \nthe best research on what is causing it and what is happening, and find \nmore ways to expand opportunities for women in the workforce with \nbetter paying jobs.\n  The GAP Act would also promote salary transparency. According to the \nInstitute for Women's Policy Research, about half of workers were \ndiscouraged or outright prohibited from discussing their pay with \ncoworkers. When employees are allowed to discuss their pay, they are \nmore likely to uncover incidents of discrimination. Yet, if I am not \nallowed to discuss my pay and I find a coworker who is the same \nsituated as me yet making more money--a male counterpart--and I am not \nallowed to raise this because I can't discuss pay comparisons, then how \nam I going to raise a claim of discrimination? So we need to make it \nmore transparent. We need to ensure that employees are allowed to \ndiscuss their pay. This will make it more likely to uncover incidents \nof gender-based pay discrimination.\n  So our bill prohibits retaliation against employees who discuss their \npay, and tells employers they can't institute secret pay policies and \nthey can't ask an employee to bargain away their right to be able to \ntalk about their pay if they choose to.\n  Importantly, after getting feedback from stakeholders in our States, \nwe made sure that provision is strong. The cosponsors of this bill \nreintroduced an updated version of this bill this week to ensure that \nthere are stronger provisions for salary transparency and to make it \nclear that employers cannot sidestep provisions that ban retaliation \nagainst employees who discuss their pay. It prohibits pay secrecy \npolicies that could encourage this kind of behavior.\n  On Equal Pay Day, today, it is very important that we all work \ntogether to do anything we can to end the gender wage gap. One of the \nthings we should do is to stop the political posturing. Let's stop \nusing this incredibly important issue as a political football, because \nlegislation like the Paycheck Fairness Act has been around 20 years.\n  I am glad to introduce the GAP Act, because I believe this is a \ncommonsense piece of legislation that gets at the issue by clarifying \nour laws in a way that benefits employees. It makes sure it is clear \nthat if you willfully violate our laws, you are going to have to pay a \npenalty. We are going to take that money, and we are going to put it \nback into research to further help us address the pay gap. We are also \ngoing to make clear for plaintiffs that, if you want to file an EEOC \nclaim and you also want to file an equal pay claim, we will make sure \nyou can do both, and your rights will be protected to do both by \nstaying the statute of limitations while the EEOC claim is going \nforward. This will help plaintiffs not have to litigate in two forums. \nThis will also allow the EEOC to do their job and, if they find \ndiscrimination, to be used in an equal pay act claim. This is another \nimportant step for plaintiffs and also to clarify that those who are \nvictims of discrimination are able to bring their rights forward.\n  On Equal Pay Day today, I hope we can stop making this a partisan \nissue and start actually passing legislation that will make a \ndifference. In 2014 New Hampshire passed an important law. I was glad \nNew Hampshire did that. I was glad that I could introduce what New \nHampshire did here in the Senate on a bipartisan basis and build on \nthat to introduce the GAP Act with some of my colleagues.\n  I hope today, on Equal Pay Day, we will take up legislation like the \nGAP Act and address gender-based pay discrimination. We are in 2016. I \nhave an 11-year-old daughter. I don't want to be discussing this 20 \nyears from now. I would like us to work on this in a serious, \nbipartisan manner, to address this, and to end gender-based pay \ndiscrimination once and for all, because equal pay for equal work just \nmakes sense. It is the right thing to do, and it should be how our laws \nwork.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of Flake \namendment No. 3556.\n  The amendment is simple. It simply strikes the newly added \nprohibition in the Visa Waiver Program on citizens of Visa Waiver \nProgram countries who are also dual nationals of certain other \ncountries, such as Iran, Iraq, Sudan, and Syria.\n  To be clear, this amendment keeps in place all other provisions added \nto the Visa Waiver Program to improve the security of the program, such \nas requiring greater information sharing. However, the dual national \nprovision does not provide any meaningful security benefit and, \ninstead, is a detriment to the country and the vast majority of dual \nnationals who provide a great benefit to the United States.\n  The problem with the dual national prohibition is twofold. It is both \nimprecise in its application, and it is difficult, if not impossible, \nto administer. One reason the prohibition is imprecise is because it \nprevents travel under the program regardless of travel history. For \nexample, a dual national of Iran who is prohibited from using the Visa \nWaiver Program need not have ever been to Iran to be prohibited. In \nfact, there is no clear definition of who qualifies as a dual national, \nand it demonstrates how this prohibition is impossible to administer.\n  Many groups have pointed out that there is no international agreement \non the rules of nationality, and that many people are dual nationals \neven if they do not wish to be. For example, there is no automatic way \nto relinquish one's Iranian nationality. It can only be accomplished if \nthe individual is allowed to do so by the Iranian Council of Ministers \nand fulfills a number of requirements, including the completion of \nnational military service. Does this sound likely or possible for an \nindividual who has never resided in Iran?\n  Now, the administration has recently stated that they will determine \neach potential visitor's nationality on a case-by-case basis. According \nto them, ``the U.S. government need not recognize another country's \nconferral of nationality if it determines that nationality to be \n`nominal.' ''\n  They also said ``DHS assesses whether an individual is a national of \na country based on an individual's relationship to that country, such \nas if an individual maintains allegiance to that\n\n[[Page S1907]]\n\ncountry.'' However, the administration would not specify what counts as \n``maintains allegiance.''\n  These examples show that the Visa Waiver Program is gaining nothing \nwhen it comes to actual security, and, instead, unfairly prohibits \nindividuals' participation based on meaningless standards.\n  Furthermore, of greatest concern is the potential for reciprocal \ntreatment of U.S. citizens. Just today, the European Commission asked \nEuropean Union governments and European lawmakers to suggest what \nactions the Commission might take due to the lack of visa waivers for \nsome EU citizens. Now, while there are a number of concerns when it \ncomes to reciprocity, this dual nationality provision has not gone \nunnoticed. Specifically, the Commission stated: ``In parallel to \ndiscussing full visa reciprocity, the Commission will continue to \nmonitor the implementation of the changes in the Visa Waiver Program.''\n  After expressing concerns about the negative consequences of these \nchanges on ``bona fide EU travelers,'' the Commission invited the \nUnited States to consider the Equal Protection in Travel Act of 2016 in \norder to mitigate restrictions imposed on dual nationals. This \namendment is that act.\n  I agree that we should mitigate these restrictions on dual nationals \nand mitigate the chances of reciprocal treatment for U.S. citizens. The \nU.S. passport is the most powerful in the world, and we need to ensure \nit remains that way. We should not threaten that status for a provision \nthat is both imprecise and impossible to administer.\n  I hope we can have a vote on this amendment, and I hope my colleagues \ncan support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nFederal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill which is before \nthe Senate and which we have been debating over the last week. Ensuring \nthat our great Nation--States such as Colorado and Alaska that have \nimportant aviation industries--has a healthy and safe general aviation \ncommunity and comprehensive aviation infrastructure is exactly the type \nof issue this Congress needs to be working on and the type that has \nbeen a top priority in previous Congresses.\n  In my State, aviation has a very rich history and is an incredibly \nimportant driver of our economy but also an important element of \nconnecting the entire State. Many aspects of our lives in Alaska rely \non commercial and general aviation. Living in a State of such enormous \nscale with numerous remote communities gives Alaskans a very deep \nappreciation for air travel, which in many cases provides the only \nmeans for transportation for many residents.\n  One of the things that is very much an honor being in the U.S. Senate \nis how different Senators come and describe life in their States so all \nAmericans have a better understanding of how the entire country is \nknitted together, how we work together, but what unique challenges \ndifferent States have.\n  For more than 100 communities in Alaska--including regional centers \nsuch as Bethel, Nome, Barrow, and Kotzebue--aviation is the only means \nof getting in or out of those communities since there are no roads. \nMost States don't understand that. There are no roads, no ferry \nservice, so aviation is critical. Alaska is unique in its dependence on \naviation, and we have a very busy, what we call highway of the skies. \nThere are more pilots per capita in my State than any other State in \nthe country. So that means everything from mail, to groceries, to baby \ndiapers has to be flown in by plane to many communities. If someone \ngets sick and needs to see a doctor, oftentimes that can only be done \nby air. There are over 400 general aviation airports across Alaska, 250 \nof which are owned and operated by the State of Alaska, and that \ndoesn't include hundreds of heliports that support mining, timber, the \noil and gas industry, and others.\n  General aviation and aviation infrastructure are critical components \nof our economy and our quality of life in our State, in Alaska. It is \nfundamental in terms of connecting people and communities and promoting \nand sustaining economic development. Indeed, estimates show that the \ngeneral aviation community contributes over $1 billion a year in \neconomic activity to the State of Alaska's economy and supports over \n47,000 jobs; that is 1 in 10 jobs in the entire State.\n  This is a very important bill. It is an important bill for the State \nof Alaska, but it is also an important bill for the United States of \nAmerica. The FAA reauthorization bill will expire in July, and it is \nimportant to avoid the uncertainty of more short-term extensions by \npassing the authorization bill we have had on the floor of the Senate \nover the last week.\n  I thank Chairman Thune and Ranking Member Nelson for all the work \nthey have been doing night and day, really for months on this important \nbipartisan bill. So far the process has been a model of how the Senate \nshould work.\n  Our friends in the media love to write the stories about nothing \nworking in the U.S. Senate. I don't think so. There are a lot of \nimportant bills moving--the highway bill, the Education bill, human \ntrafficking. Now we are looking at a bipartisan way to address a very \nimportant bill for the country; that is aviation, that is aviation \ninfrastructure, and that is aviation security.\n  Let me talk about some of the substance more broadly for the country \nand why this bill is so important.\n  One aspect of the bill is the Pilot's Bill of Rights 2. Building off \nthe success of the initial Pilot's Bill of Rights, this provision \ncontinues to make essential reforms for pilots--mostly general aviation \npilots who are so important to my State--streamlining an overly \nburdensome medical certification process, increasing transparency and \naccess to additional information for pilots in all the different \naspects of their requirements as to being pilots in the general \naviation community. There are provisions that also balance and make \nessential inroads toward rebalancing the relationship between the FAA \nand general aviation pilots.\n  One thing this Senate bill does not do--there has been a discussion \nover in the House--is it does not transfer the air traffic control \nservices that are so important to many of our States--particularly \nrural States--to a private corporation.\n  This bill also, very importantly, strengthens safety for pilots and \npassengers across the country. You can't pick up the news and not see \nhow important this issue is. From the terror attacks in Brussels, at \nthe airport there, to the Russian flight out of Egypt that went down \nbecause of a suspected ISIS attack, to instances of criminal behavior \neven among U.S. airport employees, events around the world have \nunderscored how important the need for stronger security measures for \nour Nation's air travel is.\n  What is really important is this is the Senate taking proactive \naction. This is not a bill on aviation security where we are reacting \nto some horrible tragedy, God forbid, in terms of aviation security, \nwhether an accident or a terrorist attack at one of our airports. What \nwe have been doing is looking at the challenges in these areas and \ntaking proactive measures so we don't have to react when there is a \nterrorist attack or an accident.\n  So these are comprehensive airline security reforms that are some of \nthe most important that have occurred and that we have debated in this \nbody for over a decade. Let me list just a few of them.\n\n  The bill includes several measures for the security of passengers by \nimproving airport employee vetting to ensure that potentially dangerous \nindividuals don't have access to secure areas in our airports, \nexpanding the enrollment in the TSA PreCheck Program so passengers move \nthrough security lines into more secure areas more quickly--we saw how \nimportant that was in Brussels--and enhancing security for \ninternational flights bound for the United States.\n  Overall, this legislation addresses a growing concern in terms of \nsecurity, including the cyber security threats facing aviation and air \nnavigation systems for our commercial airlines. The\n\n[[Page S1908]]\n\nbipartisan FAA Reauthorization Act does more for passengers and more \nfor security than any bill, at least in the last decade. It is an \nimportant bill, it is a good bill for America, and it is a good bill \nfor Alaska. It will advance measures to keep us safer. That is why I am \nsupporting this bill, and I encourage my colleagues to do so as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                         National Equal Pay Day\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, as we have heard all day, today is Equal \nPay Day. What does that mean? That means that today is the first day \nwomen in the workforce--if we separated male and female workers--would \nactually get a paycheck in the year. That is pretty remarkable, and it \nis a disparity we have been working on for decades in this country but \nstill have not achieved the parity that we believe is absolutely \nessential if we are going to be a family-friendly and forward-looking \ncountry with a growing and prosperous middle class.\n  I think way too often the issue of pay equity--the issue of equal \npay--is characterized as a woman's issue. It is characterized as \nsomething that only elite women care about, and it is characterized as \nsomething that is not something for the government to address. Well, I \nam here to dispel all of those myths. I think we can only fairly say \nthat by shortchanging women, employers are also shortchanging working \nfamilies. Families need a full salary so they can put food on their \ntable and make sure children have the medical care they deserve.\n  We have all heard the stark statistic that nationally women only earn \n79 percent of what White, non-Hispanic males are paid. In North Dakota, \nthe numbers are even more dramatic. The pay equity there is 71 percent. \nWomen earn just 71 percent of what men make in my State. It is \nunacceptable. It is unacceptable at a time when--according to a recent \nstudy from the Pew Research Center--women are now the leading solo \nbreadwinners in 40 percent of households. That compares to just 11 \npercent in 1960. It does not make sense that we are still struggling to \nmake the same amount as men for equal work.\n  Additionally, in North Dakota, 74 percent of children live in \nhouseholds where both parents work. Both parents need to work in order \nto support their families. When women don't make as much as men, it \ndoesn't just hurt them, but it hurts their children and families across \nthe country.\n  What is Congress to do about this disparity? We need to pass a \npaycheck fairness bill. We need to make sure we have this critical \npiece of legislation, which responds to this concern, in our laws and \nin the statutes of the United States of America.\n  What does paycheck fairness do? It would help close the pay gap by \ntaking critical steps to empower women to negotiate for equal pay. I \ncan't tell you the number of times I have heard women in my State say: \nWell, I just didn't know I wasn't getting paid what a man was getting \npaid. And employers saying: Well, she didn't ask and he did. I think we \nneed to be able to give the tools to women so they know when there is \ndisparate treatment. We need to close the loopholes the courts have \ncreated in the law, we need to create strong incentives for employers \nto obey the laws that are in place, and we need to strengthen Federal \noutreach and enforcement efforts.\n  Looking at pay is only one part of the equation. We also need to pass \nother family-friendly policies, such as the FAMILY Act, which would \nestablish a Federal paid leave policy.\n  I can only imagine what the debate was in this body when somebody \ncame up with the idea to introduce employment insurance. I am sure \nthere were a lot of discussions about yet another program and yet \nanother system that would actually add to the payroll tax and add to \nburdens put on families.\n  Who today in this body would propose that we eliminate unemployment \ninsurance? It has been a valuable transition opportunity so our workers \ncan look for that next job without disrupting their family payment. As \na person whose father was a seasonal construction worker, I know how \ncritical that benefit was to my family when I was growing up. I know \nunemployment insurance frequently gave our family the ability to put \nfood on the table in my household.\n  Let's talk about what happens when someone has a baby. Let's talk \nabout what happens when someone's mom gets sick. Let's talk about what \nhappens when we have a catastrophic illness of our own. Many people in \nmy State--in fact, the majority of people in my State--do not have 1 \nday of paid leave. So their choice is to take care of their family's \nhealth conditions or to take care of their newborn child and just quit \ntheir job or go on unpaid leave and actually not receive a salary.\n  How many people can go on unpaid leave and not receive salary? Not a \nlot. What it means is that frequently when people have to transition \naway from work, all of a sudden that person qualifies for food stamps, \nqualifies for Medicaid, and qualifies for other government assistance \nprograms. The cost to the employer for those government programs is \nequal to the price of a cup of coffee a week. For $1.50 a week per \nemployee, we can provide this benefit. How do we know we can provide \nthis benefit? Because we have States that have done it. California, \nwhich restricted their payment, I believe, to 50 percent to families \nwho used this insurance benefit, recently upped that amount to 70 \npercent. This bill would put it at 66 percent.\n  The FAMILY Act is also a critical piece of legislation that moves our \nemployment economy into the 21st century. It actually recognizes that \nwomen are in the workplace, and they are in the workplace for real and \npermanently. It recognizes that when we have family-friendly policies, \nwe have a better workforce, we have a more economical workforce, and we \nhave an opportunity for employers to keep their businesses.\n  Recently, in North Dakota, Senator Gillibrand and I traveled around \nthe State talking about our paid leave policy in the FAMILY Act. We \nwere in a small business with less than 10 employees. The owner said he \nwould love to provide this benefit, but there was no way he could \neconomically afford it. If anything happened to one of his employees, \nthere would be no way he could give this benefit and also hire a \ntemporary worker. If he had the opportunity to share that risk broadly \nwith all small employers in the country, that shared risk would then \nmake this benefit available to him, and he could keep his employees. He \ncould keep those employees whom he trained, and he could make sure they \nwere better employees when they came back because they have that \nbenefit.\n  We need to understand this isn't just about the girls. This isn't \njust about the women of the Senate standing up. It is about a shared \nexperience we have all had. It is a shared experience of having to \nchoose between going home and taking care of your mother or actually \nfeeding your family. That is not much of a choice. When we look at why \npeople are angry in America today and why they feel like they are not \ngetting ahead, it is because they are falling further and further \nbehind because we aren't adopting 21st century policies, such as the \nFAMILY Act, equal pay for equal work, and recognizing the value of what \nwomen do.\n  I will close with a true story. When I was in college, between my \nfreshman and sophomore year, I was a nanny. It was very rewarding. I \nloved the kids, but it was hard work and it was 24/7. After working as \na nanny, I was a construction worker. Do you know why I worked \nconstruction? I was paid better and the work was not as difficult. I \nworked in a factory cleaning pipes, I worked on road construction, and \nI worked on rural water construction. Yes, that is hard work, and I was \na laborer in all of those jobs. It is hard work, but none of it is as \nhard as taking care of children, sick people, or the elderly. Yet in \nAmerica those jobs pay less.\n  It is time we evaluate what is happening in the workplace and what is \nhappening to America's families so we can adopt these family-friendly \npolicies. In fact, we need to listen to our constituents so we can have \nempathy for the challenges of American families. When that empathy \nfinds its way to public policy in the halls of Congress, people will \nonce again feel reconnected to their government.\n  I encourage everyone who hasn't taken a look at pay equity and hasn't \nyet taken a look at the FAMILY Act to\n\n[[Page S1909]]\n\nunderstand and appreciate what this can do for their constituents, what \nthis can do for the American workplace, and how we can help small \nbusinesses provide the services and benefits they need to provide so \nthey can compete in this very competitive workforce environment.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a December 16, 1997, New York Times article \nentitled ``Asia's Forest Fires, Scant Mercy for Orangutans'' described \nthe widespread illegal logging and slash and burn agriculture that \nposed an existential threat to the orangutan, one of the world's only \nfour species of great apes. It was after reading that article and \nspeaking to scientists who had devoted their lives to saving the \norangutan from extinction that I started a program in the foreign aid \nbudget to help protect their rapidly shrinking habitat.\n  Orangutans live in only two places on Earth, Borneo and Sumatra, and \nsince I first learned of the threats they are facing, the U.S. Agency \nfor International Development has provided millions of dollars to \nnongovernmental organizations in Indonesia to try to ensure their \nsurvival in the wild.\n  Important progress has been made. Back when the program started, it \nwas feared that the orangutan would be extinct in the wild within 15 \nyears if nothing was done. That has not happened, but their survival is \nfar from assured, as an article in the April 6, 2016, edition of the \nNew York Times entitled ``Adapting to Life as Orphans, Fires and \nCorporate Expansion Threaten Indonesia's Orangutans,'' describes. It \nreminded me of what had sparked my attention 20 years ago and how much \nmore there is yet to do.\n  Orangutans and humans share 97 percent of the same DNA. They are \nextraordinarily intelligent animals and physically far stronger than \nhumans, but today, like all species, their survival depends on humans.\n  The Indonesian Government has taken steps to change people's \nattitudes toward orangutans, so they are recognized as deserving of \nprotection, not as pests to be killed or captured and kept as pets. In \nmany ways, the orangutan is or could be Indonesia's equivalent of \nChina's Giant Pandas which are protected and admired around the world.\n  Among the biggest threat to orangutans today is the palm oil \nindustry, which is responsible for the destruction of huge areas of \ntropical forest where orangutans live. The fires used to clear the \nforest for the planting of palm oil trees has caused havoc on the \nenvironment and public health, contributing not only to the destruction \nof species but widespread drought.\n  The New York Times describes this increasingly precarious situation. \nI want to quote a few passages from that article:\n  ``The blazes destroyed more than 10,000 square miles of forests, \nblanketing large parts of Southeast Asia in a toxic haze for weeks, \nsickening hundreds of thousands of people and, according to the World \nBank, causing $16 billion in economic losses.''\n  ``They also killed at least nine orangutans, the endangered apes \nnative to the rain forests of Borneo and Sumatra. More than 100, \ntrapped by the loss of habitat, had to be relocated. Seven orphans, \nincluding five infants, were rescued and taken to rehabilitation \ncenters here.''\n  ``Indonesia has approved palm oil concessions on nearly 15 million \nacres of peatlands over the last decade; burning peat emits high levels \nof carbon dioxide and is devilishly hard to extinguish.''\n  ``Multinational palm oil companies, pulp and paper businesses, the \nplantations that sell to them, farmers and even day laborers all \ncontribute to the problem.''\n  ``While it is against Indonesian law to clear plantations by burning, \nenforcement is lax. The authorities have\n\n[[Page S1910]]\n\nopened criminal investigations against at least eight companies in \nconnection with last year's fires, but there has yet to be a single \nhigh-profile case to get to court.''\n  ``The government in Jakarta, the capital, has recently banned the \ndraining and clearing of all peatland for agricultural use, and it has \nordered provincial governments to adopt better fire suppression \nmethods. But it has not publicly responded to calls for better \nprevention, such as cracking down on slash-and-burn operations by large \npalm oil companies.''\n  It would be an unforgiveable tragedy if any species of great apes \nwere to become extinct in the wild. They are all endangered--gorillas, \nchimpanzees, bonobos, and orangutans. We need to do whatever is \nnecessary to build international support for protecting these animals, \nand to help countries like Indonesia enforce its laws to stop the \ndestruction of tropical forests on which these and so many other \nspecies depend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/12/senate-section/article/S1910-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL EQUAL PAY DAY\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today is Equal Pay Day, and I wish to \nspeak about the importance of ensuring women in this country are paid \nfairly.\n  April 12--102 days into the year--marks the day that women's wages \ncatch up to men's wages from the previous year. That is unacceptable. \nWe can do better.\n  Last week, the national women's soccer team filed a complaint with \nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The complaint states that \nwomen are paid just 40 percent of what men are paid--despite the fact \nthat our women's soccer team has long been one of the best in the \nworld. The team has won four of the last five Olympic Gold Medals and \nthree of the last seven World Cups. Women soccer players are even given \nsmaller per-diems when they travel. Women receive $50 per day while men \nreceive $62.50 per day. This shows the pervasiveness of wage \ndiscrimination in this country. The most successful women's soccer team \nin the world still earns just 40 cents for every dollar earned by men.\n  Next, I would like to turn to my home State. Women in California are \npaid just 84 cents for every dollar earned by men. While better than \nthe national average of 79 cents, California's wage gap totals nearly \n$40 billion each year in lost wages. That is $8,053 for every woman who \nworks full time.\n  This gap has a significant effect on the economic security of working \nfamilies--40 percent of women are the primary or sole breadwinners in \ntheir families. That means 40 percent of families depend on women's \nwages to pay the bills. Every dollar women lose to the wage gap makes a \ndifference.\n  Here are just a few examples of what the wage gap costs families: \n$8,000 is about 1 year's worth of groceries for a family of four, 4 \nmonths of mortgage and utility payments, or 6 months of rent.\n  And the wage gap is even bigger for African-American and Latino \nwomen. African-American women are paid just 63 cents. Hispanic women \nare paid just 43 cents. We can't allow this discrimination to continue.\n  Next, I would like to address a longstanding myth about the wage gap. \nSome say it exists only because women choose lower-paying professions \nthan men. For example, women are the vast majority of child care and \nhome health care workers. This is a myth.\n  Even when women perform the same job as men, with the same level of \neducation, the wage gap persists. For example, men who are nurses are \npaid $5,000 more than women, even though only 10 percent of nurses are \nmen.\n  We need to do more to close the wage gap, and I am very proud that \nCalifornia is leading the way. A landmark bill signed by Governor Jerry \nBrown last year protects women from retaliation if they ask how their \npay compares to their colleagues. This is important because secrecy \ncontributes to the wage gap. Women often don't know they are being paid \nsubstantially less than men.\n  The bill also requires employers to justify higher wages for men who \nperform the same jobs as women.\n  This law is a big step to improve the economic security of California \nfamilies.\n  While it is good news that States are addressing this issue, the wage \ngap is a national problem. It affects all American women, and the \nSenate must take action. The Paycheck Fairness Act is a good place to \nstart. I have long supported this bill, which is sponsored by Senator \nBarbara Mikulski.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act is similar to the new California law. It \nwould protect women from retaliation and require employers to justify \npaying women less than men for the same job.\n  The bill would also make it easier for women to take legal action \nunder the Equal Pay Act, including class action lawsuits.\n  Under current law, it is significantly easier to recoup lost wages if \nthey were denied through other discriminatory practices--like failure \nto pay overtime.\n  Lastly, the bill would create a training program to help women learn \nhow to negotiate their salaries.\n  This is a commonsense bill, and one that is long overdue.\n  In closing, President John F. Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act in \n1963. At the time, women made 59 cents for every dollar earned by men. \nIn 53 years, we have only closed the gap by 16 cents. At this rate, it \nwon't be eliminated until 2059.\n  Women and their families deserve better, and they can't afford to \nwait that long.\n  I strongly urge the Senate to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/12/senate-section/article/S1910-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         California Casualties\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 37th \nanniversary of the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act, TRA. Since \nthe TRA was signed into law in 1979, the U.S.-Taiwan bilateral \nrelationship has continued to expand, growing into an important \nfriendship as trading partners and allies. In 2015, Taiwan became the \nUnited States' ninth largest trading partner and our seventh largest \ndestination for agricultural exports. My home State of Arkansas has \nseen firsthand the benefit of these close commercial partnerships with \nTaiwan.\n  As a member of the Senate Taiwan Caucus, I support efforts to further \nstrengthen and deepen the bonds between the people of the United States \nand Taiwan, and I am not alone in these efforts. During the past 8 \nyears, 40 State legislative chambers have passed resolutions in support \nof U.S.-Taiwan trade and a close cultural relationship. As Taiwan \nPresident Ma Ying-jeou recently pointed out, U.S.-Taiwan relations have \nnever been better, and I look forward to working with President-elect \nTsai Ing-wen to ensure this continues to be the case.\n\n[[Page S1911]]\n\n  In celebrating the 37 years since the Taiwan Relations Act was signed \ninto law, I want to thank the Taiwanese people for their continued \nfriendship and support. It is my hope that the United States and Taiwan \nwill continue to work together to promote enduring peace, stability, \nand prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/12/senate-section/article/S1911-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           CONGRATULATING AIRBUS EMPLOYEES IN MOBILE, ALABAMA\n\n Mr. SESSIONS.

The Airbus A321 is an advanced airplane \nand constructing it is no easy task. There is no doubt that building \nthe A321 required immense dedication from the workers in the plant to \nthe suppliers across Alabama and the entire southeast.\n  I am pleased that Airbus continues to be a leading participant in the \nmanufacturing resurgence in Alabama.

JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. BLUNT (for himself and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 2782. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nthe participation of pediatric subspecialists in the National Health \nService Corps program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining Senator Blunt in \nintroducing the Ensuring Children's Access to Specialty Care Act.\n  According to the American Association of Child and Adolescent \nPsychiatry, there are currently only 8,300 child and adolescent \npsychiatrists, CAPs, in the United States--many of whom are not \npracticing full time--far short of the estimated need of over 30,000 \nCAPs. On average, patients wait almost 2 months to see a CAP, a \nstartling concern given that the incidence rates of mental illness and \nbehavioral disorders among children in the United States continue to \ngrow. Fifty percent of all lifetime cases of mental illness begin at \nage 14; 75 percent by age 24.\n  The National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program, NHSCLRP, \nwas created by Congress 40 years ago to help recruit and place trained \nindividuals in underserved communities to provide needed health care \nservices. Licensed health care providers may earn up to $50,000 toward \nstudent loans in exchange for a 2-year commitment at an NHSC-approved \nsite, within 2 years of completing their residency. Accepted \nparticipants may serve as primary care medical, dental, or mental-\nbehavioral health clinicians.\n  NHSCLRP provides critical relief to physicians who have completed \npediatrics or psychiatry residency training programs; however, \npediatric subspecialists, such as child and adolescent psychiatrists \nare effectively barred from participating due to the extra training \nthese physicians are required to take after completing their residency. \nThis extra training, which often results in increased student debt, \ntypically consisting of a fellowship, takes place in the 2-year window \nof eligibility for NHSCLRP. The creation of NHSCLRP preceded the \nexpansion of many pediatric subspecialties, not taking into account the \nextra years of training required for these physicians.\n  The Ensuring Children's Access to Specialty Care Act would correct \nthis loophole and allow pediatric subspecialists practicing in \nunderserved areas to benefit from the National Health Service Corps \nLoan Repayment Program. This bill would increase access to specialty \ncare for children and improve mental health parity for children served \nby NHSCLRP. Every child with a physical, mental, or behavioral health \ncondition should have access to pediatric health services.\n  Providers across the spectrum of care support this bipartisan \nlegislation including the American Association of Child and Adolescent \nPsychiatry, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Arthritis \nFoundation, Children's Hospital Association, March of Dimes, and the \nNational Alliance on Mental Illness. I look forward to working with \nthese and other stakeholders as well as Senator Blunt and our \ncolleagues to pass the Ensuring Children's Access to Specialty Care Act \nin order to help ensure children have access to the health care they \nneed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Mr. Peters, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. \n        Gillibrand, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Markey, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \n        Booker, Mr. Schatz, Mr. Merkley, and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 2784. A bill to ensure that Federal science agencies and \ninstitutions of higher education receiving Federal research and \ndevelopment funding are fully engaging the entire national talent pool, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, today April 12, is Equal Pay Day. Equal \nPay Day means women have to work more than 4 months longer to catch up \nto what, on average, men made in 2015. This significant pay disparity \nhas been going on for decades--generations--even though it is against \nthe law and\n\n[[Page S1914]]\n\nhas been against the law since the passage of the Equal Pay Act in \n1963.\n  The gender pay gap persists across all States and nearly all \noccupations. As we seek to build a 21st-century workforce, more than 73 \nmillion working women are at a disadvantage because of pay inequity and \nother barriers based on gender. While we have come a ways from the days \nof overt pay discrimination--such as in the 1930s, when the Federal \nGovernment, no less, required women to be paid 25 percent less than \ntheir male counterparts--the pay gap persists.\n  It is bad enough that women with equal education and experience get \npaid less, but it gets worse. A recent New York University study found \nthat when women begin to enter predominately male occupations, pay in \nthose fields decrease overall. For example, when women began to pursue \ncareers in design, wages dropped more than 30 percent. When they \nentered careers in biology, wages dropped 18 percent. The study also \nshowed the converse. When men entered fields previously dominated by \nwomen, such as computer programming, wages increased.\n  The bottom line is that these studies show that women's work is less \nvalued than men's work. This discrimination won't change because we \ndon't like it or because we hope it will. It will only begin to change \nif we take action. That is why I joined Senator Mikulski in continuing \nour call to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. This legislation would \nallow women to compare their salaries without fearing retaliation. How \ncan a woman find out if there is pay discrimination going on in her \nworkplace if she can't even find out what others are being paid? The \nbill would also require employers to prove that differences in pay for \nmen and women doing the same work are not related to gender.\n  While the gender pay gap affects all women, this morning I want to \nfocus on inequity in the fields of science, technology, engineering, \nand math--also known as STEM. Nationally, we need to promote STEM to \nremain competitive in the global economy. STEM careers are among the \nhighest paid positions and are some of the most sought after by \nemployers. In order to keep our country's historical leadership in STEM \nover the next decade, economists say we need to create a million more \nSTEM careers than we are currently creating. We will lose our \ncompetitive edge unless the number of women earning STEM degrees keeps \npace with their growing share of the population. But, of course, women \nin the STEM fields earn less than men. For example, on average, women \nengineers earn just 82 percent of what their male counterparts earn. \nFemale doctors' starting salaries are almost $20,000 less than their \nmale counterparts, even after accounting for factors such as specialty \nand location.\n  In addition to facing lower wages, women in STEM must often overcome \ninstitutional barriers, cultural stereotypes, and sexual harassment. \nThese barriers permeate every level of the STEM career pipeline. They \nstart as early as middle school and continue throughout one's career \nand lead to women and minorities disproportionately giving up interest \nin STEM careers.\n  At the University of Hawaii at Manoa, men earned more than five times \nthe number of computer science bachelor's degrees as women, and in the \nCollege of Engineering, men earned three times as many bachelor's \ndegrees. These kinds of numbers in STEM education are not unique to \nHawaii. Even when women overcome the odds and pursue careers in STEM \nfields, they continue to face gender biases that can affect the hiring, \npromotion, and career advancement for women in STEM. For instance, \nresearchers found that women in STEM encountered bias judgments of \ntheir competence and the ability to be hired. They also received less \nfaculty encouragement and financial rewards than identical male \ncounterparts when negotiating salary packages.\n  Studies show that when women in STEM decide to become mothers, they \nare perceived as less competent and less committed to hard work and are \noffered fewer jobs and lower salaries. In comparison, men are not \npenalized for being fathers. If that wasn't enough, women in STEM often \nexperience workplace harassment.\n  Recently, in the New York Times, University of Hawaii geobiology \nprofessor Hope Jahren shared an email that was sent to a former student \nfrom a male colleague who works in the same lab as the student. This \nemail read in part this:\n\n       All I know is that from the first day I talked to you, \n     there hadn't been a single day or hour when you weren't on my \n     mind. That's just the way things are and you're gonna have to \n     deal with me until one of us leaves.\n\n  In the age of social media, these kinds of totally inappropriate \nemails are all too common. According to Professor Jahren, this former \nstudent feels that she cannot rely on human resources because she heard \nstories from female colleagues about how sexual harassment happens \n``all the time'' in their organization and that no action is taken.\n  These stories are all too common. Again, merely condemning this kind \nof environment is not enough. Merely hoping that change will occur is \nnot enough. We can and must do more to even the playing field for women \nin STEM, and that is why I am introducing the STEM Opportunities Act \ntoday, so we can combat the systemic issues that can lead to women \nlosing interest in STEM and leaving STEM careers basically in droves.\n  The STEM Opportunities Act helps Federal science agencies and \ninstitutions of higher education identify and share best practices to \novercome barriers that can affect the inclusion of women and other \nunderrepresented groups in STEM. The STEM Opportunities Act also allows \nuniversities and nonprofits to receive competitive grants and \nrecognition for mentoring women and minorities in STEM fields. \nMentoring programs such as the Maui Economic Development Board's Women \nin Technology Program and the Native Hawaiian Science and Engineering \nMentorship Program at the University of Hawaii have seen tremendous \nsuccess.\n  The Women in Technology Program supports those like Deanna Garcia, \nwho was first introduced to STEM through Women in Technology and is now \na mentor to girls who want to follow in her footsteps.\n  Deanna said:\n\n       Women in Technology gave me the skills, confidence, and \n     support I needed. Because of their networking and strong ties \n     within the community, I was not only able to find an \n     internship, but a career in IT. Because of the Women in \n     Technology program, I can also pay it forward to current \n     students and show them during career days or tours I am a \n     product of the program and hope to inspire them to pursue a \n     path in STEM just like I did.\n\n  Deanna's story is just one of many successes that programs like Women \nin Technology have.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the testimonials on \nthe success of existing STEM programs printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Senator Mazie K. Hirono--April 12, 2016\n\n Extension of Remarks: Testimonials From Hawaii STEM Mentoring Programs\n\n\n      maui economic development board women in technology program\n\n    Deanna Garcia, TMDS-MSAT Analysis Team Manager, Akimeka LLC, A \n                     Subsidiary of VSE Corporation\n\n       ``Technology and Engineering are known to be male dominated \n     fields, however, the Women in Technology program empowered me \n     to succeed in an IT Career. I got my start almost fifteen \n     years ago because of the WIT program. They gave me the \n     skills, confidence, and support I needed and because of their \n     networking and strong ties within the community, I was not \n     only able to find an internship, then job, but a career in \n     IT. They also lead by example and have strong, driven, \n     impactful women leading the way. Because of the WIT program, \n     I can also pay it forward to current students and show them \n     during career days or tours I'm a product of the program and \n     hope to inspire them to pursue a path in STEM, just like I \n     did.''\n\n            Kawai Hall, Integrity Applications Incorporated\n\n       ``Since there are fewer women with technology-related \n     degrees, it is harder for work industries to recruit women in \n     these fields. I think Women In Technology is an amazing \n     project to help bring awareness of STEM-related work \n     opportunities to girls and women, especially here in Hawaii \n     where it is prime. Our company is made of mostly men but I \n     haven't felt the effect of gender in my workplace. Everyone \n     works greatly as a team and helps each other advance in \n     learning. But it would be great to have more females added to \n     our workplace.''\n\n[[Page S1915]]\n\n  \n\n\n                    Audrey Cabrera, Brown & Caldwell\n\n       ``After having my second child I've had a hard time finding \n     my balance and feeling like I am fulfilling my roles as \n     employee, mother, and wife. Although we have come so far in \n     terms of women in the professional workforce and specifically \n     STEM careers, the statistics remain that a large portion of \n     women migrate out of their STEM career in their 30's, when \n     they are growing their families. My company is great, with \n     fair pay and good benefits, but I feel that there are some \n     double standards/expectations that probably aren't specific \n     to my company, but in our society in general.''\n\nKimberly Vaituulala, Maui Electric Company (MECO) mentor for Introduce \n                    a Girl to Engineering Day (IGED)\n\n       ``Society has taught young girls to care for their baby \n     dolls or encouraged to play ``house'' with their Barbie \n     dolls. Meanwhile boys are building structures with Legos and \n     playing outside, messing around with their bikes to see what \n     they can do to make it go faster or make it look and sound \n     cooler as they ride by. This beginning transitions into \n     college where the number of boys dominate science and math \n     courses. For me, the significance of IGED is to show these \n     young ladies that engineering/technology IS cool and it's not \n     just for boys. IGED gives these ladies an opportunity to see \n     real people working in STEM careers, and broadens the horizon \n     for these up and coming females. Igniting a spark of interest \n     in just one of the 15 girls in the group makes this effort \n     completely worth it. . . .\n       ``Women are physiologically and psychologically different \n     from men. In order to solve the engineering problems of this \n     world, the men cannot do it alone. It is vitally important \n     for women (of all ages) to be exposed to and consider a \n     career in engineering. The different perspective that women \n     can bring to forth might be the key to making cold fusion a \n     reality one day.\n       ``In college I was one of three girls in my electrical \n     engineering classes. But I know more girls are getting \n     involved in STEM related fields and careers, and it can be \n     attributed to programs like IGED. Sometimes girls need that \n     extra push. Someone to tell them, ``Go! You can do it too!'' \n     And as long as we can sustain STEM programs like IGED, this \n     trend for girls will continue on upward.''\n\n  Native Hawaiian Science & Engineering Mentorship Program (NHSEMP), \n       University of Hawaii at Manoa Kaiho'olulu Rickard, mentee\n\n       ``[NHSEMP] helped me focus on my studies and set goals. \n     They got me started with a mentor who's been helping me out \n     with choosing good projects to work on . . . I was introduced \n     to [researcher] Lloyd French, and after that I really began \n     to get involved in projects like MMIC, or Monolithic \n     Microwave Integrated Circuit, and JPL, which is the NASA Jet \n     Propulsion Laboratory. . . .\n       ``I've really gotten involved in what I'm doing here. My \n     freshman year, my grades weren't so good. I had about a 2.0 \n     GPA then. So, after I joined the program, I was given my own \n     small office, and working with a mentor, basically helped me \n     pull my GPA up to a 3.0 in two semesters.''\n\n  Ms. HIRONO.

Res. 418\n\n       Whereas women's leadership in the world is critical to \n     shaping and addressing world events and decreasing global \n     instability;\n       Whereas women leaders play an integral role in fighting \n     against transnational organized crime, human trafficking, and \n     violence against women, including honor killings, and female \n     genital mutilation;\n       Whereas changing the trajectory of these dynamics requires \n     empowering women leaders to advance economic opportunity and \n     increase political and public leadership;\n       Whereas women leaders have selflessly sacrificed, and in \n     some cases placed their lives at risk, to advance causes that \n     will better their communities, their nations, and the world;\n       Whereas Hafsat Abiola of Nigeria, founder of the Kudirat \n     Initiative for Democracy, campaigns to end violence against \n     women, trains young female leaders, and works to increase \n     civic participation;\n       Whereas Khanim Latif of Iraq, the Director of Asuda, places \n     her life at risk to provide safe haven to victims of sexual \n     and gender-based violence, and fights threats of honor \n     killings and female genital cutting;\n       Whereas Yoani Sanchez of Cuba, founder of ``Generacion Y'', \n     created a blog that captures daily life in Cuba as an effort \n     to encourage political change and increase public awareness \n     and engagement;\n       Whereas Akanksha Hazari of India fights to deliver basic \n     necessities such as clean water and electricity to \n     impoverished communities and to empower the underserved in \n     India; and\n       Whereas each of these leaders serves as a role model and an \n     inspiration to help change the lives of others: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes Hafsat Abiola, Khanim Latif, Yoani Sanchez, \n     and Akanksha Hazari for their selflessness and dedication to \n     their respective causes; and\n       (2) commends their efforts to advance economic opportunity, \n     increase political and public leadership, combat violence \n     against women, and empower women to address global \n     instability.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to honor and congratulate the \nVital Voices Global Partnership and the 2016 Vital Voices Award \nrecipients: Hafsat Abiola, Khanim Latif, Yoani Sanchez, and Akanksha \nHazari.\n  The Vital Voices Global Partnership identifies, invests in, and \nbrings visibility to extraordinary women around the world by unleashing \ntheir leadership potential to transform lives and accelerate peace and \nprosperity. Vital Voices equips such leaders with the management, \nbusiness development, marketing, and communications skills required to \nexpand their enterprises, to provide for their families, and create \njobs in their communities. Vital Voices seeks to empower these women \nleaders to create a better world for us all.\n  The Vital Voices Global Partnership has trained and mentored over \n14,000 women in 144 countries over the last 15 years, in addition to \nthis year's award recipients Hafsat Abiola of Nigeria, founder of the \nKudirat Initiative for Democracy, campaigns to end violence against \nwomen, trains young female leaders, and works to increase civic \nparticipation. Khanim Latif of Iraq, the Director of Asuda, places her \nlife at risk to provide safe haven to victims of sexual and gender-\nbased violence, and fights threats of honor killings and female genital \ncutting. Yoani Sanchez of Cuba, founder of ``Generacion Y'', created a \nblog that captures daily life in Cuba in an effort to encourage \npolitical change and increase public awareness and engagement; and \nAkanksha Hazari of India fights to deliver basic necessities such as \nclean water and electricity to impoverished communities and to empower \nthe underserved in India.\n  Such leaders, supported by the Vital Voices Global Partnership Fund, \nand through their selfless efforts and advocacy, continue to advance \nsocial justice, support democracy, and strengthen the rule of law \nacross the globe.\n  With this in mind, I am pleased to offer this resolution with Senator \nFeinstein.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of a resolution, \nsubmitted by Senator Collins, to honor four women recently recognized \nby the Vital Voices Global Partnership.\n  This is a global organization that identifies, supports, and \nhighlights women around the world who exhibit leadership to transform \ntheir communities.\n  I am pleased to sponsor this resolution with Senator Collins.\n  The four women honored by this resolution are leaders who have made a \ntrue difference in their countries in the face of adversity.\n  Hafsat Abiola of Nigeria founded the Kudirat Initiative for Democracy \nto end violence against women in Nigeria and remove barriers for the \ncivic participation of women. She has been actively working on gender \nequality and women's leadership in Nigeria since she was a teenager, \nand continues to advance women's rights.\n  Khanim Latif of Iraq is the Director of Asuda, which works to combat \nsexual and gender-based violence in Iraq. She has worked on gender-\nbased violence issues in Iraq for over 15 years,\n\n[[Page S1916]]\n\nand has helped provide refuge to women subjected to horrific violence \nin her country, including to those who have been subjected to ISIL's \nviolent campaign against the region's Yazidi population.\n  Yoani Sanchez of Cuba founded ``Generacion Y,'' a platform to capture \ndaily life in Cuba as an effort to encourage political change. It \nstemmed from her personal experiences growing up in Cuba, and the \nexperiences of her family.\n  Akanksha Hazari of India works to empower impoverished, rural \ncommunities in India. She has done this by pioneering a loyalty \nprogram--through mobile phones--to provide social goods such as clean \nwater to rural customers in India.\n  These women were recognized by Vital Voices because they have made \nsignificant strides to better the communities in which they live, and \nthey continue to do so.\n  The resolution, submitted by Senator Collins and myself, further \nrecognizes their contributions, and I hope that we can all draw \ninspiration from their leadership.\n  I congratulate these women, and look forward to hearing about their \ncontinued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/12/senate-section/article/S1916-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1916-S1917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3640.

NEXTGEN ANNUAL PERFORMANCE GOALS.\n\n       (a) Annual Performance Goals.--Section 214 of the FAA \n     Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-95; 49 \n     U.S.C. 40101 note) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsection (d) as subsection (e); and\n       (2) by inserting after subsection (c) the following:\n       ``(d) Annual Performance Goals.--The Administrator shall \n     establish annual NextGen performance goals for each of the \n     performance metrics set forth in subsection (a) to meet the \n     performance metric baselines identified under subsection (b). \n     Such goals shall be consistent with the annual performance \n     objectives established by the senior policy committee \n     (commonly known as the `NextGen Advisory Committee') \n     established under section 710 of the Vision 100--Century of \n     Aviation Reauthorization Act (Public Law 108-176; 49 U.S.C. \n     40101 note).''.\n       (b) NextGen Metrics Report.--Section 710(e)(2) of the \n     Vision 100--Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act (Public \n     Law 108-176; 49 U.S.C. 40101 note) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (D), by striking ``; and'' and \n     inserting a semicolon;\n       (2) in subparagraph (E), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(F) a description of the progress made in meeting the \n     annual NextGen performance goals relative to the performance \n     metrics established under section 214 of the FAA \n     Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-95; 49 \n     U.S.C. 40101 note).''.\n       (c) Chief NextGen Officer.--Section 106(s)(3) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (2)(B), by adding at the end the \n     following: ``In evaluating the performance of the Chief \n     NextGen Officer for the purpose of awarding a bonus under \n     this subparagraph, the Administrator shall consider the \n     progress toward meeting the NextGen performance goals \n     established pursuant to section 214(d) of the FAA \n     Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-95; 49 \n     U.S.C. 40101 note).''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (3), by adding at the end the following: \n     ``The annual performance goals set forth in the agreement \n     shall include quantifiable NextGen airspace performance \n     objectives regarding efficiency, productivity, capacity, and \n     safety, which shall be established by the senior policy \n     committee (commonly known as the `NextGen Advisory \n     Committee') established under section 710 of the Vision 100--\n     Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act (Public Law 108-176; \n     49 U.S.C. 40101 note).''.\n\n     SEC. 4104. FACILITY OUTAGE CONTINGENCY PLANS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On September 26, 2014, an Administration contract \n     employee deliberately started a fire that destroyed critical \n     equipment at the Administration's Chicago Air Route Traffic \n     Control Center (referred to in this section as the ``Chicago \n     Center'') in Aurora, Illinois.\n       (2) As a result of the damage, Chicago Center was unable to \n     control air traffic for more than 2 weeks, thousands of \n     flights were delayed or cancelled into and out of O'Hare \n     International Airport and Midway Airport in Chicago, and \n     aviation stakeholders and airlines reportedly lost over \n     $350,000,000.\n       (3) According to the Office of the Inspector General of the \n     Department of Transportation, the fire at Chicago Center \n     demonstrated that the Administration's contingency plans for \n     the Chicago Center and the airspace it controls do not ensure \n     redundancy and resiliency for sustained operations.\n       (4) Further, the Inspector General found that Chicago \n     Center incident highlighted the limited flexibility and lack \n     of resiliency in critical elements of the Administration's \n     current air traffic control infrastructure, including limited \n     communication capacity and the inability to easily transfer \n     control of airspace and flight plans.\n       (b) Comprehensive Contingency Plan.--Not later than 180 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Administrator shall update the Administration's comprehensive \n     contingency plan to address potential air traffic facility \n     outages that could have a major impact on operation of the \n     national airspace system.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 60 days after the date the plan \n     is updated under subsection (b), the Administrator shall \n     submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a report on \n     the update, including any recommendations for ensuring air \n     traffic facility outages do not have a major impact on \n     operation of the national airspace system.\n\n     SEC. 4105. ADS-B MANDATE ASSESSMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Administration's ADS-B program is expected to be \n     the centerpiece of the NextGen effort at the Administration, \n     but the satellite-based system faces uncertainty and \n     controversy.\n       (2) In May 2010, the Administration published a final rule \n     that mandated airspace users be equipped with ADS-B Out \n     avionics by January 1, 2020.\n       (3) Subsequently, in April 2015, the Administration \n     announced completion of the ADS-B ground-based radio \n     infrastructure. However, the ADS-B program faces considerable \n     uncertainty and unanswered questions about whether or not the \n     2020 mandate is still meaningful.\n       (4) In 2014, the Office of the Inspector General found that \n     while ADS-B is providing benefits where radar is limited or \n     nonexistent in places such as the Gulf of Mexico, the system \n     is providing only limited initial services to pilots and air \n     traffic controllers in domestic airspace.\n       (5) The Office of the Inspector General also found, in \n     2014, that all elements of the system, such as avionics, the \n     ground infrastructure, and controller automation systems, had \n     not yet been tested in combination to determine if the \n     overall system can be used in congested airspace and perform \n     as well as existing radar, much less allow aircraft to fly \n     closer together. This is referred to as ``end-to-end \n     testing.''\n\n[[Page S1969]]\n\n       (6) When this report was issued, commercial and general \n     aviation stakeholders voiced serious concerns that equipping \n     with new avionics for the 2020 mandate will be difficult due \n     to the cost and limited availability of avionics, and \n     capacity of certified repair stations to install avionics.\n       (b) Assessment.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Inspector General of the \n     Department of Transportation shall assess--\n       (1) Administration and industry readiness to meet the ADS-B \n     mandate by 2020;\n       (2) changes to ADS-B program since May 2010; and\n       (3) additional options to comply with the mandate and \n     consequences, both for individual system users and for the \n     overall safety and efficiency of the national airspace \n     system, for noncompliance.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 60 days after the date the \n     assessment under subsection (b) is complete, the Inspector \n     General of the Department of Transportation shall submit to \n     the appropriate committees of Congress a report on the \n     progress made toward meeting the ADS-B mandate by 2020, \n     including any recommendations of the Inspector General to \n     carry out such mandate.\n\n     SEC. 4106. NEXTGEN INTEROPERABILITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--To implement a more effective \n     international strategy for achieving NextGen interoperability \n     with foreign countries, the Administrator shall take the \n     following actions:\n       (1) Conduct a gap analysis to identify potential risks to \n     NextGen interoperability with other Air Navigation Service \n     Providers and establish a schedule for periodically \n     reevaluating such risks.\n       (2) Develop a plan that identifies and documents actions \n     the Administrator will undertake to mitigate such risks, \n     using information from the gap analysis as a basis for making \n     management decisions about how to allocate resources for such \n     actions.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress a report on the analysis \n     conducted under paragraph (1) of subsection (a) and on the \n     actions the Administrator has taken under paragraph (2) of \n     such subsection.\n\n     SEC. 4107. NEXTGEN TRANSITION MANAGEMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Administrator shall--\n       (1) identify and analyze technical and operational maturity \n     gaps in NextGen transition and implementation plans; and\n       (2) develop a plan to mitigate the gaps identified in \n     paragraph (1).\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress a report on the actions \n     taken to carry out the plan required by subsection (a)(2).\n\n     SEC. 4108.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Airport Security \n     Enhancement and Oversight Act''.\n\n     SEC. 6102. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A number of recent airport security breaches in the \n     United States have involved the use of Secure Identification \n     Display Area (referred to in this section as ``SIDA'') \n     badges, the credentials used by airport and airline workers \n     to access the secure areas of an airport.\n       (2) In December 2014, a Delta ramp agent at Hartsfield-\n     Jackson Atlanta International Airport was charged with using \n     his SIDA badge to bypass airport security checkpoints and \n     facilitate an interstate gun smuggling operation over a \n     number of months via commercial aircraft.\n       (3) In January 2015, an Atlanta-based Aviation Safety \n     Inspector of the Federal Aviation Administration used his \n     SIDA badge to bypass airport security checkpoints and \n     transport a firearm in his carry-on luggage.\n       (4) In February 2015, a local news investigation found that \n     over 1,000 SIDA badges at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta \n     International Airport were lost or missing.\n       (5) In March 2015, and again in May 2015, Transportation \n     Security Administration contractors were indicted for \n     participating in a drug smuggling ring using luggage passed \n     through the secure area of the San Francisco International \n     Airport.\n       (6) The Administration has indicated that it does not \n     maintain a list of lost or missing SIDA badges, and instead \n     relies on airport operators to track airport worker \n     credentials.\n       (7) The Administration rarely uses its enforcement \n     authority to fine airport operators that reach a certain \n     threshold of missing SIDA badges.\n       (8) In April 2015, the Aviation Security Advisory Committee \n     issued 28 recommendations for improvements to airport access \n     control.\n       (9) In June 2015, the Inspector General of the Department \n     of Homeland Security reported that the Administration did not \n     have all relevant information regarding 73 airport workers \n     who had records in United States intelligence-related \n     databases because the Administration was not authorized to \n     receive all terrorism-related information under current \n     interagency watchlisting policy.\n       (10) The Inspector General also found that the \n     Administration did not have appropriate\n\n[[Page S1976]]\n\n     checks in place to reject incomplete or inaccurate airport \n     worker employment investigations, including criminal history \n     record checks and work authorization verifications, and had \n     limited oversight over the airport operators that the \n     Administration relies on to perform criminal history and work \n     authorization checks for airport workers.\n       (11) There is growing concern about the potential insider \n     threat at airports in light of recent terrorist activities.\n\n     SEC. 6103.
