Mr. President, at noon today the Senate will vote on \npassage of H.R. 203, the bipartisan veterans suicide prevention bill. \nFollowing the recess for the weekly party lunches, we will vote on \ncloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. 240, a bill to fund the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n\n\n         Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention For American Veterans Act\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, following last week's bipartisan vote \nfor American jobs, the new Republican Congress will vote to send the \nPresident another bipartisan bill today. It is legislation that already \npassed the House of Representatives unanimously, the Clay Hunt Suicide \nPrevention for American Veterans Act.\n  This bill would offer critical support to the men and women who have \nalready sacrificed so much for all of us. It would extend a helping \nhand to heroes when they need it. It is just the kind of commonsense \nbipartisan action the new Congress can deliver for the American people.\n  Let me recognize once more the great work of Senators Isakson and \nMcCain on this bill. I hope our colleagues across the aisle will help \nus pass this legislation today with strong bipartisan support.\n\n\n                Department Of Homeland Security Funding\n\n  Mr. President, when the new Senate convened, I stated my view that \ndemocracy is not about what you can get away with, it is about what can \nbe achieved together. Exercising raw power is easier, no question about \nthat. Changing the rules of democracy when they do not suit you can be \npretty tempting to politicians. But we are hoping our colleagues in the \nDemocratic Party will agree that elected leaders can be bigger than \nthat. We are hoping Democrats will agree that it is on Presidents to \nconsider the long-term consequences of partisan power grabs and to rise \nabove the kinds of partisan temptations that tend to emerge.\n  The choices Democrats make on the legislation before us will say a \nlot about whether there are still two serious political parties in our \ncountry, whether there are still two parties interested in governing \nwithin a constitutional framework.\n  At its core, the debate is about whether Democrats think Presidents \nof either party should have the power to simply do what they want. \nWhile this is about more than just President Obama, it is also true \nthat President Obama has repeatedly reached beyond his authority.\n\n[[Page S708]]\n\n  Some of the President's overreach has been so out of bounds that the \nSupreme Court struck it down unanimously. Whether on the left, right, \nor center, every last Justice--even those appointed by the President--\nrebuked him for his overreach on recess appointments last June. Then \njust a couple of months ago the President rebuked himself by taking \nactions he had previously said many times that he lacked the legal \nauthority to take. When he tried to suggest otherwise, a fact-checker \nblasted the spin and clarified that the President had been asked \nspecifically about just the sorts of actions he was contemplating.\n  Last year President Obama declared that executive action was ``not an \noption'' because it would mean ``ignoring the law.'' ``There is a path \nto get this done,'' the President said, ``and that is through \nCongress.'' That was his view then. What changed? What changed?\n  The truth is, the latest power grab is not really about immigration \nreform. It is about making an already broken system even more broken. \nIt is about imposing even more unfairness on immigrants who have \nalready worked so hard and played by the rules. It is hard to \nunderstand why the President would want to impose additional unfairness \non immigrants like these who just want to live their own American \ndream.\n  The question is, Do Democrats agree with the President? Well, we will \nsoon find out. We will also find out if Democrats agree with President \nObama who ignores the law when it suits him or if they agree with \nPresident Obama who made this statement just a few years ago in Miami. \nHere is what he said in Miami just a couple of years ago.\n  The President:\n\n       Democracy is hard, but it's right. [And] changing our laws \n     means doing the hard work of changing minds and changing \n     votes one by one.\n\n  That is the President a couple of years ago.\n  So I am calling on Democrats to vote with us now to fund the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. I am calling on Democrats to join us \nand stand up for core democratic principles such as the rule of law and \nseparation of powers.\n\n\n                   Recognition Of The Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n\n\n                        Loretta Lynch Nomination\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the record held by the Republicans dealing \nwith Cabinet officers is not one they should be proud of. For example, \nduring a time of the War on Terror, the Republicans held up the Defense \nDepartment's nominee for a historically long time. Never in the past \nhad someone who was to be Defense Secretary been held up by being \nblocked from moving forward.\n  You would think that would be a lesson learned and that would be \nenough, but no, that is not enough. Loretta Lynch, for example, who was \nnominated by the President to be Attorney General, has been held up for \nlonger than any nominee for Attorney General in the last 30 or 40 \nyears. It is hard to comprehend that. For example, Senator Lindsey \nGraham said she was ``a solid choice.'' Senator Orrin Hatch has \nindicated that he supports her nomination. Why, then, do we have to \nkeep waiting and waiting? We are approaching 3 months that this good \nwoman has been held up from a job for which she has been nominated.\n  I would hope the Republican leadership would move this out of the \nSenate as quickly as possible.\n\n\n                Department Of Homeland Security Funding\n\n  Mr. President, I am not going to dwell very long on the matter that \nis before this body, and we will vote at 2:30. We have here with us the \nleading Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, and she will talk \nabout homeland security. We have here on the floor today the assistant \nDemocratic leader, who was one of the authors of a bill which we \nbrought to the floor and which was debated for a long time and passed \noverwhelmingly before it was blocked by the Republicans.\n  We have before us a very interesting proposition. We have had \nterrorist attacks in Canada, in Australia, all over the European Union, \nincluding France and Belgium. Those countries, rather than talking \nabout not funding homeland security, are talking about funding it with \nmore money--but not the Senate led by the Republicans. They are doing \neverything within their power to make sure Homeland Security is held \nhostage to matters that do not really relate to homeland security.\n  If my Republican colleagues do not like something President Obama has \ndone dealing with Presidential Executive orders--which, by the way, he \nhas done less than any President in modern times--bring it up on the \nSenate floor and let's have a debate on that. Let's not do what \nhappened previously and shut down the government. That is the direction \nwe are headed. That is really too bad.\n\n\n                         The President's Budget\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, the President has outlined a good proposal \nfor a budget. It is nothing that is new. It is simply building upon the \nbudget that was so successfully negotiated by Senator Murray and \nCongressman Ryan. That is what this budget he proposed is all about. It \nwould seem to me, rather than the Republicans running out, as soon as \nhe said a word, saying no, no, no, let's look at areas where we can \ncompromise. Don't we need something done with the infrastructure of \nthis country? The answer is obviously yes. Why can't we work something \nout in that regard? So I would hope that rather than saying no to \neverything the President does, that we should understand that our role, \nincluding Republican Senators, is to legislate. Legislation is the art \nof compromise.\n\n\n                       Reservation Of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to call for a vote \nagainst the motion to proceed to H.R. 240, the House Homeland Security \nfunding bill.\n  Now, this is a shock--for Senator Barbara Mikulski to call for a vote \nagainst a motion to proceed on an appropriations bill. For the past 2 \nyears, I have been on the floor speaking out, pounding the table, \nsaying: Let's bring up bills; let's bring them up one at a time.\n  So now why am I on the floor asking for a vote against the motion to \nproceed on the Department of Homeland Security funding bill?\n  Well, I can tell us it is because the Homeland Security bill has two \nparts. One is an essential bill, the funding for the Department of \nHomeland Security--which I hope we get to and we get to as \nexpeditiously as possible. But they have another component to it--\npoison pill riders--five riders from the House of Representatives \ndesigned to attack the President on immigration.\n  These riders, if passed, will guarantee the President will veto the \nbill, and we are going to be back to parliamentary ping-pong. We \nposture and pomp and vote. Send it to the President; he will veto it. \nWe will get into more posturing, pomp, and partisan points. For what? \nWe need to fund the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Yes, we do need to deal with immigration, but the Senate passed an \nimmigration bill. Rather than attacking the President, let's attack the \nproblems from immigration. Let's deal with the DREAMers. Let's deal \nwith getting people into the sunshine.\n  This institution, both the House and the Senate under Republican \ncontrol, criticized the President for not acting.\n\n[[Page S709]]\n\n  Where is leadership? Where is leadership? When the President acts, as \nhe did on immigration, they want to punish him by adding poison pill \nriders to an essential--essential--national security bill.\n  Colleagues on the other side say: Why are you seeking to delay the \nfunding bill?\n  I am not seeking to delay the funding bill. I am asking that we put \nin a clean bill and just vote on the money part.\n  All of my Democratic colleagues and I wrote a letter to Senator \nMcConnell asking him to schedule a vote on a clean Homeland Security \nbill. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the ranking member on the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Homeland Security, and I put in a clean bill the other \nday.\n  We could do it now. We could pass that funding today and reserve the \ndebate on immigration for another day, calling upon the House to do \ntheir job. But right now I want all of the wonderful men and women who \nwork at the Department of Homeland Security to be paid for the work \nthey do.\n  We need them. We need them in cyber security. We need them searching \nout the lone-wolf attacks. Weren't we proud of the brilliant job our \nHomeland Security leadership provided to protect all the people who so \nenjoyed the Super Bowl?\n  We have a lot of work to do. In my own home State we are dependent on \nthe Coast Guard, but so is every other State with a coastal area, \nprotecting us in terms of search and rescue, against drug dealers.\n  What about our Border Patrol, which is there every single day in \ndangerous circumstances; don't they deserve our respect, the resources \nthey need, and the pay they have earned?\n  Let's get with the program. The program is to protect America, not to \nprotect a political party and its partisan points on immigration. Our \njob is to protect the homeland security of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I am adamant about this. We are now 4 months into the fiscal year. We \ncould be heading for--I hope not--another continuing resolution. We \nneed to stand for America.\n  Americans are in danger at home and abroad. I know my other \ncolleagues are waiting to speak. But we do face terrorist threats. We \ndo face cyber criminals. The Secret Service is reforming itself. We \nhave fence jumpers at the White House, we have drones over the White \nHouse, and yet we are going to dicker, dicker, dicker, and dicker \nagainst five poison pill amendments.\n  Let's clean this up and vote against the motion to proceed today. \nLet's come back with the clean bill that Senator Shaheen and I \nintroduced.\n  The money has been agreed upon on both sides of the aisle and both \nsides of the dome in the closing hours of the fiscal year 2015 debate. \nWorking hand-in-hand with Senator Dan Coats we fashioned a bill in the \nSenate, and we have it agreed to over in the House. So we could do our \njob so that Homeland Security can do their job.\n  Defeat this ill-conceived motion to proceed. Let's proceed to a clean \nbill. Let's protect America and then get on with other important \ndebates.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to follow my leader on the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Mikulski. She and I know what it was \nlike on 9/11/2001 in this building. We were looking out the window down \nthe Mall and saw black smoke billowing from the Pentagon. We didn't \nknow what happened, but we were told immediately to evacuate this U.S. \nCapitol Building.\n  I had never heard those words before. We raced out of the building, \nstanding on the lawn outside, unaware of exactly what happened.\n  We knew about the tragedy in New York. We didn't know what was next. \nWe stood there in our bewilderment, thinking what could we do. Well, \nwhat we did was protect ourselves and our Nation and come together. I \nremember our choral director, when we came together, Senator Mikulski \nof Maryland, led us in singing ``God Bless America'' that evening on \nthe steps of the Capitol.\n  There was a feeling of bipartisanship brought about by the tragedy of \nthat moment and the belief that we had to rise above party to do \nsomething and keep America safe.\n  We did. I am proud of that, and I am proud of the role the Senator \nfrom Maryland played in that.\n  One of the aspects that went way beyond singing was to roll up our \nsleeves and decide how to make government work more effectively. We had \ntwo outstanding leaders in that effort: Senator Lieberman of \nConnecticut and Senator Collins of Maine. The ranking Republican and \nDemocratic chair of that committee came together and crafted a bill \nliterally to create a new department in our government, the Department \nof Homeland Security, that brought together, I believe, 22 different \nagencies under one roof so that we could effectively coordinate keeping \nAmerica safe.\n  We agreed on a bipartisan basis and created that Department, and that \nDepartment has really served us well. The current Secretary, Jeh \nJohnson, is an outstanding individual. They have so many areas of \nresponsibility. Other agencies play an important role--defense, \nintelligence, transportation--but the Department of Homeland Security \nis the coordinating department for America's safety against terrorism.\n  That is why it is incredible to me that we have refused to provide \nthe funds the Department of Homeland Security needs to keep America \nsafe.\n  The Republicans insisted in December, in the House of \nRepresentatives, they would not pass the appropriations bill for one \ndepartment, the Department of Homeland Security, because they wanted to \nenter into a debate with the President over immigration policy. There \nis nothing wrong with a debate over immigration policy. In fact, the \nRepublicans, now in the majority control of the House and Senate, could \nhave started that debate weeks ago. They didn't.\n  Instead, they attached five riders to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill, and they said: We will not allow that \nDepartment to be properly funded unless the President accepts these \nfive immigration riders.\n  I wish to speak to one of those riders because it really tells the \nstory of the feelings of many on the Republican side when it comes to \nimmigration.\n  Fourteen years ago I introduced the DREAM Act. The DREAM Act is very \nbasic. If you were brought to America as an infant, a toddler, a child \nby your parents, and you were undocumented in America, we believe you \nstill deserve a chance.\n  As children, they didn't vote on the family decision to come to \nAmerica, but their lives have been changed because of that decision. \nThey have lived in America--many of these young people--undocumented, \ngrowing up, going to school, doing everything every child around them \ndid, and then finally knowing they didn't have the necessary legal \ndocumentation to stay in this country.\n  Well, I introduced the DREAM Act and said for those kids--who should \nnot be held responsible for any wrongdoing by their parents--give them \na chance. Give them a chance if they have led a good life, if they have \ngraduated from high school, if they aspire to serve in our military or \ngo on to college. Give them a chance to be legal in America.\n  The DREAM Act we have never enacted into law despite 14 years of \neffort. But the President stepped in 2\\1/2\\ years ago and said by \nExecutive order: We will not deport the DREAMers if there is no \nevidence of criminal wrongdoing, if they have completed high school, if \nthey came here as infants, toddlers, and children. We will give them a \nchance to stay in America, to work in America, and to go to school in \nAmerica.\n  We estimate 2 million young people would qualify, and 600,000 have \ngone through the process. They have paid the filing fee, gone through \nthe process, have the protection of what we call DACA, and now don't \nhave to fear deportation. Who are these young people? They, frankly, \nare some of the most inspiring stories I have met as a Member of the \nSenate.\n  The Republicans in the House of Representatives have said they want \nto deport the DREAMers. That is right. They will not allow the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to renew their protection from \ndeportation, and they won't allow any others to apply for DACA \nprotection.\n  That means 600,000 young people currently protected by DACA would be\n\n[[Page S710]]\n\nfacing deportation and another 1.5 million will be facing it as well.\n  Now, that is the answer of the Republican Party when it comes to \nimmigration. Take these children--who came here as children to America, \nwho have shown they want to be part of America's future--and deport \nthem. Get rid of them.\n  From the Republican point of view in the House of Representatives, we \nhave no use for these young people.\n  I wish to introduce one of these young people. This is Aaima Sayed. \nAaima Sayed was brought to the United States from Pakistan. When she \nwas 3 years old her parents brought her to this country. She grew up in \nChicago like every other typical American kid. Aaima says:\n\n       I have no memories but those of living in the United \n     States; I am an American in every way, except on paper.\n\n  Aaima was an outstanding student. She graduated in the top 10 percent \nof her high school class, where she was secretary of the Spanish club, \nthe math team, and a member of the National Society of High School \nScholars. Her dream in life is to be a doctor. This is how she explains \nit:\n\n       It completely breaks my heart to see thousands of children \n     die of treatable diseases due to inadequate basic health care \n     facilities, and I want to have the skills and ability to \n     change that.\n\n  In January 2012, Aaima graduated from Rutgers University magna cum \nlaude with a major in psychology. She was on the dean's list six times \nand had a grade point average of 3.75 out of 4.0. She was a research \nassistant at the Rutgers Department of Psychology and interned with a \nlocal cardiologist. Aaima took the Medical College Admission Test, the \nMCAT, after graduating magna cum laude from Rutgers.\n  She scored in the 90th percentile. Her score was better than 90 \npercent of those who took the test. Shortly after she graduated from \nRutgers, she was told that President Obama had an Executive order that \ngave her a chance to stay in America. It was called DACA. She applied \nfor it, and she was accepted.\n  For Aaima, it meant that now, for the first time, she could honestly \nthink about going to go medical school. She has never received any \ngovernment assistance, incidentally. As an undocumented person in \nAmerica, she doesn't qualify. So when she goes to college, it is at \nconsiderable challenge and hardship beyond those who had help from the \ngovernment. She never did.\n  Aaima sent a letter to me about DACA and its impact on her. She said:\n\n       I went from feeling hopeless and full of uncertainty \n     regarding my future to feeling confident and optimistic that \n     I will one day get the opportunity to help my community and \n     people in other poverty-stricken areas.\n\n  Then something amazing happened. Loyola University in Chicago, after \nthe President's Executive order on DACA, decided they would create 10 \nspots in their medical school for DACA students around America such as \nAaima. She applied.\n  I went to Loyola the day they started classes and met 10 of them. \nAaima is an amazing young woman. This was an extraordinary academic \nachievement in her life, and she was surrounded by those just like her \nwho were ``undocumented,'' protected by President Obama's Executive \norder.\n  The 10 were accepted to Loyola in this special program in their \nmedical school on one condition; that is that when they finished and \nbecame doctors, they had to agree to serve in underserved areas where \nthe poor people live in America and don't have doctors. They gladly \nagreed to do it.\n  They are not going to medical school to get rich. They are going to \nmedical school for the enrichment of a profession where they can help \nso many deserving people. That is where Aaima is today, at Loyola's \nmedical school. I thank Loyola University for giving her a chance and \ngiving nine others a chance. I thank them as well for giving Aaima the \nopportunity to serve those in America--in cities and rural areas--who \nhave no doctors.\n\n  The House Republicans want to deport this young woman. That is what \nthey have said: We want to deport her. We don't believe she should stay \nin America. After all she has accomplished in her life, after all she \npromises to bring to our great country, the Republicans have said: No, \nwe don't need you. We don't want you. Leave.\n  That is what the rider says on the Department of Homeland Security. I \ncome to this floor virtually every day and tell another story, such as \nthe story of Aaima, the story of what she has been through and the \npromise she holds for the future of this country. I cannot understand \nthe mentality of some on the other side of the aisle who are so hateful \nwhen it comes to these young, idealistic, amazing young people. Some of \nthe things they have said about these DREAMers are very sad. I have had \na chance to meet them, and I am going to continue to work for them.\n  So let us do this. Let us pass a clean Department of Homeland \nSecurity bill. What does that mean? Take off the riders, take off the \npolitically extraneous things. Let us pass the bill to fund the \nDepartment that keeps America safe and then turn to the majority \nparty--the Republican majority party--and say: Now accept your \nresponsibility. If you want to debate immigration, bring it to the \nfloor of the Senate, bring it to the floor of the House. It is within \nyour power to do it. Don't hold the Department of Homeland Security \nhostage. Please, when you consider the future of immigration in \nAmerica, don't forget we are a nation of immigrants, and that immigrant \nstock has made this the greatest country on Earth, if I can say. Let us \ncontinue that tradition.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, later today, the Senate will vote on \nwhether it should proceed to a bill that attempts to link two critical \nyet independent debates: the day-to-day operations of one of the \nNation's key national security agencies, and addressing our broken \nimmigration system. Now, in doing that, it appears that leadership \nwants to hold hostage the operations of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, an office charged with protecting our national security. And \nfrankly, that is simply irresponsible.\n  Sometimes the sense of history around here is whatever was the last \nsound bite heard on television, but let's take an honest look at the \nreal history and how we got here: It has been well over a year and a \nhalf since a strong, bipartisan majority, Democrats and Republicans, \ncame together in the Senate and approved a package of comprehensive \nimmigration reforms. We did this after the Senate Judiciary Committee \nhad held hundreds of hours of hearings and debate in markup. We passed \nit here overwhelmingly. The Republican House leadership refused to \nallow a vote on that measure even though most of it would have passed \nthe House of Representatives. Now, because they wouldn't act at all, \nand left a void, the President acted. The President acted when he had \nwaited for a couple of years to see if Congress would act--waited for \nthe House of Representatives to take up the bill we passed. He had to \nact. This is almost like ``Alice in Wonderland.'' The Republican \nleadership refuses to act on the immigration bill and then they get mad \nbecause the President, who has to take responsibility for this country, \nacts. They now want to put at risk the very operations of the agency \ncharged with enforcing the immigration laws in question and blame it on \nthe President because they failed to act. This is ``Alice in \nWonderland.''\n  I know Republicans object to the President's Executive action. We \nspent hours hearing their complaints last week as the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee was supposed to be considering the qualifications of Loretta \nLynch to be Attorney General. It had nothing to do with her but they \nwanted to vent for the cameras. It went on until the cameras were \nturned off. I would say that instead of complaining about what they \nfailed to do and complaining about what the President does to protect \nthis country, why don't they offer some meaningful solutions for fixing \nour broken immigration system. A good place to start would be the \ncomprehensive immigration bill we passed last Congress by a vote of 68-\n32. There was plenty in that bill I did not like but it included \nmeaningful reforms to all aspects of our immigration system that was \nnegotiated and improved through the full committee process and that is \nwhat made it a real compromise.\n  Now, instead of voting on that bipartisan compromise or other \nalternative solutions, all we see are attempts to\n\n[[Page S711]]\n\nundermine any efforts at comprehensive reform. By blocking all \nalternatives, the Republicans are keeping us locked in a status quo \nthat hurts our economy, makes us less safe and pulls families apart.\n  The President's Executive action is a positive step to toward keeping \nour communities safe because it requires DHS to prioritize the \ndeportation of dangerous criminals. And it encourages those immigrants \nwith longstanding ties to our communities who do not pose a danger to \nregister with the government and come out of the shadows.\n  Law enforcement officers and victims' advocates tell us the \nPresident's Executive action will make our communities and families \nsafer because people will not hesitate to call the police for fear of \nbeing deported themselves.\n  Business leaders, economists and labor leaders tell us it will grow \nour economy and increase wages for all workers. It will level the \nplaying field for American workers and raise revenues by more than \n$22.6 billion over 5 years.\n  Immigration and constitutional law experts have concluded that it is \nconstitutional and the President acted within his authority.\n  Mayors from 33 major cities across the country who work every day to \nmake our communities safe and our businesses flourish, have said the \nExecutive action will fuel growth in local economies, increase public \nsafety, and facilitate the integration of immigrants. These are not \npolitical partisans. They are frontline leaders who understand the \ndaily problems posed by our broken immigration system. They are telling \nus that we must act. And until we do, they are supportive of the \ntemporary steps the President has taken.\n  House Republicans have said their proposal will bolster border \nsecurity in a way the President's Executive actions did not but those \nclaims ignore reality. Border security has become a game of who can \ndevelop the most outlandish, unrealistic proposals. Round-the-clock \ndrone surveillance. Doubling the border patrol. Waiving all \nenvironmental laws. Requiring DHS to prevent every last undocumented \nperson from crossing the southern border. These proposals are not \nserious. They never worked in the past. They are not going to work now. \nWe are not at war with Mexico and Canada. We cannot seal our borders. \nNor should we.\n  We already have devoted an enormous amount of resources to border \nsecurity. The overall budget for CBP and ICE has nearly doubled in the \npast 10 years. Hundreds of miles of border fencing has been \nconstructed. We have more than 21,000 border patrol agents. And, the \nDepartment has deployed advanced technologies and airborne assets. The \nmost effective border security measure would be approving the \ncomprehensive immigration reforms passed by the Senate last Congress \nthat reduce the number of people trying to come here in the first \nplace.\n  The Senate has a choice. We can set aside politics and act like \ngrownups or we can waste days debating the legislation sent to us by \nthe House, which the President has made clear he will veto.\n  What I suggest is that we respond to the American people and act like \ngrownups--consider legislation introduced last week by Senator Shaheen \nand Senator Mikulski. That bill, negotiated last year by Senate and \nHouse members, Democrats and Republicans alike, would ensure that the \nDepartment of Homeland Security has the critical resources it needs to \nprotect our national interests. That bill will raise DHS funding by \n$400 million, and fund the largest operation force of border patrol \nagents and CBP officers in history. It will provide resources to \nrespond quickly when natural disasters devastate our states and \ncommunities. It will provide funding for the essential services \nprovided by the Coast Guard and Secret Service. It will invest in \nFEMA's State and Local Grants Program, which also helps all of our \nstates--including rural, border ones like Vermont. And it will support \nour state and local law enforcement, fire departments and first \nresponder emergency services. It replaces rhetoric with reality. I \nthink the American people are tired of rhetoric. They'd like some \nreality.\n  We all know our current immigration system needs comprehensive \nreform. That's why I held hundreds of hours of hearings and markups in \nthe Judiciary Committee and why this Senate, Republicans and Democrats, \ncame together last Congress and passed a comprehensive immigration \nbill. And I'm so sorry that the House Republican leadership refused to \nbring it up even though there were the votes to pass it. So the \nPresident took the first step. Now, Congress must act. But this \nappropriations bill is not the place for that debate. Have a real \ndebate on immigration. We cannot send the message that we are more \nwilling to play politics than promote and protect national security. \nThat posturing is beneath the Senate. We should pass a clean funding \nbill for the Department of Homeland Security, and renew our efforts to \nenact meaningful, comprehensive immigration reforms such as those \npassed by the Senate in 2013.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I stand to discuss what has been discussed \nby the previous two Senators, the urgent need for a clean bill to fund \nour Department of Homeland Security.\n  I wasn't part of this body during the 9/11 attacks. I was living in \nNewark, NJ, and watched, as many in my city did, with a view clearly to \nthe World Trade Center and saw that attack. What moved me afterward was \nthe incredible unity of our country. There was no partisan politics. \nPeople pulled together. First responders from New Jersey, all over New \nYork, and all over the country came together.\n  What we did after that as a nation was we began to prepare to ensure \nwe could prevent those attacks and have better systems in place should \nemergencies, crises, disasters or attacks happen again. What happened \nfrom that unity is evidenced by this body joining together not just to \nsing patriotic songs on the Capitol steps but to work in unison to \ncreate the Department of Homeland Security.\n  That agency is tasked with the urgent need to prepare our country to \nmeet crises if they come. This is not a partisan issue and should not \nfall prey to political fights between congressional Republicans and the \nPresident of the United States over immigration. There is way too much \nat stake.\n  Let me cite a few examples. Something we have learned from past \nattacks is the urgency of coordinating between different layers of law \nenforcement and first responders. If we do not pass a clean DHS bill, \nresources for that coordination, getting everyone working together, \nwill be put at risk.\n  Let me cite another example. It is critical in this day and age that \nwe stay on the cutting edge of technology, one step ahead of those \npeople who seek to do us harm. We see clearly if we do not get a clean \nbill passed, we will not be able to stay on that technological edge. We \nsee that in many areas. One great example is at our ports. New Jersey \nhas one of the third busiest ports in America, and we need that \ncritical technological equipment for upgrades that can help us to \ndetect nuclear devices or harmful materials coming into our country. \nWithout a clean bill, we will not have those resources.\n  We also see the headlines from just the past few months about cyber \nattack after cyber attack. A critical agency that must be funded \nappropriately to protect our businesses and our infrastructure and our \nfirst-responding capabilities against cyber attack is coordinated and \nled from the DHS. Not to fund this agency adequately so they can \nprepare for those attacks is unacceptable.\n  We are Americans and this idea of unifying together is our strength. \nWe stand united against attacks. If we do it right, as we have learned \nnot just throughout our country's history but in every aspect of our \nsociety--my college--high school coach used to talk about the five Ps: \nProper preparation prevents poor performance. This, unfortunately, will \nso undermine our ability to secure ourselves, it is almost an insult \nthat it will not even give proper funding to meet the weaknesses to the \nSecret Service, as we have seen their weaknesses exposed. As we go into \na Presidential election, we must provide adequate security and \nprotection for the next potential President.\n  This also harms our businesses as well. Take for example the E-Verify\n\n[[Page S712]]\n\nsystem. This makes sure people who are hired by our companies do not \nhave things in their background that would undermine our security. \nThose systems are harmed as well.\n  This is an example where petty politics and recklessness is being \nplaced above people, policy, and reason. We as a nation have stood in \nunity after the most horrifying of attacks. We live in a world where we \nhave seen diseases such as Ebola, where we have experienced cyber \nattacks, and where we have had to recover from vicious weather events \nsuch as Sandy. We live in a world where people seek to do us harm, and \nwe should do nothing to weaken our ability to respond, to prepare, to \nmake ourselves more resilient for any such occurrences. The urgency is \nupon us. We cannot be a reactive nation unified after the fact. We must \nbe a proactive nation, working together, above politics, to do what is \nright for the strength and the security of our country.\n\n  I call for a clean bill in the critical, most important part, of our \ngovernment to provide for the common defense. This is a time that \nshould bring us together, not have us fall prey to every bit of \nWashington that people have grown tired and sick of. Let us pass a \nclean bill, as a bipartisan group of former Secretaries of Homeland \nSecurity has called for. This is not a time for recklessness; it is a \ntime for reason. It is not a time for petty politics; it is time to put \npeople first.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/03/senate-section/article/S712-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S712-S713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, yesterday the President of the United \nStates released his budget. Unfortunately, it looks like the same old \nfailed, top-down policies of the past. It is a government-knows-best \napproach that clings to more taxes, more spending, and bigger \ngovernment. And it is exactly what the American people don't need.\n  If the past 6 years have demonstrated anything, it is that big \ngovernment doesn't work. Six years of big-government policies have left \nthe American people struggling.\n  Even the Vice President of the United States admits it. Speaking at \nthe House Democrats' retreat last week, Vice President Biden said:\n\n       To state the obvious, the past six years have been really, \n     really hard for this country.\n\n  That is the truth. The recession officially ended more than 5 years \nago, but the recovery has been weak and sluggish. Economic growth has \nlagged far behind the pace of other recoveries.\n  By this point in the Reagan recovery, the economy had created a \nstaggering 11.8 million more private sector jobs than we have created \nsince the recession ended.\n  Wage growth has remained stagnant under the Obama administration, \nwhile prices have risen. The average family health insurance premium \nhas increased by over $3,000 since the President's health care law was \npassed. Household income has declined by more than $2,000 over the past \n6 years. And too many Americans are unemployed or trapped in part-time \njobs because they can't find full-time employment.\n  Over the past 6 years, middle-class families have had to work harder \nand harder just to stay in place. Getting ahead has started to seem \nlike an impossible dream.\n  Republicans are committed to changing that. Providing relief to the \nmiddle class is the priority of America's new Congress. We intend to do \nit by eliminating the top-down, big-government policies of the past few \nyears and replacing them with a new path focused on growing the economy \nfrom the ground up.\n  If big government programs tend to assume one thing, it is that \ngovernment knows best. The government decides what it thinks you need, \nand then it makes you pay for it.\n  Well, Republicans don't believe government knows best. We believe the \nAmerican people know best. And our goal is to get government off the \nbacks of American families. We want to eliminate burdensome government \nprograms and regulations and allow Americans to keep more of their \nhard-earned dollars. We want to leave Americans free to make the best \ndecisions for their families about health care, about housing, and \nabout everything in between. We want to make sure Americans live in an \neconomy that provides the resources and opportunities they need to \nsupport their families and achieve their dreams. That is what we mean \nby fighting for people, not government, and we have already gotten \nstarted.\n  Senate Republicans just passed legislation to approve the Keystone XL \nPipeline. This project is a win-win for Americans. It would support \n42,000 jobs during construction. It would invest billions in the \neconomy. It would bring in millions in revenue to State and local \ngovernments.\n  In my home State of South Dakota alone, the pipeline would bring in \n$20 million in tax revenue. That is a lot of funding for local \npriorities such as schools and teachers, law enforcement, roads, and \nbridges.\n  Finally, the Keystone Pipeline would substantially reduce our \nreliance on oil from unstable countries such as Russia, Venezuela, and \nIran. That would be good news for American families' energy bills.\n  In addition to legislation to approve Keystone, Republicans have a \nnumber of other job-creating bills on the agenda.\n  The House of Representatives has already taken up legislation to make \nit easier for employers to hire veterans by exempting new veteran hires \nfrom ObamaCare's burdensome employer mandate. House Republicans have \nalso taken up legislation to fix ObamaCare's 30-hour workweek rule, \nwhich is currently cutting workers' hours and wages by making it more \ndifficult for employers to create or maintain full-time positions.\n  Republicans will also be releasing our own budget in the next few \nweeks, and it will be very different from President Obama's. First of \nall, our budget is going to balance. The President's budget never \nbalances--ever--and that is not a sustainable path for our country. \nFamilies have to balance their budgets. They don't have a choice. The \nFederal Government should be no different.\n  The President tends to act as if the Federal Government is different, \nas if the fact that his new government programs have good intentions \nmeans he can somehow ignore the fact that the country can't afford \nthem. But the Federal Government is just like any family or business or \norganization. If its budget isn't balanced, bad things happen.\n  Right now, the Federal Government is in debt to the tune of $18.1 \ntrillion. That number is so large that it is practically unfathomable.\n  To put it in perspective, 18.1 trillion people are more than 2,540 \ntimes the total population of the Earth; 18.1 trillion miles is the \ndistance to the Moon and back--almost 38 million times.\n  Needless to say, a debt that big is not a good thing--and the \nPresident's budget would keep adding to it. In fact, it would add \nanother $8.5 trillion to the debt. That is not good news for future \ngenerations who will have to pay down the bills our generation is \nracking up.\n  Republicans' budget will balance. It will take aim at out-of-control \nFederal spending and address our massive Federal debt. Our budget will \nalso cut waste to make the government more efficient, effective, and \naccountable to the American people. There is no excuse for wasting \nAmericans' money on ineffective and duplicative programs.\n  The President's budget is about the past. Republicans' budget will be \nabout the future. The American people sent a clear message in November \nthat they were tired of the status quo in Washington. They were tired \nof gridlock. They were tired of the same old top-down, government-\nknows-best approach to governing.\n  Well, Republicans heard them. And since we took control of Congress a \nmonth ago, we have focused on living up to the trust the American \npeople placed in us. We have gotten Washington working again.\n  In just 1 month, we have held more amendment votes than Democrats \nheld in an entire year. Committees are back up and running, and \nRepublicans and Democrats are getting the chance to make their \nconstituents' voices heard.\n  We have passed job-creating legislation, and we are going to keep \npassing more. We are going to put forward the kind of budget the \nAmerican people are looking for: a budget that balances, a\n\n[[Page S713]]\n\nbudget that targets wasteful Washington spending, and a budget that \nstarts to address the massive debt that has accumulated under the Obama \nadministration.\n  President Obama has a choice: He can continue to put forward the \nfailed policies his budget offers, or he can move away from these \npolicies and work with Republicans to start cleaning up the debt and \ngetting government off the backs of the American people. We hope he \nwill choose to work with us.\n  But whatever he chooses, though, Republicans will continue this \nCongress as we have begun: by getting Washington working again for \nAmerican families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I wish to join in the comments from my \nable and learned colleague from South Dakota to talk about what \nhappened when the President yesterday released his budget for the next \nfiscal year.\n  I agree with my colleague from South Dakota that the President's \nspending is absolutely astonishing. The President wants to spend $4 \ntrillion in 2016. That is $1 billion 4,000 times. Nobody has ever seen \na budget that big before.\n  The New York Times ran an article right after the budget came out \nyesterday with the headline ``Liberal aspirations, set out as a \nbudget.'' The article said:\n\n       President Obama presented a budget on Monday that is more \n     utopian vision than pragmatic blueprint.\n\n  The American people don't want a utopian vision. They want \nresponsible leadership--responsible leadership that understands their \nneeds and the challenges people face every day.\n  So far this year, all we have seen from the President is a list of \nways he wants to spend taxpayers' hard-earned dollars. These ideas are \nso unrealistic, there has been no sign that the President actually \nwants to get anything done for the rest of his term. If the President \nwanted to get something done, what he would do is write a budget that \nspends a reasonable amount of money in a responsible way. If he wanted \nto get something done, he would offer responsible tax simplification.\n  Instead, the President of the United States asked for more taxes on \nhard-working American families. That is what he did when he said last \nmonth that he wanted to raise taxes on college savings plans. Millions \nof people use those plans to give their children a better future. When \neven Democrats in Congress told the President it was a terrible idea, \nthe President finally had to relent and drop his plan.\n  Then came the State of the Union Address, and the President had more \nideas for even additional new taxes. The Tax Policy Center analyzed \nthose ideas, and they found that millions of middle-class families \nwould pay even higher taxes under the President's plans. When they \nlooked at families squarely in the middle of the middle class, they \nfound that only about one in four of them would even get a tax break \nand, instead, twice as many families in the middle of the middle \nclass--twice as many families--would see their taxes go up, and they \nwould pay almost $300 more on average under President Obama's plan. How \nis that a good deal for hard-working taxpayers all across the country, \nfor middle-class families?\n  Another study looked at some of the President's other plans for tax \nincreases. It found those ideas would lead to a smaller economy and \nsmaller incomes. How is that a good idea for the middle class?\n  Now we have the President's budget. Next year, he wants to increase \nspending by 7 percent over what Washington will spend this year. Did \nmost Americans get a raise of 7 percent last year? Of course not. Under \nPresident Obama's economy, wages have been stagnant. Part-time workers \nare having their hours cut, their paychecks cut. Why? Because of the \nPresident's health care law. People are paying higher premiums, higher \ndeductibles, higher copays for health insurance that meets all of \nPresident Obama's mandates but doesn't necessarily meet the needs for \nthem and their families. President Obama still has not learned that \nevery dollar Washington takes out of the pockets of hard-working \ntaxpayers all across the country is a dollar they can't use for \nthemselves, to spend, to save, to invest.\n  In his budget the President sent over yesterday, he wants to add \nanother $474 billion to Washington's debt next year alone--see what the \ndebt is, and he wants to add it to the debt on top of that. He wants \nanother $8.5 trillion over the next decade. Every one of those numbers \nis right there in his budget, and every one of them is bad news for \nhard-working American taxpayers.\n  Americans aren't asking the President to add trillions of dollars to \nWashington's out-of-control spending and debt. They know they are the \nones who are going to have to pay for this new spending. The President \nmay not realize it, but the American taxpayer knows it.\n  The White House says it can add all of this new spending because the \nbudget deficit this year, as they say, will only be $468 billion. That \nis how out of touch this administration is. The President sees a \ndeficit of $468 billion--and that is adding it on top of the debt--and \nis declaring victory. He wants to celebrate by piling on more debt to \nspend on his priorities, not on the priorities of hard-working American \nfamilies. That is not a victory.\n\n  Over the next 10 years, under President Obama's budget, the debt in \nWashington is going to climb to more than $26 trillion. That is $75,000 \nthat each man, woman, and child in America would owe to pay off the \ndebt President Obama is suggesting in his budget.\n  We have all of that debt, and the President's budget does nothing to \npreserve and protect Social Security. There is nothing to preserve and \nprotect Social Security so it will be there for the next generation. Is \nthat really the legacy President Obama wants to leave for America's \nyoung people?\n  At least the President will send his budget to Congress by the \ndeadline this year. This is President Obama's seventh budget, and five \nof those he turned over after the legal deadline. Maybe the President \nshould have taken a little more time to double check his math because \nthe President's figures don't add up for the American people.\n  President Obama's economic policies have led to far less growth than \nwe would have had following the recession. According to the latest \nnumbers released on Friday, our economy grew by just 2.4 percent last \nyear. That is not really what it should be, not for our country. We \nhave tried President Obama's ideas for the last 6 years, and they have \nfailed. They have failed the American people. This budget is more of \nthe same ideas--more middle-class taxes, more spending, more debt. And \nDemocrats in Congress didn't even offer a budget the past few years.\n  Republicans are ready to do the work of passing a responsible budget. \nWe are going to pass a budget with commonsense spending that fits \nAmerica's priorities, not Washington and President Obama's priorities. \nWe will pass a budget that actually helps middle-class families thrive \nand our economy grow. We will pass a budget that takes control of \nWashington spending and starts to bring down President Obama's massive \ndebt. Republicans in Congress understand that governing responsibly \nbegins with budgeting responsibly. Instead of more new spending that \nmiddle-class, hard-working American families can't afford, we will \nbalance the budget. We will cut waste and support programs that deliver \nreal results.\n  That is what the President should have done. What he should have done \nis shown real leadership, not just more utopian vision. The President \nmissed his chance to lead. Republicans will produce a budget that \nfocuses on jobs, economic growth, and opportunity for all Americans.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/03/senate-section/article/S713-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S713-S716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of moving to the \nHomeland Security appropriations bill. I hope we do that with a vote \ntoday. This is very important in terms of governing and in terms of \npassing an appropriations bill for a vital part of government.\n  It is also important to address and debate and vote head-on on \nPresident\n\n[[Page S714]]\n\nObama's illegal Executive amnesty, which he announced last December, \nwhich would basically give amnesty to about 5 million illegal aliens \nwith no basis whatsoever in statutory law. In fact, statutory law is \nopposed to that sort of Executive action.\n  I find it ironic that the very same Members from the very same party \nand ideology that is constantly beating the drum and saying ``For God's \nsake, we can't shut down the government; we can't have that sort of \nshowdown'' are apparently preparing to vote against even moving to this \nspending bill which is necessary to fund a vital part of the \ngovernment. That makes no sense.\n  We need to move to this spending bill, debate it, and act on it. Not \nmoving to the spending bill is a vote for a government shutdown in that \narea of the government, and I think that is irresponsible. We need to \nmove to the spending bill which originated in the House. This is the \nHouse-passed spending bill for Homeland Security. We need to move to \nit.\n  Furthermore, as is evident from the last couple of weeks, we are \ngoing to have an open amendment process. There will be amendments \noffered and available to be debated and voted on that will have \nanything and everything with regard to this spending bill.\n  The House put several policy provisions in the spending bill, \nincluding those that I agree with, such as defunding this \nunconstitutional Executive amnesty from December. I agree with that, I \nsupport that, and I will certainly vote to support it. But the point is \nthat there will be plenty of opportunity to vote on that and \npotentially remove that because we are going to have an open debate and \namendment process--as we should--here on the Senate floor.\n  Let's move to this vital spending bill. Let's not threaten to shut \ndown the government. Let's have the debate here on the floor, and let's \nvote. That is what we were elected to do. We were elected to represent \nour constituents, debate major issues of the day--and that certainly \nincludes the President's Executive amnesty--and to vote.\n  If there is an effort to not allow us to even move to the bill to do \nthat, I can only come to one conclusion: that folks voting that way for \nthe most part support President Obama's illegal Executive amnesty, but \nthey just don't want to have to say so, and they certainly don't want \nto have to vote that way. Well, sorry. You ran for the job, you asked \nfor the job, and you got it. Let's do our job, which means putting the \ncountry's business on the floor of the Senate and acting one way or the \nother, debating, voting, proposing amendments, and moving on with this \nessential spending bill for this part of the government.\n  I will strongly support moving to the bill. That is the responsible \nthing to do. I will strongly support the provisions in the bill that \nthe House enacted, including blocking the President's illegal Executive \namnesty.\n  With regard to that, this is an important matter for two reasons. \nFirst of all, I believe this Executive amnesty is really bad policy \nthat is going to grow the problem and not solve it. A fundamental rule \nin life is that when you reward something, you get more of it, not less \nof it, right? That is true of our Tax Code, and that is true in \nparenting. Well, we are rewarding illegal crossings. We are rewarding \nthat flow of illegal immigrants. We are rewarding that through the \nPresident's Executive amnesty, and it is only going to produce more of \nit. That is my first objection to the policy. It is a very bad idea, \nand it is going to grow the problem, not decrease it.\n  My second objection is even more fundamental. I believe this action \nis clearly way beyond the President's Executive authority and way \nbeyond his true powers under the Constitution. The Supreme Court has \nsaid many times that there is nothing that Congress has more clear and \nstraightforward powers on than immigration policy, and it certainly \nincludes anything like a major amnesty.\n  What the President did in December was not filling in the blanks of \nstatutory laws or executing statutory law. What he did was completely \ncontrary to all sorts of statutory law. Statutory law is clear. It is \non the books. It has been passed through a valid process. It is clear \nthat folks who enter the country illegally, break the law and are here \nillegally, are subject to removal and cannot work in the country \nlegally.\n  In contrast to that clear statutory law, President Obama is first \ngiving them authorization to stay here for at least 3 years, and that \ncan be renewed. Secondly, he is handing them a document that he is \nmaking up out of thin air called a work permit which gives them \nauthority to work even though that is clearly contrary to statutory law \ngiven the means by which they entered the country.\n  We need to put that issue and topic directly on the Senate floor and \ndebate and act on that as well. As I suggested, the only way we do any \nof that is to first take a responsible vote and put the House spending \nbill on the Senate floor. To vote otherwise is to block a necessary \nspending bill, to basically threaten shutting down part of the \ngovernment, and to avoid our responsibility in terms of debating and \nvoting on the major issues of the day--to deal directly with that.\n  I urge all of my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, to put this \nnecessary bill on the floor, and then we will have an open and full \ndebate, we will have an open amendment process, we will have all of the \nvotes that go to this topic, and then we will act. That is what we \nshould do, and that is what we were elected to do.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, elections in our representative form of \ngovernment are supposed to have consequences, and if they don't have \nconsequences, there is not much point of having elections.\n  One of the issues in the most recent election for Congress was a \npromise of some people running for office to overcome the President's \nconstitutional actions, particularly what he did on immigration but on \na lot of other things as well. The bill we have before us is a \ndemonstration on the part of people who were victorious in that last \nelection to deliver on the promises of that election.\n  So obviously I am here at this time to speak on the Department of \nHomeland Security appropriations that the Senate is considering today \nand, as the Senator from Louisiana just said, to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the efforts to move ahead.\n  In doing so, I wish to discuss what we are doing. This bill is about \nstopping the unilateral actions the President has taken with respect to \nthe country's immigration laws, doing it without congressional approval \nor scrutiny. It is our responsibility to check the President and ensure \nthat he does not go beyond the limits of his powers as defined in that \nbasic document, the Constitution. This is about restoring the rule of \nlaw. This is about restoring the Constitution by denying that funds be \nutilized to carry out the President's improper, unconstitutional \nactions.\n  Our government is based on the rule of law. No one is above the law, \nnot even those who were chosen to be leaders among the people. This \ncore principle has kept us free and preserved our rights and liberties \nfor over 200 years.\n  However, the rule of law in our country has slowly eroded away. While \nthe current administration is not the only culprit of that corrosion of \nthe rule of law, this administration has expedited its erosion more \nthan others. That is the basis for the President saying: If Congress \nwon't, I have a pen and a phone, and I will.\n  Let me explain this erosion. Under article II of the Constitution, \nthe President ``shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.'' \nThis is not a permissive clause, letting the President pick and choose \nwhich laws he will enforce. The article uses the mandatory ``shall,'' \nwhich requires him to enforce all laws. However, the President has not \ndone that. He has taken the attitude that he is above the law and is \nnot required to obey it.\n  Just in the last couple of years we have seen President Obama's \ncomplete disregard for laws passed by Congress. Rather than enforcing \nthe Affordable Care Act, he rewrote the deadlines prescribed by law. He \nhas not enforced the Controlled Substance Act in some States and, even \nworse, has allowed them to openly defy Federal law.\n\n[[Page S715]]\n\n  He released five Taliban prisoners from Guantanamo without first \nproviding 30 days' notice to Congress as required under the National \nDefense Authorization Act.\n  He unlawfully made four appointments to executive positions without \nauthority under the appointments clause of the Constitution. In that \nregard, he was even overruled by two members he appointed to the \nSupreme Court in that 9-to-0 decision that says when the Constitution \nsays only Congress can decide when a House is in session, the President \ncan't say on some basis that they aren't in session and proceed to make \nrecess appointments. In other words, what the judges said is that what \nthe Constitution says is what it says. So he took unconstitutional \naction in making those appointments.\n  Lastly, he took the drastic step of changing immigration laws on the \nbooks without the authority or approval from Congress.\n  When the President acts in contravention to the law, he erodes the \nrule of law. He sets an example for future Presidents who will expand \non his precedent and actions on other laws and policies they don't \nagree with. By doing this the President sends the message that the laws \nas written by the legislative branch aren't important, thereby removing \nand reducing faith in the rule of law.\n  The Founders understood the serious dangers of investing all powers \nof our government in a single body. They understood that because the \nRevolution was all about colonists being sick and tired of one man--\nGeorge III--making decisions. So under the doctrine of separation of \npowers, they wrote into the Constitution dividing the power among three \nbranches of government so one person could not be George III. They gave \nall legislative powers to the Congress, all Executive powers to the \nPresident, and all judicial powers to the judicial branch. No body of \ngovernment may exercise the powers of other bodies of the government.\n  Separation of power then is fundamental to the Constitution of the \nUnited States, and the Constitution of the United States enshrines the \nspirit of the Declaration of Independence, that we are endowed by our \nCreator, not by government, with certain inalienable rights.\n  Just last week during the nomination hearings of Loretta Lynch as \nAttorney General, we had an outstanding professor from George \nWashington Law School testify by the name of Jonathan Turley, and he \nsaid this: ``The Separation of Powers is the very core of our \nconstitutional system and was designed not as a protection of the \npowers of the branches but a protection of liberty.''\n  We are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights, among \nthem life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The Founding Fathers \nknew that if the same body had all the powers, that body, no matter how \nlarge or small, would be tyrannical, as was George III.\n  However, President Obama has overreached the limits of his \nconstitutional authority. He has blurred the lines of separation of \npowers.\n  The executive branch action taken with respect to our immigration \nlaws is only the most recent, if not the most pervasive, of legislative \nactions he has taken under the proposition that I have a phone and a \npen and I can do almost anything Congress isn't doing that I want them \nto do. In effect, the President has thwarted the immigration laws \nCongress has written in order to implement the policy he wants. \nContrary to the laws on the books, the President's action would give \npeople who have crossed the border illegally the right to remain in the \nUnited States and many taxpayer benefits that are only available to \nlawfully documented immigrants, as well as the right to work.\n  The President's action expanded a program he created without \ncongressional approval, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals--or \nDACA as it is called--and created a new program, the deferred action of \nparents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents--or DAPA--as it \nis called.\n  But under the Constitution only Congress has the authority to create \nthese types of programs that grant a lawful status to people who have \ncome here undocumented. Let me repeat: Congress has the responsibility \nof writing laws, not the President. I remind my colleagues that \nCongress considered a law that resembled the DACA Program, but it never \npassed that law. So what has the President done? In effect, he has \nenacted a law Congress rejected.\n  The President justifies his actions by saying ``Congress has \nfailed.'' However, that doesn't give him license to act on his own. I \nwish to again quote Professor Turley:\n\n       Our government requires consent and compromise to function. \n     It goes without saying that when we are politically divided \n     as a nation, less tends to get done. However, such division \n     is no license to ``go it alone'' as the President has \n     suggested.\n\n  The genius of our government is that it allows for the collection of \nideas and opinions. It allows these different ideas and opinions to \nwork together to find common ground. Once common ground is reached, \nthen laws are enacted. The President doesn't represent that many \ndifferent views in the country, but obviously Congressmen from all over \nthis geographical area represent those views. Congressmen are elected \nby the people directly, and if there is a disagreement in Congress on \nhow immigration should be handled, that means there is disagreement in \nthe country on how immigration should be handled. The President cannot \nimagine that everyone agrees his plan is the best plan. It is the job \nof Congress to find compromises and solutions that most people can \nagree with and particularly in the U.S. Senate where it takes 60 votes \nto pass legislation. This is where consensus is built when there are \nonly 54 Republicans and 46 Democrats. If we are going to get anything \ndone, there has to be a consensus.\n  The other justification the President is fond of using for his \nactions is the executive branch's ability to exercise prosecutorial \ndiscretion, but while the President does have the authority to decide \nwhen to prosecute or where to allocate resources, that authority is not \nunlimited.\n  The President's actions with respect to immigration go far beyond \nprosecutorial discretion. Lawful prosecutorial discretion is exercised \non a case-by-case basis. Lawful prosecutorial discretion isn't \nexcluding entire categories of individuals in a blanket fashion and \ntelling them that going forward the law will be applied to them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. In addition, lawful prosecutorial discretion doesn't \nreward illegal behavior by conferring substantive benefits to those who \nhave violated the law. Yet under the President's unilateral action, \nindividuals who have entered without inspection or overstayed their \nvisas unlawfully now will get work permits, Social Security numbers, \ndriver's licenses, employment and education opportunities, and many \nother benefits only afforded to those who abide by the law.\n  Further, the President argues that because the Department doesn't \nhave sufficient resources, he has exercised his prosecutorial \ndiscretion by prioritizing the removal of the most dangerous aliens for \nbetter security of our country. Yet the reality of his statement is \nthat in fiscal year 2013, 36,007 criminal aliens were released. What is \nmore, a report just issued by the Department of Homeland Security \nreveals that 1,000 of those criminal aliens have gone on to commit \nfurther crimes.\n  So the President isn't even doing what he says he is doing. Instead \nof removing criminals from our country as required by law, he is just \nreleasing them back into the community so they can continue to commit \nfurther crimes and jeopardize public safety.\n  No matter how the President paints the picture, his Executive action \non immigration is an abuse of constitutional duty to faithfully execute \nthe law and an overreach of his executive branch authority under the \nseparation of powers doctrine.\n  Under the Constitution, the Congress has several tools it can use to \ncheck the President and rein him in when he operates outside of the \nConstitution. Among the tools Congress has is the power of the purse. \nCongress appropriates funds and has the authority to\n\n[[Page S716]]\n\ndictate where and how those funds may or may not be used. If the \nPresident exceeds the limits of his Executive authority to create an \nillegal program such as DACA or DAPA, Congress has the power to defund \nsuch a program.\n  The Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill is a check on \nthe executive branch. It is a result of the last election, and \nelections are supposed to have consequences. This bill is our way of \nshowing to the American people we are carrying out a campaign promise \nto make sure the President doesn't act in an unconstitutional way and \nabuse his authority.\n  So I ask my colleagues to take this under serious consideration when \ndeciding whether to vote in favor or against proceeding to this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/03/senate-section/article/S716-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 12 \nnoon will be equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Department of Homeland Security Funding\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Grassley for his \nremarks. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee and a longtime vigorous \nleader in the U.S. Senate, I know he was here and saw the problems of \nthe 1986 amnesty. It had bad ramifications in a lot of ways. I believe \nif we listened to the experience of Senator Grassley and his \nunderstanding of what is at stake, we would all be in a lot better \nshape than we are today.\n  The American people want a lawful system of immigration. They want \none that is fair to applicants who want to come to America. They are \nnot for eliminating immigration to America. They want a system that \nallows people to apply, wait their turn, and if they are qualified, be \nadmitted; if they don't qualify, not be admitted. They want that \nenforced. They don't believe we should have open borders and open visa \nprograms that allow people by the millions to come unlawfully into this \ncountry. The President obviously has a different view. As a result, we \nare in a situation in which the Constitution is at stake in a lot of \nways.\n  We will vote after lunch on moving forward to the Department of \nHomeland Security bill. The Department of Homeland Security bill, \npassed by the House of Representatives, fully funds the Department of \nHomeland Security. The basic funding mechanisms and agreements and \nallocations of money in that legislation were approved on a bipartisan \nbasis. The House of Representatives simply said: Mr. President, the \nmoney in the Department of Homeland Security funding mechanism will be \nspent for lawful purposes. That money will be spent to secure the \nhomeland in an effective way. That money, however, will not be spent by \nanyone to take actions outside the lawful limitations and lawful powers \nof the Department of Homeland Security. But that is what the President \nwanted to do, and that is what he wants to do through his Executive \naction.\n  They are now leasing a new building across the river in Crystal City. \nThey are hiring 1,000 new Federal employees. Those Federal employees \nwill be processing the applications for up to 5 million people and they \nwill be providing those people with photo IDs. These are people in the \ncountry unlawfully. They are not lawfully allowed to work in America. \nBusinesses aren't allowed to hire people who are here unlawfully.\n  It is plain and simple. They are not eligible to qualify for Social \nSecurity or Medicare. So the President has declared he is going to set \nup this office. They will process these individuals, and they will \nprovide up to 5 million photo IDs, 5 million Social Security numbers, \nand the right to work in America. They will be allowed to participate \nin Social Security and Medicare.\n  He says: I am entitled to do that. Well, he is not entitled to do \nthat. As scholar after scholar and as common sense tells us, the \nPresident doesn't have that power. That is what this is about.\n  The House barred any spending on this unlawful activity--an activity \nthe President asked Congress to allow him to do and which Congress \nrejected. This proposal was presented to Congress, and Congress refused \nto pass it. But he is doing it anyway. It is an arrogant overreach, a \ndirect challenge to the historic role of Congress in our American \nsystem.\n  Our Democratic colleagues say they don't want controversial \nimmigration riders on this bill--controversial immigration riders. In \nother words, they don't want the Congress to do what it is required to \ndo--fund the programs it believes need to be funded and not fund \nprograms it doesn't believe should be funded.\n  As a matter of policy, Congress has not adopted and does not support \nwhat the President wants to do. In fact, it has prohibited it. It has \nno duty whatsoever to allow the President to spend moneys of the United \nStates of America to advocate a program they don't approve of, or \ncertainly one that is unlawful. That is what this is all about. Our \ncolleagues are voting to block the bill that would fund Homeland \nSecurity at the level the President has asked for. So there is no \npolicy change here. Every lawful activity of Homeland Security is \nfunded.\n  There was a headline in the New York Times today. I am going to push \nback a little on my colleagues because they have been spinning this \nidea that somehow the Republican House, in sending this legislation \nover that funded Homeland Security, is disrupting the fair flow and \ncausing controversies within our funding mechanisms of Congress. The \nheadline from an experienced reporter's article in today's New York \nTimes is: ``Democrats Look to Protect Obama's Immigration Directives.''\n  That is exactly what this is about, colleagues. At least seven of our \nDemocratic colleagues have explicitly said they don't agree with the \npolicy of the President with regard to Executive amnesty and providing \nwork permits and Social Security to people unlawfully here. But they \nare now united. We are told all of them are going to stand together to \nprotect President Obama's immigration directives.\n  When they were running for office during the campaign last fall, \npeople were saying they didn't agree with him. Now, when the issue hits \nthe floor and we have an opportunity to do the normal and rational \nthing and not fund an unlawful policy, they are all sticking together \nlike a palace guard around the White House to protect Obama's \nimmigration directives. This is a sad thing and a disappointing thing \nto me. The article goes on to say:\n\n       Democrats are hoping they can force the new Republican \n     majority to drop the immigration provisions and send the $40 \n     billion spending bill to the President.\n\n  Congress is spending $40 billion on homeland security. All of that \nmoney is directed to legitimate lawful policies of Homeland Security \nand not allowing any of it to be spent on unlawful, unapproved policies \nin Homeland Security--an absolute power that Congress has, a duty that \nit has. Congress is violating its fundamental duty if it allows the \nPresident to carry out power he is not authorized. It is absolutely \nviolating its duty if it supports and funds actions by the President to \nviolate the law. It has a duty to say no to the President who \noverreaches.\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       But Democrats have decided to shut down debate on the \n     measure altogether, fearful that it could lead to the bill's \n     approval and could prompt negotiations with the House that \n     would put them at a disadvantage.\n\n  Fearful that the process could lead to the bill's approval during \nnegotiations\n\n[[Page S717]]\n\nwith the House--isn't that what legislation is all about? Isn't that \nwhat it is all about? Shouldn't our colleagues have the right, if they \ndon't like the language that constricts the President's power to carry \non this unlawful act, to offer an amendment to strip it out? They have \nthe ability to strike that language. Why don't they do that? No, they \nare blocking even moving to the bill in its entirety. Then they are \nattempting one of the most through-the-looking-glass, down-the-rabbit-\nhole arguments you have ever heard. They are saying Republicans are \nshutting down Homeland Security when they are not passing the bill that \nis on the floor today and we will be voting on. They are rejecting it. \nAll it does is fund the Department of Homeland Security at a level \nagreed upon on a bipartisan basis, $40 billion.\n  What kind of world are we in when we do that? I would like to ask who \nis being protected here. The answer is clear. The New York Times said: \nThey are protecting President Obama's political immigration directives.\n  I would ask this. Isn't it our duty to protect the Constitution? \nIsn't it our duty to protect the laws of the United States of America? \nIsn't it our duty to protect American workers from the decline in wages \nand their job prospects as a result of now legalizing 5 million people \nto be able to take any job whatsoever in the entire American economy, \nincluding working for the county commission, the power company, the \ntrucking companies?\n  Isn't that what our duty is? Who should we be protecting here? \nShouldn't we be protecting a lawful system of immigration?\n  But the President wants to take money. He wants Congress to \nappropriate money to give him at Homeland Security so he can spend it \nto undermine the law of the United States of America. What an \nunthinkable thing that is. But that is fundamentally what is happening. \nHe wants and is demanding that this Congress not follow its promises to \nthe American people--not follow its lawful and constitutional duty--but \nto give him the money so he can carry out a policy in contradiction to \nthe laws of the United States of America and to the good policy of \nAmerica. This is the way we do business in this country.\n  I think the reason our Democratic colleagues don't want to move to \nthe bill is because they don't want to debate the substance of it. That \nis not a good reason. They don't want to debate the substance of it \nbecause their position is untenable. The American people understand \nthat Congress is not shutting down the government and is not shutting \ndown Homeland Security. Our Democratic colleagues are the ones that are \nrefusing to pass the legislation that would fund Homeland Security. The \nPresident is backing them up and encouraging them, and apparently he \nhas had success. He twisted arms or something because at least seven of \nthe Members said they didn't agree with this, and more probably would \nhave, had they been asked. But no, not now. Now they are all standing \ntogether with Senator Reid, the minority leader of the Senate, to \nadvocate this policy.\n  I don't appreciate it being said time and again by so many of our \nDemocratic colleagues and the President that somehow Congress is acting \nimproperly and that Congress is not funding Homeland Security. This is \nthrough the looking glass. This is beyond acceptance. I think the New \nYork Times pretty well said it correct. I don't believe the media is \nbuying this argument. I don't think the American people are buying this \nargument, and Congress shouldn't buy the argument. The right thing to \ndo, colleagues, is to get on the bill.\n  Let me say this to my Democratic colleagues. I know many of you are \nuneasy about this. Let's get on the legislation. There will be \namendments. There will be a number of amendments. Perhaps things could \ndevelop in a way that you can support them. We will protect the lawful \nconstitutional powers of Congress and fund Homeland Security. We will \ndo it in a way that strengthens the rule of law in America and \nstrengthens our ability to have integrity in the immigration system. It \ncreates a system the American people rightfully have demanded, pleaded \nfor, and prayed for, and that Congress and the politicians have failed \nto produce for now over 40 years. That is the problem. The American \npeople are angry, and they are not angry at immigrants. All of us have \nfriends and relatives and neighbors who have immigrated to America. We \nare not against immigrants. I think there is a growing unease out there \nabout the willful refusal of Congress to do what it takes to fix this \nsystem.\n  I would just say one more thing. American wages are down. Wages fell \nin December 5 cents an hour--not a good event after we have been told \neverything is getting so much better. There is a limit, colleagues, to \nhow many people we can bring to America to take jobs when we have a \nlimited number of jobs and falling wages.\n  We have the lowest percentage of Americans in the workforce working \ntoday since the 1970s. Things aren't going good. We can't accept \neverybody in the whole world to take jobs here.\n  We just had a report produced yesterday that said we have now \ndiscovered there are another 5 million people who have been--it looks \nto me--admitted to work in the country unlawfully. Through the Freedom \nof Information Act, it was discovered that not only do we have a \nmillion people a year come to America with green cards and permanent \nresidency, we have 700,000 guest workers that come every year. Add to \nthat the asylees, plus the refugees and other people. What they found \nout was we have now--in the last 5 years under this administration--\ngiven work authorization to 5 million more people than anybody knew. Do \nwe think this doesn't impact people's wages, impact women to have a \nbetter job, their children to have a better job?\n  Somebody needs to be thinking about this. There is a limit here, and \nit is obvious the limits need to be discussed. We need to create a \nlawful system which protects American workers. We need to be less \nconcerned about protecting President Obama's unlawful directives and \nmore concerned with protecting the interests of the American working \nperson.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I rise to speak on the Clay Hunt \nSuicide Prevention for American Veterans Act, a most important piece of \nlegislation. I would like to thank Senator Isakson in particular for \nexpediting this legislation through the Veterans' Affairs Committee. I \nadmire his leadership. I admire his commitment to the veterans of \nAmerica. It has been a pleasure to know him and to serve in the Senate \nwith an advocate for our American veterans.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Blumenthal, whose partnership I \nhave been with for a long period of time. Without his leadership and \nsupport, this legislation would not be coming to the floor.\n  Every day approximately 22 American veterans commit suicide, totaling \nover 8,000 veteran suicides each year. I repeat: 8,000 veteran suicides \neach year. It is evident by these staggering numbers that our military \nand veterans affairs programs are not effectively treating post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, known as PTSD, and other mental health \nillnesses that can lead to suicide. There are too many disconnected and \nineffective treatment programs, and as a result our service men and \nwomen are suffering from the bureaucracy.\n  Against this backdrop, I wish to highlight the story of Clay Hunt, \nfor whom this proposed legislation is named. Clay enlisted in the \nMarine Corps in May of 2005, deployed to Al Anbar Province near \nFallujah in January 2007.\n  During that deployment Clay Hunt was shot in the wrist by a sniper's \nbullet that barely missed his head, a wound for which he received a \nPurple Heart. Despite having been wounded, Clay Hunt volunteered and \ngraduated from Marine Corps Scout Sniper School in March 2008.\n  After another deployment to Afghanistan, Clay was honorably \ndischarged from the marines in April 2009. After returning home, Clay \nsuffered from the effects of PTSD for many years and struggled with \ninadequate care at his\n\n[[Page S718]]\n\nlocal VA hospital. Subsequently, Clay took his own life in March 2011 \nat the age of 28. Clay is only one example of veterans who are trying \nto make their way in our country today, but who suffer, more so than \nthey have to, because of Department of Defense and Department of \nVeterans Affairs mismanagement of resources for suicide prevention and \nmental health treatment.\n  This bipartisan bill will lay the foundation for improved mental \nhealth care and better suicide prevention resources for our American \nservicemembers. Specifically, this bill would require an independent \nevaluation of existing suicide prevention programs at the DOD and VA, \ngauge their effectiveness, and make recommendations for consolidation, \nelimination, or improvement.\n  Additionally, this legislation would establish a new single Web site \nthat provides information for veterans regarding available mental \nhealth care services, create a pilot loan repayment program to recruit \nmore psychiatrists to treat veterans at the VA, improve the exchange of \ntraining best practices and other resources among the VA and nonprofit \nmental health organizations, create a community outreach pilot program \nto assist with and mitigate the stressors of servicemembers \ntransitioning to civilian life, and provide a 1-year extension for \ncertain combat veterans to enroll in the VA.\n  Our Nation has a moral obligation to identify, resource, and make \navailable to our veterans effective forms of treatment to help \neliminate suicide resulting from severe combat-related psychological \ntrauma. This bill is an important step to improve the care we provide \nto the men and women who have sacrificed for all of us and to whom we \nare forever indebted. We owe it to these brave men and women to act \nnow.\n  Obviously I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation.\n\n\n                         The President's Budget\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to briefly discuss the President's budget \nrequest for fiscal year 2016 as it relates to the Veterans' \nAdministration. In this year's budget request, the President has stated \nhe will submit legislation to reallocate part of the funding for the \nVeterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014, legislation he \nsigned into law just last August, to other programs within the VA.\n  In other words, he wants to take money from the Veterans Access, \nChoice and Accountability Act and put it into other programs within the \nVA--a bill we just passed last August. It clearly suggests that the \nPresident of the United States is disconnected from the needs of our \nveterans and he may be more solicitous about supporting a bloated, \ndemonstrably dysfunctional bureaucracy than ensuring that quality care \nis available to our veterans.\n  Our veterans have suffered long enough with wait times and scheduling \ndelays at the VA, and deserve to have the right to choose where and \nwhen they get their health care. Taking funding away from this \nlegislation, especially the choice card, shows a complete disregard for \nour veterans' well-being and the service they provide to our country.\n  If or when this legislative proposal comes to the Hill, I would urge \nmy colleagues to vote against it--in fact, not even consider it.\n  I want to thank my colleagues. I am sure we will have an overwhelming \nvote today. I think it is an important step forward.\n  I would like to thank all of the veterans organizations and veterans \nadvocates who have made the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act for \nAmerican Veterans a reality. But I would also like to urge my \ncolleagues to understand that this problem, this serious problem, of \n8,000 veteran suicides each year is not going away anytime soon. So do \nnot believe the passage of this legislation will somehow be a cure-all. \nThat can only come through long and persistent efforts and care and \nconcern for our veterans who have given so much to their country. So I \nam very honored to be a part of this legislation.\n  Again, I want to thank the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee and the ranking member, Senator Sanders. I would like to \nthank Senator Burr, who was ranking member previously.\n  My friends, we have a long way to go. We have a lot of young men who \nhave not been able to come all the way home. It is our job and our \nobligation to do everything we possibly can not only to honor them but \nto see that they have a safe and secure future, and one in which the \nthought of suicide would never be any consideration.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans--\nSAV--Act, of which I am a cosponsor.\n  This bill addresses a true public health crisis facing our Nation's \nmilitary members and veterans: suicide. You see, an estimated 22 \nveterans commit suicide every day. According to data from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, VA, young veterans are particularly at \nrisk, dying by suicide more often than both Active-Duty troops and \ncivilians. In fact, the Department of Defense, DOD, reports that in \n2012 and 2013 more veterans died by committing suicide than died in the \nIraq and Afghanistan wars. This is a serious problem that must be \naddressed.\n  The legislation being considered today is named for a marine who \nserved in Iraq and Afghanistan and who committed suicide in 2011. He \nwas 28. After being honorably discharged from the Marine Corps, Clay \nHunt sought VA medical care for post-traumatic stress disorder. He \nconstantly voiced concerns about the care he was receiving, both in \nterms of scheduling and the treatment received, which consisted solely \nof medication.\n  Clay decided to move closer to his family but had to wait months to \nsee a psychiatrist at the VA medical center. After the appointment, \nClay called his mother on his way home and told her that the VA is way \ntoo stressful of a place and that he can't go back. Two weeks later, \nClay took his own life. Despite Clay Hunt's proactive and open approach \nto seeking care to address his injuries, the VA system did not \nadequately address his needs.\n  Unfortunately, this story is far too common. In 2014, Jeremy Sears, a \nCamp Pendleton, CA, marine who survived several tours in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, also took his own life after struggling to receive \nadequate care from the San Diego VA Medical Center. It took the VA 16 \nmonths to respond to Jeremy's disability claim. After the long wait, \nJeremy received a letter that he had been denied all disability \npayments, despite reporting symptoms of traumatic brain injury and \nhearing loss from his military service. The 35-year-old former Camp \nPendleton marine tragically took his own life almost 2 years after \nbeing discharged from service.\n  These tragedies are unacceptable, and it is our moral duty to ensure \nthat the men and women who bravely serve our country have access to the \nmental health care needed to address serious mental health conditions \nlike depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n  What does this bill do? The SAV Act is an important bill that will \nimprove the delivery of mental health care to veterans and will address \nobstacles in the VA and DOD health care systems.\n  Under this bill, special care and attention will be given to service \npersonnel transitioning from Active-Duty to veteran status through \ncommunity outreach and peer support groups. The legislation also calls \nfor a one-stop Web site with suicide prevention resources for veterans. \nIn addition, to make recruitment of mental health professionals easier, \nthe bill creates new incentives for psychiatrists who agree to serve at \nthe VA. Both Department of Defense and VA suicide-prevention programs \nwill also be required to be evaluated each year to increase \naccountability and improve care. Lastly, this bill empowers the VA to \ncollaborate with Veteran Service Organizations and nonprofit mental \nhealth organizations to combat veteran suicide.\n  Suicide is a deadly epidemic for veterans that the Federal Government \nmust address. This bill will be a starting point, by requiring the VA \nto prioritize suicide prevention. However, Congress must continue to \nwork to address this critical public health issue,\n\n[[Page S719]]\n\nand I hope this will be one of many steps we will take to prevent \nveteran and military suicides.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support the passage of the Clay Hunt \nSuicide Prevention for American Veterans, SAV, Act.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I remain strongly committed to our \nveterans and their families. When America sends our men and women to \nwar, we vow to care for them when they return. However, throughout the \nNation, we have seen reports of our veterans enduring long wait times, \nsubstandard quality of care, and a lack of transparency at the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs.\n  In my great State of Oklahoma, we have a large population of veterans \nat roughly 340,000. From 2005-2012, there was an increase of 34 percent \nin the annual veteran suicide rate in Oklahoma, totaling 1,018 veteran \nsuicide deaths. An average of 127 deaths per year is not acceptable. We \nmust help our veterans get access to the best mental health and suicide \nprevention programs.\n  I believe the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for Americans bill will \nprovide opportunities for the VA to work collaboratively with local \ncommunity organizations and require an evaluation of the various mental \nhealth care programs to identify the efficiencies or lack thereof. It \nwill also allow the VA to compete in recruiting the necessary staff for \nthe mental health care and suicide prevention programs. We cannot allow \nVA psychiatry positions to remain open for long periods of time, and \nthe education loan repayment pilot program will assist the VA in \nattracting the much needed psychiatrists to support those currently \nemployed with the abundant workload. With this bill, Congress will \nexercise its constitutional right to oversight of the VA while \nrequiring the Department to use the resources it already has.\n  Freedom is not free. Many of our veterans and their families have \npaid and continue to pay the price for us and our great Nation. It is \nour duty to honor the promises made to them in return for their \nsacrifices.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I have spoken repeatedly on this floor \nabout the cost of war. In doing so, I have tried to remind the American \npeople and my colleagues that the cost of war does not end when the \nlast shots are fired and the last missiles launched. The cost of war is \nvery, very expensive not just in dollars and cents but in terms of \nhuman life and human suffering.\n  The cost of war in Iraq and Afghanistan is almost 7,000 dead. Nearly \n52,000 servicemembers have returned with physical wounds; however, more \nthan 200,000 service men and women are seeking treatment for post-\ntraumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injury.\n  The cost of war is nearly 1,600 servicemembers who face amputations, \nto include a number of with multiple amputations.\n  The cost of war is veterans returning home unable to find jobs and \nget their feet back on the ground financially.\n  The cost of war is high divorce rates and the impact that family \nstress has on children.\n  The cost of war is mothers losing their children to suicide.\n  Late last session the Veterans' Affairs Committee heard from two \nmothers--Valerie Pallotta from Vermont and Susan Selke from Texas--\nwhose lives have been forever changed because of the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  The experience these two mothers shared with the committee goes well \nbeyond anything I can put into words. They shared powerful stories \nabout their own cost of war--the tragic suicides of their sons \nfollowing their return from combat. They talked about their sons' \nstruggles with post-traumatic stress disorder and efforts to seek help \nfrom the Department of Veterans Affairs. It is with the stories shared \nby these mothers in mind that I come to the floor today.\n  As chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I worked hard to \nlisten to and address concerns brought to my attention by veterans, \ntheir family members and advocates within the military and veterans' \ncommunity.\n  The ideas in the bill under consideration--which will be voted on \nshortly--are the result of the work of the families and friends of \nthose who have committed suicide, advocates, and countless others who \ncontinue to search and fight for solutions to address the staggering \nrate of suicide among veterans.\n  This bill is a good start. Everyone needs to be thanked for their \nefforts, especially the mothers who came before our committee and \nshared their thoughts on mental health and suicide.\n  But, we can never do too much in the area of veterans' mental health \nand suicide. That is why I intend to pursue additional enhancements at \nanother time. I do not want to slow down the bill we will be voting on \ntoday--but I want my colleagues to recognize that much, much more needs \nto be done to assist veterans and families struggling with either their \nown mental health conditions or a loved ones' mental health condition. \nWe can never do enough.\n  Briefly, let me tell you what additional provisions I will be pursing \nat a later time.\n  Currently, returning veterans have 5 years from their date of \ndischarge to enroll in the VA health care system and receive free \nhealth care for their medical conditions resulting from their service.\n  The bill we are voting on today would provide an additional 1-year \nwindow during which VA can provide health care for veterans whose \neligibility for the initial 5-year period has lapsed.\n  Now, is that exactly what I wanted? No. I think the period of \neligibility for health care at VA following separation from service \nshould be 10 years.\n  We hear time and time again that for many veterans, problems do not \nnecessarily manifest until years after they have returned from war. \nThen it might take some time before they actually seek assistance at \nVA. However, recognizing the importance of getting this legislation to \nthe President's desk as soon as possible, I intend to pursue that \nprovision at another time.\n  During her testimony before this committee last session, Valerie \nPallotta, the mother of a veteran who succumbed to suicide, talked \nabout her desire to see complementary and alternative medicine \nopportunities expanded at VA.\n  While VA has made significant strides in providing complementary and \nalternative medicine at VA medical centers, access to such services is \nnot standardized across VA. I commend VA's current efforts, but more \nmust be done.\n  I will pursue expanding access to complementary and alternative \nmedicine at another time, so that we can increase the likelihood that \nveterans will get the care that not only meets their needs, but their \npersonal preferences, as well.\n  We have also heard that families, who are caring for loved ones with \nmental health conditions, are highly stressed and looking for resources \nto help their loved ones. At the moment, VA has only limited capacity \nto offer support and education to family members and caregivers of \nveterans with mental health conditions. This is an issue I will pursue \nin the near-future.\n  We could never do too much to help veterans and their family members \nafter these veterans return from war. As I said earlier, this bill is a \ngood start--but we have much more to do.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I know we are close to a vote on the Clay \nHunt suicide prevention bill. As chairman of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, who has just left the Veterans' Administration this morning \nafter a 3-hour meeting with employees, I want to tell all of the \nMembers of the Senate how much I appreciate their commitment to this \nbill, how much I would appreciate their vote in favor of this bill.\n  Every day in America, 22 veterans commit suicide. Every year in \nAmerica, 8,000 veterans commit suicide. Eight thousand is more than all \nwho have lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan over the last 13 \nyears. Suicide is a critical problem in the VA. The Clay Hunt bill \nfocuses and targets on what we need: more psychiatric care, more \naccountability in the VA, and an investment in the future of our \nsoldiers who have come home after defending our country for ourselves.\n  As chairman of the committee, I want to thank Senator McCain, Senator \nBlumenthal, Senator Boozman, and Senator Burr for their tremendous \neffort and work to bring this about. I want to thank the members of the \ncommittee who unanimously passed\n\n[[Page S720]]\n\nthis out, including the Presiding Officer, in the very first meeting of \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n  I encourage every Member of the Senate to vote for the Clay Hunt \nsuicide prevention bill and make an investment in the future of the \nlives we will save of our veterans who return with mental health \nproblems.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking Chairman \nIsakson for giving the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American \nVeterans Act the priority it needs and deserves. I know the Presiding \nOfficer, as a veteran, understands and supports the vital mission of \nthis legislation.\n  I also want to thank the veterans service organizations, particularly \nthe IAVA, for the critical role they have played in heightening \nawareness and educating the American public about the scourge that \nveteran suicide reflects in our society, the unacceptable 22 veterans \nwho commit suicide every day in the greatest, strongest Nation in the \nhistory of the world.\n  Our veterans all too often succumb to the invisible wounds and inner \ndemons that come home with them. They lack the mental health care they \nneed and deserve because the VA lacks the resources to provide that \nhealth care.\n  I know the VA is committed to do better. Senator Isakson and I have \njust returned from 3 hours at the VA, where we heard the Secretary, as \nwell as his top-ranking staff, commit to using this act as a means of \nenhancing and increasing the quality and quantity of mental health care \nour veterans deserve. Far too many of our veterans have succumbed to \nsuicide, including a friend of mine, Justin Eldridge, whose widow \nJoanna was my guest at the State of the Union.\n  She has struggled in the wake of his death with their children to \nsurvive this tragedy. Her courage and strength mirror those same \nqualities of bravery and fortitude demonstrated by Susan Selke who \ntestified before our committee about her son Clay Hunt, for whom this \nbill is named. My hope is we can continue this bipartisan work \ntogether.\n  I thank Senator McCain, the cosponsor of this bill, and hope we keep \nfaith with all of our veterans and make the VA the pioneer and champion \nof mental health care so we end the scourge of veteran suicide in this \ngreat Nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask for a vote to be called, and I ask \nthat it be a rollcall vote on the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for \nAmerican Veterans Act.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The bill was ordered to a third reading and was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Kirk).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz).

The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, as we begin this debate on funding for \nthe Department of Homeland Security, we face some fundamental \nquestions: Are we going to prioritize the safety and security of the \nAmerican people? Or are we going to put the country at risk because of \nan ideological disagreement?\n  That is the choice I believe we face with this bill. We can either \npass a clean bill that makes critical investments in our Nation's \nsecurity or we can put this country at risk by playing politics with \nthe funding for the Department of Homeland Security.\n  We all know these are dangerous times that we live in. Every day, new \nthreats emerge that endanger our citizens at home and our allies \nabroad. The Department of Homeland Security's role in protecting our \ncountry from these threats cannot be overstated, and its funding should \nnot be controversial.\n  Right now, the U.S. law enforcement community is on high alert for \nterror threats after attacks in Sydney, Australia, and Ottawa, Canada, \nand in Paris. Just 2 weeks ago, an Ohio man was arrested when \nauthorities discovered he was plotting to blow up the U.S. Capitol in \nan ISIS-inspired plan. I believe, as the Presiding Officer understands, \nthe man was from Ohio.\n  ISIS has thousands of foreign fighters, including Americans, among \ntheir ranks who seek to return to their home countries to do harm--not \nto mention the barbarity of ISIS today in killing the Jordanian pilot \nwhom they had in their custody.\n  These are very real threats--a clear and present danger to the \nhomeland--and because they are so real, we need our counterterrorism \nintelligence community operating at full strength. We need the entire \nDepartment of Homeland Security fully engaged in keeping our Nation \nsafe.\n  Last week, President Bush's two Homeland Security Secretaries, Tom \nRidge and Michael Chertoff, joined former DHS Secretary Janet \nNapolitano in a letter to Congress. The three of them wrote:\n\n       The national security role that the Department of Homeland \n     Security plays . . . is critical to ensuring that our nation \n     is safe from harm. . . . It is imperative that we ensure that \n     DHS is ready, willing, and able to protect the American \n     people . . . we urge you not to risk funding for the \n     operations that protect every American and pass a clean DHS \n     funding bill.\n\n  All three former Secretaries--two of whom served under a Republican \nPresident and one under a Democratic President--are warning us that the \nsafety and security of our Nation are at risk if we hold up funding for \nHomeland Security operations.\n  Anything short of passing a clean funding bill will endanger \nimportant security operations and could very well put our citizens at \nrisk. But because of the anti-immigration riders that have been \nattached by House Republicans, the bill we are about to vote on cannot \nbecome law. Senate Democrats are not going to support it. The President \nhas already said he will veto it. And, furthermore, according to the \nnonpartisan\n\n[[Page S721]]\n\nCongressional Budget Office, the bill also adds $7.5 billion to the \ndeficit.\n  Last week, Senator Mikulski and I introduced a clean bill that is \nmodeled after the bicameral, bipartisan agreement that was negotiated \nlast December by Senator Mikulski, who was then chair of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, and Congressman Hal Rogers, then chair of the \nHouse Appropriations Committee. The bipartisan bill negotiated by \nSenator Mikulski and Congressman Rogers is a good bill. It is in line \nwith the Murray-Ryan budget deal. It will help keep our Nation safe and \nsecure, funding key counterterrorism, intelligence, and law enforcement \nactivities, and will also strengthen the protections on our borders.\n  So our position on this issue is clear: Congress needs to pass a \nclean, full-year funding bill without any controversial immigration \nriders that are not going to be able to gain support, that the \nPresident has already said he is going to veto. It is that simple. \nThere is too much at stake for the security of our Nation to play \npolitics with this bill.\n  Before I conclude, I would note again that the House-passed \nDepartment of Homeland Security funding bill includes several \nimmigration-related provisions that draw budget points of order against \nthe bill. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the \nimmigration-related provisions would increase the deficit by $7.5 \nbillion over 10 years. In addition, the bill includes language relating \nto the budgetary treatment of these provisions. The result is multiple \npoints of order that would not apply to the bill if the immigration \nprovisions had not been added.\n  Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry: Does a budget point of \norder lie against H.R. 240 pursuant to section 311(a)(2)(B) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is advised that the point of order \nlies.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Does a budget point of order lie against the bill \npursuant to section 311(a)(3) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is advised that the point of order \ndoes lie.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. And does a budget point of order lie against the bill \npursuant to section 306 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is advised again that the budget \npoint of order does lie.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to highlight the importance of \nvoting yes to proceed to the Department of Homeland Security \nappropriations bill for 2015, H.R. 240. This bill, which has passed the \nHouse, is necessary to protect our borders, fight terrorism, and defend \ncommunities under threat from natural disasters. The list of national \nsecurity-related programs this bill provides resources for is long, but \nbefore I speak to those programs in greater detail, I will reinforce \nthe importance of proceeding to this DHS appropriations bill.\n  DHS's funding expires on February 27. To my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle who do not want to proceed to this bill, I would just \npoint out, we need to take up this DHS appropriations funding bill and \ndebate it--to let the Senate do its work.\n  We just passed a Keystone bill after the consideration of more than \n40 amendments. At the end of the day, we were able to produce a bill \nthat garnered 62 votes. I urge my colleagues to let the Senate do its \nbusiness. Vote yes on cloture on the motion to proceed.\n  Now I would like to walk through some of the things this bill funds. \nI want to remind my colleagues how critical these DHS operations are to \nthe economic prosperity, public safety, and security of the American \npeople.\n  The bill provides $39.67 billion in net discretionary appropriations \nplus $6.4 billion in disaster funding.\n  Let's take a look at some of the critical security functions this \nbill provides.\n  The bill provides $10.7 billion for Customs and Border Protection--an \nincrease of $119 million over fiscal year 2014. It supports record \nlevels of personnel, tactical infrastructure, technology, and air and \nmarine assets, including 21,370 Border Patrol agents; 23,775 Customs \nand Border Protection officers; miles of fencing and border roads; \nfixed and mobile surveillance and detection technology; aircraft and \nvessels outfitted with the latest sensor technology, as well as \nunmanned aerial systems; reused technology from the Department of \nDefense, such as tethered aerostat radar systems.\n  The bill also includes funding for a biometric exit pilot program in \nairports in 2015, as well as improvements to the Department's biometric \nsystem to support exit implementation in the future.\n  The bill provides $5.96 billion for Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement, ICE--an increase of $689 million over fiscal year 2014, \nwhich is a 13-percent increase.\n  It holds the administration's feet to the fire by maintaining a \nrecord 34,000 adult detention beds.\n  It responds to the recent flood of families coming across our border \nby significantly increasing family detention beds from 96 to 3,828.\n  It provides increases for the criminal alien program and for fugitive \noperations, both of which are critical to identifying, apprehending, \nand removing the criminals that the administration claims are a \npriority.\n  The bill provides increases for Homeland Security Investigations to \ncombat human trafficking, cyber crime, child exploitation, and drug \nsmuggling.\n  It also includes $50 million for the Visa Security Program and \nsupports enforcement to address visa overstays.\n  In addition, the bill provides strong support for the Secret Service, \nan organization that requires reform and congressional oversight, given \nrecent incidents, with $81 million above fiscal year 2014.\n  In addition to funding increases associated with preparations for the \n2016 campaign season, the bill provides $25 million to begin addressing \nsecurity needs at the White House complex.\n  Recognizing the need for a state-of-the-art biosafety level 4 \nresearch facility to prepare for and respond to animal-borne and other \nbiologic threats, this bill provides the funding necessary to construct \nthe National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility.\n  The bill provides more than $10 billion for the Coast Guard. It \ncontinues our commitment to recapitalization of the Coast Guard fleet, \nincluding funding the 8th National Security Cutter. And it takes a \nserious step to address nearer term heavy ice breaker needs with $8 \nmillion for preserving the Polar Sea.\n  The bill supports our cyber security efforts as a nation, both \nprotecting government systems and working with the private sector to \nshare threat information and protective measures.\n  Since homeland security is a national effort, the bill continues \nfunding for grant programs to State and local firefighters, emergency \nmanagers, and law enforcement--$467 million for State homeland security \ngrants, including $55 million for Operation Stonegarden related to \nborder security; $800 million for the Urban Area Security Initiative, \nport security grants, and transit security grants; $680 million for \nfire assistance grants; $350 million for Emergency Management Program \ngrants.\n  For research and development efforts, funding is provided consistent \nwith fiscal year 2014 levels. The Science and Technology Directorate \nsupports research and development at our national labs, with our \nuniversity partners, and in the private sector to meet homeland \nsecurity needs.\n  The bill also provides for aviation security screening operations by \nthe TSA, law enforcement training needs by the Federal Law Enforcement \nTraining Center, and E-Verify, which supports businesses across the \nUnited States in hiring legal workers.\n  Finally, the bill provides the requested almost $7 billion for the \nDisaster Relief Fund to assist with recovery costs for communities hit \nby natural disasters.\n  What the bill does not fund is the President's Executive actions. The \nHouse bill includes several amendments that are targeted at reversing \nthe President's actions and articulating priorities for immigration \nenforcement.\n\n[[Page S722]]\n\n  The President's actions overstepped his authority. His actions put \nillegal immigrants ahead of legal immigrants who are hoping to be a \npart of the American dream, who are following and respecting the \nNation's laws.\n  The immigration system is broken, but it cannot be fixed through \nExecutive actions that exceed the President's authority. Instead, it \nshould be accomplished through legislative reforms that start with \nborder security, do not provide amnesty, and respect the rule of law.\n  I leave my colleagues with this thought: We need to support these \nvital national security programs. Vote yes on cloture on the motion to \nproceed to this bill, and let's get to work.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I certainly appreciate Senator Hoeven, who chairs the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, for laying out the \ncase for the importance of the funding for critical security agencies \nin this bill--for the Coast Guard, for Customs and Border Patrol, for \nefforts to address security at our border, for cyber security.\n  As the Senator pointed out, there is a lot of very important funding \nin this bill to address homeland security. I wonder if the Senator \nagrees with me that we should support the funding of this bill and that \nif we are going to have a debate about the President's Executive \nactions, it should be a separate debate on immigration rather than \nputting at risk the funding in this bill to protect our Nation.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I would like to respond to my colleague \nfrom the State of New Hampshire. I thank her for her work on our \nAppropriations Committee on the Department of Homeland Security and--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will yield.\n  All time for debate has expired.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, she and I will be continuing to work \ntogether on this and other important issues, but the reality is that we \nneed to proceed to this bill so that we can get the funding in place.\n  Let's proceed to the bill. Let's have the debate. Let's have \namendments. Let's do the work of the Senate on this important \nlegislation. That is why we need a ``yes'' on this cloture motion to \nproceed--so we can get on this funding bill and go to work, have \ndebate, have amendments, and do the work of the Senate on funding DHS, \nwhich is very important for our country.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to H.R. 240, making appropriations for the Department \n     of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2015.\n         Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, Richard Burr, Jerry Moran, \n           John Thune, Johnny Isakson, Marco Rubio, Roy Blunt, Pat \n           Roberts, Deb Fischer, John Boozman, David Vitter, Tim \n           Scott, Roger F. Wicker, Richard C. Shelby, Michael B. \n           Enzi, Rand Paul.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to proceed to H.R. 240, an act making appropriations for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending September \n30, 2015, and for other purposes, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Kirk).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 51, the nays are \n48. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is entered.\n  The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yesterday President Obama, as part of the \nrollout of his blueprint budget that calls for more than $2 trillion in \nnew taxes and adds more than $8 trillion to our national debt over the \nnext 10 years, visited the Department of Homeland Security to urge the \nHouse of Representatives to pass a funding bill for that Department.\n  It struck me as somewhat odd that the President would go to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and ask the House to pass a bill to \nfund the Department of Homeland Security since they have already done \nit. They passed a $40 billion funding bill to fund the Department of \nHomeland Security. It seems to me the President--rather than giving a \nspeech at the Department of Homeland Security--needs to be talking to \nMembers of his own political party. If the President wants Congress to \npass a Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill, then he \nneeds to talk to our friends in the minority in the Senate who just \nblocked consideration of a $40 billion Department of Homeland Security \nfunding bill.\n  I know what they will say. They will say: We don't like parts of the \nbill. But the only way to finish a bill is to start a bill, and today \nthey voted to refuse to start that process.\n  Why in the world is it that the Senate Democrats will not even allow \nthis particular legislation to be debated and amended? One of the \nreasons is that they probably don't want to revisit the President's own \nrepeated assertions--22 different times--when he said he didn't believe \nhe had the legal authority to issue the Executive action he issued in \nNovember of 2014. Twenty-two times he said: I don't have the authority.\n  In 2013, when the President was speaking at an immigration event, he \nwas interrupted by a heckler who urged him to stop deportations by \nExecutive fiat. In response, the President said:\n\n       If in fact I could solve all these problems without passing \n     laws in Congress, then I would do so. But we're also a nation \n     of laws--that's part of our tradition.\n\n  Thus spoke the President of the United States on 1 of those 22 \ndifferent occasions.\n  Maybe our colleagues in the minority don't want to debate this bill \nbecause they don't want to have to answer questions from their \nconstituents about those 22 different occasions when the President \nsaid, ``I don't have the authority,'' and explain how they now agree \nwith him and that somehow he miraculously got that authority absent an \nact of Congress.\n  I can think of another reason our friends on the Democratic side are \nreluctant to allow us to even begin debate on this legislation. I have \nhad the honor of participating in naturalization ceremonies all across \nmy State. I\n\n[[Page S723]]\n\nhave witnessed men and women who were born in other countries, came to \nthe United States of America, raised their right hand and swore \nallegiance to the U.S. Constitution. They may have come from Mexico, \nIndia, Vietnam or from any one of a number of other countries, but they \ndecided, notwithstanding from where they came, they wanted to be an \nAmerican.\n  Those naturalization ceremonies are almost like birthdays--a \ncelebration of one's birth--because in a way it is a birthday. It is a \nday when they become proud Americans.\n  As Americans we believe in the benefits of legal immigration because \nin many cases it was our parents, grandparents or great-grandparents \nwho came here from another country in search of the American dream--a \nbetter place to live, work, and raise a family.\n  Sadly, the President of the United States has made it clear his \nadministration is willing to take the people who played by the rules \nand applied for immigration and legal status to become an American \ncitizen and kick them to the back of the line. This President has \nkicked the people who played by the rules to the back of the line, and \nhe has moved people who did not play by the rules to the front of the \nline. That is fundamentally unfair. It also sends a terrible message \nthat we are going to reward people who break the law and we are going \nto punish people who follow and comply with the law.\n\n  So maybe our colleagues across the aisle don't really want to talk \nabout that, and that is the reason they voted not to proceed to even \nbegin to debate this important Department of Homeland Security \nappropriations bill--again, a bill that was passed by the House that \nwould fund, to the tune of roughly $40 billion, the functions of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. Yet our friends in the minority have \nsaid: We don't even want to talk about it. I can tell my colleagues \nwhat they don't want to talk about. They don't want to talk about the \nPresident's unconstitutional Executive action which he issued or \nannounced last November.\n  Here are some interesting quotes from some of our colleagues in the \nminority. The senior Senator from West Virginia said: I wish he \nwouldn't do it. He was talking about the President's stated intention \nto issue his Executive action.\n  The senior Senator from Missouri, a member of the minority party, \nsaid: I have to be honest. How this is coming about makes me \nuncomfortable.\n  Then there is the junior Senator from Indiana who said: I am as \nfrustrated as anyone in Congress that it is not doing its job, but the \nPresident shouldn't make such significant policy changes on his own.\n  Then there is the junior Senator from North Dakota, a member of the \nminority party, who said: It could poison any hope of compromise or \nbipartisanship in the new Senate before it has even started. That is \nwhat a Democrat from North Dakota said about the President's stated \nintention to issue his Executive action.\n  The senior Senator from Minnesota said: I have concerns.\n  Then there is Senator King from Maine who said: And I also frankly am \nconcerned about the constitutional separation of powers.\n  The Senator from Maine isn't the only one because 26 different States \nhave filed a lawsuit in the Southern District of Texas challenging the \nconstitutionality of the President's Executive action, and the Federal \ndistrict judge could rule at any time on that.\n  Then there is the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, will my colleague from Texas yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will not yield at this time, Mr. President. I will be \nglad to yield at the conclusion of my remarks if the Senator still has \na question.\n  Then there is the Senator from Montana who said: I would prefer that \nthe Congress act, yes.\n  Then there is the Senator from Delaware who said: What I would say to \nCongress, I am going to give you a little bit of time in the new \nCongress, and I expect you to do something.\n  So that is eight Members of the minority party who said they are more \nthan a little uncomfortable about what the President has done. Yet \ntoday the Members of the minority party have voted in lockstep to deny \na debate, any opportunity to discuss how to fund the Department of \nHomeland Security, how to rein in a reckless President who has \noverreached his constitutional authority.\n  Here are some other provisions that are actually in the House bill \nthat perhaps some of the Members of the minority are a little bit \nnervous to talk about, much less vote on.\n  The House has offered as part of their bill a rider which defunds \nExecutive actions treating domestic violence, sexual abuse, and child \nexploitation offenders as secondary priorities for removal. In other \nwords, the President's Executive action took people who have actually \ncommitted crimes--not just entered the country illegally but committed \nother crimes--and made them nonpriority in terms of removal.\n  Then, of course, there is the provision of the House bill that says \nwe don't want to disadvantage legal immigrants and people who played by \nthe rules because the House recognized that is exactly what the \nPresident's Executive action did. It kicked the people who played by \nthe rules to the back of the line and the people who did not to the \nfront of the line. But our friends in the minority obviously don't want \nto talk about that either.\n  Millions of foreign-born immigrants have become successful, patriotic \nAmerican citizens. We are richer as a country because of the \ncontributions they have made to our great land.\n  The fundamental choice we have is, are we going to have controlled \nimmigration or uncontrolled immigration? The President and apparently \nhis political party have embraced uncontrolled, illegal immigration as \ntheir cause.\n  We, on the other hand, have said we believe in the benefits to our \ngreat country of legal immigration and assimilation because that is who \nwe are. All of us have a family story somewhere back in our history. \nMine goes back to the 19th century following a potato crop famine in \nIreland that caused my forebears to immigrate to Canada and then to the \nUnited States. Everybody has a story like that.\n  But it is a sad and important realization that the President, through \nhis Executive action, is disrespecting the very individuals who have \nplayed by the rules and whom we celebrate as great, patriotic \nAmericans. But apparently our friends in the minority don't even want \nto talk about it, so that is why they stopped this funding bill--$40 \nbillion to fund the Department of Homeland Security--and refused to \neven talk about it, much less debate it. They are going to come out \nhere on the floor, I trust, and click through the days and say: Well, \nwe only have 3 weeks until the Department runs out of money. It is like \nthe old story about the teenager who murders his own parents, and then \nhe goes to court and pleads for mercy because--he says: Judge, I am an \norphan. That is what our friends in the minority have done.\n  This is a crisis of their own making. In fact, we don't want a \ncrisis. We want to eliminate government by crises. That is why the \nHouse has passed the responsible piece of legislation they have. That \nis why we ought to take it up today. If they don't like it--I know \nthere are Members on our side who disagree with certain portions of \nit--then we ought to debate it and we ought to vote. Any way we look at \nit, the Senate ought to at least have the debate on this legislation.\n  Last week our colleague from Illinois, the assistant minority leader, \ncame to the floor and praised the new majority leader, Senator \nMcConnell, for his leadership during the first few weeks of the new \nRepublican majority here in the Senate. He said:\n\n       I hope that in our role in the minority, we can work with \n     you to achieve at least debate on the floor if not some \n     significant legislation.\n\n  That was a nice moment. But then the very next day, on a call with \nreporters, my colleague from Illinois pledged to filibuster the House-\npassed Department of Homeland Security funding bill and refused to even \nallow a debate--a threat they made good on today.\n  So my request to our colleagues on the Democratic side is simple: \nHonor the promise the senior Senator from Illinois made last week to \nhave an open and fair debate and not just shut it down and create \ngovernment by crisis and add to the very dysfunction the voters \nrepudiated on November 4.\n\n[[Page S724]]\n\n  I am glad to yield to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague. I just have a few more questions, \nand then I will say my piece.\n  First, I ask my colleague, is it his party that is in the majority in \nthis body?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Indeed they are--sad, from our point of view.\n  Mr. CORNYN. We are delighted to be.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Isn't it true that the majority has the ability to put \nany bill they want on the floor just about at any time? They can rule \nXIV. They can go through committee. There are many procedural ways to \nget a bill on the floor; is that right?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Again, Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from New \nYork knows well the answer to that is yes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. My final question is this: Since we have a Department of \nHomeland Security that needs funding and the issue of immigration is a \ncontroversial issue--one on which we relish a debate--wouldn't it be \npossible for the majority to pass a Department of Homeland Security \nbill without extraneous and controversial amendments, send that back to \nthe House, and then move immediately to debate the immigration proposal \nthat was added to the bill by the House or any other immigration \nproposal they wish to bring forward? I am not saying they will do it; I \nam just asking my dear friend, isn't that possible procedurally for the \nmajority to do?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, responding to my friend from New York, I \nwould say theoretically the answer to his question is yes. As a \npractical matter, we know the House has passed a particular piece of \nlegislation that we would like to take up. It is what it is. It is the \nhand we have been dealt. That is the base bill to operate from. There \nare, of course, procedures to change it.\n  Senator McConnell, the majority leader of the Senate, has said he \nbelieves there should be an open amendment process, and I trust our \nfriends across the aisle would have a chance to offer an amendment and \nget a vote. If they have the votes, they are going to win.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/03/senate-section/article/S724-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, the distinguished majority leader has \nstated that it is possible within the procedures of this Senate to pass \na homeland security bill, as negotiated by our Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs--and I see the able head of the \nsubcommittee here on the floor, the Senator from New Hampshire--and \nthen move to immigration and bring it to the floor. So all of his \narguments that we are afraid to debate immigration, that we don't want \nto debate immigration are false.\n  There is not one choice, there are two. One is to debate immigration \nfully and openly. The other is to a play a game of hostage, to say: We \nare kidnapping Homeland Security, and now let's have a debate on how \nmuch the ransom should be.\n  No one in America wants us to legislate that way. I know my \ncolleagues in the Senate didn't do that. It was the House that did it, \nled by thinking by the junior Senator from Texas. His view, as I have \nheard him say, is that what the President did on immigration is so \nawful that we should shut down the Department of Homeland Security as a \nway of forcing the President to go along with what the junior Senator \nfrom Texas wants.\n  When are our colleagues on the other side of the aisle going to \nlearn? They followed Senator Cruz a year and a half ago when he wanted \nto shut down the government over ObamaCare. They actually did shut down \nthe government for a few weeks and were so widely excoriated by just \nabout all Americans that they backed off. But they haven't learned. \nThey are following the junior Senator from Texas, Mr. Cruz, into a cul-\nde-sac at best and over a cliff at worst.\n  We are happy to debate homeland security but not with a gun to our \nhead or the President's head; not to say: If you don't do it my way, I \nam going to shut down the government. The vast majority of Americans--\nDemocratic, Independent, Republican, North, East, South, West--don't \nbelieve that is how we should legislate. I am surprised--I am almost \nshocked, with some of the wisdom we have in the leadership of this \nbody, that they are allowing that to happen. We will not. We have the \nability to block it, and block it we will. We will not play hostage. We \nwill not risk shutting down Homeland Security--as I am sure my \ncolleague from New Hampshire will talk about--a vital Department. We \nwill not let their being upset with DREAM kids jeopardize our safety \nwith ISIS. We will not let that happen.\n\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to pass the bill \nthat has already been put on the floor--a clean Homeland Security \nbill--then they may decide to put immigration on the floor, and we will \nbe happy, happy, happy to debate it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I have to say that I am a little \nconfused about what is happening right now. The Republican Party is in \ncharge--totally in charge of Congress. I am sure Speaker Boehner's and \nMajority Leader McConnell's staffs talk on a daily basis. I am sure \nthey are talking, coordinating, and realizing the Republican Party now \nhas the responsibility of showing this country they can run Congress.\n  So what do we do right out of the gate? We threaten to shut down the \nDepartment of our government that protects our homeland while ISIS is \nburning prisoners alive on film? The irony of this is Republicans are \nin charge. All they have to do is present a clean funding bill for \nHomeland Security, and the very next day take up immigration reform and \ndebate it. But they are trying to play a political trick and trying to \nmake it look as if somehow their disagreement with the President on \nimmigration trumps the protection of our country and that somehow we \nwill all go along with that.\n  Speaker Boehner mentioned me. My friend and my colleague from Texas \njust mentioned me. Yes, I said it. I am uncomfortable with the \nPresident issuing Executive orders such as this--no matter what party \nit is, no matter who the President is. But what I said when I made that \nstatement is--I pivoted, and I said: Do you know how we prevent that \nfrom happening? We have a House of Representatives that is willing to \ntake up and debate immigration reform. This body passed a bipartisan \nimmigration reform bill by a wide margin. It wasn't even a squeaker. \nMany of my Republican colleagues voted for it, understanding this is a \npublic policy area in our country that needs to be addressed.\n  We can't make it a political punching bag on either side. My party \ncan't say: We are for the immigrants; we get their votes. And the \nRepublican Party can't say: Well, we are for the tea party, and we are \nagainst all immigrants. We need to come together and do public policy \nin a system that is broken. The bill we passed here was amazing in \nterms of border security. But Speaker Boehner wouldn't take it up for \nmore than 18 months. Speaker Boehner wouldn't even allow it to be \ndebated on the floor of the House.\n  Now the Republicans are in charge. Do they take up immigration \nreform? Do they have a proposal? By the way, that is the way you get \nrid of the President's Executive order; that is, we do our jobs. We do \nour job. It is a little bit like ``replace'' for health care. I have \nheard repeal and replace for 4 years. Has anybody seen replace? Has it \nbeen identified anywhere? If it is out there, I would love to see it. \nIt has been talked about a lot. The same thing for immigration. If you \ndon't like what the President has done, then put up a bill and let's \ndebate it.\n  By the way, the Republicans have the power to do that immediately \nafter we fund Homeland Security. We don't have to talk about anything \nelse. We can\n\n[[Page S725]]\n\nstay on immigration reform and pound out a compromise and public policy \nthat won't please everyone but will do exactly what the American people \nwant us to do, and that is find a compromise that works.\n  As countries around the world have united in their opposition to ISIS \nand the barbarians who are participating in ISIS activities, as all of \nour allies and some who haven't traditionally been our allies are \nbeefing up their cyber security, their border security, beefing up \ntheir homeland security, their airport security, adding more resources, \nwhat are we doing in America? Talk about a mixed signal--we are \nthreatening to shut ours down. We are threatening to shut ours down to \nscore political points.\n  I know there would be tough votes on immigration reform when we \ndebate it, for me in my State and for many in their States. We had \nthose tough votes last year and the year before. We pounded out a bill \nthat nobody loved, but it was pretty good. It made sure, by the way, \nthat people who had broken the rules went to the back of the line. If \nyou want people who break the rules to go to the back of the line, then \nlet's get busy on immigration reform. But this is exactly the nonsense \nthat frustrates Americans--threatening to shut down a vital part of \nprotecting our country in the name of politics.\n  The notion that the senior Senator from Texas, the assistant majority \nfloor leader, just said--that we were denying a debate--is absurd on \nits face. We debate whatever the Republican Party wants us to debate \nnow. They are in charge. So step up, fund Homeland Security, and move \non to an immigration debate. You will find a lot of willing partners \ntrying to find a way forward but not with this gamesmanship. It is not \ngoing to happen. It isn't going to happen because homeland security is \ntoo important, especially at this moment in our history.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator of New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks from the \nSenators from Missouri and New York because I think they reflect my \nsentiments as well. The senior Senator from Texas suggested that we \ndon't want to debate immigration. We are happy to debate immigration. \nIn fact, I would love to debate immigration reform with our colleagues. \nBut the bill before us is not about immigration reform. It is about \nwhether we are going to fund the Department of Homeland Security. The \nfact is many of the issues the senior Senator from Texas raised about \nimmigration were addressed in the comprehensive immigration reform bill \nthis body passed in 2013. I am happy to go back to that debate, but \nthat debate should not come in place of our willingness to fund \nnational security and the Department of Homeland Security. That is the \nissue that is before us today, and we should not hold up our \nwillingness to fund the Department because there are certain Members of \nthe Republican Party in the House and Senate who want to talk about the \nPresident's Executive action. This bill is not about that. It is about \nwhether we are going to fund the Department of Homeland Security.\n  I thought it might be instructive to point out some of the changes \nCongress has made which are included in this bill and which actually \nstrengthen border security, since that is one of the concerns that has \nbeen raised. Over the past 10 years, Congress has gone to extraordinary \nlengths to secure our borders against the threat of smugglers, of human \ntraffickers, and of illegal immigrants.\n  Since 2005 the combined budgets for Customs and Border Protection and \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement have grown by an astounding 97 \npercent--97 percent--from about $8.5 billion in 2005 to more than $16.7 \nbillion today.\n  In fact, the combined budgets for these two border security agencies \nnow account for more than 42 percent of the entire discretionary \nappropriations of the Department of Homeland Security. But Congress \njust hasn't thrown money at the problem. We have made wise investments \nto ensure our borders are more secure than they have ever been.\n  Since 2011 Congress has steadily maintained 21,370 Border Patrol \nagents. That more than doubles the size of this force since 2001. Over \nthe past 2 years Congress has added 2,000 Customs officers to help stop \nthe flow of illegal drugs and prevent human trafficking while still \nfacilitating legitimate trade.\n  I have been to the San Ysidro border crossing in San Diego. I have \nseen the advanced technologies that have been implemented to make sure \nthat legitimate trade can get across the border yet stop those people \nwho are coming illegally.\n  Congress has deployed enhanced border security technology, including \nintegrated fixed towers, remote and mobile video surveillance systems, \ntethered aerostats, and other technology to secure our southern border.\n  We have also funded the construction of 652 miles of vehicle and \npedestrian fencing at critical locations determined by the Border \nPatrol agents on the ground. The Department's ability to detect illegal \nborder traffic has grown substantially due to simultaneous investments \nin airborne assets, including Blackhawk helicopters, multirole \nenforcement aircraft, and surveillance planes critical in the war \nagainst drugs, as well as nine unmanned, unarmed Predator aerial \nsystems.\n  Since 2011 Congress has provided more than $721 million above the \nPresident's request for these important airborne assets that strengthen \nour border security. In the bipartisan full-year budget that Senator \nMikulski and Congressman Rogers negotiated last December--the same bill \nthat Senator Mikulski and I have introduced in this session of the \nSenate--we included those critical investments made to continue those \nefforts to secure the border. These investments will not occur or they \nare going to be delayed if we have a short-term budget, if we continue \nwith a continuing resolution and, heaven forbid, if we shut down the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, which some of the Members of this body \nand the House have suggested is not a problem for us to do.\n  The clean bill includes a $119 million increase for Customs and \nBorder Protection. This is the funding level that supports the largest \noperational force levels in history--21,370 Border Patrol agents and \n23,775 CBP officers. The agreement restores funding cuts to CBP's \nOffice of Air and Marine proposed by the administration. That enables \nthem to fly more patrols along the border and to continue purchasing \ncritical assets.\n  The clean bill also increases funding for the border security, \nfencing, infrastructure, and technology account by $20 million to \nprovide additional video surveillance systems and adapt surplus Defense \nDepartment equipment for border security purposes.\n  For Customs and Border Protection, a short-term budget also means \nthat pending contracts for border security upgrades are going to be put \non hold. When I met last week with CBP Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske, he \ntold me that $90 million in contracts for mobile and remote video \nsurveillance technology--the very technology that is going to help us \nkeep illegal aliens from coming across the border--is going to be put \non hold due to funding uncertainty.\n  A clean, full-year budget bill provides an increase of $700 million \nfor Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency responsible for \napprehending and detaining undocumented immigrants in this country. If \nwe don't pass on full-year bill, ICE will have insufficient resources \nto maintain a statutorily mandated level of 34,000 detention beds for \ndetaining illegal immigrants, the vast majority of which are criminals. \nThey are going to fall over 4,000 beds short of that mandated level \nunder a continuing resolution. Furthermore, they will have no funding \nto complete construction and continue operating new family detention \nfacilities in Texas.\n  Now, 3,000 family detention beds are supposed to be completed in \nTexas to deal with the surge of unaccompanied children and families to \nthe southwest border. The very people who are complaining about border \nsecurity, who are complaining about illegal immigrants coming into this \ncountry are opposing the funding that would address that border \nsecurity. It makes no sense.\n  The bill also increases ICE's capability to engage in domestic and \ninternational investigations with a $67 million increase for antihuman \nsmuggling\n\n[[Page S726]]\n\nand traffic activities, to combat cyber crime, to combat drug \nsmuggling, and to expand visa vetting capabilities. With a short-term \nbudget, a continuing resolution, these additional investments will not \nbe made. We should not be holding up this funding bill for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security with critical border protections in it \nbecause we have a few Members of the House and Senate who want to make \nthis an ideological battle about the President's Executive action. \nLet's have that immigration debate, but this is not the place to do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, let me thank Senator Shaheen for her \nleadership on the Homeland Security bill. She has taken that over this \nyear and learned it, knows the ins and outs of it. She is someone who \ntruly cares about being fiscally responsible. She just recently pointed \nout to our caucus that if we pass the House bill with all of the riders \nin it, it would cost $7.5 billion more and put us $7.5 billion more \ninto debt, which I do not think is a fiscally responsible move. So we \nshould be taking a very hard look at these riders as they come through \nfrom the House.\n  I have come to the floor to talk about how important it is for us to \npass a clean appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. I wish to talk about how failing to pass a bill will impact \nthe southern border, impact my State of New Mexico, where DHS plays a \nvital role in security, in business, and in people's daily lives. The \nmen and women at DHS make sure commerce is conducted smoothly across \nour border with Mexico. They make sure workers can get back and forth. \nThey inspect shipments coming into the country, and they protect our \ncommunities from drug smugglers and crime.\n  It is inconceivable to me that Republicans would threaten to stop \nfunding this agency over a policy dispute with the President. I have \nheard Republican leaders say the era of shutdowns was over, but here we \nare again, rapidly approaching the date when DHS funding expires. We \nneed an appropriations bill that does not disrupt this important work.\n  I talk to New Mexicans who live in the border communities. I talk to \nranchers and farmers in my State. Border security is not theoretical. \nIt is not a political game. It is crucial to safety. It is crucial to \ntrade at our ports of entry, such as Santa Teresa and Columbus. In New \nMexico a shutdown of DHS is a threat to our security, to jobs, and to \nour economy.\n  I have read some reports where congressional Republicans have said on \nthe record that a delay in funding DHS would not be a big deal. They \nsay most of the Department's employees are considered essential so they \nwould still be working at our borders and screening airline passengers. \nThat may be true, but those employees would not get paid. I am not \nwilling to tell our Border Patrol agents and TSA officers with families \nto feed that they still need to go to work, but they are not going to \nget paid because Washington cannot get its act together.\n  I know my constituents would feel a lot more secure in border \ncommunities if the Border Patrol officers were getting paid rather than \nworrying about their mortgages, their car payments, tuition payments, \nand other household expenses. Despite the Republican claims that DHS \nwill not actually shut down, there would be significant consequences if \nCongress failed to fund DHS.\n  Consider what would happen to the Federal Law Enforcement Training \nCenter, FLETC as they are called out in New Mexico. FLETC serves as the \nlaw enforcement training academy for 96 Federal agencies. FLETC in \nArtesia, NM, trains all of our Border Patrol agents and Bureau of \nIndian Affairs police officers.\n  If we fail to fund DHS, FLETC training grinds to a halt. This will \nimpact every Federal agency whose law enforcement officers must \ncomplete basic training before they can be deployed in their posts of \nduty. A delay in training impacts securing the Nation's borders, \naviation security, protecting our Nation's leaders and diplomats, \nsecuring Federal buildings, and other countless Federal law enforcement \nactivities.\n  The economic impact is huge. Over 3,000 students, 350 of them in \nArtesia, NM, are expected to be in training at the end of February. If \nDHS is not funded, they have to go back home. This will cost about $2.4 \nmillion in airfare to send students back to their agencies, and then \nturn around and fly them back to FLETC when Congress does its job and \nfunds DHS.\n  Regardless of your views on immigration policy, wasting law \nenforcement's time and taxpayer money does not improve our security. \nArtesia is not a big city. Its economy relies on FLETC. The students \nspend their money at local businesses. Many residents are contract \nemployees at the facility. If FLETC closes, it has a real impact in our \ncommunity.\n  As a New Mexican, I am appalled that a DHS shutdown is even being \nconsidered. We cannot risk our national security, our community safety, \nand our border commerce just so Republicans can prove some sort of \ninside-the-beltway point about how angry they are about immigration \nreform. The House Republican bill threatens to deport millions of \npeople who have been living and working and going to school in our \ncountry for many years. The Senate should choose a different route: Put \na clean bill on the floor, allow an open amendment debate, and enact a \nbill the President can sign before any shutdown occurs.\n  Few States understand the importance of comprehensive immigration \nreform as New Mexico does. We need a system that secures our borders, \nstrengthens families, and supports our economy. In fact, we almost had \njust that. The Senate passed a bipartisan bill in the last Congress, \nbut House Republicans let it die--would not even take it up, would not \nput it on the floor.\n  That bill was not perfect. It did not satisfy everyone in every case, \nbut that is what compromise means. That is what a bipartisan effort \nrequires. Due to the House's failure to act on immigration reform, over \n400,000 people in my State live in immigration limbo, all the while \nthey work and raise families. Deporting these children and families is \nnot a realistic option. We need to focus limited resources, as the \nPresident has done, on securing the border. We need to go after drug \ndealers and gang members and potential terrorists.\n  I and so many other New Mexicans are appalled that Republicans want \nto take out their anger on the DREAMers. They will not commit to real \nreform, but they will commit to chasing down children--innocent \nchildren--brought to this country by their parents. These are inspiring \nyoung people in my State, when I talk about these young DREAMers. They \nhave worked hard. They have persevered. They know and love this country \nas their own.\n  They are young leaders such as Mabel Arellanes. Mabel came to Santa \nFe with her mother from Mexico when she was just 6 years old. Mabel \ngraduated from Capital High School. Her dream was to go to college, but \nher immigration status made that impossible. From the age of 15, Mabel \nworked to help other DREAMers. She helped pass the New Mexico DREAM \nAct. Mabel eventually did get to college and graduated from the \nUniversity of New Mexico with honors. She is in her second year of law \nschool now.\n  Another one of the DREAMers--this is Alejandro Rivera. Another \nDREAMer, he moved to Belen, NM, when he was 7 years old. After high \nschool, Alejandro enrolled at the University of New Mexico. \nUndocumented, he could not get financial aid. He and his mother worked \nhard to pay tuition. Alejandro also volunteered to help other young \npeople get an education and to follow their dreams. He is at work now \non his Ph.D. in education. We may disagree on the specifics of \nimmigration reform, but these DREAMers have earned our admiration. They \nshould not be pushed back into the shadows by the House deportation \nbill.\n  The men and women who work to keep us safe, who screen more than 1 \nmillion people a day through our ports of entry, who patrol our borders \nand help secure our communities should not be a bargaining chip. In New \nMexico we believe homeland security should be a priority, not a talking \npoint. Secretary Johnson at DHS has been very clear. Key security \ninitiatives are left waiting. His predecessors have also been very \nclear. Last week all three former DHS Secretaries, two of whom are \nRepublican, sent a letter\n\n[[Page S727]]\n\nto the Senate leadership urging them to pass a clean funding bill.\n  We live in a very dangerous world. We face terrorist threats at home \nand abroad. Recent events make that very clear. Now is not the time to \nplay politics with homeland security. In fact, there never is a right \ntime for that. The American people are watching. The people of my State \nare watching. They are watching these games. What they see is a lot of \nsound and fury that leads nowhere. What they want is a government that \nworks.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to discuss a matter of \nutmost importance: the Department of Homeland Security funding bill, \nH.R. 240.\n  We live in a world of extraordinary threats. Around the world, \nterrorists continue to devise ways to harm Americans and our interests. \nIn Pakistan and Afghanistan, we see a resurgent Al Qaeda, which \ncontinues to plot attacks from increasingly ungoverned safe havens. \nThroughout the broader Middle East, we see Al Qaeda's affiliate \ngroups--from Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to al-Shabaab--posing \nsophisticated new threats. In Iraq and Syria, we see the self-\nproclaimed Islamic State controlling vast swaths of territory, shocking \nthe world with its brutality, and announcing its deadly serious intent \nto kill Americans. Within Western societies, we see the potential for \nradicalization at home, the danger of which has been made manifest in \nthe attacks on Ottawa, Sydney, and Paris. Inside the United States, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security serves as our critical line of defense \nagainst many of these threats at critical points--from our borders, to \nour airports, to our coasts and our ports.\n  In the realm of cyber space, criminals, terrorists, and other \nnations' governments present sophisticated threats on a variety of \nfronts. Defending against these many serious threats requires efforts \nthat range from securing critical infrastructure to guarding against \nthe sort of espionage and blackmail that Sony recently experienced. \nThese are enormously difficult tasks, especially in an ever-changing, \nhigh-tech operating environment. As the agency charged with protecting \ncivilian networks and coordinating on cyber defense issues with the \nprivate sector, the Department of Homeland Security stands at the \ncrossroads of our Nation's defense against this next generation of \nthreats.\n  When the dangers we face are natural rather than manmade, the \nDepartment plays no less of a critical role. From hurricanes and \ntornadoes to volcanos and forest fires, the Department's component \nagencies, such as FEMA and the Coast Guard, play a critical role in the \npreservation of lives and property.\n  The House-passed bill provides the Department with nearly $40 billion \nin funding--a level consistent with the Budget Control Act's spending \nlimits. That money will not only fund the critical programs I have \nmentioned so far, but will also provide critical improvements on a wide \nrange of fronts, including more border control agents, new ICE \ndetention facilities, increased funding for E-Verify, more effective \nsecurity screening at our airports, improved Secret Service protection, \nincreased support for cyber defense, and important disaster relief.\n  These provisions all enjoy broad bipartisan support, and I commend my \ncolleagues on the Appropriations Committee for their hard work on this \npackage. But this work has been complicated by a troubling development: \nsome of my colleagues--almost all of them Democrats--actively seeking \nto block consideration of this vitally important funding. Why? Only \nbecause they seek to protect a President of their own party who has \nacted lawlessly and overstepped proper constitutional bounds. Instead \nof following the examples of great Senators of the past who stood up to \nPresidents of their own party on behalf of the Constitution and the \nrule of law, today we have witnessed far too many Senators instead \nshamefully toeing the party line.\n  Our Nation's Founders knew, in the sage words of Montesquieu, that \n``in all tyrannical governments . . . the right both of making and \nenforcing the laws is vested in one and the same man . . . and wherever \nthese two powers are united together, there can be no public liberty.'' \nFor this reason, when drafting the Constitution, the Framers divided \npower between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, and \nbetween the Federal Government and the States.\n  Despite these constitutional foundations, President Obama has decided \nthat he ``won't take no for an answer'' when Congress refuses to go \nalong with his agenda. In direct opposition to our centuries-old system \nof legislation and to the binding authority of the Constitution, the \nPresident has audaciously declared that ``when Congress won't act, I \nwill.'' And he has followed up these threats with a variety of \nunilateral Executive actions, many of which are flatly inconsistent \nwith the law and the Constitution.\n  Over the past weeks and months, I have come to the Senate floor to \nspeak out about a series of specific instances that exemplified the \nbrazen lawlessness of this administration. This pervasive and \nillegitimate overreach has come in many different forms.\n  With his recent move on immigration, President Obama seeks not only \nto prevent enforcement proceedings against millions of people \nunlawfully present in this country, but also to license their unlawful \npresence with affirmative work permits. In doing so, he not only \nignores the duly-enacted laws of the land but also seeks to \nunilaterally replace them with his own contradicting policies.\n  The President and his allies in this Chamber want nothing more than \nto turn this into a debate about immigration policy, but that is not \nwhat this debate is about. Immigration is a complex and divisive issue, \nand Americans hold a wide variety of views on the matter that don't \nalways divide neatly along partisan lines. Many conservatives--myself \nincluded--share some of the same policy goals as President Obama. \nInstead, this is a debate about loyalty. As Senators, where do our \nloyalties lie? Do we owe our loyalties first to the Constitution, to \nthe protection of the American people, and to the goal of lawful and \nlasting immigration reform, or do we owe our loyalty, out of reflexive \npartisanship, to a President bent on dangerous unilateralism?\n  President Obama's Executive action is a direct affront to our system \nof republican self-government. The Constitution vests legislative \nauthority with the Congress, not the President alone. Instead, the \nPresident is charged with the duty to ``take care that the laws be \nfaithfully executed.'' This is not a suggestion or an invitation for \nthe President to enforce the law; it is an obligation for him to do so.\n  The President and his executive branch exercise prosecutorial \ndiscretion--the discretion to choose not to prosecute certain cases. \nBut that power stems from considerations of fairness and equity in \nparticular cases. Instead of requiring individualized determinations \nbased on individuals' specific situations, the President's latest \naction sweeps up millions of people based on only a few broad, widely \nshared criteria.\n  An administration, of course, cannot prosecute when there are not \nsufficient resources to do so. But the Obama administration has never \nexplained how these Executive actions will save money. In fact, the \nadministration's own policy advisers have acknowledged that a work-\npermitting program will be expensive and will actually take away \nresources from law enforcement.\n  While no one disagrees that capturing and removing violent criminals \nshould be our highest immigration priority, President Obama has gone \nmuch further and made current immigration law essentially a dead letter \nfor millions of illegal immigrants.\n  Despite the administration's claim to the contrary, President Obama's \naction is not comparable to the Executive actions taken by President \nRonald Reagan and President George H.W. Bush. Even the Washington Post \neditorial board found that claim by the White House to be \n``indefensible.'' Presidents Reagan and Bush simply implemented the \nenforcement priorities established in laws that Congress\n\n[[Page S728]]\n\nactually passed. By contrast, President Obama sought to change the law \nbefore Congress has acted, so he cannot rely on Congress's authority to \nenforce the policy he prefers. Indeed, President Obama has acted \ndirectly in the face of congressional opposition, so we should call his \nExecutive order what it is: an attempt to bypass the constitutionally \nordained legislative process and rewrite the law unilaterally.\n  Perhaps the most persuasive case against this disturbing \nunilateralism was laid out by President Obama himself. On at least 22 \ndifferent occasions since he took office, the President acknowledged \nthat he lacked the legal authority to carry out these actions. As he \nhimself said, by broadening immigration enforcement carve-outs, ``then \nessentially I would be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be \nvery difficult to defend legally. So that's not an option . . . What \nI've said is there is a path to get this done, and that's through \nCongress.'' He was right then; he is wrong now.\n  Faced with this brazen lawlessness, the House of Representatives \npassed a bill that both funds our critical homeland security priorities \nand fulfills our duty to respond to the President's lawless actions. \nThis is a careful line to walk, and our colleagues in the House deserve \npraise for their admirable work. Their bill represents a responsible \ngoverning approach by funding our critical homeland security needs \nwhile preventing President Obama's constitutional abuse.\n  When faced with such a sensible approach, I have frankly been shocked \nand dismayed by the opposition that many of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle have expressed to this bill. On the floor today, many \nof my colleagues have indicated that they will oppose letting us vote \non Homeland Security funding and even oppose allowing a formal debate \nand an open amendment process on the bill unless we allow President \nObama's Executive action to come into effect.\n  Senators of both political parties have often stood up to Executive \nencroachment--not for purposes of partisan gain or political \ngrandstanding, but in defense of Congress as a coordinate and coequal \nbranch of government with its own essential authorities and \nresponsibilities.\n  Implicit in the constitutional design of separating the Federal \nGovernment's powers is the idea that each branch would have the \nincentive and authority to resist encroachments from the other \nbranches, ensuring that unfettered power is not concentrated in any one \nset of hands. The Founders recognized this as indispensable to \npreserving the individual liberty of all citizens. As Madison counseled \nin Federalist 51, ``The great security against a gradual concentration \nof the several powers in the same department consists in giving to \nthose who administer each department the necessary constitutional means \nand personal motives to resist encroachments of the others.''\n  Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia embodied this institutional \nidea as much as anyone with whom I have served. Although he helped to \nlead this body for more than half a century and left us less than 5 \nshort years ago, I was surprised and dismayed to learn recently that \nnearly half of current Members never served alongside Robert C. Byrd.\n  Senator Byrd fiercely defended this body's prerogatives and \nindependence against the encroachments of the executive branch--whether \nthey were Republicans or Democrats in the executive branch. He neither \ncensored his criticisms nor weakened his defenses based on the \nPresident's political party. Even in his twilight years, when President \nObama took office with extraordinarily high approval ratings, Senator \nByrd was willing to hold the new President's feet to the fire to defend \nthe Senate's right to give advice and consent to nominees. He publicly \nchastised the White House for its excessive reliance on czars, \nobserving that unconfirmed policy chieftains ``can threaten the \nConstitutional system of checks and balances. At the worst, White House \nstaff have taken direction and control of programmatic areas that are \nthe statutory responsibility of Senate-confirmed officials.''\n  How far we have fallen since the days of Senator Byrd. Indeed, this \nbrinksmanship by my colleagues in the minority represents the height of \nirresponsibility. They risk our homeland security funding at a time \nwhen our terrorist enemies have repeatedly demonstrated a renewed \ncapability to threaten the homeland. They risk our very system of \nconstitutional government by sacrificing our power to make the laws and \nthe President's duty to enforce them. They risk many of the immigration \nreform goals that are shared across party lines.\n  I am committed to making real progress toward implementing lasting \nimmigration reform. I supported the Senate's comprehensive immigration \nbill in the last Congress. Even though that bill was far from perfect, \nI voted for it because I believe in working together to make much \nneeded progress on this vitally important issue.\n  As I have long argued, the way to get real immigration reform back on \ntrack is not for the President and his allies to insist on his ``my way \nor the highway'' approach. Responsible legislating--not unilateralism--\nis the right way forward on immigration. The President's Executive \naction risked the opportunity for meaningful bipartisan progress and \nundermined the Constitution in the process. And now, his allies in this \nChamber are apparently willing to risk the security of our Nation at a \ntime of extreme danger just to close partisan ranks and provide \npolitical cover to the President.\n  If my colleagues in both parties are serious about protecting our \nConstitution's separation of powers and the liberty it ensures, if they \nare committed to protecting Americans from the sorts of terrorist \nattacks we have lately witnessed with alarming frequency, and if they \nare committed to working together to achieve lasting immigration reform \nthe right way, I urge them to reconsider their vote earlier today and \nto agree to--at the very least--debate this critically important bill.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I rise in opposition to what seems to \nbe a politically motivated Department of Homeland Security funding bill \nthat we had to vote on. Funding the DHS should be a priority of \nCongress. It really should be. I know it is for all of us, and we \ncannot afford to play any of the political partisan games. It is not \nwhat people in this country want see. It doesn't do any of us justice \nwhatsoever. We jeopardize the funding for third largest agency in the \ncountry that will risk lapse in not only our border security, which is \nmost important to all of us, but also cyber security, also Secret \nService protection, disaster response, FEMA, TSA in airports. Our \nNation faces many threats from our enemies, both overseas and here at \nhome, more so than ever before.\n  The world is a troubled place. We all go home and the No. 1 thing \npeople are concerned about is the security of our own Nation. They see \nthis evil going on, and now this horrific, barbaric action we saw that \ntook place with the Jordanian pilot is unimaginable to us, that people \ncould act this way to other humans.\n  With that being said, we have to stand united in supporting our \nvalues and protecting our citizens in the United States of America. \nThis is not the forum for debate on immigration, and I have said that. \nI would hope some of my colleagues would feel the same way. We should \nfully fund the DHS, and this is one that has necessary levels that must \nbe funded for the protection of our country. Then we can deal with our \nimmigration system which is broken. I think we have stated that in the \nSenate. We have stood bravely, we voted, and we did changes and took \nsome tough votes that needed to be made.\n  I agree with all of my Republican colleagues that our borders need to \nbe secure. I don't think any of us disagree with that. It has to be \nsecured first and then must stem the tide of illegal immigrants flowing \ninto our country. We have seen them coming in all different sizes, \nraces, and sexes. It continues to be something we should be concerned \nabout.\n  I also agree with my Republican colleagues that President Obama \nshould\n\n[[Page S729]]\n\nnot have executed action--he should not have used his Executive action \nto make changes in our immigration system. I think we should have \ndoubled down and gotten this bill before us and get the House. I \ndisagree with the House's decision not to even take up the bill we \nsent. In a bipartisan fashion it was debated on this floor, put \ntogether by Democrats and Republicans.\n  I have been here for 4 years. I haven't seen a bill worked more \nintensely than the immigration bill. I haven't seen the border security \nworked more intensely and Republicans and Democrats working together to \nmake sure we have a Homeland Security that will secure our borders. \nThat is the first time I saw the Senate truly work since I have been \nhere and saw what the potential would be if we worked together. I was \nvery excited about that. I thought for sure we would get a vote. Now we \nare back to the same, putting together who is for what and how we are \ngoing to posture on this one. I believe this is not the place and this \nis not the bill for us to get into a political squabble. I don't.\n  I know the House put us in a difficult position. It came over here, \nit had to be voted on, and it was. Now we have to get on to serious \nbusiness. How do we take care and make sure our Department of Homeland \nSecurity has the necessary funding through an appropriations bill that \nboth Democrats and Republicans worked on, not for another continuing \nresolution which does not let our different branches that are \nresponsible for Homeland Security be able to upgrade and fight the \nbattle we need to fight.\n  When we think about all of the new equipment that is needed for our \nforces out there, our National Guard, also our Coast Guard, what they \nneed to be updated and upgraded to and the things that have been \nplanned, it will only happen through a bill we pass on this side. It \nwill not happen through a continuing resolution bill. It will be the \nsame as we have had. The status quo will not change.\n  I am willing to work with all of my friends in here to have a good, \nclean Homeland Security bill that does the job and protects the United \nStates of America. I am not willing to do a bill that will jeopardize \nthe security of our homeland, which is what I think we have received. I \nthink we can do better than that.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to work together to get a piece of \nlegislation that helps protect America and keeps America safe and also \nputs the emphasis where it needs to be. That is what the people back \nhome in West Virginia expect. I know people in New Hampshire expect the \nsame from the Presiding Officer. I know we can deliver, working \ntogether in a bipartisan way, putting America first and not our \npolitics. That is what they expect. I hope we are able to rise above \nthis, and we will get through this. I think we will get to a clean bill \nthat basically secures America and keeps us safe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I come to the floor to join my \ncolleagues to call for an end to any political gamesmanship being \nplayed over this bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security. I \nthank Senators Shaheen and Mikulski for their leadership on this issue. \nThey have introduced legislation I am proud to cosponsor and that \nprovides the critical resources the Department of Homeland Security \nneeds today and for the remainder of 2015.\n  The issue of funding the Department of Homeland Security has become \nparticularly important to my State. It is important to every State. New \nHampshire cares a lot about the Coast Guard and many of the other \nagencies involved in security.\n  In Minnesota we have actually had active recruiting, a first from al-\nShabaab that recruited young men in the State of Minnesota--and \nparticularly in the Twin Cities--to go to Somalia and to fight, \nincluding becoming suicide bombers. We actually had 18 Federal \nindictments that came out of that. Half of those people have already \nbeen convicted because of the fact our community--our Somali \ncommunity--has been able to work with the law enforcement positively. \nWe have been able to get the information to prosecute those cases.\n  Then we go to Syria, something our Presiding Officer knows a lot \nabout and is an expert on. The first American who was killed fighting \non the side of the terrorists was from Minnesota. There is active \nrecruiting that has been going on there. I have seen the ads of some of \nthe recruiting from the FBI that has been going on there. In fact, we \nhad an indictment of people involved in going to fight for ISIS. So \nthis is real for us. This isn't just something that is thousands of \nmiles away. It is happening in our communities.\n  Just last fall a young man from the Twin Cities area was arrested by \nthe FBI at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport as he was \ntrying fly to Turkey. The next day the young man's partner was able to \nboard a flight for Turkey and is thought to be fighting with ISIS.\n  These are real people, real terrorists. I think we all know when it \ncomes to Homeland Security it is not just our national security that is \nat stake, it is also our economy. Our border with Canada stretches over \n5,500 miles, the longest in the world. Over 400,000 people and nearly \n$2 billion in goods and services cross our borders every day.\n  In Minnesota we understand the economic significance of cross-border \ncommerce. Canada is our State's top international trading partner with \nover $19 billion in total business across the border. Think of that--\n$19 billion. Over 1 million Canadians visit Minnesota every year--that \nis a lot of Canadians--contributing $265 million to our local economy. \nA lot of them visit the Mall of America in Bloomington. Many of them go \nfishing up north. That relationship relies on a seamless United States-\nCanadian border with U.S. Customs and Border Protection keeping that \nborder secure and efficiently screening all cross-border traffic.\n  We have made important strides in recent years with the trusted \ntravel programs to make our northern border more secure while \nencouraging the cross-border tourism and commerce that is the lifeblood \nof so many Northern States, including Minnesota and New Hampshire. \nWithholding critical funding from DHS could threaten this progress, \nleading to a less secure border and also hindering economic \nopportunity. Withholding critical funding risks the safety of our \npeople, the strength of our economy, and even our relationships abroad.\n  At a time when other countries around the world are stepping up their \nsecurity, we can't be standing it down. Even a cursory look at world \nheadlines shows the threats the United States and our allies face--from \nthe terrorist attacks in Paris and Sydney to cyber attacks by North \nKorea. We need to be stepping up our security.\n  That is why it is so important we turn immediately to this bill to \nfund the Department of Homeland Security, a bill we can all agree on. \nThe funding bill introduced by Senator Shaheen and Senator Mikulski and \nthat I am proud to cosponsor does just that. It would provide funding \nfor security while keeping crossings open for business. It would \nsupport 23,775 Customs and Border Protection officers working at our \ncountry's 329 ports of entry. It would ensure that we keep 21,370 \nBorder Patrol agents at work keeping our country safe. It funds cyber \nsecurity initiatives that protect our critical infrastructure and \nallows us to track down and punish hackers who are responsible for \ncyber crimes.\n  It provides over $1 billion for security-related grants to States--we \nare talking about firefighters and first responders--and localities to \nhelp ensure they are prepared to handle both manmade and natural \ndisasters. No one knows this better than our State when we had a bridge \nfall down in the middle of a summer day on August 1 in Minneapolis, MN. \nAn 8-lane highway right in the middle of the Mississippi River, 13 \npeople died, dozens of people injured, dozens of cars submerged in the \nwater after dropping 111 feet. No one knows this better than our State \nafter we had the floods we shared with North Dakota across the Red \nRiver, floods that nearly swept away homes and resulted in a lot of \neconomic loss. That happened in our State. No one knows better than our \nState, where we have had tornadoes similar to so many places in the \nMidwest, sweep across the prairies, taking everything in their path. \nThat is when you know what FEMA is all about. That is when you know \nwhat Homeland Security is all about. That is\n\n[[Page S730]]\n\nwhy we must continue to fund this important Agency.\n  It is my hope we can come together to pass the Shaheen-Mikulski \nHomeland Security appropriations bill. We should never play politics \nwhen it comes to protecting our homeland. That is why former Homeland \nSecurity Secretaries from the George W. Bush and Obama administrations \nhave come together--Tom Ridge, Michael Chertoff and Janet Napolitano--\nand all agree on the need to pass a clean bill. Anyone who is watching \nC-SPAN and says, What is she talking about--a clean bill? Did it go \nthrough the laundry machine? This is a bill that focuses on what it is \nsupposed to focus on, which is funding Homeland Security. It doesn't \nhave other provisions in it that are better debated on other bills, \nthat are comprehensive and focus on these issues. This bill should not \nhave those kinds of things on it. This bill is about Homeland Security, \nand we shouldn't be shutting down our security over political fights.\n  As Senators, chief among our responsibilities is to do everything we \ncan do to keep Americans safe. As a Senator from Minnesota, no job is \nmore important to me than keeping our State and our country safe. I was \na prosecutor for 8 years. I know how much this means to people. I \ndeeply respect the work of the Department of Homeland Security and what \nthey do every single day to protect us. Those workers deserve the best. \nThe people of America deserve the best. That is why we have to pass \nthis bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass the Shaheen-Mikulski bill without delay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate in morning business for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/03/senate-section/article/S730-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S730-S732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               CHOICE ACT\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I am on the floor today to speak about an \nissue that I spoke about just a few days ago, the Choice Act.\n  Let me take my colleagues back in history just a few months, just to \nlast year. I don't imagine any of us don't remember the scandal the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs was facing--the stories across the \ncountry of fake waiting lists, of services not provided, of the \npotential death of veterans while waiting for those services to occur. \nI also would think that at least many of my colleagues would agree that \nfor much of the past few years the Senate hasn't done much of the \nbusiness it was designed to do and that needed to be done in our \ncountry.\n  But I remember a day in August of 2014 in which the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives were successful in passing a bill. It is \nsomewhat embarrassing to me to be on the floor praising the \naccomplishment of a bill passage. It is a significant part of what \nshould be the normal course of business of the Senate.\n  But those of us--and I would put all of my colleagues in this \ncategory who care about the service men and women who sacrificed for \nthe benefit of their fellow countrymen and came home to a Department of \nVeterans Affairs that failed to meet their needs. I have indicated that \nsince I came to Congress, both in the House and the Senate, I have \nserved on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. This is an issue that we \nneed to make certain we get right.\n  Just this week, in fact this morning, we passed a piece of \nlegislation, the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans \nAct. That is an accomplishment. I remember the testimony of the two \nmothers in the Veterans' Affairs Committee who came to talk to us about \nthe importance of this legislation, their experience as mothers, and \nthe death of their sons by suicide.\n  In the time that I have been in Congress, it is among the most \ncompelling testimony I have ever heard. The part that sticks with me \nthe most is the belief by these two mothers that had the Department of \nVeterans Affairs done their work, their sons would be alive. What that \ntells me is the decisions we make and those decisions as implemented by \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs in some cases--in fact in many \ncases--are a matter of life and death.\n  We saw the scandal that came about last year. We know the decisions \nwe make have huge consequences on veterans and their families. We \nrejoiced--at least I did--in the passage of the Choice Act, which gave \nveterans the opportunity to choose VA services, to choose health care \nto be provided in their hometowns by their hometown physicians and \ndoctors.\n  The criteria that is set out in the Choice Act for that to occur is \npretty straightforward. It says if you live more than 40 miles from a \nVA facility, you are entitled to have the VA provide the services at \nhome, if that is what you want. It says that if those services can't be \nprovided within 30 days of the time you need those services, then the \nVA shall provide those services at home if you choose. You can see the \nhospital, you can be admitted to the hospital of your choice, and you \ncan be seen by the doctor of your choice.\n  That was actually something to rejoice about, to be excited about--\nthat this Congress and this Senate came together and passed what I know \nto be a very significant and important piece of legislation. It is \nimportant for the reasons that common sense tells us it is important--\nthat a veteran who lives a long way from a VA hospital or a VA facility \ncan now get services at home. A veteran who had to wait in line for too \nlong could now get those services at home.\n  The other aspect of that is that the Department of Veterans Affairs \nhas told us time and again about the inability to attract and retain \nthe necessary health care providers, the doctors and others who provide \nservices to our veterans.\n  So one way to improve that circumstance is to allow other health care \nproviders, those in your hometown, to provide that service.\n  The Choice Act was a good measure for the Department of Veterans \nAffairs to meet its mandate to care for our veterans, and the Choice \nAct was a good measure for veterans who live long distances from a VA \nfacility, especially in States such as mine and the Presiding \nOfficer's, where it is a long way to a VA facility.\n  So I remember the moment in which that bill passed and was sent to \nthe President. Finally something good has come. A bill has been passed. \nSomething important to our veterans is occurring.\n  But the reality is the implementation of the Choice Act has created \nmany problems and, in my view, the Department of Veterans Affairs is \nfinding ways to make that implementation not advantageous to the \nveteran but self-serving to the Department.\n  This is what catches my attention today. We are reviewing the \nPresident's budget, and within that budget is this language:\n\n       In the coming months, the Administration will submit \n     legislation to reallocate a portion of Veterans Choice \n     Program funding to support essential investments in VA system \n     priorities in a fiscally responsible, budget-neutral manner.\n\n  What the President's budget is telling us is that there is excess \nmoney within the Choice Act. We allocated money--emergency spending--to \nfund the Choice Act, and the President's budget is telling us: Well, we \nthink there is too much money in there. We are going to submit \nlegislation to reallocate that money to something we think is a higher \npriority.\n  I don't expect many of my colleagues to remember, but I was on the \nSenate floor last week talking about a specific problem in the \nimplementation of the Choice Act, and it was this: The Department of \nVeterans Affairs shall provide services at home to a veteran who lives \nmore than 40 miles from a facility.\n  Well, the problem I described last week is that the VA has determined \nthat if there is an outpatient clinic within that 40 miles, even though \nit doesn't provide the services that the veteran needs, that veteran, \nhe or she, must drive to the VA, wherever that is\n\n[[Page S731]]\n\nlocated, and does not qualify for the at-home services.\n  Does this make any sense to any of us, that the VA says: Oh, there is \nan outpatient clinic within 40 miles of you, Mr. Veteran? Even though \nit doesn't provide the service that you need, we are still going to \nrequire you to drive to a VA hospital to receive those services and you \ndon't qualify to go see your hometown doctor or be admitted to your \nhometown hospital.\n  Who would think--in fact, I admired Secretary McDonald in his early \ndays at the Department in which he talked about how the VA is going to \nserve the veteran: The decisions we make at the VA will be directed at \nhow do we best care for our veterans.\n  I respect Secretary McDonald for that attitude and approach, and I \nwant the Department to follow his lead in accomplishing that mission.\n  But clearly deciding that a facility, even though it can't provide \nthe service you need, precludes you from getting services at home makes \nno sense, and it certainly doesn't put the veteran at the forefront of \nwhat is in the best interest of a veteran.\n  So why would the Department of Veterans Affairs make that decision? \nWe have a facility within 40 miles, but you don't qualify. So drive 3 \nor 4 hours to the VA hospital.\n  Well, one might think they have made the decision that we are going \nto enforce that aspect of the Choice Act. We are going to enforce the \nidea that you don't qualify because they don't have enough money to pay \nfor those services. But, lo and behold, the President's budget says \nthere is excess money that we now want to transfer to other priorities.\n  So, clearly, it is not funding issues. The Department is making \ndecisions for some reason that makes absolutely no sense, defies common \nsense, and certainly doesn't put the veteran ahead of the Department of \nVeterans Affairs.\n  I don't know what the story is that these kinds of decisions would be \nmade, but it certainly is worthy of the Senate to make certain the \nDepartment implements its moment of triumph, the Choice Act, in a way \nthat benefits those we intended for the legislation to serve.\n  I will ask some questions of the Department, and I wonder about the \nattitude. I have been on task trying to get services provided closer to \nhome for veterans for as long as I have been in Congress.\n  One of the other programs, aside from the Choice Act, is a program \ncalled ARCH for accessing services closer to home. There are pilot \nprograms across the country to do that. One of them is in Kansas.\n  In an internal memo from Washington, DC, to a VA hospital in Kansas, \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs indicated to the VA hospital in \nKansas they could not promote, encourage or market the idea of a \nveteran seeking services at home.\n  So already I bring skepticism about the attitude at the Department of \nVeterans Affairs. For a long time they have been told not to encourage \nveterans to find health care outside the VA hospital, outside the VA \noutpatient clinic.\n  Here are a few questions. How do you reach the conclusion that there \nis excess money when the program is just now being implemented and, in \nfact, there has been a significant delay in getting the choice cards \nout to veterans so they could determine whether they were interested \nand qualified?\n  I also have learned that the Department of Veterans Affairs has \nintentionally narrowed the veteran population that is eligible for the \nchoice program by rule, narrowing the number of medical procedures for \nwhich they will consider whether it can be performed outside the VA on \nthe 30-day rule.\n  I didn't say that quite right. I didn't say it quite as well as I \nwould like. But the VA already narrowed, by regulation, the services \nthat might qualify for hometown services if it takes longer than 30 \ndays to get those services.\n  The VA added an unnecessary reimbursement requirement. I am told now \nthat if there is a third-party provider and you have some insurance, \nthe VA is going to require that the veteran pay the copayment up front \nand then seek reimbursement from the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  Of course, the fourth one is how can you reach the conclusion that a \nveteran, who needs colonoscopy--in my hometown, as I talked about last \nweek, one must drive 3 or 4 hours to Wichita to the VA to get the \ncolonoscopy because there is an outpatient clinic within 40 miles of my \nhometown, but the outpatient clinic doesn't provide colonoscopies.\n  Now we learn that it is not a matter of money. It has to be a matter \nof attitude, approach, and culture.\n  Just today, a few minutes before I came to the Senate floor to talk \nabout this issue, I received an inquiry from a constituent who is a \nhealth care provider. What they indicated to me is their interest in \nproviding services under the Choice Act. They have contacted the VA, \npursued the opportunity to be a provider for that veteran population in \nrural Kansas, and they were told the rate of reimbursement would be \nsomething significantly less than Medicare.\n\n  The Choice Act says the Department of Veterans Affairs shall provide \nthese services up to paying Medicare rates. The VA says if you are \ngoing to provide services to our veterans, we are only going to \nreimburse you at something significantly less. That is something this \nhealth care provider didn't believe they could make any money doing, \nbut ultimately they concluded it was their responsibility to try to \nhelp veterans who lived in rural Kansas, and so they went back to the \nVA and said we are willing to take less rates. Certainly let's \nnegotiate and see if we can find something mutually agreeable between \nthe VA and us to provide those services. They have yet to receive a \nreturn to their inquiry to the VA--again, trying to preclude a willing \nprovider who is willing to provide services at less than cost. How can \nthat be common sense? How can that be putting veterans ahead of the VA?\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues. I look forward to our \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs--a committee the Presiding Officer \nserves on--trying to make sure we get this right. I want to return to \nthe day in August when the Senate passed the Choice Act and there was \nthis feeling of accomplishment of something beneficial and useful.\n  If the VA continues to implement this bill--if it doesn't reverse \ncourse, if it doesn't put the veteran first, we will have missed \nanother opportunity to care for the needs of those who served our \ncountry. What American would we expect to receive the best health care \npossible in this country? Well, of course, I want all Americans to \nreceive quality health care at an affordable cost. But I would say \nthere is no group of people for whom it is more important that they \nreceive what is their due, what was committed to them, than those who \nserved in our military and are now our Nation's veterans.\n  I represent a very rural State. The congressional district that I \nrepresented as a House Member is larger than the size of the State of \nIllinois. It has no VA hospital. How do you get to a VA hospital when \nyou are a 92-year-old World War II veteran and the hospital is 4, 5, 6 \nhours away?\n  I thought we had finally come to a solution. I thought that earlier \nwith the passage of legislation I introduced in the House that \nultimately became the ARCH pilot program. While it gets rave reviews \nfrom veterans who are in those pilot program areas, it has not been \nexpanded. It doesn't solve the country's rural needs.\n  Then I thought, well, a great day has occurred; we passed the Choice \nAct. But as I look at the implementation, as I look at the decisions \nbeing made today at the Department of Veterans Affairs, I have to \nwonder if one more time we are providing false hope, false promises to \nthose who served our country. We owe them something different than what \nis occurring today.\n  I reaffirm my commitment to my colleagues, but also to the leadership \nof the Department of Veterans Affairs, to work closely, side-by-side, \nto make sure the choices made fit the reality of those who served our \ncountry in the circumstances they find themselves in today. Help those \nveterans who can't get the service because they can't get there. Help \nthose veterans who need the services more quickly than the Department \nof Veterans Affairs can provide them.\n  This seems straightforward to me, but I raise this concern today to \nmake\n\n[[Page S732]]\n\nsure my colleagues and I are united in the effort to see that good \nthings happen as a result of the passage of the Choice Act in 2014.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is no secret we are living in \ndangerous times and that we face a variety of threats. We face the \nthreat of ISIL, a barbaric and despicable terrorist organization. We \nface threats to the security of our personal information both online \nand in our daily life. We still face threats from Al Qaeda and rogue \nnations such as North Korea. With all of these ongoing threats to our \nNation and its citizens, shouldn't our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle want to work together in a bipartisan manner in order to fund \nthe government agency responsible for protecting us from those threats?\n  Evidently they do not. Instead, they are playing a partisan game \nwhile threatening to shut down the Department of Homeland Security. \nThey are playing politics with our homeland security. The vote the \nSenate just took relates to a bill that put partisan politics ahead of \nour national security while also needlessly creating another \nmanufactured budget crisis, and that is why I voted no.\n  I understand our Republican colleagues have concerns about the \nPresident's Executive actions on immigration, and I believe there is a \ntime and place for this body to debate those issues, as we have in the \npast and we must in the future. But to jeopardize our Nation's security \nby playing politics with this vital funding measure is extremely \ndisappointing.\n  I would actually like to remind our colleagues that the President's \nactions on immigration reform devote even more resources to securing \nour Southwest border and to deporting felons, not families, and \nidentifying threats to our national security.\n  The President's Executive action on immigration also provides certain \nundocumented immigrants temporary relief, after background checks and \nother security measures are passed, bringing families out of the \nshadows so they can work and pay taxes like everyone else.\n  I remain committed to finishing the job on bipartisan and \ncomprehensive immigration reform here in Congress, but until we can \nachieve that goal, I support the President keeping his promise to take \naction and do what he legally can to fix our broken system.\n  Consistent with the actions by previous Presidents of both parties, \nPresident Obama is right to follow in the footsteps of every President \nsince Eisenhower to address as much of this problem as he can through \nExecutive action. The status quo is simply unacceptable.\n  In fact, the Congressional Budget Office--also known as the \nnonpartisan scorekeeper--recently found that including a reversal of \nthese Executive orders in the homeland security funding bill would \nactually increase our deficit.\n  Instead of attaching these transparent attacks on the President, the \nCongress should pass a clean, straightforward, bipartisan bill. And \nthere is such a bill. That bill was previously negotiated and it was \njust introduced by the vice chairwoman of the Committee on \nAppropriations, Barbara Mikulski, and the ranking member of the \nSubcommittee on Homeland Security, Senator Shaheen.\n  As a new member of the Subcommittee on Homeland Security of the \nCommittee on Appropriations, I am a strong supporter of the Mikulski-\nShaheen bill because it would fund programs that are critical to our \nNation and to my home State of Wisconsin. Their straightforward funding \nbill funds essential Departments such as the Coast Guard, which keeps \nthe Great Lakes safe and open for business; and it funds FEMA grants, \nwhich have helped communities in western Wisconsin, for example, plan \nand prepare for floods; and it funds fire grants that help rural fire \ndepartments with equipment they could never afford through the proceeds \nof annual pancake breakfasts. These are critical assets that my \nconstituents rely on, and putting them at risk is simply irresponsible.\n  It is time for our colleagues to drop this dangerous political stunt \nand to join with Democrats to pass a bipartisan bill that gives the \nDepartment of Homeland Security the resources it needs to keep \nAmericans safe.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today the House of Representatives held yet \nanother vote--I think they are maybe up to 50-some--to repeal the \nAffordable Care Act, showing once again their objective is to dismantle \nthe health care law. House Republicans voted to repeal the law. They \nlike to say ``repeal and replace,'' but the ``replace'' doesn't ever \nreally quite come forward.\n  Think what that would be like. It would take us back to the day when \nchildren with preexisting conditions such as cancer or asthma could be \nturned away from health coverage. Let me illustrate.\n  Several months ago a couple came to my coffee, which I hold every \nThursday when the Senate is in session. It is open to anyone from Ohio \nwho wants to stop in. A woman came from Cincinnati. She lives in one of \nthe most conservative parts of the State. We talked for a few minutes \nabout home schooling and her desire to be able to get some support from \nthe Federal Government in a variety of different ways for home \nschooling.\n  Then she said: I want to thank you for the Affordable Care Act.\n  I said: Certainly. I was proud to support it.\n  She said: You see, my son--and she pointed across the room. He was \nabout 15. He was diagnosed with diabetes when he was 7 or 8 years old.\n  She hesitated. She said: I counted them, 33 times, we were turned \ndown for health insurance because of his preexisting condition. We \nsigned up last week for the Affordable Care Act.\n  So if the House's effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act had come \nto the Senate and become law, someone would have to explain to her why \nshe loses her health care. Again, if this is repealed, insurers could \nplace lifetime or annual caps on health coverage. We know that tens of \nthousands of people in this country have gotten sick and their \ninsurance has been cancelled because their insurance was so expensive. \nThat is prohibited under the Affordable Care Act. That would be back if \nwe repealed the Affordable Care Act.\n  Seniors were forced to pay huge out-of-pocket costs when they hit the \ngap in prescription drug coverage known as the doughnut hole.\n  A decade ago, when I was a Member of the House of Representatives, I \nvoted against that Medicare plan in part because it had this huge gap \nin coverage. So if you have an illness or a series of illnesses and buy \na lot of prescription drugs, between the second thousandth dollar and \nthe fifth thousandth dollar, there is a gap in coverage. In other \nwords, you continue to pay the premiums for prescription drug coverage \nbut get no assistance from the government. Under the Affordable Care \nAct, we have closed that gap. We have already cut it better than half, \nand over the next 3 or 4 years it will be eliminated entirely. We know \nthe Affordable Care Act is working.\n  In my State, 100,000 young Ohioans, a little older than these pages, \nbetween the ages of 18 and 26, are on their parents' health insurance \nplans right now. They would be dropped from that coverage if the \nAffordable Care Act were repealed.\n  Ohio seniors have saved $65 million in prescription drug costs by the \nclosing of the coverage gap, the so-called doughnut hole. Those savings \nwould end. Those with preexisting conditions would no longer be covered \nor would be\n\n[[Page S733]]\n\ncharged higher premiums, and 700,000 Ohioans--people in my State--now \nhave health insurance they did not have 5 years ago.\n  So if we repeal the Affordable Care Act, somebody has to explain to \nthose 700,000 people why they no longer have insurance, why those \n100,000 young people are getting dropped from coverage; those families \nlike the woman's who would lose her insurance because her child has a \npreexisting condition, and all the consumer protections the Affordable \nCare Act has been part of.\n  Last month I spoke with Charles McClinon, a Cincinnati resident who \nsuffered from severe epilepsy and, as a result, was unable to work. \nAfter Ohio chose to expand Medicaid--and I give Republican Governor \nKasich credit for that--Mr. McClinon qualified for health care coverage \nand was able to schedule surgery. Thanks to this lifesaving coverage, \nhe has returned to work.\n  Isn't that what we want? If people are ill, injured, sick, don't we \nwant to take care of them so they can return to work? Mr. McClinon \nnever wanted to miss work, but he had to. Because of the expansion of \nMedicaid, because of the Affordable Care Act passed by a Democratic \nSenate, signed by a Democratic President, because of a Republican \nGovernor in Ohio expanding Medicaid, unlike Republican Governors in \nmany States, people such as Charles McClinon can now go back to work \nand live a healthier, more productive life and pay taxes.\n  Since its creation in 1965, Medicaid has been a joint Federal and \nState program, providing free or low-cost health coverage to qualified \nindividuals. One of the key components of the Affordable Care Act \nexpanded both the eligibility and the Federal funding for Medicaid. \nStates were given the opportunity to expand Medicaid to individuals \nwith incomes of up to 130 percent of the Federal poverty level. Many \npeople on Medicaid who are now on the expanded Medicaid in Ohio and \nKentucky and many other States hold jobs, just like the parents of the \n130,000 Ohio children who now have insurance because of the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program. Their parents are working at places such as \nWalmart and McDonald's, making $8, $9, $10 an hour. Those companies \ngenerally don't provide health insurance and don't pay wages high \nenough to be able to buy health insurance.\n  What kind of society do we want to be? Where people are working every \nbit as hard as all of us as U.S. Senators work, with very little \ncompensation, without health insurance, generally without pensions?\n  Do we want to say: Well, we don't care about you? If you weren't \nsmart enough, if you weren't educated enough, if you weren't smart \nenough to get a good-paying job with insurance, then we are going to \nturn our backs on you? Of course we are not that kind of society. That \nis what the Affordable Care Act is about.\n  The expansion of Medicaid has saved Ohio about $350 million. It also \nhelped Ohioans who already have insurance. When people lack health \ninsurance, someone has to pay for their care.\n  The Presiding Officer's State of Colorado is not much different, just \nsmaller dollar amounts because it is a smaller State. But Ohioans spend \nover $2 billion on care for people who can't pay. It is a hidden tax on \nthe insured estimated to be about $1,000 a year per insured family.\n  So prior to the Affordable Care Act, somebody who went to a hospital \nin Denver, Cleveland, Dayton or Colorado Springs or Pueblo or \nYoungstown--because those without insurance would go to hospitals and \nget care; that is what we do; we take care of people if they show up in \nan emergency room--because they were not paying, because they were low \nincome, they were unemployed, and they had no insurance, the cost of \ntheir treatment got shifted onto those of us with insurance. Economists \nsay pretty much everybody pays about $1,000 additional for their health \ninsurance because of the problems of the uninsured. So when we expand \nMedicaid, when we pass the Affordable Care Act, when we get people into \nthe health exchanges, it means we are not charging people that $1,000 \nhidden tax, so it is a savings to those of us with insurance. \nUltimately it is better for taxpayers, ultimately it is better for our \nhealth care system, and ultimately, most importantly, it is better for \na healthier society.\n  We should be helping Ohioans gain health care, not cutting them off. \nThat is the importance of expanding Medicaid.\n  I urge the Ohio legislature to work with the Governor to include \nMedicaid expansion in the budget. I urge my colleagues here in this \nChamber to end their grandstanding attacks on a law that is helping \nAmericans such as Charles McClinon get the care they need. It helped \nhim go back to work. It will help others live more healthy lives. It \nwill help all our communities. We should be helping Ohioans gain health \ncare, not cutting them off.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I had the honor of addressing the \nlegendary World War II-era 1st Special Service Force, a joint American-\nCanadian special forces military unit called the Devil's Brigade, on \nthe occasion of the surviving members of that elite unit receiving the \nCongressional Gold Medal. I ask for unanimous consent that my remarks \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Sometimes, truth can be more impressive than fiction.\n       When it comes to the heroes we honor today, that's \n     certainly the case.\n       Members of the elite ``Devil's Brigade'' excelled in rock-\n     climbing and amphibious assault.\n       They advanced on skis and through the air. They survived by \n     stealth, and trained in demolitions.\n       Some of their more daring mission plans would've made James \n     Bond blush.\n       And through it all, they helped save a continent in chaos. \n     They helped defeat some of the greatest menaces our world has \n     known.\n       But this isn't just some Hollywood script. It's a true \n     story about a fearless group of young Canadians and \n     Americans--including many Kentuckians--who were willing to \n     put their lives on the line in the truest sense of the term.\n       Some probably did it to protect neighbors and families. \n     Others to defend cherished democratic ideals. Many likely \n     fought for all these reasons.\n       And they volunteered for this danger. Here's how the \n     force's recruiting slogan read:\n\n     Vigorous training.\n     Hazardous duty.\n     For those who measure up, get into the war quick.\n\n       Typical Madison Avenue spin, this was not.\n       But it was honest.\n       The fighting could be fierce.

Mr. President, I wish our friends in the Vietnamese-\nAmerican community in Louisville, KY, and across the Commonwealth, a \nvery merry celebration of Tet Nguyen Dan. Tet Nguyen Dan means ``first \nday,'' and is the celebration of the Vietnamese Lunar New Year and the \narrival of Spring. The Lunar New Year is the most important celebration \nin traditional Vietnamese culture. This year it falls on February 19.\n  The celebration of the Lunar New Year lasts for several days. It is \nseen as the precursor for events of the coming year, and therefore is \ncelebrated by paying homage to one's ancestors, having family reunions, \nand paying old debts.\n  At midnight of the Lunar New Year, the event is celebrated with \nfirecrackers, gongs, and drums. Children wear new clothes to visit \ntheir relatives, and elders offer children little red envelopes full of \nmoney.\n  The festival then continues for several days with special events on \neach day. Many traditional foods are served during the Lunar New Year \ncelebrations, including banh chung, a dish made of sticky rice, and \nmung beans and pork, all wrapped in banana leaves.\n  Of course, one doesn't have to be in Vietnam to celebrate the Lunar \nNew Year. Louisville has a strong and vibrant Vietnamese-American \ncommunity that contributes to the mosaic that is the River City, and \nthis year they will celebrate the Lunar New Year with great gusto. \nCelebrations are scheduled across the city for several days.\n  I know that Louisville and the Commonwealth of Kentucky are better \noff for the values that Vietnamese-Americans celebrate during Tet \nNguyen Dan--love of family, appreciation of one's elders and ancestors, \nand optimism about the times ahead. I convey to my friends in \nKentucky's Vietnamese-American community my best wishes and I ask my \nU.S. Senate colleagues to join me in wishing them a happy, healthy, and \nprosperous Lunar New Year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/03/senate-section/article/S734-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CLAY HUNT SUICIDE PREVENTION FOR AMERICAN VETERANS ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am a proud cosponsor of the Clay Hunt \nSuicide Prevention for American Veterans Act and am pleased my \ncolleagues chose to support it unanimously. The bill is designed to \nhelp reduce--and hopefully eliminate--veteran suicides by improving \naccess to and quality of mental health care for veterans.\n  An estimated 22 veterans a day take their own lives. That is twice as \nhigh as the general population. Veterans of all ages and from all wars \nare affected by conditions that can contribute to depression and \nthoughts of suicide. We are learning more and more, for example, about \nhow common post-traumatic stress disorder is among our returning \nheroes. PTSD can surface years--even decades--after a veteran was in \ncombat. It is one of many factors that contribute to this disheartening \nproblem.\n  The number of suicides is disproportionately high, however, for \nveterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Young men and women just \nout of the service and receiving health care from the government \ncommitted suicide at nearly three times the rate of active-duty troops \nin 2012. We have to work harder to make sure our heroes have access to \nthe help they need.\n  The Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act will \ncreate a peer support and community outreach pilot program to connect \ntransitioning service members with programs that could help them. The \nbill will create a pilot program to repay the loan debt of psychiatry \nstudents so it is easier to recruit them to work at the VA. It also \nwill improve the accountability of VA mental health and suicide-\nprevention programs by requiring an annual evaluation.\n  Today, in a bipartisan fashion, the Senate said we need to do more to \nmake sure our heroes have access to the assistance they need. I hope \nthe step we took here today helps many veterans regain a path to \nwellness and happiness.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today to commend my colleagues for \nswift passage of the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans \nAct. This act will build upon the Veterans Choice Act and put in place \nneeded measures to improve responsiveness, reporting, oversight and \naccountability for mental health outreach, intervention, treatment, and \ncounseling in the Department of Veterans Affairs. Sometimes the \ngreatest hurdle for ailing veterans is just getting started. There is \nnothing more frustrating and potentially demoralizing and debilitating \nfor a veteran in crisis to seek mental health care from the VA and be \ntold he will have to wait weeks or months for an appointment because VA \nfacilities lack sufficient personnel with an expertise in psychiatric \nmedicine to provide timely care. Left to fend on their own, many \nveterans become depressed and feel powerless, some resort to high-risk \nbehaviors, from isolation, self-medication with alcohol and \nprescription drugs, to suicide.\n  This bill authorizes a pilot program to expand the VA's capacity to \nhelp repay loans incurred by individuals who are eligible to practice \npsychiatric medicine and agree to serve the VA in that field. In doing \nso, we recognize that serving veterans is a noble cause that some are \ncalled to, but working in such a demanding field requires economic \nincentives, especially in areas where abundant career options exist or \nin more remote locales, where attracting talent is difficult for the \nVA.\n  The Clay Hunt Act also facilitates greater veteran's access through a \nconsolidated interactive website, where veterans can visit from the \nprivacy of their own home or wherever they may be when the need arises.\n  Most importantly, the bill directs VA to establish a pilot program \nfor community-based support networks in the VA's Integrated Service \nNetworks to ease the transition of veterans and provide peer-based \nsupport for those who are encountering difficulties coping with those \nlife changes. These community outreach teams at each medical center \nwill be aimed at getting care to the point of need with the least \namount of delay and help those veterans who are unwilling or unable to \nseek professional help on their own.\n  Make no mistake, the suicides of our veterans are preventable with \nthe right intervention and proper continuum of care. When a veteran \ntakes their own life due to untreated mental pain, it is a stark and \nsobering sign that somewhere, someone who loved them was unable to \nreach them and recognize the warning signs to help or that the veteran \njust couldn't carry a heavy burden any longer and found stability or \nsome greater peace and solace elusive. It is at these moments, with \nnowhere to turn and perhaps no one to trust, that some of our veterans \nwant to escape life. The sooner we can fully transform the VA into a \nplace where veterans in crisis at any time can find access to \ncaregivers and peers ready to light the path to a better place in our \nsociety, the better outcomes we will see and the surer we will be that \nthe promises we have made to them are being kept.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/03/senate-section/article/S734-3", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S734-S735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING BURTON SNOWBOARDS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for generations, Vermonters have \ncontributed to the global culture of winter sports. Whether the sport \nis snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, snowmobiling or\n\n[[Page S735]]\n\nsnowboarding, Vermonters never pass up an opportunity to claim the \nfirst run of the day.\n  Almost four decades ago, Jake Burton's passion for winter sports led \nto the creation of Burton Snowboards, one of the leading snowboard \nmanufacturers in the world. Jake at a young age enjoyed ``snurfing''--\nsurfing on snow--but he never anticipated the path he would eventually \ntake, becoming one of the pioneers in snowboard manufacturing.\n  In the late 1970s, Jake started exploring the idea of manufacturing \nsnowboards, building prototypes from a barn in Londonderry, VT. At the \ntime, most ski resorts did not allow snowboarders, as snowboarding was \nnot yet considered a sport, and gaining recognition as a sport proved \nto be harder than one might expect. Jake didn't let his optimism or \npassion wane, and interest in the fledgling sport finally spread. Jake \nand his wife Donna explored the European market, eventually opening a \ndistribution center in Austria, while maintaining their national \nheadquarters in Burlington, VT. For a little-known sport, it quickly \ngained international notoriety and stature. In 1998, snowboarding \ndebuted at the winter Olympics in Nagano.\n  Jake is now one of the most successful business leaders Vermont has \never known. His commitment and passion allow him to remain one with the \npulse of his company, with consumers, and, most of all, with the sport, \non a level unique to Burton Snowboards.\n  The Wall Street Journal recently chronicled the multiple ways in \nwhich Jake keeps himself healthy, in shape, and on the slopes. Jake's \nlifestyle is one that truly speaks to the Vermont spirit. Marcelle and \nI are proud to have Jake and Donna as friends.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article \nfrom The Wall Street Journal.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 22, 2014]\n\n    Jake Burton, Snowboard King, Sets Multiple Goals for His Workout\n\n                            (By Jen Murphy)\n\n       The founder and chairman of Burton Snowboards, finds \n     multiple ways to keep his lower body in shape for \n     snowboarding and surfing.\n       Jake Burton sets an annual goal of snowboarding 100 days a \n     year. A snowboard pioneer, and founder and chairman of Burton \n     Snowboards Inc. in Burlington, Vt., has hit that goal nearly \n     every year during the past 19 years, with the exception of \n     2011, when he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Mr. \n     Burton went through three months of chemotherapy. In January \n     2012, his doctors gave him a cancer-free bill of health and \n     he slowly began regaining his strength in the pool and at the \n     gym. Today, at age 60, he is charging harder than ever on the \n     mountain.\n       ``I got in 114 days this season,'' he says. And when the \n     snow is gone, he takes to the ocean for his other obsession, \n     surfing.\n       Mr. Burton relies on four regular activities--hiking, yoga, \n     swimming, and biking--to keep him fit enough to snowboard and \n     surf. He thinks of his workouts on a point system, awarding \n     himself one point per workout, with 10 being his target each \n     week. ``I usually manage six.'' Some days he tries to double \n     up on workouts by mixing business with an activity. He might \n     bike with a colleague and discuss new snowboard gear.\n       Mr. Burton includes his family in as many activities as \n     possible. He and his wife, Donna Carpenter, who is president \n     of Burton Snowboards, have trails within minutes of their \n     Vermont home in Stowe. They often set out together on hikes, \n     but ``hiking with Jake is a solo sport,'' jokes Ms. \n     Carpenter. ``He recently had a minor knee surgery and still \n     beat me up the mountain.''\n       He takes about six surf trips a year. This year he brought \n     his three sons, ages 18, 21, and 25, on a surf trip to the \n     Maldives. Recently, he and his wife started booking bike \n     tours when they visit cities such as Florence and Paris.\n\n\n                              The Workout\n\n       Hiking is Mr. Burton's main form of cardio. ``I have to \n     keep it up to keep my weight in check,'' he says. One of his \n     favorite hikes is up the Pinnacle Trail, which is 10 minutes \n     from his home. It takes him about 50 minutes to hike up and \n     another 50 minutes to hike down. He will also drive to Mount \n     Mansfield, Vermont's highest peak, and hike the Long Trail, \n     which is nearly 5 miles round trip. Mr. Burton always takes a \n     watch when he hikes. ``My watch is like a heart rate monitor. \n     The times tell me how hard I'm working,'' he says.\n       In the winter he often hikes up the mountain with his dogs \n     and snowboards down four or five times before the ski resort \n     is officially open. Bigger trips, most recently to Japan, \n     allow him to have full days snowboarding in the backcountry.\n       While attending New York University, he was the captain of \n     the swim team and he continues to get in the pool every other \n     day when he is home. He swims intervals, warming up with 800 \n     meters and then doing a few intervals of 500 meters and 50-\n     meter intervals for speed.\n       Two days a week, Mr. Burton uses weight machines at the \n     Swimming Hole, a nonprofit pool and gym facility in Stowe \n     that he and his wife helped fund. He does an all-body workout \n     with a focus on legs. ``The stronger my legs, the better my \n     snowboarding,'' he says. He says he used to lift more but \n     scaled back when he began practicing yoga. ``I might not be \n     as strong as I once was but I feel better doing yoga,'' he \n     says. ``It makes surfing easier and every day things easier, \n     like standing on one leg when you're drying your feet after \n     you get out of the shower.''\n       He takes a private Ashtanga-style yoga lesson in his home \n     once a week.\n\n\n                                The Diet\n\n       Mr. Burton is pescetarian and tries to eat mostly organic. \n     He and his wife hire someone to help prepare meals, which are \n     left in the fridge. ``We're spoiled,'' he says. In the \n     morning Mr. Burton has a smoothie made from frozen mangos and \n     frozen peaches or frozen berries and bananas. Lunch might be \n     vegetable soup and an avocado and tomato sandwich with a tiny \n     bit of mayo on whole wheat bread. They might have a squash \n     soup with some cheese or lentils and a salad with avocado. \n     ``I average more than two avocados a day,'' he says. His \n     wife's vegetable garden provides many of the ingredients that \n     go into meals. They freeze vegetables to use during the \n     winter. His splurge is pizza.\n\n\n                                The Gear\n\n       Mr. Burton estimates he has about 30 different snowboards \n     at home. His favorites are the Burton Namedropper (retail \n     $419.95) and the Burton Barracuda (retail $519.95). Right now \n     he is riding with Burton EST Genesis bindings (retail \n     $329.95) and wearing Burton Ion leather boots (retail \n     $499.95). Mr. Burton likes to hike in Adidas trail running \n     sneakers. In 2006, Burton purchased Channel Islands \n     Surfboards and Mr. Burton is constantly trying out new \n     boards. He has recently been riding the Average Joe short \n     board (retail about $1,500) and a Waterhog longboard (retail \n     $765) from Channel Islands.\n\n\n                              The Playlist\n\n       ``I'm hooked on hip hop,'' he says. ``It drives Donna nuts \n     so I try not to listen to it at home but I'll put on my \n     headphones when I hike. The music is so clean and raw. It \n     really motivates me.'' He says he'll listen to the classics \n     from Biggie [The Notorious B.I.G.], Tupac, and 2 Chainz or \n     he'll put on the hip-hop channel on Sirius XM Radio. ``I also \n     love classic rock so much that my kids now like it.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/03/senate-section/article/S735-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S735-S736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                RECOGNIZING THE LEGACY OF STORER COLLEGE\n\n Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I wish to honor Storer College, a \nhistoric educational establishment that truly left a significant \nimprint on the history of our State and our Nation.\n  Located in West Virginia's Eastern Panhandle in beautiful Harpers \nFerry, the legacy of Storer College began following the Civil War. It \nwas established by the Reverend Dr. Nathan Cook Brackett and \nphilanthropist John Storer of Sanford, ME, whose goals were to create a \nschool that was open and accepting of all students regardless of \ngender, race, or religion.\n  Particularly now, during Black History Month, it is fitting to \nrecognize such a tremendously important endeavor as Storer College \nbecause it had such a significant impact on civil rights in the decades \nfollowing the Civil War. This educational institution was a constant \nrefuge for former slaves who found themselves without the necessary \nskillsets to lead marketable lives. Attendees were taught how to read \nand write, but they also gained a sense of purpose.\n  John Brown's raid is largely considered the motivation for the \nschool's creation in Jefferson County, as the 1859 rebellion liberated \ncountless African Americans in the area. Frederick Douglass, also a \ntrustee of Storer College, once spoke at the school about John Brown \nand the raid's significance.\n  On October 2, 1867, Storer Normal School opened its doors with 2 \nteachers and 19 attending students. Under the leadership of Henry T. \nMcDonald, Storer converted into a college in 1938.\n  Storer College set the groundwork for integrated education across the \nrest of the Nation. For many years, it was the only school that allowed \nAfrican Americans to acquire an education past elementary school.\n  By the end of the 19th century, our Nation faced another battle \nmarked with Jim Crow laws and legal segregation. To combat these \ninjustices, many brilliant leaders in the African-American community \ncreated the Niagra\n\n[[Page S736]]\n\nMovement, a precursor to the NAACP. The second meeting of the Niagra \nMovement was held at Storer College in 1906. It was supported by such \nleaders as W.E.B. Du Bois, William Monroe Trotter, and Booker T. \nWashington.\n  In 1954, legal segregation came to an end with the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Brown v. the Board of Education. This decision, while \nrevolutionary across our Nation, also brought an end to Federal and \nState funding for Storer College, and regrettably, its doors closed a \nyear later.\n  Today, though no longer a learning institution, the National Park \nService continues the college's mission to welcome individuals of all \nbackgrounds by using the campus as a training facility. It continues to \nserve as a staunch reminder of triumph over injustice.\n  As we reflect on Storer's history, it is important that we continue \nto pass down this legacy for future generations because it remains \nrelevant in so many ways to this day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/03/senate-section/article/S736-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:16 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 361.

A bill to support the provision of safe relationship behavior \neducation and training; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, it is widely recognized that relationship \nviolence and campus sexual assault are major issues facing our Nation. \nAccording to the Department of Justice more than 290,000 Americans are \nvictims of rape and sexual assault each year with young women between \nthe ages of 16 and 24 consistently experiencing the highest rate of \nintimate partner violence. Secondary schools can play an important role \nin educating young people about relationship behavior and dating \nviolence, but comprehensive health education courses are not required \nto include these topics, even though similar requirements for including \nage appropriate content and abstinence-only education already exist.\n  Safe relationship behavior education is age-appropriate education \nthat promotes safe relationships and teaches students to recognize and \nprevent physical and emotional relationship abuse, including teen and \nadolescent dating violence, domestic abuse, sexual violence and sexual \nharassment. This includes education regarding consent as well as \nemotional health and well-being in relationships. Currently there is no \nfederal requirement that sex education courses cover topics like sexual \nassault prevention and discussions about communication in safe \nrelationships.\n  This is why I am proud to introduce with my colleagues, Senator \nMcCaskill and Senator Blumenthal, the Teach Safe Relationships Act of \n2015, which would build upon the Violence Against Women Reauthorization \nAct to develop and implement prevention and intervention policies in \nmiddle and high schools, including appropriate procedures for students \nwho are experiencing or perpetrating domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, stalking, or sex trafficking.\n  The idea for this legislation developed as a result of a meeting at \nthe University of Virginia with members of One Less, a sexual assault \neducation group that advocates for survivors of rape and sexual \nassault. With the alarming statistics on the prevalence of sexual \nassault on college campuses and in communities across the country, \nsecondary schools should play a role in promoting safe relationship \nbehavior and teaching students about sexual assault and dating \nviolence.\n  Currently, it is not mandatory for schools to offer health education. \nBut if they do, this proposal is consistent with existing requirements \nin current law. This bill will amend the Elementary and Secondary \nSchools Act, ESEA, to include safe relationship behavior education in \ncomprehensive health education and assists State and local educational \nagencies and institutions to meet the Title IX requirements of the \nEducational Amendments of 1972. Additionally, this legislation \nauthorizes grant programs to enable secondary schools to educate staff \nand administration, and provide age appropriate educational curricula \nfor students regarding safe relationship behavior. In addition to being \nage-appropriate the training and education programs must also be \nculturally and linguistically appropriate, reflecting the diverse \ncircumstances and realities of young people.\n  I am hopeful the Teach Safe Relationships Act will be one part of the \nsolution as lawmakers, parents, colleges and universities, and law \nenforcement continue working together to embrace comprehensive reforms \nto make our country safer. I strongly encourage my colleagues in the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions committee to consider this \nlegislation in any ESEA reauthorization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/03/senate-section/article/S738-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 63--CONGRATULATING THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS ON THEIR \n                       VICTORY IN SUPER BOWL XLIX\n\n  Ms. WARREN (for herself, Mr. Markey, Mr. Reed of Rhode Island, Mr. \nWhitehouse, Mrs. Shaheen, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Blumenthal, and \nMs. Collins) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation:\n\n                               S.
