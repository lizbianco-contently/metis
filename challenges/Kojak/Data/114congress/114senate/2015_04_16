Mr. President, human trafficking affects every State \nin this Nation--every single one of them. In Kentucky we have heard \nreports of victims as young as 2 months old--2-month-old victims of \nhuman trafficking. We heard about a Kentuckian who said she was sold \nfor sex from the age of 5 until she was able to physically break free \nas an adult. Stories such as these may shock the conscience, but they \nare hardly unique in our country.\n  The Judiciary Committee recently heard the story of Aviva, who was \nbarely a teenager when she was kidnapped and forced into modern \nslavery. Listen to this. Aviva was sold to as many as 10 different men \na night. Freedom was stolen from her, innocence ripped away. Aviva's \ntrafficker tried to stamp out everything that made Aviva Aviva. Aviva \neven forgot what it felt like to be human anymore.\n  Democrats have said they were in favor of helping victims such as \nAviva. Democrats demanded that I bring the Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act to the floor. But now that the very legislation is here \non the floor, our Democratic friends seem to have changed their tune \ncompletely--a totally different tune. Now that they have a chance to \nactually help the victims, they decided they are more concerned about a \nfew sentences in the bill--a provision they seemed perfectly fine with \nuntil just recently. They are more concerned about those few sentences \nthan actually solving the problem the bill would address.\n  Now, this provision has been included in countless bills they have \nvoted for and cosponsored. It is language they were perfectly happy to \nendorse again in another bill this very week--2 days ago. But that bill \nwas designed to help doctors, not children enslaved by sex traffickers. \nSo it is OK to vote for that kind of language if you are trying to help \ndoctors, but not OK to vote for that kind of language if you are trying \nto help these poor young children. Obviously our Democratic friends \nthink that doctors are worthy of their help. What about the victims of \nmodern slavery?\n  Now, the rationale for this filibuster seems to shift by the day, and \nit is almost incomprehensible. Their foremost concern seems to be about \ntreating this specific kind of money this way, versus treating that \nspecific kind of money that way. It is hard to follow; isn't it? \nFocusing all their attention not on the victims of these crimes but on \nfinancial assessments levied on the people who perpetrate them--the \ntraffickers.\n  Honestly, I am not sure why anyone would think money collected from \ncriminals ought to get more consideration than money collected from \nlaw-abiding taxpayers. What a strange argument. But this is where they \nhave planted their flag. That ridiculous argument is where they have \nplanted their flag.\n  Their contention is essentially that the victims of trafficking \nshould get no help at all because Democrats say the money they would \nreceive might be considered ``private'' and that this bill should not \npass, therefore, because the bipartisan Hyde principles it contains \nmight apply to those private funds. If that argument sounds contrived \nand illogical to you, you are not alone.\n  Now we find out it is not even true. Let me repeat that. The very \nheart of the Democrats' argument isn't even true. That is what the \nnonpartisan Congressional Research Service told us just yesterday.\n  So I would ask my Democratic friends to listen to this closely. CRS, \nthe Congressional Research Service, answered some very straightforward \nquestions posed by the senior Senator from Texas, my friend and \ncolleague Senator Cornyn. Here is what they said to Senator Cornyn: \nMoney deposited in the General Treasury from traffickers, as the \nFederal law requires, is Federal money, according to CRS.\n  So let me repeat. The Democrats have been blocking an antislavery \nbill over money they call private, and they are not even correct about \nthis. Our Democratic colleagues have also blocked this bill because \nthey say Hyde has only applied to annual spending or\n\n[[Page S2228]]\n\nappropriations--not mandatory spending. It is another argument that the \nCongressional Research Service tells us is simply not true--not true.\n  The experts at CRS say Hyde has applied to mandatory spending of \nFederal funds out of the General Treasury, as the Cornyn amendment \nprovides. And CRS concludes that Hyde just applied to mandatory \nspending in the very doc fix bill that 100 percent of our Democratic \nfriends voted for 2 days ago.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the CRS memorandum be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  I ask my Democratic friends to stop this. Stop this. Take a breath \nand think about what is being done. Children are being sold into sexual \nslavery, having their freedom and self-respect ripped away. Will they \nfinally allow the Senate to help them or will they continue some \ndebunked crusade?\n  We have offered several compromises to address the concerns they have \nraised. We will soon vote on another one that Senator Cornyn has been \noffering. He has been reaching out to our Democrat friends for weeks \nnow to try to find a solution to this nonproblem. The findings of CRS \nmake it clear that we are doing nothing extraordinary or unusual here. \nWe are simply applying long-accepted principles that Americans \noverwhelmingly support. Most people would think that sounds pretty \nreasonable. It is time to get serious and pass this important \nlegislation.\n  A large, bipartisan majority of the Senate has already voted \nrepeatedly to approve this bill. With the support of a couple more \ncourageous Democrats, we can bring an end to this debunked filibuster \ntoday.\n  The victims who survive brutal abuse don't need more of our friends' \nillogical contortions and justifications. They just need help, and they \nneed it now. They need the help the Justice for Victims of Trafficking \nAct would provide.\n  Why don't we finally get around to fixing this problem? The time to \ndo that is now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n                                                   April 15, 2015.\n     To: Senate Committee on the Judiciary.\n     From: Edward C. Liu, Legislative Attorney; Jon O. \n         Shimabukuro, Legislative Attorney.\n     Subject: Analysis of S.Amdt. 1120 to S. 178.\n       This memorandum responds on an expedited basis to your \n     request for an analysis of specific questions you have posed \n     regarding a draft amendment denoted ``ALB15639'' which \n     appears to be identical to S.Amdt. 1120 to S. 178. Your \n     questions have been reproduced below verbatim followed by our \n     responses.\n\n\n ``1. Does the text of ALB15639 require all special assessments to be \n               deposited in the General Treasury Fund?''\n\n       Yes. Section 3302(b) of Title 31 of the United States Code, \n     also known as the miscellaneous receipts statute, requires \n     that all money received for the federal government must be \n     deposited in the General Fund of the Treasury unless \n     disposition of the receipts is otherwise specified by law. S. \n     178, as amended by S.Amdt. 1120 does not appear to specify a \n     different treatment for the assessments received.\n       The new Sec. 3014(d) created by S.Amdt. 1120 would specify \n     that ``consistent with [the miscellaneous receipts statute], \n     there shall be transferred to the [Domestic Trafficking \n     Victims'] Fund from the General Fund of the Treasury an \n     amount equal to the amount of the assessments collected under \n     this section, which shall remain available until expended.'' \n     The transfer of funds from the General Fund does not affect \n     the disposition of the assessments in a way that would \n     supersede the miscellaneous receipts statute, though the end \n     result for the respective balances of the General Fund and \n     the Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund appears to be \n     mathematically equal to directly depositing the assessments \n     into the Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund. The conclusion \n     that the assessments are deposited into the General Fund is \n     reinforced by the clause requiring that the transfer occur \n     ``consistent with'' the miscellaneous receipts statute.\n\n\n ``2. Once the special assessments in ALB15369 are deposited into the \n  General Treasury Fund, would they be classified as federal funds?''\n\n       Yes, amounts in the General Fund are considered ``federal \n     funds'' by the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB''). In \n     the Analytical Perspectives volume of the Budget for FY2016, \n     OMB provides background information on budget accounts. This \n     information would seem to be instructive for determining how \n     funds, i.e., amounts, in the Treasury account will be \n     classified. OMB observes:\n       When money is received by the federal government, it is \n     credited to a budget account, .  . . . All budget accounts \n     belong to one of two groups of funds: federal funds and trust \n     funds. . . . The federal funds group includes the ``general \n     fund,'' the largest fund in the government used for the \n     general purposes of government and special funds and \n     revolving funds, both of which receive dedicated collections \n     for spending on specific purposes. Where the law requires \n     that federal fund collections be dedicated to a particular \n     program, the collections and associated disbursements are \n     recorded in special fund receipt and expenditure accounts. . \n     . . Money in a special fund must be appropriated before it \n     can be obligated and spent. The majority of special fund \n     collections are derived from the government's power to impose \n     taxes or fines, or otherwise compel payment.\n\n\n ``3. Do precedents exist for applying the Hyde amendment to mandatory \n               spending from the General Treasury Fund?''\n\n       Yes. Mandatory spending can be generally defined as federal \n     spending which is controlled by laws other than \n     appropriations acts. In recent years the Hyde Amendment has \n     included a clause extending its scope to trust funds to which \n     money was appropriated in that same annual appropriations \n     act. For example, the consolidated appropriations act for \n     FY2015 includes a Hyde Amendment with this clause, and also \n     appropriates funds from the General Fund to the Federal \n     Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. The Federal Hospital Insurance \n     Trust Fund is used to pay for services provided to Medicare \n     beneficiaries under Part A of the program. Because these \n     payments from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund are \n     controlled by the Social Security Act and are considered to \n     be mandatory spending, this would appear to constitute an \n     example of mandatory spending that was subject to the \n     versions of the Hyde Amendment.\n\n\n``4. Is not the language in Section 221(c) of H.R. 2 (Hyde language in \n House-passed SGR legislation) attached to mandatory spending from the \n                       General Treasury Fund ?''\n\n       Yes. Section 221(a) of H.R. 2 amends Sec. 10503 of the \n     Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) which \n     appropriates funds to the Community Health Center Fund (CHC \n     Fund) for certain fiscal years, out of any monies in the \n     Treasury not otherwise appropriated. Section 221 extends the \n     funding provided in Sec. 10503 for fiscal years 2016 and \n     2017. Pursuant to Sec. 10503, amounts in the CHC Fund are \n     available until expended, and are to be used by the Secretary \n     to increase funding of community health centers and the \n     National Health Service Corps. Subsection 221(c) of H.R. 2 \n     further provides that:\n       Amounts appropriated pursuant to this section for fiscal \n     year 2016 and fiscal year 2017 are subject to the \n     requirements contained in Public Law 113-235 for funds for \n     programs authorized under sections 330 through 340 of the \n     Public Health Service Act.\n       On its face, this restriction would appear to apply to the \n     amounts appropriated to the CHC Fund for fiscal years 2016 \n     and 2017. The spending of funds appropriated for those fiscal \n     years would appear to be controlled by Sec. 10503 of ACA, and \n     would not appear to be controlled by an appropriations act. \n     Therefore, spending from the CHC Fund would appear to be \n     classified as mandatory spending subject to the restriction \n     in subsection 221(c) of H.R. 2.\n\n\n``5. Is the language on page 4, lines 8-14 of ALB15639 (Hyde language) \n  also attached to mandatory spending from the General Treasury Fund''\n\n       Yes. The new 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3014(e)(3), as added by S.Amdt. \n     1120, states that:\n       Amounts transferred from the [Domestic Trafficking \n     Victims'] Fund pursuant to this section for each of fiscal \n     years 2016 through 2019 are subject to the requirements \n     contained in Public Law 113-235 for funds for programs \n     authorized under sections 330 through 340 of the Public \n     Health Service Act.\n       S.Amdt. 1120 further provides that amounts in the Domestic \n     Trafficking Victims' Fund shall be used by the Attorney \n     General, in coordination with the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services, to award grants or enhance victims' \n     programming, ``without further appropriation.'' This \n     provision is found in an authorizing measure which amends \n     Title 18 of the United States Code, and not an appropriations \n     act.\n       Therefore, using the same definition of mandatory spending \n     as provided above, the Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund \n     would appear to be mandatory spending that is subject to the \n     restrictions in the new 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3014(e)(3) that would \n     be added by S.Amdt. 1120.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/16/senate-section/article/S2228-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am not an expert in the field of \netymology, which is the study of the origin of words, but I do find the \norigin of English words to be enlightening. For example, the word \n``govern'' is one we hear often in the Capitol. ``Govern'' is derived \nfrom the Greek word meaning ``to steer or pilot\n\n[[Page S2229]]\n\na ship.'' The most important question for a party in power is simply \nthis: Can you govern? I say this to my Republican friends. In other \nwords, can you steer the ship? Can you pilot this great Nation of ours \nin the right direction?\n  We are just over 100 days in this Republican-controlled Congress, and \nit is already clear that the Republican leader and his side have not \nbeen up to the task. One need look no further than the Republicans' \nbotched handling of the human trafficking bill before the Senate.\n  I would just say in partial response to my friend the Republican \nleader that I have never been a big fan of polling--political polling \nor any kind of polling--because you can get any answer you want by \nasking the right question. Of course, the Republican leader, in the \nquestions submitted to the Congressional Research Service, asked the \nwrong questions.\n  The majority leader and the assistant majority leader took a piece of \nlegislation and steered it right into the rocks. The ship has sprung \nmany leaks. All Democrats and Republicans support the provisions of \nthis bill to help the victims of sexual trafficking and hold the \noffenders accountable, but instead of legislating on common ground, the \nRepublicans are legislating to obstruct. When they were in the \nminority, all they did was obstruct. So they know how to do that. I \nvouch for that. One of the things I said was that we are not going to \ntreat them the way they treated us. And we haven't done that.\n  The Republicans, now in the majority, can't filibuster themselves so \nthey are resorting to tanking good legislation--bills they themselves \nwrote and support--in order to score some type of political point. Does \nthat seem like reasonable governance to anyone? I don't think so.\n  Yesterday, I sat listening to the majority leader--and I did today--\nclaiming that they are seeking a compromise, even saying that \nRepublicans have offered three compromises. Well, if we are just going \non the number of offers made, we have done 10. We have made 10 good-\nfaith offers to get this human trafficking bill on the right path. We \nhave tried and tried and tried to reach an agreement. We have done 10. \nI will mention just a few.\n  We proposed that they strip the Hyde language from the bill. Then we \nproposed the Leahy substitute, which would strip the Hyde language and \nalso include Leahy's Runaway and Homeless Youth Act and Senator \nKlobuchar's Stop Exploitation through Trafficking Act, which would \nstrengthen the legislation. Then we proposed to use the entire \ntrafficking bill passed by the House instead of the Cornyn bill. That \nis the bill the House passed. Let's bring it to the floor here and pass \nit. We even proposed to keep the Cornyn fund but use it only for law \nenforcement efforts to help catch sex traffickers and use the House \nbill's authorization for victims services, including health care.\n  But Republicans would not agree to any of those changes. They simply \nare not interested in getting to ``yes.'' This morning, I heard some \ntalk that maybe we can work something out. I hope that, in fact, is \ntrue. I hope they are not using this urgently needed trafficking bill \nto continue to push through the party's backward agenda relating to \nwomen's health.\n  The Hyde language--I served in the House of Representatives more than \n30 years ago. I served with Congressman Hyde, a fine man. If there ever \nwere anyone who looked like a public servant, it was Henry Hyde--big \nman, beautiful white hair, great speaking voice. He, this good \nCongressman, is responsible for the Hyde language. It has been in bills \nsince then, but it applied and has always applied to government money, \ntaxpayer money--taxpayer money.\n  What we have said over the last couple of weeks time and time again \nis that Hyde should not be expanded to cover nontaxpayer dollars. That \nis what this is all about. We are not going to bend on that issue. It \nis not right. We do not need to expand Hyde. We think the Republicans \nbelieve this is a way to pacify the right-to-life community, some of \nthese--not all but some of these ideologues out there who want to \nexpand Hyde. We are not going to allow that to happen. Hyde should \napply to taxpayer-funded money and nothing else.\n  What has taken place on the direction of human trafficking is an \neffort to obfuscate--to hide the real purpose of the legislation. We \nall agree that human trafficking should stop. This legislation we have \nbefore us is a step in the right direction. We want to support that \nlegislation.\n  My friend the Republican leader said: Well, all they are complaining \nabout is a sentence or so. Well, that is why people spend all these \nyears going to law school, taking contracts courses. That is why my \nfriend the assistant Republican leader, who served as a trial court \njudge, a supreme court justice--during his entire career, he dealt with \nlawyers coming to him talking about sentences in a contract or \nsentences in a piece of legislation. That is what this is all about.\n  We should eliminate those sentences that allow Hyde to be expanded to \nnontaxpayer money. We cannot allow that to happen.\n  So, over 100 days into this Congress, we should move forward and get \nthis bill done. It is time that, on this legislation, Republicans right \nthe ship. If human trafficking legislation is any indication, \nRepublicans have not had a desire to govern dependably. I think that is \nunfair.\n  I hope this cloture vote will be defeated. I hope at that time people \nwill finally come to the realization that we are willing to do whatever \nneeds to be done to change this language so that the Hyde language is \nnot applied to taxpayer dollars. If that is the case, we can move \nforward expeditiously.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/16/senate-section/article/S2229-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

As a matter of \nfact, I think everybody from Texas is an optimist. Can you imagine the \nchallenges the people who founded our State had--Indians, wide-open \nhostile territory, tough weather. But they persevered because they were \noptimists. They thought the fight was worth the struggle. They thought \nthe goal and the accomplishment--the hope for accomplishment--was worth \nthe struggle.\n  I still remain optimistic--despite the last few weeks that have \nchallenged that optimism--that we will actually break through here and \nget to consider and vote on the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act \nand get help to the people whom the majority leader, Senator McConnell, \ndescribed, the children who cannot help themselves. I mean, for \nheaven's sake, if we cannot help the most vulnerable people in our \ncountry--children who cannot help themselves, who are the victims of \nmodern-day slavery--what in the world can we do?\n  So we have marked 100 days here in the Senate with the new Republican \nmajority. As I look back, I do not think anybody can deny that under \nthe majority leader's stewardship we have had some significant \naccomplishments in a relatively short period of time. Sure, it has been \nbumpy along the way. The Keystone XL Pipeline was a significant bump in \nthe road. But we had a strong bipartisan vote. Unfortunately, the \nPresident decided to veto that legislation.\n  After years of this Chamber being used solely for the purpose of \nmessaging and conducting political show votes, we are actually starting \nto get\n\n[[Page S2230]]\n\nsome things done. It is pretty exciting. As somebody who has been here \nsince 2002, it is hard to believe, when I say that, that I have \nactually been here during different phases and cycles of the Senate \noperating. I have to tell you that the last 4 years or so has been a \ndark period, a stain on the reputation of the Senate in terms of \nactually getting things done in the interests of the American people.\n\n  I understand the he said-she said and the blame game. The blame game \nis a world-class sport here in Washington, DC. But most of our \nconstituents couldn't care less about the blame game; they actually \nwant to see government function in their interest. Consistent with our \nprinciples, we are going to have some disagreements, there is no doubt \nabout it. But they hate the dysfunction. They hate the political \nposturing. You know what. I do, too. I dare say that the vast majority \nof Senators hate the dysfunction the Senate has experienced.\n  So there is a new spirit of optimism and, yes, hope, not that the Age \nof Aquarius has suddenly broken out--peace, love and understanding and \nwe are all going to hold hands and sing ``Kumbaya.'' That is not going \nto happen. But can we work together as Americans, as people who love \nour country, who have taken an oath to uphold and defend the \nConstitution and laws of the United States, who owe a fiduciary duty to \nthe people we represent? I represent 26.9 million people. That just \nstaggers my imagination when I think about it, when I think about the \nresponsibility associated with it. But I am encouraged when we have the \nchance to help people, especially those who cannot help themselves.\n  Well, one reason for my optimism about the new Congress is that we \nhave held a lot of votes. We had 15 votes last year, 15 rollcall votes \nin the Congress last year. We have had about 100 in the 100 days we \nhave been here. As a matter of fact, I have heard some of our \ncolleagues say: I am a little tired of voting quite as much as we have, \nparticularly on the budget vote-arama which lasted until 4 in the \nmorning. I understand that. But, you know, we have passed a balanced \nbudget in the Senate without raising taxes. The Congress has not passed \na budget since 2009. What more fundamental, basic function of \ngovernment is there than to pass a budget?\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer was Governor of his great State. \nI am absolutely confident he viewed that as one of the fundamental \nresponsibilities of his State government and of his office in \nparticular--to get the fiscal house in order. The way you do that is by \npassing a budget and determining what your priorities are--things you \nabsolutely have to do, things you perhaps want to do but maybe have to \ndelay, and things you simply cannot afford.\n  Every State, every local government, and, yes, the Federal Government \nshould pass a budget. We will in short order. The Senate has, and now \nwe need to reconcile our differences with the House, which we will \nshortly. But it is not just government; every family and every business \nhas to work on a budget. So that is progress. I am happy about that.\n  On Tuesday night, we actually fixed a problem that had been nagging \nthe Congress since 1997. Back in 1997, we, the Congress--we were not \nhere; the Presiding Officer and I were not here. The Congress had this \nbright idea: We are going to save money on health care by whacking the \npayments we make to providers and hospitals. Well, after a while we \nfound out that if we do not pay doctors and hospitals for treating \nMedicare patients, they will not see them.\n  So our seniors, to whom we had made a sacred promise--we will \ncontinue to make sure Medicare provides quality service and is \naccessible--all of a sudden, it was not quite so accessible because \npeople could not find a doctor who would take a new Medicare patient.\n  That is still a problem, so we came back over the intervening years \nand 17 times out of the 18 times those cuts would have been imposed, \nCongress reversed them. We had an expression around here that \nunfortunately we had to use a lot; we called it the doc fix. That is an \ninelegant way, perhaps, of describing what we were doing, but basically \nwhat we were trying to do was preserve Medicare and access to doctors \nand hospitals for our seniors who are the beneficiaries of the Medicare \nsystem. That, to me, represents some progress, that we have fixed that \nonce and for all.\n  Then, imagine my surprise that, after the contentious issue of \ncongressional approval of the anticipated Iranian-U.S.--along with our \nallies--nuclear negotiations, this deal that could be forthcoming this \nsummer, imagine my surprise, after the President said he would veto it, \nwhen the Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously passed a bill \nout of the committee. All Democrats voted for it. All Republicans voted \nfor it. Oh, by the way, when the President began to count the numbers \nand the support in the Senate on a bipartisan basis, he said: You know \nwhat. I think I will sign that piece of legislation when it comes to my \ndesk. I think that represents progress.\n  One other item that has made me somewhat optimistic on this 100th day \nof the new Congress is that we are very close to working out a trade \ndeal that the President supports and I would say Republicans by and \nlarge support. Honestly, there is probably more controversy on the \nDemocratic side than there is on the Republican side. But in a world \nwhere 80 percent of the purchasing power and 95 percent of the \npopulation exists beyond our shores, why in the world would we not want \nto open new markets to the stuff we grow--our farmers, our ranchers--\nthe livestock we raise, and the things we make? I think it makes good \nsense.\n  So you can see why I, perhaps, am optimistic about this new Congress \nand what we have been able to do together on a bipartisan basis to make \nprogress in the interests of the American people.\n  The one thing that has me completely bamboozled and befuddled is the \nobjections over this antitrafficking legislation that had 30 \ncosponsors--roughly an equal number of Democrats and Republicans--and \npassed--sailed out of the Judiciary Committee.\n  My friend the Senator from Illinois, the Democratic whip, knows that \nthe Judiciary Committee is no place for the faint of heart. We have a \nlot of disagreements. Maybe that is because we have a lot of lawyers on \nthe Judiciary Committee. We fight a lot about things we believe in \nstrongly. But this antitrafficking legislation sailed out of the \nJudiciary Committee on a unanimous basis.\n  I hope we can work out these differences, and I have made multiple \nsuggestions and compromises in an effort to try to get everybody to \nyes.\n  I agree with the majority leader's description of the sordid, \nunspeakable, evil of human trafficking and the compelling reason we \nought to do something to address it.\n  I know that is where the hearts of all of our colleagues are, but \nsomehow we have just gotten stuck. We need to get unstuck, and I hope \ntoday will be that day. Of course, human trafficking is a plague in all \n50 States, and my State, unfortunately, has way too much of its share.\n  I, like all of our colleagues, have had the chance to meet many of \nthe brave victims of human trafficking. One victim I met last week in \nAustin is Brooke Axtell.\n  Our friends at Google convened a meeting in Austin. The technology \ncommunity understands that a lot of the solicitation of underage girls \nand victims of human trafficking occurs online. So they have come \ntogether to try to work with law enforcement, work with victims' rights \ngroups to try to come up with a comprehensive way to combat it.\n  At Google last week in Austin, I met Brooke Axtell, who was \nintroduced to America when she gave a moving speech at this year's \nGRAMMY Awards. In Texas, she is better known for her work with a number \nof nonprofits that are focused on ending domestic violence and human \ntrafficking. I can't begin to tell you how inspiring she is and her \nwords were, particularly when you comprehend the horror, the absolute \nhorror of what she had been through as a victim of human trafficking \nherself.\n  Starting at the age of 7--7 years old--Brooke was sexually abused. \nShe was literally put in chains and a cage--treated like an animal--in \na basement. She was repeatedly sold to men who raped and abused her.\n\n[[Page S2231]]\n\n  Out of this horror that she experienced as a young child, Brooke has \nbrought life to her pain, and I think her leadership in the \nantitrafficking effort has actually helped her heal. She is one brave, \ncourageous, young woman. She founded a group called Survivor Healing \nand Empowerment, which is a healing community for the survivors of \nrape, abuse, and sex trafficking.\n  That is why, today, at 11 o'clock, I hope all of our colleagues \nlisten not only to Brooke's voice and her experience, but each one of \nus on the floor could tell a similar story about somebody in their \nState, somebody they know, they have met, who would be helped by this \nlegislation.\n  I hope we don't tell them no. I hope we don't shut another door in \ntheir faces.\n  I see some of our colleagues on the floor. I want to briefly give \nthem a chance to speak before we vote at 11 o'clock, just to say that \nthe underlying legislation is not partisan. It would strengthen law \nenforcement tools and authorities to rescue victims, while taking down \nthe human traffickers and the criminal networks that support them. The \ngoal is to provide at least $30 million through fines and penalties \npaid into the public Treasury that would then go to help heal and \nrescue the victims of human trafficking.\n  Now, this is not tax money, so it is deficit neutral. We are not \nraising taxes to do it. We are making the people who purchased these \nservices, who were convicted and have to pay fines and penalties, pay \nto help rescue and heal the victims.\n  Shortly, we will vote on another compromise I have offered. I have \ntried to listen to the objections of our friends across the aisle--and \nI don't want to relitigate those because, frankly, that is not \nparticularly productive. They seem to be locked in. I am sure they \nwould say we are locked in, and so we are trying to find a way forward.\n  First, and most important, this amendment would completely replace a \nprovision that Members on the other side have objected to regarding the \napplication of the Hyde amendment. The amendment would replace the \nlanguage or the provision negotiated by Leader Pelosi from the doc fix \nbill I mentioned earlier that passed the House with 392 votes; 180 \nHouse Democrats voted for this bill, including Leader Pelosi. So we \nhave substituted that language for the original language.\n  Of course, in the Senate we had 92 Senators vote for that same \nlanguage, and our colleagues across the aisle have repeatedly voted for \nsimilar language.\n  So the Pelosi language from this bill that my amendment includes \nwould simply say any funds used to provide services for victims of \nhuman trafficking would be subject to the same requirements as funds of \nthe Public Health and Services Act.\n  The majority leader has said it well: If this language is good enough \nto help the doctors and the hospitals, surely it is good enough to help \nyoung 7-year-old victims of human trafficking, such as Brooke Axtell.\n  To further clarify, to address the stated concerns of our friends \nacross the aisle, this amendment would also clarify that all money--all \nthe money in the Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund--must be derived \nfrom the General Treasury. This is an objection I don't personally \nunderstand, but we want to make it clear--just perhaps to help our \ncolleagues get to yes--that all of the money would be derived from the \nGeneral Treasury, which, of course, is where all Federal funding comes \nfrom, and we would make clear that all of the money would be public \ndollars.\n  I don't get this because tax dollars are private dollars until you \ngive them to the government, and then they are no longer public-\nprivate, they are public. Private penalties are private until you pay \nit to the government, and then it is public.\n  But we want to make clear, to eliminate any rationale for any \nobjection, and say that explicitly these would be public dollars. The \nrequirements placed on funds under the bill would not be placed on the \nfees and penalties. That seemed to be a matter of concern, and we tried \nto address that.\n  As I explained, the pending amendment would do what I have tried my \ndead-level best to do, to try to address the concerns our Democratic \ncolleagues, who have blocked the bill so far, have continually \nexpressed.\n  So the language is just the same as the doc fix, and we have made \nclear that none of the fines and penalties themselves--but rather funds \nderived from the General Treasury--would be used to pay for these \nservices in an equivalent amount to the fines and penalties.\n  I would add, parenthetically, when I was talking to one of our \ncolleagues about it, they said: Well, that is money laundering. You are \ntaking fines and penalties and you are transferring it, you are \nsubstituting it into a general fund.\n  I mean, give me a break. What we are trying to do is find a solution. \nI think we have given our colleagues every opportunity to get to yes.\n  I know, because I have talked to a lot of them--including the Senator \nfrom Illinois--people want to get to yes. I hope we have found a way to \ndo that. So I hope we will not let the political gamesmanship continue \nto get in the way of a bill that would bring relief and healing to \nvictims of human trafficking.\n  I hope we will have that vote at 11 o'clock, and there will be broad, \nbipartisan support to proceed to the bill and to pass the legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on the Democratic \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 20 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will be very brief because I see my \ncolleague from Connecticut on the floor.\n  Let me say at the outset, in the most positive way, I thank Senator \nCornyn and Senator Klobuchar of Minnesota for their bipartisan effort \nto bring this issue to the floor and to the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  We had a hearing in a subcommittee on this subject, and it was \nheartbreaking to hear about the exploitation of these young women at \nsuch a tender age. Unspeakable things were happening to them.\n  Sadly, in many States, when they finally came into the custody of law \nenforcement, some of them--some of the children--these young girls, \nwere being charged as criminals until it was clear they had been \nenslaved and they had been exploited for so many years. So thinking on \nthis subject is moving in the right direction. The suggestions of \nSenator Cornyn and Senator Klobuchar are also in the right direction.\n  So why don't we pass this bill? We have all of this bipartisan \nsupport. One provision in this bill turns out to be fraught with \ncontroversy.\n  Thirty-nine years ago, a Congressman from Illinois named Henry Hyde \noffered compromise language on the issue of abortion. It was just a few \nyears after Roe v. Wade. It was still very controversial. He said: We \nwill prohibit the expenditure of taxpayer funds for abortion except in \ncases of rape, incest, and the life of the mother.\n  For 39 years, that has been the standard. There has been an uneasy \ntruce between those who see this issue in many different ways. They \nhave come to the conclusion this will be the standard that would be \napplied to the expenditure of taxpayer funds, and it is renewed year \nafter year.\n  Senator Cornyn, perhaps by accident or perhaps by design, crossed the \nline and started talking about not taxpayer funds but funds collected \nin fines from those guilty of human trafficking to create a victims' \nfund.\n  That has brought all of the debate and controversy--in fairness to \nSenator Cornyn and to Senator Murray, who has joined with others in \nthis battle, there has been an active exchange of compromise language. \nWe have counted, I think, 12 different versions we have sent over to \nSenator Cornyn. He sent probably as many our way.\n  So it isn't as if both sides have hunkered down and are just staring \none another down. There is an honest effort to find a solution. The \nsolution would not be embodied in the vote that had been scheduled for \n11 o'clock; it is the old language. But they are still working on new \nlanguage, and I hope we reach a point soon where we achieve that. We \nall agree human trafficking should stop and victims should be \ncompensated.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Connecticut.\n\n[[Page S2232]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I rise with regret because, \nunfortunately, we remain divided. There is so much common ground, so \nmany good ideas in this bill, and so much that unites us. We have so \nmuch more in common than in conflict on this bill.\n  The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act has involved so much work \nby great colleagues--Senator Cornyn, Senator Klobuchar, Senator Murray, \nSenator Feinstein, and my colleague who has just finished speaking.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill. We are divided on one \nparagraph that is simply unacceptable, and it is fundamental to the \ngoals of this bill, which is to restore human dignity and freedom to \nvictims and survivors of human trafficking. Restoring freedom involves \ngiving those survivors choices over whether they will bear children as \na result of that trafficking. Trafficking is, fundamentally, modern-day \nslavery. It is sex slavery and sex exploitation, which results, all too \noften, in pregnancy. At its core, the human trafficking bill before us \ntoday is about restoring human dignity to those victims and survivors \nand enabling them to avoid the long-lasting and enduring consequences \nof that slavery.\n  This legislation is an acknowledgment of our common commitment to \nthese survivors and to providing them the services and support they \nneed so much. One of them is abortion. Where we are divided is on \nguaranteeing that reproductive right--the essence of freedom, dignity, \nand choice. So it is well beyond a technicality here. It is about the \nfundamental goals of this bill, which are contradicted by this \nprovision in the law.\n  Senator Cornyn's proposed amendment changes the words of this \nparagraph that we find objectionable, but it doesn't change the basic \nsubstance or its practical effect. We are told the provision in \nquestion doesn't matter because it includes a rape exception, but it \nrequires the survivor to request, to ask, to entreaty and supplicate to \nthe State whether the rape was really rape, whether it is a pretense or \nthey must bear a rapist's child.\n  We are told the provision in question is essentially the same as the \nHyde amendment, but that is flatly untrue because the Hyde amendment \napplies to taxpayer funds. I would say to my colleague from Texas, a \ngood friend, who is determined to address this problem of human \ntrafficking, there are no taxpayer funds in that $30 million that is \ntaken from criminal fines and penalties. It is an entirely different \nsource of funds.\n  As a former prosecutor, I view those moneys as restitution. They come \nfrom criminals and they are used to try to support and serve the \nvictims of that criminal activity. There is nothing more fundamental \nthan using funds taken from criminals for the benefit of their victims. \nCongress has never before privileged the concerns of criminals over the \nrights of women, and we should not start now.\n  I respect my colleague from Texas and other colleagues who may differ \nwith me on this issue. He has stated, in heartbreaking and eloquent \nterms, the practical human impact of trafficking, sex slavery. I ask my \ncolleagues now to give these women the real freedom from that sex \nslavery. Liberate them, truly, from this heinous and horrific violation \nof basic human rights by guaranteeing them one of the basic human \nrights, which is the right to make choices about their own bodies, \nabout their futures, about their hopes and dreams as they are liberated \nfrom this slavery. Let this Chamber and my colleagues recognize the \nrights they have to truly be free from those who enslave them. I urge \nthis body to strike the Hyde language from S. 178 and to make good on \nits promise.\n  As cochair of the bipartisan Senate caucus to end human trafficking, \nI agree completely this cause ought to be bipartisan. It ought not to \ndivide us along any partisan or party lines. I am proud to have worked \nwith Members on both sides of the aisle, and I hope we can come to \nagreement now with my good friend and my excellent colleague Senator \nCornyn and others who have worked so hard and who are so genuinely \ndetermined to solve this problem and to take a step--it is only a first \nstep--in the direction of combating human trafficking.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, my friend and colleague Senator Cornyn \nhas been involved in discussions with the minority about a path forward \non the trafficking bill, and I would like to ask him if he is \noptimistic that we may be able to reach an agreement at some point in \nthe near future about a way to go forward.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would say to the distinguished majority \nleader that I am more optimistic than I have been at any time in the \nlast few weeks. I just talked to the Democratic leader who told me \nthere are active discussions taking place by all of the key people who \ncan help us break this deadlock, and so I am more optimistic. We are \nnot there yet, but we are in a much better place than I think we have \nbeen certainly in the last 3 weeks. So I am hopeful and somewhat more \noptimistic.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we would like to be able to process \nthis important bill and move on to a vote on the President's nominee \nfor Attorney General. Based upon the progress that is being made by my \nfriend and colleague from Texas, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw \nthe cloture motion on the Cornyn amendment No. 1120.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Wasteful Spending\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, as I have done for the last several weeks, \nI am back again for this week's ``Waste of the Week,'' a series of \nweekly speeches which points out how we can save taxpayer dollars by \nlooking at waste, inefficiency, duplication, and other factors that are \nsimply a waste of taxpayer money.\n  Because this is April and because it is just a day after that fateful \nday in April, April 15--and we all know what that means--our waste of \nthe week.\n  Clearly, there is a growing consensus that our Tax Code is hopelessly \ncomplex, hopelessly burdensome, hopelessly anticompetitive, and needs \ncomprehensive reform. That is not what we are here to talk about today, \nbut I am a strong proponent of moving forward on that issue. It has \nbeen almost 30 years now--1986 was the last time a comprehensive reform \nwas enacted by Congress. It turned out to be a tremendous stimulus to \nour economy. It created a boost in growth and boosted the economy in a \nway that provided us with the necessary funding without having to raise \ntaxes, and, in fact, it lowered taxes because of its dynamic effect. \nThat is an issue for another day. We will continue to try to pursue \nthat. As a member of the Finance Committee, I know that is one of our \nmajor goals this year, as it is in the House of Representatives. \nWhether or not we are able to achieve our goal, we need to keep working \non that.\n  Today, I want to talk about the waste of the week by looking at the \nTax Code and doing something I think would be a relatively easy and \nsimple way to save the taxpayer some money. It involves a refundable \nchild tax credit. The tax laws allow a refund which is not an offset of \ntaxes owed but an actual direct payment that occurs if you have \nchildren. The refundable child tax credit is pretty straightforward. It \nqualifies a taxpayer for a credit of up to $1,000 per child depending \non their income level.\n  I am not here today to talk about the merits of that tax credit. I \nhave supported it in the past, and I think it is something that ought \nto be given serious consideration in any kind of tax reform. Rather, I \nam here to discuss the cost to the American taxpayer due to\n\n[[Page S2233]]\n\nthe improper use of payments that are made to recipients who don't \nlegally qualify for this refundable payment.\n  According to the inspector general at the IRS, the Internal Revenue \nService sent out at least $5.9 billion in improper payments in 2013--\npayments that went to people who did not legally qualify for the \nbenefit.\n  Listen to what Russell George, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax \nAdministration, said:\n\n       The IRS has continually rated the risk of improper \n     Additional Child Tax Credit payments as low. However, [our] \n     assessment of the potential for improper payments in this \n     program indicates that its improper payment rate is similar \n     to that of the Earned Income Tax Credit.\n\n  What is that rate? Nearly $6 billion and even more than that over a \nperiod of time.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       It is imperative that the IRS take action to identify and \n     address all of its programs that are at high risk for \n     improper payments.\n\n  Today, we are talking about one of those programs that Russell \nGeorge, the Treasury Inspector General, defined and suggested we look \nat, and we will be looking at some others later.\n  We are proposing a pretty easy fix, and I am supporting legislation \nthat will require the submission of a valid Social Security number in \norder to claim the refundable portion of the child tax credit. \nRequiring the submission of a valid Social Security number does not \ntake the credit away from anyone who legally qualifies for this credit, \nbut it does help ensure that only those who are truly legally qualified \nwill benefit from the credit and will receive the payment.\n  According to the most recent estimate by the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, this simple fix--simply requiring a valid Social Security \nnumber before a payment is given so we can weed out those improper \npayments--could save taxpayers $20 billion over a 10-year period. \nCompared to our multitrillion-dollar budget, $20 billion is a fairly \nsmall percentage, but compared to the way the taxpayer looks at this, \n$20 billion is a lot of change. It is a lot of money, and the savings \nfrom that can be used in any number of ways. Hopefully, it will be used \nto lower rates people have to pay in terms of the tax revenues they \nsend to Washington, but if it is needed for essential programs, such as \nnational defense or homeland security, and we can prove a need for \nthat--we are constantly looking for ways to pay for things that are \nessential and need to be done--this is a perfect pay-for. So one way or \nanother, it is a benefit to the American taxpayer.\n  As we mark tax day this week, I wish we could say we are getting \nclose to major tax reform, but since we are not, it is important that \nwe continue to look at the Tax Code as well as other functions of \ngovernment to determine how we can continue to save taxpayers money and \nhow we can continue to identify unfair and complicated areas of our Tax \nCode.\n  So with that we add to the gauge, which is growing every week that we \nidentify a program. We started off at zero. Now we are approaching $50 \nbillion worth of savings for the taxpayer. Our goal is $100 billion. We \nare going to keep doing this week after week, and we are going to keep \nadding money that is identified by our politically neutral accounting \nefforts. We are going to keep adding to this gauge until we reach our \ngoal and hopefully go well beyond it.\n  Mr. President, $20 billion is no small amount of change. It is being \nused improperly, and we can save that money.\n  Stay tuned for next week's ``Waste of the Week.''\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  (Mr. FLAKE assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Deyo Nomination\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I come to the floor today to recommend \nto the Senate the confirmation of a very qualified individual, Mr. \nRussell C. Deyo, to become Under Secretary for Management at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  We are very fortunate to have an individual of Mr. Deyo's \nqualifications and integrity willing to serve our government working \nwith Secretary Jeh Johnson and trying to help him succeed in his \nmission of keeping this Nation safe.\n  Mr. Deyo has a long and successful career and background. After law \nschool, he clerked for Judge John Hannum of the U.S. District Court for \nthe Eastern District of Pennsylvania and then spent 2 years at a \nprivate law firm.\n  In 1978, Mr. Deyo joined the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District \nof New Jersey as an assistant U.S. attorney.\n  In 1983, he was promoted to chief of the special prosecutions unit \nfor public corruption.\n  In 1985, he came to Johnson & Johnson as a litigation attorney and \nbecame associate general counsel in 1999. He ultimately became vice \npresident and general counsel later in 2009 and was responsible for \nhuman resources.\n  After retiring from Johnson & Johnson in 2012, Mr. Deyo served as \nboth a standing member of a panel for potential product liability \narbitration for Eli Lilly and as chairman of the Corporate Board of \nAdvisers of the National Counsel of LaRaza.\n  He obtained his education at both Dartmouth College, with an \nassociate bachelor's degree, and at Georgetown University with a J.D. \nin June of 1975.\n  Again, I wish to thank Mr. Deyo for being willing to serve his Nation \nin this crucial capacity.\n  I would also like to thank the members of our conference for clearing \nhis name. I have worked very closely with our ranking member, the \nSenator from Delaware, in trying to develop not only a mission \nstatement but also a commitment to enhance the economic and national \nsecurity of our Nation. We listed a bunch of priorities. The Presiding \nOfficer is on our committee, and she is also committed to those exact \nsame goals. One of the priorities we listed was our commitment to do \neverything we can to help the Secretary of Homeland Security, Secretary \nJeh Johnson, succeed in his mission of keeping this Nation safe. Our \ncommittee worked hard over a number of obstacles to make sure Mr. Deyo \nhas his vote now for confirmation.\n  I certainly thank my ranking member, the Senator from Delaware. I \nthank my Republican colleagues for clearing the way for this vote.\n  I urge all of our colleagues here in the Senate--I would love to see \na unanimous vote to approve Mr. Russell Deyo as the Under Secretary for \nManagement at the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, today I wish to express my gratitude to \nthe chairman for his work with his conference to clear the path to this \ndiscussion today of the nomination of Russ Deyo and to bring his name \nforward for hopefully confirmation this afternoon.\n  When I first met Russ Deyo, I asked him: How do you pronounce your \nname?\n  He said: ``Dio'' as in Rio.\n  I said: I think you mispronounce your own name.\n  He said: No, no. It is ``Dio'' as in Rio.\n  So I try to do that, but he has been called a lot of things. Some of \nthe things he ought to be called are talented and dedicated, and we \nshould call ourselves lucky that a guy or gal with his credentials from \nthe private sector is willing to come and go to work for the people of \nAmerica and to serve all of us.\n  The Department of Homeland Security is a Department that, as we know, \ndoes enormously important work to protect us. People all over this \nNation--in the air, on the ground, on the borders, in our cities, and \nall over our countryside--have my gratitude and I know the gratitude of \nall of us.\n  Every organization of any consequence needs good management, and the \nidea of bringing in Russ Deyo is--this is a fellow who will offer real \nstrength to the management team at the Department of Homeland Security. \nWe need him. We are glad he is ready to go into the lineup, and I hope \nwe will put him in there later this afternoon.\n  The position for which he has been nominated, the Under Secretary of\n\n[[Page S2234]]\n\nManagement, is the third highest position in the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  While this vote is long overdue, he has been approved by our \ncommittee now not once, I think, but twice. Unfortunately, we failed in \nthe Senate to act on his nomination before the end of the last \nCongress, so we had to start over again. I am just glad he is willing \nto serve in this role.\n  As of this week, more than a year will have passed since the last \nSenate-confirmed Under Secretary for Management--a fellow named Rafael \nBorras, a very good leader--stepped down from this post. I again thank \nChairman Johnson for his efforts and our joint efforts to move this \nnomination forward.\n  Everything I have learned about Russ Deyo over the past several \nmonths has led me to conclude that he is an exceptional candidate to be \nthe next Under Secretary for Management at DHS. Chairman Johnson has \nalready walked through his impressive career.\n  Russ Deyo is also no stranger to public service. We tend to emphasize \nhis very significant responsibilities at Johnson & Johnson and as a \npartner in a major law firm, but he has also worked with law \nenforcement organizations. He was an assistant U.S. attorney in New \nJersey for 8 years--something we don't always note--including a period \nas chief of the public corruption unit. His perspective from the \nprivate and public sectors is going to be a great asset to Secretary \nJeh Johnson and to Alejandro Mayorkas, the Deputy Secretary at the \nDepartment, as they work together to get the Department operating in a \nmore unified and cohesive manner, in creating one DHS.\n  If confirmed, Mr. Deyo is going to face plenty of challenges. For \nexample, the Government Accountability Office continues to remind us \nthat the overall management of the Department remains on GAO's high-\nrisk list of government operations that need urgent attention. Of \ncourse, if confirmed, Mr. Deyo will inherit the challenge of improving \nmorale across the Department. I believe Mr. Deyo has the leadership, \nthe experience, and the skills necessary to tackle these and other \nchallenges at the Department and that he really will make a difference.\n  I would just say in closing that all of the organizations I have ever \nbeen a part of or observed, whether they happen to be a school or a \nuniversity, a sports team, a military unit, a business, a church, the \nHouse or the Senate--here or at the local level--the most important \nelement in the success of those organizations is almost always \nleadership. What we have endeavored to do over the last year, or \nactually a little more than a year, is to take the Department of \nHomeland Security--which was largely bereft at the senior levels of \nSenate-confirmed leadership--and with the addition of Russ Deyo in this \nNo. 3 position to be in charge of the management shop at DHS, they will \nhave a full slate. They will have a full slate for not the C team or \nthe D team or the B team but I think in many respects the A team. We \nexpect them to rise to the challenge--there are plenty of challenges \nthey face today--and Russ will help make that possible.\n  I wish to say to Russ Deyo, if he is listening: Thanks for your \nwillingness to hang in there with us until we could get to \nconfirmation.\n  To the Deyo family: We appreciate very much your willingness to share \nyour spouse and in this case your dad with the people of this Nation. \nWe need him. We will put him to good work, and after a while we will \nsend him back to you safe and sound.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/16/senate-section/article/S2234-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF RUSSELL C.

Mr. President, I am going to have, later on--I was hoping\n\n[[Page S2235]]\n\nwe would be able to do this today--a couple of amendments that I can't \nimagine will be any problem on the floor. But it has been a problem \nthat has been with us for a long period of time, and we are in a \nposition to do something about it.\n  Due to a couple of Supreme Court cases, ICE cannot detain convicted \ncriminal aliens awaiting deportation beyond 6 months. So what they have \nto do is--they have no choice--they have to put them back into the \ncommunity, and they are back where they can continue to commit the same \ncrimes that they committed before.\n  In 2013, over 36,000 criminal immigrants with over 88,000 convictions \nwere released back into our communities, including convictions of over \n100 commercialized sexual offences, over 700 sexual offences, and many \nothers. But that is 36,000, all in 1 year. Now, since that time, \n176,000 of nondetained convicted criminals have gone back into our \nsociety. This is something I can't imagine anyone would want to \ncontinue.\n  My amendment would allow for the government to renew detention of \nthese criminal aliens every 6 months to determine, should they be \nreturned to society, what the risk is. Then we can let justice take \nplace. But it does away with that prohibition of anything over 6 \nmonths. So we have people out there right now--167,000 alien \ncriminals--who very likely could repeat their crimes. That is my \namendment No. 275.\n  Amendment No. 276. Last summer, we saw tens of thousands of kids come \nacross our southern border. Some were housed in my State of Oklahoma at \nFort Sill. This summer, experts are predicting another wave of children \nfrom Central America. This is the problem. If these were kids who came \nover from either Canada or Mexico, we could do something about it. We \ncould actually send them back and have some authority.\n  But as it is right now, if one of them comes from Central America, \neven though they come through Mexico, they are citizens of a Central \nAmerican country, and so we cannot do that.\n  I have an amendment that would--well, in fact, our situation in \nOklahoma is that we had several hundred who were just put there, and \nwhat do you do with a bunch of kids? So they put them in Fort Sill, and \nthey had a place where they could temporarily put them down. Then they \nkind of disappeared.\n  I had occasion to go into Los Fresnos in southern Texas. That is one \nof the largest centers where they will put these kids.\n  I went in there. They didn't really want me to go in there, take \npictures, and see what was going on. But in that particular center--I \nam going from memory now. I think they had a total of 80 beds--only 80 \nkids at the time.\n  I asked the question: How many kids have come through here in the \nlast 6 months?\n  And they said: Over thousands and thousands.\n  I said: Wait a minute. If you had thousands, where are they now?\n  They couldn't answer that.\n  So what happens is the kids come in, they temporarily identify them, \nand then they disappear into society.\n  Now, with this change, all we are doing is treating these kids who \nwould be coming into this country by giving our enforcement officers \nthe latitude and the opportunity to send them back or to let them go \nback voluntarily. Right now, they can't even go back voluntarily once \nthey cross the line coming into this country.\n  That is amendment No. 276. It is one that we will be considering and \nhopefully getting a vote on when we return early next week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Commemorating Virginia Tech Shooting\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate a horrible \ntragedy, to honor a community, and to challenge this Congress. Eight \nyears ago today I was the Governor of Virginia. I had just landed in \nJapan to begin a 2-week trade mission in Japan and India, and there was \na knock on my hotel room door. State Police informed me there had been \na horrible shooting on the campus of one of my State universities, \nVirginia Tech. We turned on CNN--that far away around the world--and \nsaw the news unfold, the horrific events of that day. We went back to \nthe airport, and we flew back home and spent weeks, months, and then \nyears dealing with the aftermath of this horrible tragedy.\n  Thirty-two wonderful Americans, Virginians, and folks from around the \nworld--students, professors, and graduate students of Virginia Tech--\nlost their lives that day. If you will allow me, I want to read their \nnames into the Record:\n  Ross Alameddine, Jamie Bishop, Brian Bluhm, Ryan Clark, Austin \nMichelle Cloyd, Jocelyne Couture-Nowak, Daniel Alejandro Perez Cueva, \nKevin Granata, Matthew Gwaltney, Caitlin Hammaren, Jeremy Herbstritt, \nRachael Elizabeth Hill, Emily Hilscher, Jarrett Lane, Matthew La Porte, \nHenry Lee, Liviu Librescu, G.V. Loganathan, Partahi Mamora Halomoan \nLumbantoruan, Lauren McCain, Daniel O'Neil, Juan Ramon Ortiz, Minal \nPanchal, Erin Peterson, Michael Pohle, Julia Pryde, Mary Karen Read, \nReema Samaha, Waleed Mohammed Shaalan, Leslie Sherman, Maxine Turner, \nand Nicole White.\n  Thirty-two precious, precious people of amazing accomplishment and \neven more amazing promise. Seventeen others were shot that day and \nwounded. Six others were not shot but were injured leaping from windows \nin a classroom building to escape the carnage. And so many others were \naffected: first responders, pastors, counselors, and the entire Hokie \nNation. That is what we call the Virginia Tech community.\n  I know there has been a presentation on the floor about mental health \nissues and first responders. Some of the most painful discussions I had \nwere in the aftermath of the shooting. I had many with family members \nand students who were injured, but some of the most painful were from \nthe first responders. The EMTs on the scene included students who were \nvolunteering at the campus EMT operation. Their description of this \ncarnage they walked into, as horrible as the carnage was--the physical \ncarnage--the thing that many of them told me was the most difficult for \nthem to get over was walking into classrooms where there were dead \nbodies and hearing in pockets and backpacks next to these prone forms \nthe vibrating and ringing of cell phones from parents and friends who \nhad seen the news on TV and were reaching out to try to find out \nwhether their friend or their child was safe. Those unanswered phones \nwere deeply, deeply difficult to those who were the responders.\n  I have friends who were pastors and counselors in the Blacksburg \ncommunity. And their own experiences years later have profoundly \ntransformed their lives. Even in tragedy, though, you can see examples \nof resilience and remarkable spirit. The Virginia Tech community, the \nHokie Nation, on that day demonstrated resilience and in the years \nsince. I do stand to honor that spirit and resilience of the entire \ncommunity, even as we acknowledge the horrible tragedy.\n  Two years ago on this day we were in the midst of a grim debate on \nthis floor inspired by another horrific shooting--the murder of \nschoolchildren in Newtown, CT. I stood on the floor and talked about \nthe shooting at Virginia Tech and the lessons we had learned. I\n\n[[Page S2236]]\n\ntold the story of just one of the victims. It is sort of unfair to \nsingle out a person because all were so special, but one of the victims \nwho was killed that day was a professor of engineering, Liviu Librescu, \nRomanian-born, who survived the Holocaust and who survived the Soviet \ntakeover of his native country, only to be killed by gun violence in \nAmerica as he barred the door to his classroom to stop the shooter from \nentering so that his students could safely escape. He survived the \nHolocaust, survived the depredation imposed on his country by Soviet \ncommunism and was killed by gun violence at Virginia Tech University in \nVirginia in this country.\n  I want to tell you today about two students who were shot that day \nbut survived. They offer a powerful lesson about the resilient human \nspirit and also offer a challenge to this body.\n\n  Colin Goddard was a senior just weeks away from graduation. He was \nbadly wounded. He was shot four times that day. My wife Anne and I \nvisited him in the hospital 2 days after the shooting. We see him and \nhis parents often. They live in Richmond, where we live.\n  In the years since his graduation, Colin has become a passionate \nadvocate for gun safety, especially focusing on the need for a national \nsystem of background record checks. He helped produce and was part of \nan award-winning documentary about his friends. The documentary is \ncalled ``Living for 32,'' and it is very powerful.\n  Elilta ``Lily'' Habtu was also a senior, and she was majoring in \npsychology. She was shot and badly injured that day. She is with us \ntoday in the Senate Gallery. Lily was already focused on helping \npeople, but the shooting put her on a new path. Along with other \nsurvivors, she founded Students for Gun Free Schools, a grassroots \nmovement to keep campuses safe. She received a master's degree in \nconflict analysis and resolution from George Mason University, and she \nhas used that training to work on a number of gun safety issues. She \nalso served as an intern at the White House.\n  I could tell wonderful stories about many of the others who were \nkilled or injured, and all of them are precious. I hope to do that in \nthe years to come because I have a feeling I will stand on this floor \noften on April 16. I focused on Colin and Lily today because of their \npassionate work for gun safety.\n  In the aftermath of the shooting at Virginia Tech, I commissioned a \npanel to review what went wrong that day. Lawyers said: Don't do that. \nPeople could use it to bring lawsuits against the State.\n  I said: No. We have to know what went wrong. We have to know what we \ncan do to reduce the chance this will ever happen again. We will not be \nable to eliminate violence. We will not be able to eliminate shootings. \nBut at least we can reduce the chance if we learn what went wrong.\n  My panel dug into it and made recommendations about mental health, \ncampus safety protocol, first responders, the training of campus \npersonnel, and about gun safety. These detailed recommendations led to \nnumerous changes in State and Federal best practices and laws, and I \nsaw legislators from both parties work together, with strong public \nsupport, to make changes so our campuses would be safer.\n  Mr. President, I would not be honest if I didn't say there was one \nrecommendation by my panel that was opposed both at the State and \nFederal levels--the institution of a comprehensive background record \ncheck system to keep weapons out of the hands of dangerous individuals. \nI wish to talk today about that continuing failure.\n  The Virginia Tech student who killed and wounded so many, Seung-Hui \nCho, should never have been able to purchase weapons at all. He had \nbeen adjudicated in a court in the Commonwealth of Virginia as mentally \nill and dangerous and was thus barred by Federal law from purchasing or \nowning weapons. That is a longstanding Federal law, but the Federal law \nis only as good as the background record check system that is able to \ndetermine when someone purchases a weapon if they have, in fact, been \nadjudicated mentally ill and dangerous. Because the record of his \nadjudication had not been entered into the national NICS database, he \nslipped through the cracks, and this troubled individual illegally \nbought the weapons that destroyed so many lives and removed so much \npromise from this Earth.\n  We fixed the narrow issue that led to Seung-Hui Cho's adjudication \nbeing left out of the database. I did it by executive order. My \nlegislature confirmed it at the Federal level. Laws were passed and \nsigned into law by President Bush to encourage States to enter mental \nhealth adjudications into the Federal database--a database that in the \nlast 20 years has succeeded at stopping more than 2 million people from \nmaking illegal gun purchases.\n  But just months later, as Governor, when I tried to make sure we \nperformed background record checks on everybody, especially those who \npurchased guns at gun shows, which account for a huge portion of the \ngun purchases in the United States--there is no law requiring \nbackground record checks at gun shows. When I made that effort, my \ngeneral assembly basically caved in to pressure from a Virginia \norganization--the National Rifle Association--and other groups, and \nthey voted against background record checks.\n  Two years ago, as a Senator, during the very week we were \ncommemorating the anniversary of the most horrific shooting to ever \nhappen on a college campus in the history of the United States and in \nthe shadow of the horrific shootings in Newtown, CT, we tried to create \na uniform background record check system at the Federal level, but the \nsame groups that fought against us in Virginia fought against \nbackground checks here.\n  Even in the shadow of the horrific shootings of the little kids in \nNewtown--and since the Newtown shootings, more than 70,000 Americans \nhave been killed by gun violence in this country--we still lack a \ncomprehensive background record check system. It is estimated that 40 \npercent of all of the guns that are sold in the United States occur \nwith no background record check.\n  The Presiding Officer knows the law. Convicted felons are not \nlawfully allowed to purchase their own weapons, but without a \ncomprehensive background record check system, they can and they do. \nPeople who have been adjudicated mentally ill and dangerous are not \nlawfully allowed to purchase their own weapons, but without a \ncomprehensive background record check system, they can and they do. \nDomestic violence perpetrators who have been placed under protective \norders are not lawfully allowed to purchase their own weapons, but \nwithout a comprehensive background record check system, they can and \nthey do.\n  So why not fix our laws to create a record check system so we can \nkeep weapons out of the hands of those who are not legally allowed to \nhave them? Why are groups such as the NRA so passionately opposed to \nkeeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people?\n  I am particularly interested in the NRA's position on this issue \nbecause I know the organization very well. The NRA is headquartered in \nVirginia. I know many NRA members. When I was the mayor of Richmond and \nI helped implement an antigun program--Project Exile--that would send \ngun criminals to Federal prison, the NRA supported our effort. So why \nis the NRA opposed to background record checks?\n  The NRA opposes background record checks even though American gun \nowners and even NRA members have frequently indicated strong support \nfor background record checks in polling.\n  The NRA opposes background record checks even though their avowed \nprinciples would suggest that they would support such laws. For \nexample, the NRA has been fond of saying: We don't need new gun laws; \nwe just need to enforce existing gun laws. That is exactly what a \nbackground record check does. It makes no change in the law as to who \ncan and cannot have a weapon; it just enables us to enforce existing \nlaws to stop dangerous people, such as Seung-Hui Cho, from purchasing \nweapons.\n  The NRA has also famously said that we should not take guns out of \nthe hands of law-abiding citizens; we should instead focus on getting \nguns away from criminals. Again, that is exactly what a background \nrecord check system does. It only stops people from purchasing weapons \nif they are legally prohibited from purchasing weapons.\n  If gun owners and NRA members support background checks in polls, and \nif\n\n[[Page S2237]]\n\nthe NRA's own principles suggest that background checks are in tune \nwith their philosophy, why have they fought so hard and so long to keep \nour Nation from having a comprehensive background check system? I have \npondered that question since 2007 because that day was one of the worst \ndays of my life. I spent a lot of time thinking about it and thinking \nabout what I ought to do as a citizen and elected official to reduce \nthe chance that anybody will ever have to go through that experience \nagain.\n  After pondering the question of why any legitimate organization would \nfight against background record checks, the only purpose of which is to \nkeep guns out of the hands of dangerous people who are not legally \nallowed to have them, I have come to the conclusion that there is only \none answer, and the answer is this: The NRA does not really speak for \nor represent American gun owners. Instead, they speak for and represent \nand, most importantly, receive funding from gun manufacturers. If you \nmake guns, it is in your financial interest to sell as many guns as you \ncan to whomever you can, whenever you can, and wherever you can. And I \nbelieve that is the reason so many States and even Congress are not \nable to pass background record check laws to keep us safer.\n  Mr. President, let me be self-critical. I would not call out the NRA \nif I were not about to do what I am about to do. I will bring it home \nand talk about Congress. If the NRA is now beholden to gun \nmanufacturers, I have to be honest enough to admit that Congress can \nhardly be self-righteous about this. I would argue that Congress is \nequally beholden to gun manufacturers as well.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, Congress generally leaves the \nquestion of tort law as a matter for States to resolve. We generally \ndon't have big tort reform at the Federal level. Republicans often \nadvance notions of States' rights and oppose Federal laws that trump \nState laws. Democrats are generally against efforts that block \nplaintiffs' access to State courts to seek redress for injuries. So, in \nsome ways, both Republican and Democratic principles have tended to be \nopposed to tort reform at the national level.\n  But here is an unusual example. In 2005, 10 years ago, both Democrats \nand Republicans joined together to support a major Federal tort reform \nact, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, and that act \nrestricts the ability of people to bring lawsuits against firearm \nmanufacturers in State or Federal court for negligent use of firearms. \nThis 2005 act, which was a bipartisan one in this body--13 Democrats \njoined with Republicans to pass it--is highly unusual because if you \nlook through the entire United States Code, you are not going to find \nmany national, Federal-level tort laws that shield entire industries \nfrom State court claims based on negligence. There may be another one, \nbut I don't know what it is. This is a highly unusual shielding of an \nentire industry--the gun manufacturing industry--from State and Federal \nclaims based on negligence. This industry uniquely receives this very \nspecial protection from the Congress of the United States.\n  When the law was passed in this body and signed into law by President \nBush, plaintiffs in State courts whose cases were being tried had to \nimmediately close down their cases. Plaintiffs who had won cases and \nhad cases on appeal immediately had their cases dismissed. This does \nnot happen often, but for gun manufacturers, in this Congress, it has \nhappened.\n  I will conclude by saying this: We have to make a decision about what \nis important. We have to make decisions every day about what is \nimportant. Should we keep weapons out of the hands of dangerous people, \npeople who are prohibited by law from having them--if you think the \nanswer is yes, then you should support background check laws--or should \nwe embrace a policy that is based on the notion that we should sell as \nmany guns as we can to whomever we can, whenever we can, and wherever \nwe can? Because that is the current state of the law with an inadequate \nbackground check system. It serves no one's interest other than gun \nmanufacturers', but the human cost is incalculably high.\n  As we commemorate the shooting at Virginia Tech, honoring those we \nlost and those brave survivors, such as Colin and Lily, who are using \ntheir painful experience to help others, and honoring the resilience of \nthe entire Hokie Nation, it is my hope that my colleagues will get \nserious about gun safety.\n  I am a gun owner and a proud supporter of the Second Amendment, but \nthe time is long overdue for a comprehensive background check system \nthat keeps weapons out of the hands of dangerous people like Seung-Hui \nCho. I look forward to the day when we will accomplish this and have a \nsafer nation as a result.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n Honoring Vietnam Veterans and North Dakota's Soldiers Who Lost Their \n                            Lives in Vietnam\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I rise again to speak about and honor \nour Nation's and North Dakota's Vietnam veterans, and, through my \ncontinuing series of floor speeches, specifically those brave \nservicemembers who gave the ultimate sacrifice.\n  As you know, we are in the midst of a commemoration of the 50th \nanniversary of the Vietnam war. This special period of honoring our \nVietnam veterans runs through 2025. I have partnered with students from \nBismarck High School in researching these soldiers, and once again I \nthank their instructors Laura Forde, Sara Rinas, and Allison Wendel for \ncoordinating this project and sharing their students' research with my \noffice.\n  Last month, I visited these students and was so impressed with their \ncommitment to this project. I want to say thank you again to the \nBismark High 11th graders and their teachers for helping us gather \nimportant information about the lives of these servicemembers.\n  This week, I am especially happy to be able to include information \nthey helped to find about the lives of Tom Alderson and John Tingley. I \nam also grateful to my friend Jim Nelson, a Vietnam veteran, who is \ndedicated to making sure each of these soldiers' immediate relatives \nreceives a Gold Star Family member pin and certificate.\n  I was happy to be part of Jim's ceremony in Bismark last year in \nhonoring these soldiers and their families. Through this effort, I hope \nto make sure our Nation never forgets the needs of our Vietnam veterans \nand the sacrifices of those who fell in service to our country.\n  There were 198 sons of North Dakota who did not make it home from the \nVietnam War. One hundred ninety-eight sons of North Dakota gave their \nlives for their country and their State. Today, I am honored to tell \nyou about a few of them.\n\n\n                       Clifton ``Cliff'' Cushman\n\n  First is Clifton ``Cliff'' Cushman. Cliff was from Grand Forks and \nwas born on June 2, 1938. He served in the Air Force--the 469th \nTactical Fighter Squadron. Cliff was 28 years old when he went missing \non September 25, 1966.\n  Cliff left behind his widow Carolyn and their son Colin, born just \ndays before Cliff learned that he would be deployed to Vietnam. Colin \nwas 9 months old when Cliff left for Vietnam.\n  Everyone in Grand Forks knows the name of Cushman because Cliff was a \nstandout athlete and a Silver Medalist in the 1960 Olympics in the 400 \nmeter hurdles. Grand Forks named their high school football stadium \nCushman Field after Cliff.\n  Grand Forks kids are still inspired annually by the reading of the \n1964 letter Cliff wrote to students about effort, after he fell while \nattempting to qualify for the 1964 Olympics. This is a quote from \nCliff's letter: ``I would much rather fail knowing I had put forth an \nhonest effort than never to have tried at all.'' Later in the same \nletter, Cliff wrote: ``Unless your reach exceeds your grasp, how can \nyou be sure what you can attain?''\n\n\n                        Thomas ``Tom'' Alderson\n\n  I want to talk about Thomas Alderson. Tom was from Grand Forks. He \nwas born on September 9, 1941. He served as a captain in the Army's \n56th medical company. He died October 3,\n\n[[Page S2238]]\n\n1968, at the age of 27. He was survived by his wife, mother, brother, \nand two sisters.\n  Tom was an Army dental officer in the Vietnam Dental Corps. His \nfather-in-law was his commanding officer.\n  In high school, he was an honor student and lettered in basketball, \ntrack, and tennis. He attended the University of North Dakota and the \nUniversity of Minnesota, where he earned his dental degree in 1966.\n  In Vietnam, Tom was in charge of several dental offices, which \nrequired travel throughout the country. Tom's driver in Vietnam wrote \nthe family a letter explaining that even as a dentist, Tom was ducking \nmortars all day long during his service.\n\n\n                         Raymond ``Ray'' Kramer\n\n  Next, Ray Kramer. Ray was from New Salem and he was born December 31, \n1946. He served in the Army's 1st Infantry Division.\n  Ray died on February 2, 1968. He was 21 years old. Ray was the sixth \nof nine children. His brother, Cecil, also served in the Army. Ray's \nnephew, Cody, is very proud of his Uncle Ray's service.\n  Ray grew up on the farm where his family raised grain and dairy cows. \nHe was an honor student at New Salem High School and later worked as a \ndedicated carpenter. Ray's sister, Beverly, remembers that Ray's dog \nloved him so much that he slept under Ray's car while Ray was in \nVietnam. After Ray was killed in action, his parents left the farm and \nmoved to town. His sister took Ray's dog to her farm 10 miles away, but \nthe dog ran all the way back home to wait for Ray under his car.\n\n\n                      Ronald ``Christy'' Goodiron\n\n  Ronald Christy Goodiron was from Shields and was born December 23, \n1947. He served in the Marine Corps' 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines.\n  Christy was 20 years old when he died on February 28, 1968. His \nfather Paul Goodiron served in World War I and was a code talker. \nChristy's close cousin, Paul Goodiron, also served in Vietnam. \nUnfortunately, Paul unexpectedly died last month. Paul's son, CPL \nNathan Goodiron, was also killed in action in 2006 serving his country \nin the U.S. Army National Guard in Afghanistan.\n  Christy's family remembers him as smiling all the time. Today, they \nhonor him at powwows by raising the American flag they received when he \ndied and singing the Vietnam ``Warrior's Song'' to honor Christy.\n  Christy's family appreciates reading what his fellow marines serving \nwith him wrote about their memories of him and the account of what \nhappened the day he died.\n\n\n                          Ronald ``Ron'' Bond\n\n  Maj. Ronald Bond was from Fargo and was born on July 30, 1930. He \nserved in the Air Force's 604th Air Commando Squadron. He was 37 years \nold when he went missing May 11, 1968.\n  Ron was the oldest of six kids and the first in his family to attend \ncollege. Ron's family remembers him as an adventuresome spirit. He \nloved hunting, fishing, water skiing, and even competitive sailing with \nhis wife.\n  Ron's military career began as a Naval ROTC Cadet in his first year \nat North Dakota State University. Ron then served in the Naval Reserve, \nenlisted in the Navy, and upon discharge immediately enlisted in the \nAir Force.\n  Despite an aircraft accident that injured his spine, Ron became a \nflight instructor and flew in more missions until he was killed in \naction in Vietnam. His body has never been recovered.\n\n\n                              Gary Lokken\n\n  Gary Lokken was from Bowman and was born on July 2, 1941. He served \nin the Army Reserve's Engineering CMD. He was 26 years old when he died \non April 10, 1968. Gary left behind his widow Paige and infant twins, a \nboy and a girl. The twins were 10 days old when Gary left for basic \ntraining.\n  Gary was a medical doctor, who studied in North Dakota and Texas. He \ncompleted his medical internship in Hawaii and planned to return there \nwith his family to live after his service. Six months after arriving in \nVietnam, Gary was killed while transporting patients when his vehicle \nhit a landmine.\n  His twins both entered the medical field. His son is a histology \ntechnician and his daughter a medical doctor.\n\n\n                         William ``Bill'' Eckes\n\n  William ``Bill'' Eckes was from Beach. He was born on September 20, \n1940. He served in the Navy as a Petty Officer First Class journalist. \nBill died March 10, 1967. He was 26 years old.\n  Bill was the oldest of seven children. His father was an Army \nsergeant in World War II. Bill was a well-known football player for \nBeach High School. He was on his second tour of duty in the Navy as a \njournalist when his aircraft crashed in South Vietnam.\n  He previously wrote for Stars and Stripes while he was stationed in \nSicily and Iceland. Margot, Bill's sister closest in age, remembers him \nas an intelligent, determined person whose plan was to come home after \nattending the University of North Dakota and have a career in the \nForeign Service.\n\n\n                            Jerome Ellenson\n\n  Jerome Ellenson was from Walcott and was born on April 3, 1946. He \nserved in the Army's 196th Infantry Brigrade. Jerome died on January \n10, 1968. He was 20 years old.\n  Jerome was the fifth of seven children. Jerome's oldest sister, \nMargie, remembers him as having a unique love of life, being a great \nstoryteller, and everyone's friend.\n  Margie tells about how Jerome would often give his family side aches \nbecause he had made them laugh so much on long car trips. Jerome didn't \nsay goodbye to anyone when he left for Vietnam.\n  His family was told he was the last survivor of his unit; that he \nmanned the radio until his death.\n\n\n                         Chester ``Skip'' Coons\n\n  Chester ``Skip'' Coons was from Bismark. He was born March 29, 1936. \nHe served in the Navy's Observation Squadron 67. He was 31 years old on \nFebruary 17, 1968, when he went missing.\n  Skip and his two brothers, Larry and Ronald, all served in the Navy. \nTheir mother Elsie still lives in Bismark and is 95 years old. Skip \nleft behind two young daughters who were thankful to meet fellow sky \nsailors of their dad's old unit.\n  Skip had planned to make a career out of the military. In high \nschool, he joined the North Dakota National Guard, then he joined the \nAir Force for 3 years, and later joined the Navy as a pilot. He was on \nhis third tour of duty in Vietnam when his plane was shot down on a \nreconnaissance mission over Laos. In 1993, his remains were finally \nrecovered.\n\n\n                           Richard Buringrud\n\n  Richard Buringrud was from Argusville and was born on November 24, \n1946. He served in the Army 12th Infantry Regiment. Richard died on \nJune 9, 1969. He was 22 years old.\n  Richard loved softball and playing basketball in high school. \nRichard's father still lives in Fargo and his family remembers the \nletters he sent home describing having been in a swamp, which was the \nfirst kind of bath he had in a week.\n  Richard was an expert rifleman and was killed when he went ahead of \nhis armored unit to help clear the way.\n\n\n                              Brent Sveen\n\n  Brent Sveen was from Harwood and went to high school in West Fargo. \nHe was born October 25, 1951. He was 18 years old when he died on \nSeptember 7, 1970.\n  Brent's father also served in the Army in World War II. Brent's older \nbrother Bruce, a marine, served two tours of duty in Vietnam.\n  Brent's sisters, Jean and Ava, remember Brent as befriending \neveryone, being the life of the party, and having a great sense of \nhumor and wit.\n  Brent's sisters cherish one family picture in particular. Their older \nbrother Bruce was wearing his marine uniform. Before taking the \npicture, Brent disappeared. He returned wearing his dad's old World War \nII Army uniform and the family took the picture with both boys in \nuniform.\n  Having an older brother serve in Vietnam, Brent could have waived out \nof his own service, but he was eager to serve his country and enlisted \nwhile in high school. Shortly before he died, Brent wrote this poem he \nmailed to his parents.\n\n     I think of my buddy I was talking to yesterday;\n     Now he's lying on the ground not far away;\n     They say he's dead, but I hope it's not true;\n     And if it is, to ease my tears I'll think of you.\n     I looked down at his body and began to cry;\n     I turned to the clouds and asked, God, why?\n     I waited awhile, but no answer came;\n\n[[Page S2239]]\n\n     Only the unceasing falling rain.\n\n  I want to thank Brent's sister Jean Kraft for participating in this \nproject. Jean joined me recently in a visit to the Bismarck High School \nsharing her own family's stories and encouraging these students to \nreach out to families and to learn about the lives of these young men \nwhom we lost in Vietnam. She is among my very favorite people and a \nhero herself.\n\n\n                          Peter Binstock, Jr.\n\n  Peter Binstock, Jr., was from New England. He was born May 5, 1947. \nHe served in the Army as an Armor Recon Specialist. He died on January \n3, 1969. He was 21 years old.\n\n  Peter was the oldest of 11 children. His family had eight girls and \nthree boys. Peter planned on taking over the family farm when he \nreturned from Vietnam. His sister Rose remembers Peter as always being \nin good spirits. While he was in Vietnam, he was fondly called ``Big \nPete'' because he was 6 feet 3 inches and very strong. He was promoted \nto corporal after his death.\n\n\n                              Ronald Kent\n\n  Ronald Kent. Ronald was from Page and was born April 21, 1943. He \nserved in the Army 25th Infantry Division. He was 23 years old when he \ndied on January 20, 1967.\n  Ronald was one of eight children. His family remembers him as a \nfearless man. He was small in stature but big in spirit. His sister \nCandice remembers that Ronald loved the outdoors, and he had the \nability to talk his nieces and nephews into anything, including \ncleaning his car.\n  A few years ago, Ronald's brother Steven spoke to the young men who \ncarried Ronald's body back to the base after he was killed. After \nhearing the description of that day, Steven knows that in those final \nmoments, all that Ronald was thinking about was saving his brothers-in-\narms.\n\n\n                               Ward Evans\n\n  Ward Evans. Ward was from Harwood, and he was born February 22, 1940. \nHe served in the Army 5th Infantry Division. He died on February 8, \n1969. He was 28 years old. Ward was the youngest of five children. His \nfamily remembers him as someone who was always ready to help others. \nHis sister Maryann remembers that when he came home from Vietnam on a \nbreak, he seemed sad and that the war had gotten to him, but he went \nback to complete his duty.\n  On February 8, 1969, almost all the men near Ward were killed. When \nthe chopper came back to pick up the survivors, Ward demanded to stay \nbehind in order to rescue three men who were still alive but also \nwounded. While tending to the injured soldiers, Ward stepped on a land \nmine.\n  Ward's nephew Mark is so proud of him and will always remember Ward \nas a man who did what was right no matter what the personal cost.\n\n\n                              John Tingley\n\n  John Tingley was from Kathryn. He was born on August 19, 1946. He \nserved in the Army 128th Aviation Company. He was 21 years old at the \ntime of his death, January 10, 1968.\n  John was one of six children born in 8 years. John's sister Mary \nremembers John as someone who did it all. He played the trombone in \nband, sang in the choir, was a member of the 4H Club, and played \nsports. He had a photographic memory and his sister knew he would have \nhad an enormously bright future.\n  In Vietnam, John was a helicopter gunner crew chief. The day he was \nkilled, John's helicopter was responding to a helicopter that had just \ngone down. While they were going to assist soldiers involved in the \ncrash, he was shot and killed.\n  All of these young men serving their country and serving each other \nremind us of the sacrifices we have experienced in war. They remind us \nthat there are so many among us who will run to the sound of the guns \nand protect our freedom. We cannot let their sacrifice ever be \nforgotten.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we are continuing to make progress on \nthe bipartisan antitrafficking bill. Senator Cornyn is working with \nChairman Grassley and Senators on both sides of the aisle to resolve \nthe remaining issues.\n  It is my hope we will be able to go through an orderly amendment \nprocess and pass the trafficking bill early next week. The Senate will \nthen consider the Lynch nomination through the regular order, as I have \nalready committed to doing, followed by consideration of the Iran bill \nas reported unanimously by the Foreign Relations Committee earlier this \nweek.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 1191\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time \nto be determined by the majority leader, with the concurrence of the \nDemocratic leader, the Senate proceed to vote on the motion to proceed \nto calendar No. 30, H.R. 1191, and that if the motion to proceed is \nagreed to, Senator Corker or his designee be recognized to offer a \nsubstitute amendment, which is the text of S. 615 as reported by the \nForeign Relations Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I reserve my right to object, and would say \nthat with the work done by Senators Murray and all the Judiciary \nCommittee, led by Senator Leahy and, of course, Senator Klobuchar, \nworking with Senator Cornyn, significant progress has been made. There \nis no question in that regard. But we are not there yet. Remember, we \nhad a problem with this initially because of the language in the bill. \nSo every word is going to have to be read with this new language that \nis drawn up, and then we will see if we can make it to the finish line. \nI think we can, but we are certainly not there yet. But progress has \nbeen made.\n  Mr. President, in my reservation to object I would say that I note \nthat the request the majority leader propounded is seeking to move to a \nHouse revenue bill, which of course would provide a vehicle for the \nForeign Relations Committee-reported Iran legislation. I support the \nCommittee-reported Iran legislation. I commend Senators Cardin and \nCorker for their historic work on this package. I do hope the Senate \ncan pass it with no changes.\n  But I note that the majority leader is once again choosing not to \nmove to the nomination of Loretta Lynch as Attorney General. It has \nbeen more than 5 months--it will be 6 months in a week or 10 days--\nsince President Obama nominated her. Her nomination has been on the \nSenate calendar for 49 days, longer than the last 7 Attorney General \nnominations combined.\n  So I ask whether the majority leader would modify his consent request \nto add this: That there be 2 hours for debate, divided in the usual \nform, and that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate \nproceed to vote on the nomination; further, that if the nomination is \nconfirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions \nbe in order to the nomination; and that the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action. Part of the consent request is that on \nMonday, April 20, at 3:30 p.m., the Senate proceed to executive session \nto consider Calendar No. 21.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the majority leader so modify his \nrequest?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as I have indicated, gosh, at least for \n6 weeks now, we are going to deal with the Lynch nomination right after \nwe finish trafficking.\n  I am optimistic that we will be able to do trafficking in 1 day. \nThere is not a huge demand for amendments. As I have assured my friend \nthe Democratic leader and our colleagues, then we will move forward on \nthe nominee for Attorney General.\n  Therefore, I object to the modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection to the modification is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, continuing my reservation, as the majority \nleader is well aware, procedurally, the Senate provides many \nopportunities for delay. We are not going to treat the current majority \nthe way the Republican minority treated us when we were in the \nmajority. I am not going to object to the majority leader's consent \ntoday. However, I want everyone to know--I\n\n[[Page S2240]]\n\nam going to serve notice right now--that Ms. Lynch's nomination will \nnot remain in purgatory forever.\n  So I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/16/senate-section/article/S2240-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a copy of my remarks to the American Council on \nEducation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Higher Education Reauthorization\n\n       I am here today to read you a letter and ask for your help. \n     I'm going to be very specific. First, I want to thank \n     Chancellors Kirwan and Zeppos for the work they've done with \n     others at the request of four United States senators: two \n     Democrats and two Republicans, Senator Mikulski and Senator \n     Bennett on the Democratic side and Senator Burr and myself on \n     the Republican side.\n       We asked them to not give us a sermon but to give us \n     specific recommendations for exactly what to do about the \n     problem of overregulation of higher education, and they've \n     done that. The English professors on your campuses would be \n     very pleased with it because it's actually recommended in \n     plain English with mostly declarative sentences. It's an \n     unusual report. It's very well done. And the way things work \n     in Washington, it reminds me a lot of the report called \n     ``Rise Above Gathering Storm'' that the National Academy of \n     Sciences sponsored about ten years ago, and Norm Augustine \n     headed it. We basically said, ``Just give us ten specific \n     things to do, and if you do, we'll probably do most of \n     them.'' They gave us 20 recommendations, and we've done most \n     of them.\n       So this is really a blueprint or an agenda for the United \n     States Congress and the United States Secretary of Education \n     to act on the problem. I want to thank Molly Broad for her \n     work at ACE on this and for organizing it and Terry Hartle \n     and Anne Hickey, who are staff members there. There's \n     Christina West at Vanderbilt University, who worked hard on \n     the report. At the University System of Maryland, there's PJ \n     Hogan, and Andrew LaCasse on our staff in the Senate. They \n     did a terrific job.\n       Now, what I'm supposed to do here is take 10 or 12 minutes \n     and then sit down and see what questions or suggestions you \n     have with the chancellors. So, I thought the best way to do \n     that was to read you a letter and come close to telling you a \n     story. One of my friends was the late Alex Haley, the author \n     of Roots. After I made a speech one time, he came up after \n     and said, ``May I make a suggestion?'' I said, ``Well of \n     course.'' He said, ``If before you make a speech, you say, \n     `Instead of making a speech let me tell you story,' people \n     may actually listen to what you have to say.'' So, let me \n     begin with a short story.\n       I got this over the weekend from someone I don't know. It's \n     from a president from a University in Missouri, handwritten, \n     and says, among other things, ``I've been in higher education \n     administration for over 40 years, the last 20 as a university \n     president, and I've never experienced the amount of \n     regulatory pressure that our institution currently faces.''\n       I hear that in lots of different ways, and this report is \n     an expression of what to do about that. For example, this \n     isn't just a sermon, as I mentioned. There are 59 specific \n     suggestions about what to do. In testimony before our \n     committee, almost everyone who testified said that requiring \n     students to fill out the FAFSA form in their senior year and \n     providing tax information before they file their taxes makes \n     no sense. It would make a lot more sense to do it the year \n     before. Almost everybody said that we should do that.\n       So, in this report are 59 recommendations, and what I want \n     to ask you to do is organize yourselves in your own state and \n     make an appointment with your member of the United States \n     Congress. And get six or seven members of the university and \n     sit down and talk about this report, and say, ``Now we worked \n     two years on this. This is serious business. It costs a lot \n     of money. It discourages a lot of students from coming to our \n     colleges, and we'd like for you to support the legislation \n     Senator Alexander and Senator Mikulski and Senator Burr and \n     Senator Bennett are introducing in order to implement the \n     report.'' You might add Senator Murray of Washington who is \n     the ranking Democrat on the committee as she will be deeply \n     involved in this as well.\n       Sometimes university presidents come to Washington to meet \n     with members of Congress. That's the biggest waste of time I \n     can think of. We're all running around here with 15-minute \n     schedules trying to keep up with things and have many more \n     requests for appointments than we have time to see or pay \n     attention to. But almost every single senator who is on the \n     committee that is going to deal with this is home every \n     weekend, and the senator from Tennessee, with all due \n     respect, doesn't really want to see the president of the \n     University of Maryland. He would like to see the president of \n     the University of Tennessee or of Vanderbilt or of Milligan \n     College or Maryville College or Rhodes College. If five or \n     six or eight of those presidents say, ``Senator Alexander, \n     may we have a 30-minute appointment with you while you're \n     home next month?'', I'll do it in a minute. So will every \n     other senator. And you have the credibility to go to that \n     member of Congress and say, ``Will you please vote for this? \n     Will you cosponsor the legislation? Will you support it? Will \n     you encourage the president to sign it?'' Odds are, if you do \n     that they will. It's about that simple.\n       There are a lot of things we work on up here about which we \n     have big partisan differences. There is no reason to have any \n     big partisan differences over this. There are a few things in \n     it that get haggles up on the left and the right, but most \n     things aren't like that at all. There is just the \n     accumulation of eight reauthorizations of the Higher \n     Education Act beginning in 1965, and you know exactly what \n     happens. A well-meaning group of senators, congressmen, \n     education secretaries, regulators come up with an idea and \n     said, ``Let's do this, or here's a good idea let's make \n     everybody do that.'' And they just keep doing that until \n     pretty soon you get a stack of regulations that's twice as \n     tall as I am. You're looking at the Higher Education Act, and \n     that's how tall it actually is. Nobody's weeded the garden. \n     Well, this is an effort to weed the garden. So, I read a \n     letter. I've asked for your help, and your help is very \n     specific.\n       Will you please make an appointment in your home state, \n     starting with the 22 members of the Senate Health, Education, \n     Labor and Pensions Committee and say to us, ``We hope you'll \n     vote for and support that.''\n       Now, you'll all recognize this. This is what 20 million \n     parents fill out every single year. And lots of colleges have \n     said, ``Well we like this information.'' You have to think \n     about how much you like it. Does it really work? Asking 20 \n     million families to fill out 108 questions like this every \n     year just to get a grant or loan to go to college? A \n     testimony before our committee said we could get it down to \n     two questions: what's your family income, and what's the size \n     of your family? Maybe it's two, maybe it's four, maybe it's \n     10, maybe it's 12. President Obama in his budget advocated \n     for removing about thirty of those questions, so that takes \n     it down from 108 to about 78.\n       What's the importance of that? The importance of it is \n     pretty obvious. The importance of it is that it saves money, \n     it saves time, and the president of the community college in \n     Memphis, Southwest Tennessee Community College, told me he \n     thinks he loses 1,500 students every semester because of the \n     complexity of the form that impair students that would like \n     to go to college.\n       The second story you'd like to know is Chancellor Zeppos's \n     story about how much it costs at Vanderbilt every year to \n     comply with federal regulations on higher education: $150 \n     million for one institution, $11,000 or $12,000 for everyone \n     to add onto their tuition. That's just ridiculous. That's \n     absolutely absurd.\n       Now, another fact is that the National Academy of Sciences \n     says, and they've done two reports to verify this, that \n     investigators of federally-sponsored research at colleges and \n     universities spend 42 percent of their time on administrative \n     matters. Now we spend $30 billion, we taxpayers at colleges \n     and universities on research. How much of that money is spent \n     on administrative? Well, Chancellor Zeppos said that at \n     Vanderbilt--and I think I've got my figures right--that about \n     $136 million of the $146 was allocated for research. So, the \n     way I figured it, about 25 percent of all the research money \n     he gets at Vanderbilt, which is probably $500 million, goes \n     to administrative tasks. Forty-two percent of the time we're \n     researching. If we can move from 42 to 35 to 33 to 30, we \n     could save $1 billion or $2 billion and take the dollars to \n     fund hundreds, maybe thousands, of multi-year research \n     grants, which we hear so much about declining.\n       And then the fact that we've been trying to reduce these \n     for a long time. One of my first acts as a senator was to \n     pass legislation requiring the U.S. Department of Education \n     to make a calendar of all of the things that you are supposed \n     to comply with if you are in one of the 6000-plus colleges \n     and universities in America. They have had seven years, and \n     they haven't been able to do it. Well, if they can't do that, \n     how can a small Catholic college in Wisconsin hire somebody \n     to figure it out? And according to this report, there is a \n     new guidance or regulation coming out on average every \n     workday in the U.S. Department of Education. So, you just \n     have that combination of 108-question FAFSA; $150 million at \n     one university to comply; the National Academy saying 42 \n     percent of time is spent by investigators is spent on \n     administration; and the department itself unable to make a \n     list of all of the rules that it expects you to comply with--\n     that's a pretty good case to make for the people you talk to.\n       And then I would suggest that a delegation--and again I \n     have discussed this with the chancellors--go see Arne Duncan \n     at the U.S. Department of Education. I meant this isn't all \n     his fault; it's all of our faults among\n\n[[Page S2241]]\n\n     all of us who have been Secretary of Education, all of us who \n     have been in the Congress since 1965. We haven't done our \n     job, and of the 59 recommendations, probably a dozen are \n     recommendations that the U.S. Secretary of Education could do \n     himself. They could be done by an administrator. So, go to \n     Secretary Duncan and say, ``Look, we'd like to make a hero \n     out of you. We're here to say, we've identified the 12 areas \n     that you can change that would make a big difference in \n     increasing innovation and reducing cost of colleges all \n     across America.'' And I've talked with him about that, and I \n     think he'd be willing to hear about that.\n       We'll be reauthorizing the Higher Education Act later this \n     year after we get through fixing ``No Child Left Behind,'' \n     which is the first order of business. And the first thing we \n     want to do is make it easier for students to go to college. \n     That's the ``FAST Act,'' aimed at simplifying the student aid \n     form. That includes saying that you can apply your junior \n     year of high school, so you can know what your award will be \n     before you are admitted to college. And, you will know what \n     your tax information is before you have to turn in your form.\n       We want to simplify the number of grants and loans. We want \n     to make it possible for there to be year-round Pell for your \n     students to be able to follow their own rate and use their \n     Pell grants and student aid progressively at their own rate \n     in college. We'd like to discourage over-borrowing by \n     changing some rules that exist, permit you to do more \n     counseling of students, change the rule that allows a part-\n     time student to borrow a full-time amount of money. We'd like \n     to simplify the repayment plans. Now, all those things don't \n     have much to do with being a Republican or a Democrat. They \n     have a lot to do with an important system.\n       We'd like to take as many of these fifty-nine \n     recommendations and put them in a bill and pass them as we \n     can. A lot of that will depend upon your business at home to \n     the men and women who run the universities in your state. We \n     want to take a look at the accreditation and make sure it's \n     focused on the right thing. As a former university president, \n     I didn't like a lot about accreditation. The only thing I \n     would like less would be having the U.S. Department of \n     Education take the place of the accreditor. So, let's work \n     together and fix the accreditation system and have focus on \n     academic quality instead of all that random other stuff that \n     accreditors often get themselves involved in.\n       We want to make it harder to over-borrow. I mentioned a \n     couple of ideas about this. There are a few more in this \n     report. Finally, we want to do our best to make sure that the \n     consumer information that you're asked for really is needed \n     and is presented in a useful way to students. Typically, it's \n     just a big pile of stuff that has the disadvantage of by the \n     time you go all the way through you haven't learned anything. \n     It's like a mortgage application or a car loan. You just sign \n     at the bottom and have no clue about what you just signed. We \n     need simpler, plain English, clear sentences--pieces of \n     information that are valuable to students and that are \n     valuable to parents, and that we can weed our way through the \n     system more confidently.\n       So, that's what we're trying to do, and we need your help. \n     One thing that I would say to you is that this is a train \n     that is likely to move down track in out of the station by \n     the end of year. Why do I say that? Well, because it has \n     bipartisan support in a town that's not noted for that. This \n     report has been active interest of four senators who will a \n     lot more. The FAST Act, as we call it, which will simplify \n     student aid has the support of six: Senator Booker and \n     Senator King and Senator Burr and Senator Isakson and me, \n     equally divided by party. Senator Murray and I, she's from \n     Washington state, will work together to reauthorize it. I've \n     talked to the president about it. He did a very good job of \n     working with us on some forms on student loans two years ago. \n     There's no reason he can't work with us in that way and this \n     year finish the job.\n       So, I hope you'll keep in mind the letter that I read. I \n     suspect that you have made the same feelings, and I am here \n     to thank you for the tremendous work that ACE and the \n     chancellors and their team and staff did on the report. It's \n     been one of the most consequential reports made to the \n     Congress during this year. Will you please make an \n     appointment in the next thirty days in your home state, first \n     with the members of the Senate education committee? Bring \n     along a few colleagues and say, ``We spent a lot of time on \n     this. This is wasting a lot of money. This is discouraging a \n     lot of students. This is taking a lot of time. Will you \n     please support this bipartisan effort to bring some common \n     sense to the jungle of red tape that is the current federal \n     regulation of higher education?''

Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize that today, \nApril 16, 2015, is National Healthcare Decisions Day.\n  National Healthcare Decisions Day exists to inspire, educate and \nempower the public and providers about the importance of advance care \nplanning. Started by a Richmond attorney as a local, grassroots \ninitiative in Virginia, NHDD became an annual event in 2008 and today \nis recognized across all 50 States. Faith-based groups, doctors and \nnurses, hospitals, patients, and caregivers alike are engaged in these \nefforts.\n  It is critical that Virginians and all Americans--both patients and \nproviders--engage in advance care planning, and that they have access \nto clear, consistent, and concise information on how to make these \ncritical health care decisions. Today, on National Healthcare Decisions \nDay, it is important to discuss preferences and goals with family and \nfriends--and this starts with filling out an advance directive. But \nadvanced care planning is about much more than that, and in the last \nseveral years, there has been a growing awareness of the need to \ntransform advanced care, both among providers and families.\n  First, broader transformations in health care, especially the \nmovement towards paying for quality, not volume, of services offer \nopportunities to speed the adoption of effective advanced care \nprograms. Our health care system does a great job paying for \nprocedures: surgery, chemotherapy, hip replacements. It does a not so \ngood job paying for health care providers to spend face-to-face time \nwith patients, helping them to choose among many options with uncertain \noutcomes. Improvements to care planning would give individuals and \ntheir families the ability to make smarter decisions. It would provide \nadditional information and support so they can make informed choices \nbased upon those values and goals.\n  Meanwhile, across the country, people are innovating and creating new \nmodels of care to provide patients with the tools and support to make \ntheir own advanced care decisions. For example, in my own State of \nVirginia, a Richmond Academy of Medicine initiative called Honoring \nChoices Virginia promises to fill a critical hole. This innovative \npartnership involves the academy and three independent health care \nsystems working to adopt nationally-recognized best practices, and \nadapting them to the needs of patients, families, doctors, and \nhospitals of the local community in Central Virginia. This commitment \nto patients and families in our region sets an example for the rest of \nthe Commonwealth and the country.\n  It is similarly essential that we consider how Federal policies \nimpact patients and their families during times of serious illness. For \nexample, the vast majority of these patients receive care funded by \nMedicaid and Medicare, and many of them are elderly or disabled. \nMedicare, however, does not adequately reimburse physicians or other \nimportant members of the care planning team, such as nurses or social \nworkers, for systems to support patients and their families. Likewise, \nfaced with an uneven patchwork of advance directive laws across States, \nproviders too often base their actions on the technicalities of forms \nor on fear of being sued. Such hurdles make it difficult for health \ncare providers to focus on what the patient really wants.\n  In the 111th and 112th Congress, I introduced the Senior Navigation \nand Planning Act, to help people grapple with the challenges of caring \nfor those with advanced illness. And in the 113th Congress, Senator \nIsakson and I introduced the Care Planning Act. The purpose of the Care \nPlanning Act is to align the care people want with the level of care \nthey get. It does not limit choices--it works to make sure people are \nmade fully aware of the broad range of choices they have. I hope to \nreintroduce the Care Planning Act in the coming weeks.\n  I believe this effort is critical, not just from my time serving as a \nGovernor and as a Senator, but also through the eyes of a loved one who \nstruggled with these issues. My mother suffered from Alzheimer's \ndisease for 10 years, and for 9 of those years, she couldn't speak. My \nfather, sister and I found grappling with the challenges of caring for \nher difficult. The difficulty was greater because, when she was first \ndiagnosed, my family didn't take the opportunity to talk in an honest \nand fully informed way with her and her health care providers about the \nfull array of health care options available, or about what her \npriorities would be during the final years of her life.\n  It is not easy, and this is a subject that most people do their best \nto avoid.\n\n[[Page S2242]]\n\nBut it is critical. National Healthcare Decisions Day reminds us of the \nimportance of discussing ways to improve advanced care planning at all \nlevels--Federal, State, local--and above all, amongst Americans and \ntheir loved ones.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/16/senate-section/article/S2242-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO JIM SCOTT\n\n Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the retirement \nof Jim Scott after nearly 50 years as Cincinnati's familiar voice of \nmorning radio.\n  Jim Scott began his Cincinnati radio career in 1968 as morning show \nhost for the iconic pop radio station 1360 WSAI-AM in Price Hill. He \njoined 700 WLW in 1984 and for 45 years, Jim has been the familiar \nvoice of morning radio.\n  During his morning time slot from 5am to 9am, Jim interviewed \ncountless dignitaries and celebrity newsmakers from Presidents and \ncivic leaders to top movie stars and sports figures. He routinely \ntalked with news correspondents from around the globe, including those \nreporting at the White House and from posts in London to Baghdad.\n  Jim is a true public servant and an inspiration to us all. He has \nbeen a long-time volunteer leader of the Greater Cincinnati United Way \nand has served on many boards, including the Wellness Community, \nCincinnati Playhouse in the Park, the March of Dimes, and Big Brothers \nand Big Sisters.\n  A stalwart volunteer, Jim is Cincinnati's voice of volunteerism; \nwhether he's hosting Marty & Joe night at the Great American Ballpark, \nserving as emcee for your favorite animal shelter or welcoming \nPresidents and foreign dignitaries to the Queen City.\n  Jim has been recognized with many awards, including the Silver Medal \nof the Cincinnati Ad Club, and the Neil H. McElroy Award from the \nUnited Way. In 1996 and 2000, the U.S. Olympic Committee named Jim ``A \nCommunity Hero'' and he was thrilled to be a torchbearer in the Olympic \nTorch Relay.\n  Jim Scott has dominated morning show ratings in every decade since \nthe 1970s and was the winner of the 2002 Marconi Award for Large Market \nRadio Personality of the Year. In 2013, the Cincinnati Enquirer named \nJim the No. 1 radio personality of the past 40 years.\n  Jim Scott will remain on air until his ``favorite day of the year,'' \nCincinnati Reds Opening Day on April 6, 2015, when he'll walk in the \nFindlay Market Opening Day Parade to say thank you to his fans who have \nsupported him throughout his career.\n  Thank you, Jim Scott.

Mr. President, due to their unique perspective, \nAmerican entrepreneurs are often at the forefront of innovative \nsolutions to local problems. This is especially true with environmental \ninitiatives, and down in Louisiana where the ecosystems are diverse and \ndelicate, the locals are best equipped to protect them. That is why ORA \nEstuaries of New Orleans, LA is the Small Business of the Week.\n  Civil engineer and New Orleans native Tyler Ortego was a student at \nLouisiana State University when he and a friend discovered a way to \nfight coastal erosion using oysters. In 2005, Ortego patented the \nOysterBreak system, which essentially allows oysters to fuse together \non a man-made rock-like material in order to create a living coastal \nreef. Now holding two patents, Ortego and ORA Estuaries are focused on \nrebuilding and revitalizing coastal regions. ORA Estuaries recently \nclaimed the top prize of the New Orleans Entrepreneurial Week's ``Big \nIdea Pitch,'' and with the prize money hopes to move into food \nproduction and new versions of the OysterBreak system.\n  Our coast and wetlands provide some of Louisiana's most important \nresources and beautiful habitats, and because our geography makes us \nvulnerable to natural disasters, it is absolutely vital that we protect \nthem. Innovative technologies like ORA's OysterBreak system play a \nsignificant role in restoring our coasts and wetlands, which protect \nLouisianians and gulf coast residents from storms and flooding. \nCurrently, ORA's natural reefs systems are deployed in four different \nareas along the Louisiana coast, including an oyster habitat \nrestoration project run by the Nature Conservatory of Louisiana. ORA is \nlooking toward expanding to all five of the Gulf States, as well as the \nChesapeake Bay area and even North Carolina.

A resolution adopted by the House of Representatives \n     of the State of Michigan memorializing the United States \n     Congress to reinstate funding for the Yucca Mountain Nuclear \n     Waste Repository; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 21\n\n       Whereas, Over the past four decades, nuclear power has been \n     a significant source for the nation's electricity production. \n     There are 104 operating nuclear power reactors in the United \n     States, providing about one-fifth of the nation's electricity \n     generation. According to the U.S. Energy Information \n     Administration, Michigan's three nuclear power plants \n     provided 28 percent of the electricity generated in Michigan \n     in 2013; and\n       Whereas, Nuclear power can provide large amounts of \n     reliable, emission-free electricity at stable prices. Many \n     electricity markets across the nation are, or will soon be, \n     in need of new baseload generating capacity. However, the \n     construction of new nuclear power plants is being hampered by \n     the unresolved issue of spent nuclear fuel; and\n       Whereas, Since the earliest days of nuclear power, the \n     great dilemma is how to deal with used nuclear fuel. \n     Currently, more than 70,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel \n     are stored in pools or casks at temporary, and potentially \n     vulnerable, sites around the country, including in Michigan. \n     More nuclear waste is generated every day. This high-level \n     radioactive waste demands exceptional care in all facets of \n     its storage and disposal, including transportation; and\n       Whereas, The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 requires the \n     federal government, through the Department of Energy (DOE), \n     to build a repository for the permanent storage of high-level \n     radioactive waste from nuclear power plants. This act \n     includes a specific timetable to identify a suitable location \n     and to establish the waste repository; and\n       Whereas, The establishment of a federal nuclear waste \n     repository is more than fifteen years overdue. Under the Act, \n     the DOE was supposed to begin accepting and storing the \n     nation's nuclear waste by January 31, 1998. In 2002, Congress \n     and President Bush approved Yucca Mountain in Nevada as the \n     site of the repository, and in 2008, the Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission (NRC) accepted an application by the DOE to \n     construct and operate the repository. However, in 2010, at \n     the urging of President Obama, the DOE chose to unilaterally \n     and irrevocably terminate the Yucca Mountain repository \n     process; and\n       Whereas, The NRC released a report in October 2014 that \n     found Yucca Mountain would be a safe and acceptable \n     repository for the permanent storage of used nuclear fuel. \n     The repository would meet all NRC standards for protecting \n     people and the environment from radioactivity. Clearly, it is \n     time to re-open the Yucca Mountain process, as it will \n     provide the best long-term solution to our nation's used \n     nuclear fuel problem; and\n       Whereas, The Yucca Mountain process cannot move forward \n     without the U.S. Congress appropriating additional funds. \n     Electric ratepayers in Michigan and across the country have \n     paid billions into the federal Nuclear Waste Fund \n     specifically to support development of a long-term \n     repository. Since 1983, in accordance with the Nuclear Waste \n     Policy Act, customers of Michigan electric utilities have \n     paid $812 million into the federal fund. While fee collection \n     has been suspended as of May 16, 2014, the fund still \n     contains a total balance of over $31 billion: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to reinstate \n     funding for the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-9. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Maine memorializing the President of the United \n     States and Congress of the United States to support the \n     reform of the Social Security offsets of the Government \n     Pension Offset and the Windfall Elimination Provision; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                            Senate Paper 382\n\n       Whereas, under current federal law, individuals who receive \n     a Social Security benefit and a public retirement benefit \n     derived from employment not covered under Social Security are \n     subject to a reduction in the Social Security benefits; and\n       Whereas, these laws. contained in the federal Social \n     Security Act, 42 United States Code, Chapter 7, Subchapter \n     II, Federal Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance \n     Benefits, and known as the Government Pension Offset and the \n     Windfall Elimination Provision, greatly affect public \n     employees, particularly women; and\n       Whereas, the Windfall Elimination Provision reduces by a \n     formula the Social Security benefit of a person who is also \n     receiving a pension from a public employer that does not \n     participate in Social Security; and\n       Whereas, the Government Pension Offset and the Windfall \n     Elimination Provision are particularly burdensome on the \n     finances of low-income and moderate-income public service \n     workers, such as school teachers, clerical workers and school \n     cafeteria employees, whose wages are low to start; and\n       Whereas, the Government Pension Offset and the Windfall \n     Elimination Provision both unfairly reduce benefits for those \n     public employees and their spouses whose careers cross the \n     line between the private and public sectors; and\n       Whereas, since many lower-paying public service jobs are \n     held by women, both the Government Pension Offset and the \n     Windfall Elimination Provision have a disproportionately \n     adverse effect on women; and\n       Whereas, in some cases, additional support in the form of \n     income, housing, heating and prescription drug and other \n     safety net assistance from state and local governments is \n     needed to make up for the reductions imposed at the federal \n     level; and\n       Whereas, other participants in Social Security do not have \n     their benefits reduced in this manner; and\n       Whereas, to participate or not to participate in Social \n     Security in public sector employment is a decision of \n     employers even though both the Government Pension Offset and \n     the Windfall Elimination Provision directly punish employees \n     and their spouses; and\n       Whereas, although the Government Pension Offset was enacted \n     in 1977 and the Windfall Elimination Provision was enacted in \n     1983, many of the benefits in dispute were paid into Social \n     Security prior to that time: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, request that the \n     President of the United States and the United States Congress \n     work together to support reform proposals that include the \n     following protections for low-income and moderate-income \n     government retirees:\n       1. Protections permitting retention of a combined public \n     pension and Social Security benefit with no applied \n     reductions;\n       2. Protections permanently ensuring that level of benefit \n     by indexing it to inflation; and\n       3. Protections ensuring that no current recipient's benefit \n     is reduced by the reform legislation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the Honorable Barack H. Obama, President of the United \n     States; the President of the United States Senate; the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States; \n     and each Member of the Maine Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-10. A resolution adopted by the General Court of the \n     Commonwealth of Massachusetts condemning all forms of anti-\n     Semitism; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                              Resolutions\n\n       Whereas, there is clear evidence of increasing incidents \n     and expressions of anti-Semitism throughout the world; and\n       Whereas, in April 2014, the United States Department of \n     State released the International Religious Freedom report \n     recognizing that anti-Semitism continues to be prevalent \n     internationally; and\n       Whereas, anti-Semitic acts committed and recorded in 2014 \n     include murders, violent attacks and death threats against \n     Jews, arson, graffiti and property desecration and murders at \n     Jewish cemeteries, places of worship, schools and community \n     events; and\n       Whereas, such anti-Semitic acts also extend to soccer \n     stadiums, the Internet, editorial cartoons and the use of \n     Nazi salutes, leading many Jewish individuals to conceal \n     their religious identity; and\n       Whereas, the recent terror attack at a kosher supermarket \n     in Paris, France, and a mounting sense of insecurity among \n     France's Jews reminds us of the urgent need for a commitment \n     to address and confront anti-Semitism; and\n\n[[Page S2244]]\n\n       Whereas, the Governments in France, Germany, Italy and the \n     United Kingdom, the 4 countries where the majority of anti-\n     Semitic incidents have occurred in Western Europe, have \n     strongly condemned anti-Semitism as unacceptable in European \n     society and have all made clear statements that such attacks \n     on their Jewish communities are intolerable; and\n       Whereas, anti-Semitic imagery and comparisons of Jews and \n     Israel to Nazis have been on display at demonstrations \n     against Israel's actions in Gaza, throughout the United \n     States, Europe, the Middle East and Latin America; and\n       Whereas, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has a rich \n     history of tolerance to all faiths and religions; and\n       Whereas, the United States Government has played an \n     essential role in counteracting the resurgence of anti-\n     Semitism worldwide and has consistently supported efforts to \n     address the rise in anti-Semitism through its bilateral \n     relationships and participation in international \n     organizations such as the United Nations, the organization \n     for security and cooperation in Europe, and the organization \n     of American states; and\n       Whereas, the Massachusetts General Court joins with people \n     everywhere in unequivocally condemning all forms of anti-\n     Semitism and rejecting attempts to justify anti-Jewish hatred \n     or violent attacks as an acceptable expression of disapproval \n     or frustration over political events in the Middle East or \n     elsewhere; and\n       Whereas, the Massachusetts General Court applauds the \n     United States and those foreign leaders who have condemned \n     anti-Semitic acts and calls on those who have yet to take \n     firm action against anti-Semitism in their countries to do \n     so; and\n       Whereas, the very recent killings of a Danish film director \n     and a Jewish guard in Copenhagen, along with the vandalism of \n     a Jewish cemetery in Eastern France, have given rise to \n     concerns about a rise of terrorism and anti-Semitism across \n     the continent: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Massachusetts General Court supports \n     expanded anti-bias and Holocaust education programs to \n     increase awareness, counter prejudice and enhance efforts to \n     teach the universal lessons of the Holocaust; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be transmitted \n     forthwith by the Clerk of the Massachusetts Senate to the \n     President of the United States, the United States Secretary \n     of State, the Governor of the Commonwealth and to each member \n     of Congress elected from this State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/16/senate-section/article/S2244-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXECUTIVE REPORTS OF COMMITTEE\n\n  The following executive reports of nominations were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. ALEXANDER for the Committee on Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions.\n       *Ericka M.

A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nprohibit employment of children in tobacco-related agriculture by \ndeeming such employment as oppressive child labor; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the important \nissue of child labor in tobacco fields. I want to tell you about \nCalvin, a 17-year-old boy just over five feet tall, who migrated to the \nUnited States by himself at age 13, leaving his family behind in \nMexico. Calvin never enrolled in school.\n  Instead, he joined a migrant crew that travels between several states \nto work in different crops. He migrates to Kentucky in August to work \nin the tobacco fields. Calvin has worked in tobacco farms since he was \n16, and he experiences headaches and nausea from nicotine poisoning.\n  Calvin said he got sick while working in a curing barn. ``I got a \nheadache and nausea. I was vomiting,'' he said. ``It happened when I \nwas hanging the tobacco in the barn.''\n  I wish that Calvin's experience was unusual. But in May of last year, \nthe Human Rights Watch published a report based on interviews with over \n140 children who worked on U.S. tobacco farms in 2012 or 2013. The \nmajority of those children were working for hire, and not on a family \nfarm. Some of the findings are staggering and show that Calvin is not \nalong.\n  Human Rights Watch found that child tobacco workers began working on \ntobacco farms at age 11 or 12. During peak harvest periods, children \ncan work as many as 50-60 hours a week. The majority of these children \nexperience symptoms like nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, dizziness, \nlightheadedness, headaches, and sleeplessness while working on tobacco \nfarms. These symptoms are consistent with acute nicotine poisoning, \nwhich happens when you absorb nicotine through their skin.\n  Furthermore, in these conditions, children work in high heat and \nhumidity and in some instances, they use dangerous tools that include \nsharp spikes to spear tobacco plants and climb to dangerous heights to \nhang tobacco in curing barns. These children are exposed to pesticides \nthat are known toxins. Long-term effects of this exposure include \ncancer, neurological deficits, and reproductive health problems.\n  In his first summer in the field, 12-year-old Miguel was topping \ntobacco plants on a farm in North Carolina wearing shorts and a short-\nsleeved shirt, his torso draped with a black plastic garbage bag to \ncover himself from the summer's heavy rainstorms. Miguel wore only \nsocks--because he did\n\n[[Page S2247]]\n\nnot have shoes that could withstand the thick mud from the heavy rain.\n  Miguel lives with his mother, 13-year-old brother, and 5-year-old \nsister in a rural town in North Carolina. He attends a public school \nfull-time, and works in the fields during his summer break to help \ncover the costs of food, clothes, and school supplies for the family.\n  Miguel was hired by a farm labor contractor to work on different \nfarms planting sweet potatoes one day, topping tobacco the next. When \nasked which crop was harder work, Miguel said, ``tobacco, because you \nhave to walk, and you have to use your hands all the time. It's really \ntiring.''\n  It is tiring. By the time Miguel got home, he would have trouble \nwalking because his legs and feet were so sore from working all day. \nNot only was 12-year Miguel physically overworked, he, like Calvin, \nalso had to deal with frequent headaches, caused by nicotine poisoning, \nfrom working in the tobacco fields. He said, ``It was horrible. It felt \nlike there was something in my head trying to eat it.''\n  I am introducing legislation today, with Senator Reed of Rhode \nIsland, Senator Feinstein and Senator Brown to take children like \nCalvin and Miguel out of the tobacco fields. Our bill would make it \nillegal to allow children under the age of 18 to handle tobacco plants \nor dried tobacco leaves.\n  Currently, U.S. law prohibits children under the age of 18 from \nbuying cigarettes . . . but allows children as young as 12 to work in \ntobacco fields. In most other jobs in the U.S., children are not \nallowed to work before the age of 15.\n  Today, there are no specific restrictions protecting children from \nnicotine poisoning or other risks associated with tobacco farming in \nthis country. The United States is the 4th leading tobacco producer in \nthe world, behind China, Brazil, and India. Even Brazil and India \nprohibit children under 18 from working in tobacco production.\n  It's time for the United States to adopt similar restrictions. Our \nchildren shouldn't be working long hours with a plant that makes them \nsick. I encourage my colleagues to work with me to pass S. 974, the \nChildren Don't Belong on Tobacco Farms Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 974\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act of 1991 to designate high priority corridors on the \nNational Highway System in the State of North Carolina, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I am introducing the Military Corridor \nTransportation Improvement Act of 2015, which would amend the \nIntermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, ISTEA, of 1991 to \nbegin the process toward eventually making the US-70 Corridor in North \nCarolina part of the Interstate system, and to help fully upgrade the \ncorridor to interstate standards. My colleague, Senator Richard Burr \nhas agreed to cosponsor the bill. In addition, Congressman G.K. \nButterfield will be introducing a companion bill in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The Military Corridor Transportation Improvement Act of 2015 would \ndesignate the following as high priority: U.S. Route 117/Interstate \nRoute 795 from U.S. Route 70 in Goldsboro, NC, to Interstate Route 40 \nwest of Faison, North Carolina; U.S. Route 70 from its intersection \nwith Interstate Route 40 in Garner, NC, to the Port at Morehead City, \nNC.\n  If the U.S. 70 corridor becomes part of the Interstate system, it \nwould improve access to military bases in eastern North Carolina and \nthe Port at Morehead City, as well as ease traffic congestion between \nRaleigh and eastern North Carolina.\n  This bill helps advance the North Carolina Department of \nTransportation's Strategic Transportation Corridors Vision, which aims \nto provide North Carolina with a network of high priority corridors to \npromote economic development and enhance interstate commerce. Federal \nHigh Priority Corridors are eligible for federal funds to assist states \nin the coordination, planning, design and construction of nationally \nsignificant transportation corridors for the purposes of economic \ngrowth and international and interregional growth.\n  In midst of a sluggish national economy, North Carolina has been a \nbright spot for growth and innovation, and one of the keys to \nsustaining that economic success is through continued investment in \ntransportation, infrastructure, and our military. The Military Corridor \nTransportation Improvement Act is a true bipartisan effort to support \nNorth Carolina's military installations and complement the State's 25 \nyear transportation improvement plan, which in turn will generate \neconomic development, provide a boost for local communities and create \ngood-paying jobs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Merkley, and Mr. Bennet):\n  S. 987. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \ndeductions and credits relating to expenditures in connection with \nmarijuana sales conducted in compliance with State law; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am here today standing up for the people \nof Oregon and recognizing their decision to legalize and regulate \nmarijuana for recreational use in the State.\n  Together with Senators Merkley and Bennet, I am introducing the Small \nBusiness Tax Equity Act, which will provide more equitable Federal tax \ntreatment for small marijuana businesses who comply with State law. \nThis comes after more than 56 percent of Oregonians voted for marijuana \nlegalization. Congressman Blumenauer is introducing a companion bill in \nthe House.\n  Unlike its treatment of all other legal businesses, the tax code \ncurrently denies these marijuana businesses, legitimate businesses, the \nability to deduct ordinary expenses. Expenses, such as employee pay and \nrent, that are essential to operating any successful small business.\n  This is one piece of the equation as Federal tax inequalities for \nmarijuana businesses extend beyond deductions. For example, other \nbusinesses are also eligible for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit for \nhiring veterans. Therefore the inability to make deductions, combined \nwith other lost credits, often leads to these businesses paying an \neffective tax rate ranging from 65-75 percent; compared with other \nbusinesses who pay between 15-30 percent.\n  This issue is not unique to Oregon. Oregon is one of four States, \nalong with the District of Columbia, where voters have passed measures \nthat permit the legal adult use and retail sale of marijuana. Oregon is \none of 23 States, along with the District of Columbia, have passed laws \nallowing for the legal use of medical marijuana.\n  Unfortunately, Federal law has not caught up with changing State \nlaws, creating contradictions, and leaving these legal businesses in a \ntough position.\n  Today, I am introducing a bill to fix this problem. Marijuana \nbusinesses operating legally under state law should be able to deduct \nordinary business expenses just like any other businesses. Voters have \nlegalized their product, now let's help create a more level playing \nfield that recognizes their business operations.\n  It is the right thing to do. It is only fair that Federal tax law \nrespect the decision Oregonians, and citizens from other States and the \nDistrict of Columbia, made at the polls.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 987\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Tax Equity \n     Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ALLOWANCE OF DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS RELATING TO \n                   EXPENDITURES IN CONNECTION WITH MARIJUANA SALES \n                   CONDUCTED IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 is amended by inserting before the period at the end \n     the following: ``, unless such trade or business consists of \n     marijuana sales conducted in compliance with State law''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply with respect to taxable years ending after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 988. A bill to promote minimum State requirements for the \nprevention and treatment of concussions caused by participation in \nschool sports, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in Illinois and all over the country \nthousands of high school students are participating in spring sports, \nincluding the national pastime: baseball and softball.\n  As with any sports team, these students are training their growing \nbodies to compete in a worthy endeavor, but with that comes some risk. \nThey put on helmets, they put on pads, but unfortunately some of them \nwill still get hurt.\n  Injuries are a part of all sports, but as we learn more about the \nlong term effects of concussions and how frequently they are ignored, \nit is clear we have to step up our game to confront this health risk.\n  The National Federation of State High School Associations estimates \nabout 140,000 students who play high school sports have concussions \nevery year. Sports are second only to motor\n\n[[Page S2250]]\n\nvehicle crashes as the leading cause of traumatic brain injury among \npeople aged 15 to 24 years.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control, the number of children \nage 19 and younger being treated in ERs for traumatic brain injuries \nwent from 153,373 in 2001 to 248,418 in 2009--a 60 percent increase.\n  Some students stay in the game not recognizing the risks of playing \nhurt--especially when they have had a concussion. Many athletes do not \nknow the signs and symptoms of concussion, which may cause many \nconcussions to go undetected.\n  A 2010 Government Accountability Office study found many sports-\nrelated concussions go unreported. Athletes who continue to play while \nconcussed are at risk for catastrophic injury if they sustain another \nconcussion before recovering from the first one. This second injury can \ncause symptoms that can last for months and can even be fatal. Youth \nathletes are at the greatest risk from sports-related concussions \nbecause their brains are still developing and are more susceptible to \ninjury.\n  According to the American Academy of Neurology, athletes of high \nschool age and younger with a concussion should be managed more \nconservatively when it comes to returning to play because they take \nlonger to recover than college athletes.\n  Since 2009, states have started implementing legislation guiding \nreturn to play procedures for student athletes who have sustained a \nconcussion.\n  With a push from the National Football League, NFL, all 50 States and \nthe District of Columbia have successfully passed some form of \nlegislation with varying concussion safety measures.\n  Illinois has been a leader on this issue and passed legislation in \n2011, recognizing the dangers associated with concussion. In Illinois, \na student athlete who is suspected of sustaining a concussion or head \ninjury in a practice or game is immediately removed from the game until \nhe or she is cleared by a health care professional.\n  This is a great step forward for Illinois, and I commend the Illinois \nHigh School Association and its support of this legislation for its \nwork protecting student athletes.\n  I would like to introduce the Protecting Student Athletes from \nConcussions Act, which would support the progress made by states like \nIllinois. The bill would, for the first time, set minimum State \nrequirements for the prevention and treatment of concussions.\n  The legislation requires schools to post information about \nconcussions on school grounds and on school websites and adopt a ``when \nin doubt, sit it out'' policy.\n  This policy requires that a student suspected of sustaining a \nconcussion be removed from participation in the activity and prohibited \nfrom returning to play that day. They can return to play in future \nevents after being evaluated and cleared by a qualified health care \nprofessional.\n  The ``when in doubt, sit it out'' policy is recommended by the \nAmerican College of Sports Medicine and the American Academy of \nNeurology, which recommends that an athlete suspected of a concussion \nshould not return to play the day of their injury--under any \ncircumstance.\n  According to the Center for Injury Research and Policy in Columbus, \nOhio, more than 40 percent of young athletes return to play before they \nare fully recovered.\n  Concussions are not always easily diagnosed, and symptoms that might \nindicate concussion don't always manifest themselves immediately. \nAthletes don't want to let down the team or the coach and are often \neager to return to the game.\n  So helping athletes, school officials, coaches and parents recognize \nthe signs and symptoms of concussion can make all the difference in \nputting a player's safety above winning.\n  This legislation will ensure that school districts have concussion \nmanagement plans that educate students, parents, and school personnel \nabout how to recognize and respond to concussions.\n  It asks schools to adopt the ``when in doubt, sit it out'' policy to \nbe sure athletes are not put back in the game before they have \nrecovered from an initial concussion.\n  I am pleased that a variety of organizations are supporting this \nbill, including the NFL, NCAA, NHL, NBA, American College of Sports \nMedicine, American Academy of Neurology, among others.\n  I look forward to working with the schools, athletic programs and \nothers to build on the progress already made in protecting student \nathletes from concussions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 988\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Student Athletes \n     from Concussions Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. MINIMUM STATE REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Minimum Requirements.--Each State that receives funds \n     under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 \n     U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) and does not meet the requirements \n     described in this section, as of the date of enactment of \n     this Act, shall, not later than the last day of the fifth \n     full fiscal year after the date of enactment of this Act \n     (referred to in this Act as the ``compliance deadline''), \n     enact legislation or issue regulations establishing the \n     following minimum requirements:\n       (1) Local educational agency concussion safety and \n     management plan.--Each local educational agency in the State, \n     in consultation with members of the community in which such \n     agency is located, shall develop and implement a standard \n     plan for concussion safety and management that--\n       (A) educates students, parents, and school personnel about \n     concussions, through activities such as--\n       (i) training school personnel, including coaches, teachers, \n     athletic trainers, related services personnel, and school \n     nurses, on concussion safety and management, including \n     training on the prevention, recognition, and academic \n     consequences of concussions and response to concussions; and\n       (ii) using, maintaining, and disseminating to students and \n     parents--\n\n       (I) release forms and other appropriate forms for reporting \n     and record keeping;\n       (II) treatment plans; and\n       (III) prevention and post-injury observation and monitoring \n     fact sheets about concussion;\n\n       (B) encourages supports, where feasible, for a student \n     recovering from a concussion (regardless of whether or not \n     the concussion occurred during school-sponsored activities, \n     during school hours, on school property, or during an \n     athletic activity), such as--\n       (i) guiding the student in resuming participation in \n     athletic activity and academic activities with the help of a \n     multi-disciplinary concussion management team, which may \n     include--\n\n       (I) a health care professional, the parents of such \n     student, a school nurse, relevant related services personnel, \n     and other relevant school personnel; and\n       (II) an individual who is assigned by a public school to \n     oversee and manage the recovery of such student; and\n\n       (ii) providing appropriate academic accommodations aimed at \n     progressively reintroducing cognitive demands on the student; \n     and\n       (C) encourages the use of best practices designed to \n     ensure, with respect to concussions, the uniformity of safety \n     standards, treatment, and management, such as--\n       (i) disseminating information on concussion safety and \n     management to the public; and\n       (ii) applying uniform best practice standards for \n     concussion safety and management to all students enrolled in \n     public schools.\n       (2) Posting of information on concussions.--Each public \n     elementary school and each public secondary school shall post \n     on school grounds, in a manner that is visible to students \n     and school personnel, and make publicly available on the \n     school website, information on concussions that--\n       (A) is based on peer-reviewed scientific evidence (such as \n     information made available by the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention);\n       (B) shall include information on--\n       (i) the risks posed by sustaining a concussion;\n       (ii) the actions a student should take in response to \n     sustaining a concussion, including the notification of school \n     personnel; and\n       (iii) the signs and symptoms of a concussion; and\n       (C) may include information on--\n       (i) the definition of a concussion;\n       (ii) the means available to the student to reduce the \n     incidence or recurrence of a concussion; and\n       (iii) the effects of a concussion on academic learning and \n     performance.\n       (3) Response to concussion.--If an individual designated \n     from among school personnel for purposes of this Act suspects \n     that a student has sustained a concussion (regardless of \n     whether or not the concussion occurred during school-\n     sponsored activities, during school hours, on school \n     property, or during an athletic activity)--\n\n[[Page S2251]]\n\n       (A) the student shall be--\n       (i) immediately removed from participation in a school-\n     sponsored athletic activity; and\n       (ii) prohibited from returning to participate in a school-\n     sponsored athletic activity--\n\n       (I) on the day such student is removed from such \n     participation; and\n       (II) until such student submits a written release from a \n     health care professional stating that the student is capable \n     of resuming participation in school-sponsored athletic \n     activities; and\n\n       (B) the designated individual shall report to the parent or \n     guardian of such student--\n       (i) any information that the designated school employee is \n     aware of regarding the date, time, and type of the injury \n     suffered by such student (regardless of where, when, or how a \n     concussion may have occurred); and\n       (ii) any actions taken to treat such student.\n       (4) Return to athletics.--If a student has sustained a \n     concussion (regardless of whether or not the concussion \n     occurred during school-sponsored activities, during school \n     hours, on school property, or during an athletic activity), \n     before such student resumes participation in school-sponsored \n     athletic activities, the school shall receive a written \n     release from a health care professional, that--\n       (A) states that the student is capable of resuming \n     participation in such activities; and\n       (B) may require the student to follow a plan designed to \n     aid the student in recovering and resuming participation in \n     such activities in a manner that--\n       (i) is coordinated, as appropriate, with periods of \n     cognitive and physical rest while symptoms of a concussion \n     persist; and\n       (ii) reintroduces cognitive and physical demands on such \n     student on a progressive basis only as such increases in \n     exertion do not cause the reemergence or worsening of \n     symptoms of a concussion.\n       (b) Noncompliance.--\n       (1) First year.--If a State described in subsection (a) \n     fails to comply with subsection (a) by the compliance \n     deadline, the Secretary of Education shall reduce by 5 \n     percent the amount of funds the State receives under the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     6301 et seq.) for the first fiscal year following the \n     compliance deadline.\n       (2) Succeeding years.--If the State fails to so comply by \n     the last day of any fiscal year following the compliance \n     deadline, the Secretary of Education shall reduce by 10 \n     percent the amount of funds the State receives under that Act \n     for the following fiscal year.\n       (3) Notification of noncompliance.--Prior to reducing any \n     funds that a State receives under the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) in \n     accordance with this subsection, the Secretary of Education \n     shall provide a written notification of the intended \n     reduction of funds to the State and to the appropriate \n     committees of Congress.\n\n     SEC. 3. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect civil or \n     criminal liability under Federal or State law.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to increase public safety by facilitating \ncollaboration among the criminal justice, juvenile justice, veterans \ntreatment services, mental health treatment, and substance abuse \nsystems; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Comprehensive \nJustice and Mental Health Act, a bill I am introducing today with a \nnumber of my Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle and with \nRepresentative Doug Collins, who is introducing this legislation in the \nHouse. This bipartisan, bicameral bill will improve outcomes for people \nwith mental illness when they interact with the criminal justice \nsystem. The Judiciary Committee unanimously approved this bill by voice \nvote in the last Congress, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on the committee to move this legislation forward to \nconsideration by the full Senate.\n  The Comprehensive Justice and Mental Health Act is meant to address a \nvery serious problem: The United States has 5 percent of the world's \npopulation but has 25 percent of the world's prison population--in \nlarge part because we have effectively criminalized mental illness. \nPeople with mental health conditions disproportionately are arrested \nand incarcerated, but instead of providing people with adequate access \nto mental health treatment, we let them fall through the cracks and \nlanguish in prison. As my home county--Hennepin County--Sheriff Rich \nStanek put it, ``Local jails are the largest mental health facilities \nin the state of Minnesota,'' and this holds true across our Nation.\n  Let's be clear. Using our criminal justice system as a substitute for \na fully functioning mental health system doesn't make sense. It doesn't \nmake sense for law enforcement officers who often put their lives at \nrisk when they are called upon to intervene in a mental health crisis. \nIt doesn't make sense for courts which are inundated with cases \ninvolving people with mental illness. It doesn't make sense for people \nwho have mental health conditions who often would benefit from \ntreatment and intensive supervision than from traditional \nincarceration. It certainly doesn't make sense for taxpayers who foot \nthe bill for high incarceration costs and overcrowded correction \nfacilities and who must pay again when these untreated mentally ill \nprisoners are released back into society often in much worse shape than \nwhen they were locked up.\n  We can improve access to mental health services for people who come \ninto contact with the criminal justice system, and we can give law \nenforcement officers the tools they need to identify and respond to \nmental health issues in the communities and the situations they \nconfront.\n  In 2004, Congress passed and President Bush signed into law the \nMentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act--or MIOTCRA--\nwhich supports innovative programs that bring together mental health \nand criminal justice agencies to address the unique needs of people \nwith mental health conditions. Former Ohio Republican Senator Mike \nDeWine, who now serves as that State's Attorney General, was the \noriginal sponsor of MIOTCRA.\n  The Comprehensive Justice and Mental Health Act reauthorizes and \nimproves MIOTCRA. Let me talk a little bit about how the programs \nsupported by this legislation protect law enforcement officers and save \nlives. I will give one example.\n  In 2013, I visited the police station in Columbia Heights, MN, a \nsuburb of the Twin Cities. I talked with some of the officers who had \nbeen given crisis\n\n[[Page S2252]]\n\nintervention training for law enforcement officers to recognize when \nthey are confronted or are entering a situation that involves someone \nwho has a mental illness. The sheriff wasn't there that day, but the \ncounty attorney who was there on behalf of the sheriff said that the \nday after the sheriff had his training, he did not kill a guy he would \notherwise have killed because he recognized what was going on. That was \npretty dramatic.\n  So I turned to the other officers there who had also had this crisis \nintervention training and said to a policewoman: Can you give me a more \ngarden-variety example?\n  She said: OK. About 3 months ago, I was on the street and I heard a \nwoman screaming. I thought it was some domestic violence thing or \nsomething. I went to see what was going on, and she went over to a \nrailing that if she had let go, she would have dropped to a playground \nbelow. She might not have killed herself, but she would have gotten \nvery badly hurt. From my training, I realized I was in a situation with \nsomeone who was mentally ill, and I used my training to talk her back \nup. I spoke to the woman. She said she had been sexually abused as a \nchild; that the perpetrator had left town and had left her life, but \nrecently that man had come back.\n  She said: I think I know where I can get help for you. And she got \nher access to some treatment.\n  She said: A couple months later, I was working a street fair when \nthis same woman came up to me, very calm, and said: You saved my life.\n  I said: OK. This is your garden-variety story?\n  She said: Yes, I use this training all the time. I will holster my \ngun maybe once in my career, but I use this all the time.\n  Now, the grants currently available that would be reauthorized \nthrough the Comprehensive Justice and Mental Health Act--which fund \nprograms such as local crisis intervention training--are the only ones \noffered by the Justice Department that address mental health issues in \nthe criminal justice system. So passing this legislation is critically \nimportant, and the bill would improve and expand upon the law.\n  Here are some of the important things the bill does: It continues \nsupport for mental health courts and crisis intervention teams, both of \nwhich save lives and money. It includes new grant accountability \nmeasures and emphasizes the use of evidence-based practices that have \nbeen proven effective through empirical evidence. Our Presiding Officer \nis a physician, therefore a scientist, and therefore relies on \nempirical evidence. It authorizes investments in veterans treatment \ncourts, which serve arrested veterans who have been arrested because \nthey suffer from PTSD, substance addiction, which may be used to \nmedicate their mental health or behavioral and other mental health \nconditions, other sometimes invisible wounds. It supports the \ndevelopment of programs, such as crisis intervention training, to train \nlocal, State, and Federal law enforcement officers how to recognize and \nrespond appropriately to mental health crises. One of the new things \nthe bill does is to support State and local efforts to identify people \nwith mental health conditions at each point in the criminal justice \nsystem in order to appropriately direct them to mental health services.\n  Our bill also increases the focus on corrections-based programs.\n  I went to a prison in St. Cloud, MN, where they do intake in our \nState system. They said this crisis intervention training is incredibly \nimportant to them. They said: Do you watch TV on the weekends where \nthey show prisoners, show the prison system, where you put on all the \ngear because some prisoner has gotten out of control and you have to go \ninto the cell and tackle them? That could be avoided very often by \nunderstanding what is going on here. There is a lot of wear and tear \nwhen they have to go in like that. It is better to recognize what is \ngoing on and know how to deal with it.\n  The bill also increases the focus on things such as transitional \nservices that reduce recidivism rates and screening practices that \nidentify inmates with mental health conditions.\n  Finally, the bill gives local officials greater control over program \nparticipation eligibility. This again is for a program that already \nexists.\n  The current system is broken. It doesn't serve the interests of \npeople with mental illness, and it doesn't protect the safety of law \nenforcement personnel. As one Minnesota judge wrote:\n\n       While [inmates with mental illness] are sitting in jail, \n     they often recede further into the depths of their illness. \n     They present a danger to themselves; they present a danger to \n     fellow inmates; and they present a danger to the . . . men \n     and women who run the jails.\n\n  We have an obligation to ensure that people with mental illness \nreceive the treatment and supervision they need and that the officers \nwho put their lives on the line when they are called on to intervene in \nmental health crises are trained to respond in a way that protects \ntheir safety and that of their fellow officers and of the person with \nmental illness. This bill helps us better meet that obligation.\n  I am very pleased to introduce this bill with a bipartisan group of \nlawmakers who are committed to improving the ways in which people with \nmental health conditions interact with the criminal justice system--in \nparticular, my fellow lead sponsor, Senator John Cornyn, and \nRepresentative Doug Collins, who is leading this effort in the House.\n  This legislation has always enjoyed bipartisan support. In 2004, it \nwas introduced by Michael DeWine, Republican from Ohio, in the Senate. \nIn the last Congress, the predecessor of this bill had 39 Senate \ncosponsors, including 25 Democrats and 14 Republicans. The House \ncompanion bill had 55 cosponsors, including 24 Democrats and 31 \nRepublicans.\n  As you can see, this has always been a bipartisan effort, and I am \npleased to continue that tradition in this Congress. I would like to \nthank Senators Cornyn, Ayotte, Blunt, and Portman, as well as Senators \nLeahy, Durbin, Whitehouse, Klobuchar, Coons, Blumenthal, Boxer, Brown, \nWarren, and Booker, for serving as original cosponsors of the \nComprehensive Justice and Mental Health Act. I look forward to adding \nmore cosponsors in the days to come.\n  I would also like to recognize the many law enforcement, civil rights \nveterans, and mental health advocacy organizations--most notably the \nCouncil of State Governments--for standing in strong support of this \nlegislation or its predecessor bill and advocating tirelessly for its \nenactment. More than 250 organizations endorsed this legislation in the \nprevious Congress, including the American Legion, the Major Cities \nChiefs Association, the Major County Sheriffs' Association, the \nNational Sheriffs' Association, the National Alliance on Mental \nIllness, the National Association of Counties, and the Wounded Warrior \nProject, just to name a few.\n  I look forward to working together with advocates and with my \ncolleagues to get this bill enacted into law so that we can ease the \nburden of mental health problems on our criminal justice system and \nhelp a lot of people.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. \n        Schumer, and Mrs. Gillibrand):\n  S. 1006. A bill to incentivize early adoption of positive train \ncontrol, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about Positive Train \nControl, a crash-avoidance rail safety system that can automatically \nstop trains in order to prevent impending collisions.\n  The Senate Commerce Committee recently voted to advance a bill that \nwould give railroads a 5-to-7 year extension of the deadline to \nimplement this life-saving technology.\n  In my view, a blanket extension is disastrous policy.\n  Fortunately, the members of the Commerce Committee have signaled \ntheir willingness to consider improvements to this bill, and today I \nrise to offer such an improvement.\n  This legislation, the Positive Train Control Safety Act, would \nprovide a reasonable extension for the implementation of positive train \ncontrol until 2018, on a case-by-case, year-by-year basis, for any \nrailroad whose implementation plans were delayed by factors outside of \ntheir control.\n  This provision mirrors language that already passed the Senate in \n2012 as\n\n[[Page S2253]]\n\npart of the transportation reauthorization bill with overwhelming \nsupport. It is a measured, realistic response to the delayed \nimplementation we have witnessed. Overall, this bill strives to hold \nthe railroads to their safety commitments.\n  To understand the importance of PTC, we must revisit a terrible \ntragedy in my State of California, near Chatsworth.\n  In 2008, a Los Angeles Metrolink commuter train collided head-on with \na Union Pacific freight train, killing 25 people and injuring 135 more.\n  Testimony from the victims who survived the crash paint a gruesome \npicture of the aftermath. ``Severed limbs were strewn all about and \nblood was pooled everywhere.'' Victims' bodies, many torn to pieces, \nhad to be extracted from heaps of steel and wreckage.\n  One passenger described coming across a man who had been crushed by \nan air vent: ``His mangled legs were all I could see, but his cries for \nhelp were very loud. Eventually he must have died, as he was calling \nout for his mother and then no more sounds. [. . .] I was trying to \ndecide if I would die by fire or suffocation of smoke.''\n  Many victims suffered traumatic brain injuries and those sitting at \ntables suffered ``horrible abdominal injuries that cannot be medically \nresolved.'' As the National Transportation Safety Board found in its \ninvestigation, this terrible tragedy could have been prevented if the \nPositive Train Control technology had been in place.\n  Positive Train Control is a system for automatic train safety, which \nwas originally recommended by the National Transportation Safety Board \nin 1970.\n  Using GPS and wireless technology, Positive Train Control can \nautomatically put the brakes on trains about to collide or derail. \nPositive Train Control can monitor trains and stop them if they enter \nthe wrong track or are about to run red lights.\n  In the Metrolink crash, it was later determined that the engineer was \ntexting, causing him to miss a red signal and cause the deadly \ncollision.\n  PTC could have prevented this, as it could have forced the train to \nstop before running onto the same track as the oncoming freight train.\n  This horrific accident became a rallying cry for Congress, which \nresponded by passing the Rail Safety Improvement Act in 2008.\n  This legislation mandated the widespread installation of PTC by the \nend of 2015.\n  The railroad industry has fought PTC from start. Now, as the deadline \nrapidly approaches, railroads are again lobbying hard to delay \ninstallation. Many have not even begun installing PTC in any form--\nsomething that is particularly disturbing to me.\n  After its terrible accident, Metrolink in California has shown great \nleadership and plans to be the first railroad to be fully certified. \nMetrolink is on track do so by the federally-mandated deadline of \nDecember 31, 2015.\n  Several other railroad companies in California are also on track to \nbegin using PTC this year, in demonstration mode, on the path to final \ncertification. These include the North County Transit District in San \nDiego and Caltrain in the Bay Area.\n  In addition, new passenger rail services in California plan to \noperate with PTC from the first moment that they come on-line, \nincluding the Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit line in 2016 and the first \nHigh Speed Rail segment in 2022.\n  California is committed to safe and efficient rail. I believe my \nState demonstrates that railroads around the country can and should be \nexpected to implement Positive Train Control as soon as is feasible, \nwithout unnecessary delay.\n  The bill that the Senate Commerce Committee recently voted to advance \nis a no-strings-attached bill that would extend by 5 years the deadline \nby which PTC must be implemented.\n  On top of that, it offers railroads an optional extension of an \nadditional 2 years on a case-by-case basis. Extending the deadline \nthrough until the outset of 2023.\n  Effectively, this is just kicking the can down road once more.\n  I am deeply concerned about this blanket extension. First, it rewards \nthose that have chosen delay over action. More troubling, it could have \ndeadly consequences for Americans across the country.\n  It has been 7 years since the collision at Chatsworth claimed 25 \nlives, and 45 years since the National Transportation Safety Board \nfirst recommended a system like Positive Train Control.\n  Unnecessary delay is simply not acceptable.\n  This is why I am introducing this bill today. I believe it will \nincentivize railroads to install PTC as quickly as possible.\n  My bill allows case-by-case, single-year extensions through 2018 for \nrailroads that have demonstrated good faith efforts to implement PTC. \nIt also instructs the Department of Transportation to only grant \nextensions if the Secretary determines that a railroad's efforts to \nimplement PTC were delayed due to circumstances beyond their control.\n  In addition, the bill offers a number of other common-sense \nprovisions relating to Positive Train Control requirements and railroad \nsafety. These provisions reflect the lessons we have learned since the \nRail Safety Improvement Act first required the implementation of PTC \n6\\1/2\\ years ago.\n  These provisions include bolstering the transparency of railroads' \nimplementation efforts, by requiring regular status reports; and \nensuring trains carrying crude oil or ethanol run on tracks with PTC.\n  The provision requires better coordination between the Federal \nRailroad Administration and the Federal Communications Commission to \nensure adequate wireless communications availability.\n  Requiring the Department of Transportation to evaluate the \neffectiveness of PTC at grade crossings.\n  Improving opportunities for railroad employees to report safety \ndeficiencies.\n  Protecting employees in rail work zones.\n  Improving inspection practices on commuter railroads.\n  Riding our rails should not be a dangerous activity. It doesn't have \nto be. If we have the technology to prevent collisions, we must use it.\n  I urge my colleagues to carefully consider this proposal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/16/senate-section/article/S2253-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 136--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE DESIGNATION OF MAY 1, \n              2015, AS ``SILVER STAR SERVICE BANNER DAY''\n\n  Mr. BLUNT (for himself and Mrs. McCaskill) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services:\n\n                              S.

(referred to in this preamble as the ``Architectural \n     Barriers Act of 1968''), was enacted to ensure that certain \n     federally funded facilities are designed and constructed to \n     be accessible to people with disabilities and requires that \n     physically handicapped people have ready access to, and use \n     of, post offices and other Federal facilities;\n       Whereas automatic doors, though not mandated by either the \n     Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 or the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.), provide a \n     greater degree of self-sufficiency and dignity for people \n     with disabilities and the elderly, who may have limited \n     strength to open a manually operated door;\n       Whereas a report commissioned by the Architectural and \n     Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (referred to in this \n     preamble as the ``Access Board''), an independent Federal \n     agency created to ensure access to federally funded \n     facilities for people with disabilities, recommends that all \n     new buildings for use by the public should have at least one \n     automated door at an accessible\n\n[[Page S2255]]\n\n     entrance, except for small buildings where adding such doors \n     may be a financial hardship for the owners of the buildings;\n       Whereas States and municipalities have begun to recognize \n     the importance of automatic doors in improving accessibility;\n       Whereas the laws of the State of Connecticut require \n     automatic doors in certain shopping malls and retail \n     businesses, the laws of the State of Delaware require \n     automatic doors or calling devices for newly constructed \n     places of accommodation, and the laws of the District of \n     Columbia have a similar requirement;\n       Whereas the Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings \n     Service, published by the General Services Administration, \n     requires automation of at least one exterior door for all \n     newly constructed or renovated facilities managed by the \n     General Services Administration, including post offices;\n       Whereas from 2006 to 2011, 71 percent of the complaints \n     received by the Access Board regarding the Architectural \n     Barriers Act of 1968 concerned a post office or other \n     facility of the United States Postal Service;\n       Whereas the United States Postal Service employs \n     approximately 522,000 people, making it the second-largest \n     civilian employer in the United States;\n       Whereas approximately 3,200,000 people visit 1 of the \n     31,857 post offices in the United States each day; and\n       Whereas the United States was founded on principles of \n     equality and freedom, and these principles require that all \n     people, including people with disabilities, are able to \n     engage as equal members of society: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the immense hardships that people with \n     disabilities in the United States must overcome every day;\n       (2) reaffirms its support of the Act entitled ``An Act to \n     insure that certain buildings financed with Federal funds are \n     so designed and constructed as to be accessible to the \n     physically handicapped'', approved August 12, 1968 (42 U.S.C. \n     4151 et seq.), commonly known as the ``Architectural Barriers \n     Act of 1968'', and the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n     1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.), and encourages full \n     compliance with such Acts;\n       (3) recommends that the United States Postal Service and \n     Federal agencies install power-assisted doors at post offices \n     and other federally funded facilities, respectively, to \n     ensure equal access for all people of the United States; and\n       (4) pledges to continue to work to identify and remove the \n     barriers that prevent all people of the United States from \n     having equal access to the services provided by the Federal \n     Government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/16/senate-section/article/S2255-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      committee on armed services\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON.

Mr. President, I wish to say a few words on the nuclear \nagreement that is being negotiated with Iran. I will start by \ncommending the members of the Foreign Relations Committee, particularly \nSenator Corker, the chairman of that committee. They moved the Corker-\nMenendez bill through the committee a few days ago with a unanimous \nvote. It was very important work. It is a good start to a critically \nimportant topic for the American people. I know it was a struggle. We \nread about what happened in the press. But it is important to recognize \nthat it was a struggle that should not have been.\n  The Obama administration put tremendous pressure on Members of this \nbody--Democratic Members of this body--not to allow the U.S. Senate to \nhave any say on this issue, one of the most important foreign policy \nissues facing the country right now. They did not want the American \npeople to have a voice. In fact, last month when the bill was released, \nthe President vowed to veto it. He backed off only when it was clear \nthat members of the committee, Republicans and Democrats, stood firm \nagainst the President and with the American people. Then the President \nknew he would fail and his veto threat would likely be overridden.\n  So the President, under pressure, dispatched Secretary of State John \nKerry, a former Member of this body, to give me and my colleagues here \nin the Senate a closed-door preview of these negotiations in this \nframework agreement. I sat through the meeting and had some discussions \nwith the Secretary. It was useful, but think about it--it was a closed-\ndoor briefing. Why not involve the American people?\n  This is not an issue which is about the Senate or the Congress per \nse, as we often read in the paper. This is an issue about the American \npeople, who have a voice through us, their representatives in Congress, \nand should have a say on one of the most critical foreign policy issues \nfacing the United States right now. And, remember, we know this. We \nwere sent here. The people are wise. The citizens of this country are \nwise. They understand national security. Many of them are in the \nmilitary. Many of them have sons and daughters in the military. Many of \nthem are veterans. They know what sacrifice is. They know what national \nsecurity is. They sent us here so their voices could be heard, \nparticularly on issues of national security and on issues of the \nsecurity of the country they love.\n  Make no mistake, Americans are overwhelmingly interested in making \nsure that they, through their representatives in Congress, have a say \nin this important deal. A recent USA TODAY-Suffolk University poll \nshowed that a whopping 72 percent of Americans think Congress should \nhave a role in approving the nuclear negotiations with Iran.\n  What is very interesting about this is that once upon a time, even \nPresident Obama, Secretary of State John Kerry, and former Senator \nClinton all believed this body should have a role in such important \nagreements. They said Congress should approve any sweeping deals. In \n2007 and 2008, they cosponsored a bill that required congressional \napproval of any long-term security commitment President Bush made to \nIraq.\n  Vice President Biden--then-Senator Biden--put it then:\n\n       The president cannot make such a sweeping commitment on his \n     own authority. Congress must grant approval.\n\n  Those were wise words then, and I believe they are wise words today. \nWhy is that? One reason is that when the executive branch and the \nCongress work together, we are stronger on issues of foreign policy and \nnational security. Think about all of the different times in which this \nbody, through treaties and other agreements, worked with Presidents of \nboth parties--bipartisan--to make sure we were speaking strongly \ntogether on critical issues of national security. I served under \nCondoleezza Rice as an Assistant Secretary of State and worked on these \nkinds of issues--sanctions on Iran and terrorist finance issues--and I \nsaw that when the executive branch worked with the Congress, we were \nstronger.\n  As I mentioned, when then-Senator Biden mentioned these words about \ncongressional approval, they were wise words. Yet, now the Vice \nPresident, Secretary Kerry, and President Obama--all former Members of \nthis body--are ignoring their own previous advice and previous wisdom, \nand they are ignoring the American people in the process through their \nrepresentatives in Congress.\n  Where does that leave us today? My own view is that the President \nshould have reached out to the Congress from the very beginning and \nsaid that he wanted to work with us and have our approval on this \nimportant agreement so we could be stronger as a country, the executive \nbranch and the Congress working together, unified, to enhance America's \nnational security.\n  The President should have looked to the Congress and the Constitution \nwhen considering this potential agreement--whether the biggest state \nsponsor of terrorism in the world should get a nuclear weapon and \nwhen--and realized this was an important enough national security issue \nand said: I am going to submit this as a treaty. He should have been \nwilling to make the case to the American people and convince two-thirds \nof the Senate to vote for this agreement, as required by the \nConstitution. But he chose another path. He chose the ``go it alone'' \npath where even just a few weeks ago the administration signaled that \nit was not going to show the agreement--the key annexes of this \nagreement--to the Congress and that any attempts to force him to do so \nwould be vetoed. That was a mistake. That is a mistake, and we are \nstarting to change that.\n  In these kinds of matters, the U.S. State Department urges any \nadministration--Republican or Democratic--to\n\n[[Page S2257]]\n\nuse the utmost caution when deciding how to deal with international \ntreaties on key foreign policy issues and the Congress.\n  I have a quote from the State Department guidelines:\n\n       In determining whether any international agreement should \n     be brought into force as a treaty or as an international \n     agreement other than a treaty, the utmost care is to be \n     exercised to avoid any invasion or compromise of the \n     constitutional powers of the President, the Senate, and the \n     Congress as a whole.\n\n  That is the State Department--``the utmost care.'' But the Obama \nadministration did not take the utmost care in this matter. In fact, \ntheir goal has been to shut out the American people on this deal.\n  So what are we doing? The Congress is having to force the President \nto let the American people be heard. That is what we are doing, and I \nbelieve in many ways that is sad. The President is clearly not abiding \nby the advice he gave when he was a Senator on these kinds of issues, \nand neither is the Vice President, so the Congress acted.\n  The Corker-Menendez bill that passed the Foreign Relations Committee, \nwhich will be debated soon on this floor, at least gives us an up-or-\ndown vote, and it will enable us to actually see some of the classified \nannexes that are part of this agreement. Again, it is not us, it is the \nAmerican people. It is the people we represent.\n  I urge my colleagues to practice what the State Department has said \nis the utmost care on these kinds of issues. We need to look hard at \nwhatever agreement is finalized and brought to this body, and we need \nto work hard to cut through the clutter and opaque language, unclear \nlanguage, and conflicting views of this agreement--the way in which \nthis administration is describing this deal right now.\n  I will give one example. Let's take the phrase ``snapped back.'' \nRight now, the American people are being told that if Iran violates the \nterms of this agreement, the sanctions, which have been key to this \nentire agreement and imposed on Iran by this body four different times, \ncan quickly and automatically be snapped back. That is a fantasy. \nPresident Obama knows that sanctions--particularly international \nsanctions--cannot just be snapped back. But it is a great phrase. It \nsounds good, but it is a fantasy.\n  As I mentioned, as a former Assistant Secretary of State, I worked \nwith the Congress and other members of the executive branch to go \naround to different countries in the world and strongly encourage them \nto divest out of Iran, out of the Iranian oil and gas sector. In many \nways, we said: If you don't take action and divest out of Iran, it is \nvery likely that the Congress will sanction you. We worked with the \nCongress. This was executive branch and congressional branch \ncooperation, making us stronger as a nation because it worked.\n\n  Many of these companies started to divest. It weakened Iran, but this \ntook years. There was no snap involved. This was a slog, but it was \nsuccessful. It was successful because this body was very intimately \ninvolved. The President knows this. Secretary Kerry knows this. But the \nfact that they are willing to say ``Don't worry, sanctions will be \nsnapped back in an instant'' should otherwise make us all nervous.\n  The administration needs to explain to the American people how this \nsnapback will work. Think about it. If sanctions are lifted, millions, \nprobably billions of dollars are going to flow from European companies, \ncountries; Asian companies, countries; Russian; Chinese. They are going \nto flow into Iran. They are going to invest in businesses. They are \ngoing to invest in the oil and gas sector. They are going to invest in \nbanks. And then we are going to snap that back if there is a violation, \nautomatically, in a couple of days? It is not going to happen. It is a \ncatchy phrase with no substance.\n  The administration needs to explain it. The American people need to \nknow what is at stake. The Secretary and the President need to be clear \nwith the American people on exactly what is in this agreement. They \nneed to level with the American people. As we move forward, as we think \nabout how we are going to analyze, look at, vote on this agreement, \nthey must tell the American people the truth.\n  We must start to think about some of these issues. Let's start with a \ncouple of things that are very important for the American people to \nknow, and the American people do know them.\n  Let's start by recognizing that Iran is the world's largest state \nsponsor of terrorism.\n  Let's recognize that Iran has consistently lied and cheated with \nregard to its nuclear weapons program, including even recently, during \nthese negotiations.\n  Let's recognize that Iran will not--will not--stand down from its \nstated goal that many of its leaders still state today, which is that \nthey want to wipe Israel off the map.\n  Let's recognize that Iran is responsible--and this is very important \nto recognize and understand--for the maiming and killing of likely \nthousands of U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines in Iraq by \nsupplying Shia militias there with the most sophisticated, the most \nlethal IED on the battlefield, called an EFP, an explosively formed \nprojectile. If a person was in Iraq as a U.S. military member and that \nperson was in a vehicle that hit one of these IEDs, that person was \neither going to be killed or seriously maimed. This is something I \nwitnessed during my time as a staff officer to the commanding general \nof the U.S. Central Command when I was in Iraq as a marine.\n  Let's recognize that from what we know right now in terms of this \ndeal, Iran doesn't appear to have given up much at all. They will keep \nthousands of nuclear centrifuges. They will keep their missile \ndevelopment programs. They will keep their nuclear infrastructure. They \nwill continue to support and sponsor terrorism around the world--the \nlargest state sponsor of terrorism.\n  The American people need to know that if we do lift sanctions--and it \nis not clear when we are going to lift them; the Iranians are saying we \nare going to lift them right away--if we do lift sanctions, Iran will \nvery likely use the millions of dollars that will flood into their \neconomy to pump up their terror machine around the world and likely \ntarget our citizens. The American people need to understand all of this \nas we go forward.\n  Maybe the administration disagrees on some of these points. Maybe \nthey don't think these points are the aspects of the deal. And if none \nof this is true, then let Secretary Kerry and his team come forward to \nthe Congress and make the case in public to the American people that \nthis isn't the case, that this is a deal which will keep us safe, that \nthis is a deal with a regime that is trustworthy. Let them make that \ncase.\n  The Congress needs to be very involved, and we are involved because \nof the respect for the people we represent.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan).

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Gov. Norm Bangerter, \nwho\n\n[[Page S2258]]\n\nserved as Utah's 13th Governor from 1985 to 1993. He was truly an \nextraordinary man and an exceptional leader. He passed away this past \nTuesday, April 14, at the age of 82.\n  He loved Utah, and he loved this great Nation. As a veteran, a \nbusiness owner, an elected official, a father, and a man of faith, he \nled a life of service to his community, to his church, and to his \ncountry.\n  Norm Bangerter once described himself as ``just an old farmer and \ncarpenter.'' And he was those things. While the qualities of a farmer \nand a carpenter may seem far removed from business and political \nleadership, his farmer's grit and determination saw him through many \ntough political battles, and his eye as a master craftsman ensured \nevery step along the way he could not only start a project, but he knew \nhow to put a fine finish on that project and see it through all the way \nto completion. His willingness to get his hands a ``little dirty'' \nenabled him to tackle difficult issues, the kinds of issues that \nrequired hard work and heavy lifting far from the spotlight and \nlimelight of public praise. And he was, indeed, a builder. He was a \nbuilder of business, a builder of the great State of Utah, and, as I \npersonally experienced, a builder of people.\n\n  I, like so many others throughout my great State and elsewhere, have \nbeen blessed by Governor Bangerter's vision for building other leaders. \nHe stood with me as a young candidate and as a new Senator and provided \npriceless insight, wisdom, and perspective. He taught me that it was \nnever about me but always about the State, about the Nation, and about \nfuture generations. He proved his commitment to this principle when he \ndescribed his decision not to seek a third term as Governor. When he \nmade that announcement, he said:\n\n       We have not concentrated on image or on protecting our \n     popularity in the polls. We have taken the problems as they \n     came, head on, and we have proposed the best solution we knew \n     regardless of political consequences. . . . I want to go down \n     in history as the Governor who didn't spend eight years \n     worrying about how he would go down in history.\n\n  All of us in Congress could benefit from this kind of approach. All \nof us in Congress could learn a great deal from this man's \nextraordinary example.\n  Governor Bangerter was one of the most unassuming, kind, honest, \ngenuinely decent people I have ever met. He was the kind of man and was \nthe kind of great Governor who, like a great farmer and a great \ncarpenter, left the world much better than he found it.\n  Like the farmer planting oak trees for the next generation or the \ncarpenter finishing a finely crafted masterpiece that becomes a \ntreasured heirloom for generations to enjoy, Governor Bangerter spent \nhis life planting the seeds for the extraordinary State of Utah and \ncrafted a legacy of leadership that will be remembered and will be \nfollowed for many decades to come. Governor Norm Bangerter's leadership \nwill be missed, and his friendship will be cherished forever.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/16/senate-section/article/S2258-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, APRIL 20, 2015, AT 2 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
