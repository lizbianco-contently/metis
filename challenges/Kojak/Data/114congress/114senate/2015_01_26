This weekend President Obama's Chief of Staff lamented \nthat the Senate has taken several weeks to debate an infrastructure \nproject, the Keystone jobs bill. I agree it is about time to bring the \nKeystone debate to a positive conclusion, and we will do that soon. We \nhave had a lot of floor discussion. We have considered Democratic and \nRepublican amendments. All in all, the last few weeks have been time \nwell spent. The debate has been good for our country. But tonight is \nour chance to notch another win for the middle class by supporting \ncloture and then actually passing this bipartisan jobs bill.\n  We have heard rumors that some in the Democratic leadership are \npressuring rank-and-file Democrats--even Democrats who cosponsored this \nbill--to block Keystone's jobs with a filibuster instead. This is \nreally disappointing when you consider all that our friends on the \nother side have been saying about the filibuster for so many years.\n  What is most disappointing, though, is the apparent reasoning for the \nKeystone filibuster. The Democratic leadership is claiming that there \nhaven't been enough opportunities to consider amendments. Yet nine \ncurrent Senate Democrats voted for the Keystone project just a few \nweeks ago without having the opportunity to offer or debate even a \nsingle amendment. Nine current Senate Democrats just a couple of months \nago voted for the Keystone project without having the opportunity to \noffer or debate even a single amendment.\n  This time around, the new Republican majority allowed more amendment \nrollcall votes on just this one bill--this one bill--than the previous \nleadership allowed on every single bill from last year combined. \nAltogether, there were more rollcall votes on this bill than we got on \namendments on the Senate floor all of last year combined.\n  I would also note that a majority of amendments we have taken \nrollcall votes on were also offered by the minority, by the Democrats. \nWe also offered our friends on the other side an opportunity to \nconsider more amendments just a few days ago. They objected to it at \nthe time. Even so, it is still my hope that we will be able to consider \nmore amendments from both sides of the aisle. Instead of filibustering \nthis bill or blocking their own amendments, which we experienced the \nother night, I am asking my Democratic friends to work with the bill \nmanager, Senator Murkowski--who has done a fantastic job on this bill--\nto get amendments lined up.\n  Let's keep up the positive momentum generated by a more open \nlegislative process that actually clearly has benefited both parties. A \nKeystone filibuster cannot succeed without the support of Democrats who \nvoted for a Keystone bill just a few weeks ago without any amendments--\nany amendments--and who are cosponsoring the jobs bill today. I truly \nhope these Democrats won't vote to block Keystone jobs now just because \na different party controls the Senate. The American people voted \ndecisively against this type of partisan gridlock back in November. \nThey want us to work together to get things done. Why don't we just \ncontinue to do that?\n  The debate over this bipartisan bill has already had so many positive \neffects on the Senate as an institution. It has shown Senators the \nbenefits of a more open process, it has given a real voice to the \nminority, and it represents a decisive change from the broken Senate of \nrecent years.\n  Here is how the assistant Democratic leader put it just a few days \nago:\n\n       We are in a healthy environment on the floor of the Senate \n     where we are pursuing amendments and active debate.\n\n  It is ``great to see'' this happening, he said. I couldn't agree \nmore. That is exactly the way we ought to operate.\n  I would urge the Senate not to fall into the old partisan habits. \nLet's keep working together. Let's cooperate to get this important \ninfrastructure project over the finish line and onto the President's \ndesk.\n  I am calling on all of my colleagues--especially the cosponsors of \nthis bipartisan bill, especially those who have supported Keystone \nwithout any amendments in the past--to vote for jobs and progress \ntonight, not the kind\n\n[[Page S448]]\n\nof gridlock American voters rejected so emphatically.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, in a short period of time, less than an \nhour, the Senate is going to vote on whether to end the debate on \nSenate bill 1.\n  Senate bill 1 is the Republican's No. 1 priority this year. They are \nnew to the majority in the Senate, and they got to choose the first and \nmost important bill to call, and they chose this bill, Senate bill 1.\n  This bill will override the President's authority when it comes to \nmaking a decision on building the Keystone Canadian pipeline--Canadian \npipeline. You see, Keystone is a Canadian corporation, and the \nRepublicans in the Senate decided the highest priority when it comes to \nAmerica's economy is to help this Canadian corporation.\n  There will certainly be construction jobs involved in the \nconstruction of this pipeline, but there will only be 35 permanent jobs \nthat come out of this. The No. 1 priority for the Senate Republican \nmajority is 35 permanent jobs. Most McDonald's hamburger franchises \nhave more than that number of jobs.\n  But, having said that, let's talk about where we are on the floor of \nthe Senate at this moment. In their new role as majority party, the \nRepublicans asked us to take up this legislation, and they said: We \nwant to go to the point we have made over and over during the past \nseveral years--we should have an open amendment process.\n  I am here to tell you that we have cooperated. I was quoted--I am \nhonored, flattered--by the majority leader on the floor as saying I \nthink it is healthy. I have said that for a long time. What changed in \nthe Senate is not just the new majority but the new minority. Our \nfeeling on our side is we need to be constructive, offer amendments, \noffer different points of view, offer different approaches, debate them \non the floor, accept the will of the Senate, and move forward on \nlegislation. That is what we have tried do on this Keystone XL bill, \nand we have really offered amendments on the Democratic side that we \nthink get to the heart of this debate.\n  My Republican friends and Senators like to characterize this as the \nKeystone jobs bill.\n  We started off by saying: Here is an idea. Let's say that the \nCanadian tar sands brought in through this pipeline and refined in the \nUnited States--the ultimate products, the oil products that come out of \nthis refinery, are going to be there for Americans first, that \nAmericans can use the gasoline and diesel fuel and jet fuel. In other \nwords, it is going to stay in America.\n  The Republicans said no. We have to be prepared, after we go through \nall of this and build this Canadian pipeline, that ultimately none of \nthe products will be used in the United States.\n  Then we said: OK, if we can't use the ultimate products coming out of \nthis pipeline to help the American economy, then let's at least agree \nthat we will build this Canadian pipeline in the United States with \nAmerican-made steel. Let's put our steelworkers and foundries to work \nfabricating the steel to build the pipelines so we will create good-\npaying American jobs supplying the materials.\n  The Republicans voted no.\n  Then we said: Well, at the end of the day, these refineries, after \nthey have processed Canadian tar sands, end up with a miserable \nbyproduct called petcoke. It has some positive applications, but sadly, \nin many instances it is piled up stories high--even in the city of \nChicago, within our city limits--and blows all over the neighborhood \nand into the lungs of children and elderly people. So let's at least \nhave standards for the storage and handling of this byproduct that is \ngoing to come out of this Canadian pipeline.\n  The Republicans voted no.\n  Then we had a vote on whether we should be concerned with the \nenvironment. Using Canadian tar sands to make oil products puts more \ngreenhouse gases in the air, more carbon dioxide, and should we be \nmindful of this.\n  If you read the votes that took place last week, it is unclear, \nuncertain as to where the Republicans stand on this issue. In fact, one \nSenator from North Dakota offered what I thought was a good amendment \nacknowledging this issue and then at the very end voted against his own \namendment, which is rare in the Senate annals, but it shows you how \nconflicted many Republican Members were on the basic environmental \nissues.\n  Now let's get to the procedure and where we stand. Last Thursday \nnight was troubling. After the constructive consideration of over a \ndozen different amendments on both sides of the aisle, the Republican \nmajority leader said: Now bring out the next group of amendments. And \nwe did. The Democrats cooperated. We produced six amendments we wanted \nup next, and the Republicans produced six amendments they wanted up \nnext. An hour later, within an hour after producing the list, the \nSenate majority leader came to floor and said: That is it; we are not \ngoing to get this done as I wanted to get it done. We are going to \nstart tabling the Democratic amendments, one after the other.\n  So the Members who offered the amendments, who had worked on the \namendments stood at their desks as each amendment came up and said: I \nwould like 60 seconds to just explain the amendment I wrote that we are \nabout to vote on. Each and every time, the Republicans objected to 60 \nseconds of debate.\n  This is considered the world's greatest deliberative body. Yet the \nsponsors, the authors of the amendments were denied 60 seconds to even \nexplain their amendments. It didn't leave a very good taste in the \nmouths of many Democrats--not even those who were supporting this \nKeystone Canadian Pipeline. Many of them think this is unfair.\n  If we are going to have a good-faith, bipartisan environment to \nconsider amendments, let's go back and forth--Democrat, Republican--and \nlet's consider the major issues before us. There are still major \nunresolved issues, health and safety issues, with pending amendments.\n  I approached the majority leader as he was leaving the floor and I \nsaid: Even if we do not invoke cloture this evening, let's work \ntogether on a bipartisan basis. Let's come up with these lists of \namendments. Let's do this in a conscientious, good-faith effort to \ncomplete this bill.\n  I think we can achieve it. My hat is off to Senator Lisa Murkowski, \nRepublican Senator, who has come to the floor, leading this effort on \nthe floor with the debate, but I have a special place in my heart for \nthe Democratic side, where two other Senators have been outstanding in \nbringing us to this point on the issue. Senator Maria Cantwell from \nWashington is leading our effort on the Democratic side in full \npartnership with Senator Barbara Boxer of California, and many others.\n  As was suggested by a Senator last week, it is time for the boys to \nget off the stage and let the ladies come back in and consider these \namendments and bring us to the right conclusion of thoughtful debate, \nimportant issues considered, and a vote in the U.S. Senate on this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/26/senate-section/article/S448-3", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S448-S449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING ERNIE BANKS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, last week America lost a hero and \nChicago lost one of its greatest. Cubs Hall of Famer Ernie Banks passed \naway Friday night.\n  He was known as Mr. Cub. His love for the game of baseball was \nmatched only by his passion for the city of Chicago.\n  He was a Hall of Famer in every sense of the word. He won the hearts \nof not just Cubs fans but baseball fans across the Nation with his \npower hitting and Golden Glove performances, and he endeared himself to \neveryone he ever met with his humble approach to the game of baseball \nand the game of life.\n\n[[Page S449]]\n\n  Before Hall of Famer Ernie Banks became Mr. Cub, he was 17 years old \nplaying in a sandlot in Dallas, TX. That is where Cool Papa Bell, one \nof the legendary leaders in the Negro League, discovered this young man \nand signed him to play for the Kansas City Monarchs for $7 a game.\n  While playing for the Monarchs, Ernie Banks was managed by another \nlegend, Buck O'Neil.\n  Playing for the Negro League legend had a profound impact on young \nErnie Banks. Buck had so much love for everybody that Ernie decided to \nmodel his life after him. It was with the Monarchs that Ernie learned \nto play with boundless energy and enthusiasm. He learned to express his \njoy for the game and took to heart the message Buck O'Neil, the \nmanager, would often shout at him: ``You gotta love this game to play \nit!'' Ernie Banks loved it, and it showed.\n  Years later, O'Neil reunited with Ernie Banks when O'Neil agreed to \nmanage the Cubs in 1962. Incidentally, he was the first African-\nAmerican manager in Major League Baseball.\n  As one of the first African-American baseball players in the Major \nLeagues, Ernie Banks helped break down the color barriers. The Hall of \nFame slugger and two-time MVP made his Major League debut at Wrigley \nField in 1953, and he became the first African American to suit up for \nthe Chicago Cubs.\n  He was only 180 pounds. He was not the most intimidating batter at \nthe plate, but he had powerful wrists that generated tremendous bat \nspeed. He whipped the bat through the ball, hitting 512 home runs in \nhis career, with 2,583 hits, 1,636 RBIs, and having a career batting \naverage of .274.\n  From 1955 to 1960, he was the most prolific home run hitter in the \ngame, hitting more home runs than either Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, or \nMickey Mantle during those years.\n  In 1958 and 1959, he was named the most valuable player in the \nNational League. He was the first ever to win the award in consecutive \nyears.\n  He was also the first player to have his jersey number retired by the \nCubs, and on game days his number 14 flies proudly over the left field \nfoul pole at the friendly confines of Wrigley Field.\n  Not surprisingly, Ernie Banks was inducted into Cooperstown the first \nyear he was eligible. But it wasn't the numbers on the back of the \nbaseball card that made Mr. Cub a beloved member of Chicago and the \ncommunity. It was his passion for the game and the appreciation he \nshowed to everyone he encountered.\n  Over the last several days, I have heard from baseball fans sharing \ntheir stories of meeting Mr. Cub. Nearly all were humbled by the \nopportunity to meet their hero, but even more impressed to find that \nErnie was just as appreciative of his fans as they were of him.\n  It is an understatement to say that the Chicago Cubs had some tough \nseasons during Ernie's 19-year career. The Cubs had not won a World \nSeries since 1908 or a National League title since 1945. But every day, \nwin or lose, Ernie would lace up his cleats, step on the field, and \nsmile for the whole world to see. You could not help but love watching \nhim play.\n  And for Ernie Banks, the eternal optimist, he always believed this \nwas going to be the year for the Cubs. Every spring he predicted, \nwithout fail, the Cubs were going to win the pennant.\n  Well, Ernie never got to play in the post season. But his love of the \ngame never wavered despite this. He became famous for his contagiously \npositive attitude. He often remarked: ``It's a great day for baseball. \nLet's play two.'' That was the charm of Mr. Cub.\n  An 11-time All-Star, first-ballot Hall of Famer, selected to \nbaseball's All-Century team in 1999, it was never about accolades or \nmoney for Ernie. He played for the pure joy of the game.\n  After hitting his 500th home run, becoming only the 9th player to \nachieve that feat, he summed up his feelings by saying: ``The riches of \nthe game are in the thrills, not the money.'' That is an inspiring \nmessage.\n  In 2013, I contacted some friends in the White House and asked \nPresident Obama to consider a Medal of Freedom for Ernie Banks. I felt \nthat his impressive career with the Cubs and his courage in breaking \ndown the color barrier in baseball were reason enough. But more than \nthese amazing achievements, Ernie's spirit set him apart.\n  It was a special moment to be there at the White House when Ernie \nBanks received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. I was honored to see \nit and experience it.\n  After being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, we held a \nreception for him in my office up here. I don't know if there have ever \nbeen so many humbled politicians coming by my office looking for an \nautograph. He happened to sign this photo for me that day that I have \nin the Chamber. I remember Johnny Isakson from Georgia--a faithful \nAtlanta Braves fan--made a point of being there to meet Ernie Banks. \nAnd I remember Harry Reid, when he met Ernie Banks, said: ``I used to \nplay a little baseball.'' Ernie Banks said to him: ``Well, Senator \nReid, what position did you play?'' He said: ``I was a catcher.'' Ernie \nBanks said: ``If you were truly a catcher, get down in that catcher's \nposition.'' Somehow or another, Harry Reid got down in that catcher's \nposition right in my office to prove it to Ernie Banks.\n  Ernie could not have been more gracious with his time, signing \nautographs for everybody who showed up. He made time for everybody.\n  The North Side of Chicago and Wrigley Field will not be the same \nwithout Ernie. ``Let's play two'' will echo off the bricks and ivy for \ngenerations to come. His positive, hopeful, Cub view of life filled \nevery room and every baseball diamond he ever touched.\n  And now it would seem they need to find a new roster spot on the \nField of Dreams--and everyone better be ready for daytime double-\nheaders too.\n  Ernie Banks, your spirit, passion, and sunny outlook on life will be \nmissed.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/26/senate-section/article/S449-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I came to the floor to speak about a \nmeasure that is supported by Members of both sides. I was listening to \nthe remarks by the minority whip on who commemorated the life of Ernie \nBanks.\n\n\n                        Remembering Ernie Banks\n\n  I began school in Chicago in the early 1960s, when Ernie Banks was \nplaying, and it is to be noted for the record that my grade point \naverage would have been higher had I not spent so many afternoons at \nWrigley Field watching the Cubs play. During that time all the games \nwere played during the day, and\n\n[[Page S450]]\n\nas such I missed a few classes to watch our beloved Cubs.\n  But our beloved player--perhaps the most beloved player in baseball \nhistory--Ernie Banks was a true delight.\n  I wish I had time to speak more on that particular issue, but what I \nwould like to direct my attention to is a bipartisan-supported measure, \nS. 1. The American people, in November, said: Get back to Washington. \nWork together, and get things done. And one of which was the Keystone \nPipeline. It has bipartisan support. In fact, on the motion to proceed \nto this measure, 10 Democrats joined Republicans in this effort. And \nthat is what we are debating here.\n\n\n          Medical Device Access and Innovation Protection Act\n\n  But I am here to talk about a second bill that certainly deserves to \nbe in the top five of pieces of legislation that have bipartisan \nsupport and will hopefully result in passage and then sent to the \nPresident. And, hopefully, with a number of Democrats joining \nRepublicans in these efforts, the President will take a second look at \nhis veto threats on measures that have bipartisan support.\n  It was Winston Churchill who said that a nation trying to tax itself \ninto prosperity ``is like a man standing in a bucket and trying to lift \nhimself up by the handle.''\n  Unfortunately, one of Indiana's most vibrant, growing industries is \nstuck in the bottom of the bucket because of a small provision tucked \naway in the 2,000-page ObamaCare law, which imposes on them an excise \ntax, a 2.3-percent excise tax on every sale they make of medical \ndevices, hindering innovation and job creation.\n  Medical device manufacturers in my State directly employ over 20,000 \nHoosiers and indirectly support thousands of additional jobs. These are \njobs that pay well above the average--56 percent higher wages than the \naverage wage rate in Indiana. So these are top-quality jobs, providing \nsignificant employment for a significant number of Hoosiers.\n  We have more than 300 FDA-registered medical device manufacturers in \nour State, and this is true of many other States. This industry is \nboosting our State's economy, our Nation's economy, and producing \ntechnologies that are changing and saving lives.\n  Products ranging from wheelchair van lifts to artificial knees, hips, \nand shoulders, to catheters used in heart procedures, have improved or \nsaved the lives of many Hoosiers and countless others not only in my \nState, not only in America, but across the globe.\n  Since the implementation of this excise tax--passed in the ObamaCare \nAct in 2010, imposed in 2013--this destructive tax has caused companies \nto freeze hiring, lay off workers, and shelve plans to expand and build \nnew facilities.\n  A survey by the Advanced Medical Technology Association found that \nthe device tax forced manufacturers to let go of or avoid hiring 33,000 \nworkers in 2013.\n  Look, I thought we were trying to get people back to work. I thought \nwe were working to pass bipartisan legislation that would benefit this \ncountry and benefit those who are seeking employment.\n  Cook Medical of Bloomington was forced to table plans for a major \nexpansion because of the device tax.\n  In 2013 testimony before the Senate Budget Committee, Cook Medical \nchairman Steve Ferguson stated:\n\n       Cook has made the difficult decision that without repeal \n     [of the medical device tax], we will move important new \n     product lines outside of the U.S. Our previous plans to open \n     up five new manufacturing facilities in American towns are \n     now on hold as we use capital intended for these projects to \n     pay the device tax.\n\n  The negative impact of this tax is not only felt by large employers \nsuch as Cook Medical, it also hurts gross sales of companies that are \nnot making a profit but are developing innovative new ways to find \nbenefits for the health and safety, and even the life, in many cases, \nof those who need these medical devices.\n  As a result, these companies are not profitable because they are \nhaving to pay the tax. They are struggling to launch new innovations to \nsave and improve lives. For instance, a small Warsaw, Indiana-based \nmanufacturer, which develops and sells orthopedic implants for \nchildren, had to shelve two important projects simply because it had to \nuse its resources to pay the medical device tax.\n  After the tax was implemented, an employee of that company shared his \nstory with me. Because of this tax, he said, the manufacturer is now \nlargely inhibited from working on important new products, such as a \ndevice that reduces a wheelchair-bound child's discomfort.\n  How ironic that ObamaCare, which the President said would increase \nthe health benefits for Americans in coverage, is actually a barrier to \nimproving lives and health outcomes.\n  Last week, I joined nine of my Senate colleagues, including five \nDemocrats, to introduce the Medical Device Access and Innovation \nProtection Act. Our legislation would eliminate this tax and has strong \nbipartisan support.\n  During the last session of Congress, 79 Senators voted to pass a \nbipartisan amendment to the fiscal year 2014 Senate budget resolution \nthat called for the repeal of this device tax--79 Members, 34 Democrats \nand 45 Republicans. It does not get much more bipartisan than that.\n  So we are hoping that while this may not be labeled S. 2, it \ncertainly stands in the top three or four issues that have strong \nsupport and will respond to the call of the American people in November \nto get back to Washington, get together, work on things with bipartisan \nsupport that are going to improve our economy and get people back to \nwork, and get it up to the President.\n  I hope my colleagues will see that this egregious, harmful tax, \ntucked-away in the Affordable Care Act, will force us to move forward, \nrepeal it, and result in the kind of improvements the American people \nare asking us to address. It is long past time for Washington to stop \npunishing medical device innovators in Indiana and across the country. \nI am urging my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, we are trying to figure out how to do a \nfair division of the time that remains. I ask unanimous consent that \nSenators Stabenow and Peters have 5 minutes between them to discuss an \namendment they have been working on, followed by Senator Cardin, who \nwould have 3 minutes to explain his, followed by myself having 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes to discuss my amendment, then Senator Heitkamp would have 5 \nminutes after that, and then the remaining time for Senator Sessions. \nBecause that would be equal. That would add to our having as much time \nas Senators Sessions or Murkowski, whoever at that point wants to \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I am seeking clarification. Is the \nSenator from California asking that these respective Members have an \nopportunity to speak to amendments or to get their amendments pending?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, some will ask for amendments to be pending. I know \nI will. Some will not ask that; they just want to be heard. But there \nis 30 minutes left in the debate. Your side just finished. Obviously, \nif we do not want to be fair, somebody could grab the time on our side \nnow and talk for 30 minutes. We do not think that is right. We are \ntrying to divide it up between our side and your side. So I have \ndivided about 15 minutes on our side and given 15 minutes to Senator \nSessions, who wanted to be heard on the matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, again, I am seeking clarification here, \nbecause up until this point in time, what we have done, in order to get \namendments pending, is the ranking member and I have kind of worked \nback and forth in terms of what it was that would come up as far as \npending.\n  As far as Members just seeking to speak to amendments, I certainly do \nnot have a problem with what the Senator from California has proposed. \nI am trying to get some other understanding. I was also--my \nunderstanding is that I had the time beginning at 5:15 p.m. reserved. I \nthink there is a little bit of confusion here.\n\n[[Page S451]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reclaiming my time, we have already wasted 4 minutes of \nthe 15. The Senator can object if she does not want to allow us to have \nan amendment pending, but I am going to start off here. Is the Senator \nstill objecting? Instead of Senator Sessions, I will give--now it is \nabout 12 minutes to you at the end. Is that all right with the Senator?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, again, I am trying to understand. If \nMembers just want to speak to their amendments, there is not a problem \nwith what the Senator has suggested. It is just the question of whether \nwe are getting amendments pending, because we have been going back and \nforth, side to side, up to this point in time.\n  I will be happy to put the microphone down and let the Senator from \nCalifornia speak to her amendment while Senator Cantwell and I talk \nabout how we get more amendments pending. That way she can get talking.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, if I might say this: Every Senator has a right to \nask unanimous consent on anything. If the Senator does not like it, she \ncan say, ``I object.'' I do intend to--I cannot speak for anybody else. \nI want to make my amendment pending because it is germane. I want to \nmake sure it is heard. It is about public health. So if my friend does \nnot want to agree to this unanimous consent, then I think what we will \ndo is I will hold the floor and I will yield to colleagues for \nquestions and they can make their points.\n  I do not understand my friend's objection to the way we have it laid \nout.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. There continues to be objection. I would like to meet \nwith the ranking member to continue a process of back-and-forth to make \namendments pending. I have no objection to the Senator from California \nspeaking to her amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, I am going to take the time now--the entire time--\nand yield to colleagues for them to ask me questions. So I will speak \nfor 2 minutes or less and then I am going to ask unanimous consent on \nmy amendment.\n  We want to have a study of the significant human health impacts of \nthe Keystone Canadian XL tar sands pipeline. I do not believe they were \nadequately addressed in the supplemental environmental impact report or \ncompletely analyzed.\n  I held a press conference with doctors from Canada who spoke about \nthe adverse impact on the health of people living near the pipeline. We \nhave had spills along the pipeline in Michigan, in Arkansas. Those \nspills are not adequately cleaned up as we speak.\n  As Senator Cantwell informed me, there have been an additional two \nspills since the new Congress came into session. From extraction to \ntransportation to refining to waste storage, misery follows the tar \nsands. We know there are dangerous air pollutants and carcinogens that \nhave been documented from tar sands refining--all of this to help a \nCanadian private company make a whole bunch of money, and we cannot \neven keep the oil in this country.\n  Are you kidding me? Thirty-five permanent jobs. The least we can do \nis have an in-depth health impact study before we approve this \npipeline.\n  I am very sad to say--you know, we still have this kind of gag-athon \ngoing on from the other side. They would not even let people speak for \n1 minute on their amendment. That is why I am grabbing the floor here. \nI could not even get agreement to divide up the time, so I am taking \nthe time.\n  I will be happy to yield to my friend from Michigan, through the \nChair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you very much to my friend and colleague and \nleader from California.\n  I first want to say thank you to Senators Murkowski and Cantwell who \nhave worked so hard with Senator Boxer moving forward a process that, \nuntil Thursday night, was working very well going back and forth.\n  Before we authorize the building of a new oil pipeline in America, it \nis important for us to consider the safety of pipelines we already \nhave.\n  In 2010, a pipeline that runs from Canada through Michigan spilled \nnearly a million gallons of tar sands oil into the Kalamazoo River, \ncausing the largest inland oil spill in U.S. history.\n  That cleanup cost $1.2 billion.\n  Nine days ago, another pipeline broke in Montana, and for the second \ntime in 4 years, tens of thousands of gallons of oil emptied into the \nYellowstone River, making that water unsafe to drink.\n  Right now in Michigan, we have a 61-year-old pipeline which runs \nalong environmentally sensitive areas and goes beneath the Straits of \nMackinac and our magnificent Great Lakes.\n  That pipeline carries 1.2 million gallons of tar sands oil per day \nand has undergone only a few upgrades since it was first installed in \n1953. A spill would be devastating, not only to the region but to all \nAmericans--because the Great Lakes are a vital source of our Nation's \nfresh water supply.\n  Yet none of the companies transporting heavy tar sands crude are \nrequired to pay into the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, which would \nensure that taxpayers are not footing the bill.\n  When we offered an amendment to fix that, the Republicans said no.\n  America's economy is only as strong as our natural resources, and \nthose resources are threatened every time a pipeline breaks.\n  Making matters worse, Republicans said no to amendments that would \nkeep the oil in America, guarantee the pipeline be built with American \nsteel and use American workers.\n  So Americans take all of the risks with very few, if any, rewards.\n  Because Republicans refuse to make this Canadian oil company pay into \nthe oil spill fund, American taxpayers may have to bailout the company \nif the pipeline breaks.\n  So, before our Colleagues vote on behalf of the oil companies to \napprove the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, it is critical \nthat we pass the amendment that my friend and partner from Michigan and \nI have introduced.\n  This amendment ensures that we address the safety of the pipelines \nthat we have now--before beginning construction on Keystone. And it \nwould ensure that the heightened safety standards being applied to \nKeystone exist in pipelines around the Great Lakes.\n  The Republican majority has promised an open amendment process, so I \ncertainly hope that when my colleague from Michigan offers this \namendment in a few moments, the Republican majority will allow a vote \non this critical pipeline safety amendment--even though Big Oil may not \nlike it.\n  Again, the American people are taking all of the risks when the oil \nwill not even stay in America. The least Congress can do is guarantee \nthe pipelines are safe.\n  I would ask my friends to join with Senator Peters and me in saying \nthat before we authorize the building of a new oil pipeline in America \nthat we have to consider and strengthen the safety of pipelines, the \npipelines we already have. In 2010, a pipeline that runs from Canada \nthrough Michigan spilled nearly 1 million gallons of tar sands oil into \nthe Kalamazoo River--this has been talked about before--causing the \nlargest inland oilspill in U.S. history.\n  So we need to vote on Senator Peters' and my amendment. The cleanup \nitself cost $1.2 billion. Nine days ago, another pipeline broke in \nMontana. For the second time in 4 years, tens of thousands of gallons \nof oil emptied into the Yellowstone River, making that water unsafe to \ndrink. So would my friend from California agree with me and share \nconcerns that under the Straits of Mackinac--and our gorgeous, \nbeautiful Great Lakes--we have a 61-year old pipeline that runs through \nenvironmentally sensitive areas, goes right under the water, and has \nonly been upgraded a couple of times since 1953?\n  Before we pass this Keystone Pipeline bill, we should make sure our \nGreat Lakes have the pipeline safety we need, as well as all of our \npipelines across the country.\n  Would my colleague agree with that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I could not agree more with my friend. Her question is \npertinent and to the point of this debate. We are giving permission to \na Canadian company to come through and use America as a passthrough. \nThey are going to leave behind petcoke, leave behind spills--they have \nalready done it before with the tar sands pipeline. This is the hardest \noil to clean up.\n\n[[Page S452]]\n\n  I absolutely know that my friend Senator Peters has a question as \nwell.\n  Without losing my right to the floor, I ask unanimous consent to set \naside the pending amendment so that I may call up my amendment. I will \nwait for the objection to be heard. I am not going to plow through \nthis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That was my amendment No. 128. I am very disappointed, \nbecause what the Senator is talking about, making sure the pipelines \nare safe, and what I am talking about, a health study, are quite \nrelated.\n  I know my friend from Michigan wanted me to yield for a question. I \nam happy to do so.\n  Mr. PETERS. I appreciate the Senator from California yielding for a \nquestion, as I am listening to this debate and hearing from my \ncolleague, the Senator from Michigan, as to the importance of pipeline \nsafety, as we are now debating a very comprehensive bill to give \napproval for one specific pipeline in this country, which I think is \nvery much an unprecedented type of vote in the Senate.\n  My question is: Why do we not have an opportunity, or would the \nSenator not agree that we should have an opportunity, to offer \namendments? I know I am new to the Senate, but I was informed this \nwould be an open amendment process. My idea of an open amendment \nprocess means you can actually offer amendments. It means you can also \nactually debate amendments. That is an open process, particularly \nsomething as important as protecting our Great Lakes, this incredible, \nimmense body of freshwater, one of the largest bodies of freshwater in \nthe world. We have a pipeline that goes through there, above the \nlakebed, that could potentially be catastrophic if there is a break.\n  As Senator Stabenow mentioned, in Michigan we have already had the \nmost expensive pipeline break in history--4 years of cleanup of \nCanadian tar sands oil, oil that sinks to the bottom of the river. It \nis more expensive to clean up--over $1.2 billion in cleanup. So you can \nimagine if we had a pipeline break in the middle of the Great Lakes. It \nwould be catastrophic to this country, it would be catastrophic to the \nState of Michigan, but really catastrophic to the entire world. It is a \nrisk we cannot take.\n  That is why we have authored a commonsense amendment that says we \nshould ensure that there is adequate inspection, that PHMSA has the \nresources they need in order to inspect this, and if there are special \nrequirements to protect the Great Lakes, as there were special \nrequirements for Keystone, it should also be available to other \npipelines, particularly in sensitive areas such as the Great Lakes.\n  That is why, in the spirit of an open amendment process, in the \nspirit of this great deliberative body, where people are allowed to \ndebate the big issues affecting our world, I ask unanimous consent to \nset aside the pending amendment so that I may call up my amendment No. \n70.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I could answer the question posed to me by my friend--\nhe asked do I think there ought to be an open amendment process. Not \nonly do I think there should be, we were promised an open amendment \nprocess. What occurred here at midnight on Thursday night, before the \nSenate left--some of our colleagues who are running for President went \nout to my beautiful State to make their case, as they have every right \nto do. But instead of staying on Friday, we adjourned on Thursday \nnight. It was anything but an open amendment process.\n  I see the Senator from Massachusetts on the floor. He had a \ncritically important amendment. He asked for 60 seconds to explain his \namendment. I have been here over 20 years. I have never seen a \nsituation, ever, where five Members in a row, five great Senators \nrepresenting their great States, were told: Sit down; we are gagging \nyou. That is what happened. This is wrong. So we are going to be asked \nto proceed today and shut down the amendment process even further. I do \nnot know how the Senate is going to vote. However the Senate votes, it \nvotes. But the bottom line is, this has been anything but an open \namendment process. My friend is absolutely right.\n  I know the Senator from Maryland wanted to ask me a question.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, could I ask my colleague from California \nto yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. The question I am going to ask Senator Boxer to respond \nto is: What are the consequences if we invoke cloture about 15 minutes \nfrom now when that comes up for a vote on the floor?\n  There were many of my colleagues who had amendments they wanted to \noffer. They filed those amendments.\n  Unless those amendments become pending, it is my understanding that--\nand unless those amendments meet the very narrow germaneness rule--they \nmay be relevant to debate--but the germaneness rules are pretty tough \nso that unless we defeat cloture, we may not have an open amendment \nprocess.\n  I know the majority leader talked about an open amendment process, \nbut many of my colleagues--including this Member, who has additional \namendments I would like to have considered--will not be able to get \nthose amendments considered, if I understand it, Senator Boxer, unless \nthe cloture motion is defeated.\n  Let me talk for one moment about amendment 75, which I filed and is \npending, and I think is critically important.\n  What that amendment would do is allow our Governors and our county \nofficials to be able to get information about the risk to their \ndrinking water as a result of the potential spills on the aquifers. \nThis is not a hypothetical question because the Ogallala Aquifer, which \nis the country's largest underground freshwater resource, is crossed by \nthe proposed line of the Keystone. Therefore, it is of major concern to \nthe Governors and local officials what a potential spill could have \nwith regard to their drinking water supplies, to their communities. At \nsome of places the aquifer is within 5 feet of the surface. So a spill \ncould have a dramatic impact on the supply of safe drinking water.\n  As has already been pointed out by my colleagues in Michigan, in July \n2010 there was a pipeline rupture near Marshall, MI, that released \n843,000 gallons of tar sands oil. It had a horrific impact on the \nenvironment, and it is still difficult to see the end in sight because \nof the cleanup difficulties in this thick, tar sands oil.\n  On March 29, 2013, there was a pipeline rupture in Mayflower, AR, \nthat caused an incredible challenge to the cleanup.\n  So my amendment is pretty simple. My amendment would allow that \ninformation to be made available to our Governors and our local \nofficials so that they could then notify the President that they have a \nconcern on the route and allow that to be considered before the \npipeline is constructed, giving our local governments the opportunity \nto be heard--to have the information and then be heard on this very \nimportant issue.\n  My question to the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, is: If we are \ngoing to have an open amendment process, how can that be if the cloture \nmotion that was filed by the majority leader were to become approved? \nWouldn't that deny us that full, open amendment process that we had \nheard was going to be used in this Congress?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend for the question.\n  Again, we were promised an open amendment process.\n  I wish to make a point to my friend who has worked so hard on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. I am so appreciative of his \nwork. Do you know, if an amendment like yours does not pass, what it \nmeans is that American companies will be treated in a much harsher \nfashion than a Canadian foreign oil company--in other words, because \nthe other side is just saying: No more facts, no more information, no \nmore environmental impact statement--even though we know there are \nhealth impacts due to the tar sands.\n  The Senator has pointed out the possibility of having a bad impact on \ndrinking water. We have seen what has happened in West Virginia when we \ndon't worry about that.\n\n[[Page S453]]\n\n  So my friend is absolutely right, and I am honored that he asked me \nto comment on this particular amendment. And I hope that he will ask--I \nknow you are pending. I hope that you are going to get a vote on this \namendment one way or another.\n  I know some other colleagues may want to ask a question.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Would the Senator from California yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am pleased to yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. I thank the Senator.\n  From the start, let me say that Senator Boxer and I are not on the \nsame side on the principal bill. I have long been one of the staunchest \nsupporters of the Keystone XL Pipeline bill.\n  A lot of what we have heard today is about the consequences of aging \ninfrastructure. So the question I have for Senator Boxer is: Would it \nnot make sense, as we are talking about this Keystone XL Pipeline bill, \nthat we find common ground that we all should agree that we need the \nresources to have the regulatory authority and the regulatory personnel \nto go out and make sure that aging infrastructure--the infrastructure \nunderneath the Great Lakes and what happened now in the Yellowstone \nRiver--that we have a robust and very complete PHMSA organization that \nhas the personnel to go out and follow the pipeline, test the pipeline, \nand review the results? But even as important to me is PHMSA's role in \nmaking sure that our transportation of oil on the railroad is actually \nadequate, that we have adequate regulation.\n  So one of my amendments--not pending but filed--is, in fact, an \namendment that would address directly what I would hope would be common \nground for everyone in the Senate, which is making sure we are, in \nfact, regulating interstate pipelines.\n  I also wish to talk about how we have an ``all of the above'' policy \nthat everybody talks about where we somehow don't seem to get to that \npoint.\n  One of the amendments I have at the desk, which I would dearly love \nto call up and make sure that it gets a vote, is an amendment that \nwould provide a long-term--just 5 years--glide path for wind energy.\n  I think we have seen, as we have included this in the tax extenders, \nthis stop-and-go policy that has, in fact, not only put the companies' \nlives on hold but also their employees' lives.\n  I am hopeful. We don't know how the vote is going to turn out. No one \nknows until the vote is done, but I am hopeful that we will be able to \ncome back and introduce so many of these amendments that my colleagues \nhave advanced--some of which I agree with and some of which I don't.\n  But that is the nature of the Senate--that we actually have a vote, \nbecause I think, as a believer, I have good ideas but my ideas should \nhave a debate in the Senate.\n  But wouldn't the Senator agree that one common area that we all share \nis making sure that we have a robust regulatory environment to protect \nour waterways, to protect our farmers' soil from any leaks, and to make \nsure that any leaks, to the extent they are preventable, are prevented.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my colleague from North Dakota, of course, I \nagree with her. We don't agree on the tar sands pipeline, but we do \nlook for common ground, and she has found it. The importance of \ninspecting the infrastructure can't be overstated.\n  I say to my friend, before she leaves the floor, this is a picture of \na recent spill. Actually, it was 2013. It still has not been cleaned up \nin Arkansas because the pipeline burst--200,000 gallons of tar sands \nburst from the pipeline, and it spilled all over the streets of a \nsubdivision. Residents were exposed to high levels of benzene, a known \ncarcinogen, and hydrogen sulfite. They suffered from dizziness, nausea, \nand headaches--all classic symptoms of exposure to the chemicals found \nin tar sands.\n  Rainfall causes oil to float to the top of the soil and off gas. What \nis happening here is it still has not been cleaned up.\n  My friend has an amendment that would say: Let's inspect the \ninfrastructure to make sure things such as this do not happen. Of \ncourse, I support it. I hope she will vote her conscience and hopefully \nvote to keep this amendment process open.\n  I know my friend from Massachusetts has a question, and I yield to \nhim if he does.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. I thank the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator has to ask if I would yield for a question.\n  Mr. MARKEY. I thank the Senator. I thank the Senator for taking the \ntime to have this very important discussion in the Senate this \nafternoon.\n  This past Thursday night the majority leader decided they would not \nallow for a debate on an amendment I was propounding that would have \nimposed a tax on the Canadian oil as it is being transported through \nthis proposed pipeline. In the eventuality of an oilspill, the \nCanadians would have to have contributed to.\n  The majority did not make it possible for me to speak for even 1 \nminute on ensuring that the Canadians had to pay the tax in the event \nthere was an oilspill with their oil in the United States of America, \nwhile Americans would have to do so.\n  This is the question I am going to propound to the Senator from \nCalifornia. Right now we know that there is increasing carbon pollution \nin the atmosphere, which stacks the decks, increasing the chances that \nour country, our planet would draw an extreme weather joker that would \nhave catastrophic consequences for our country or for any other place \nin the world. We know that while no one storm can be attributed to \nclimate change, scientists agree there is an increase in the intensity \nand the frequency of extreme weather events. In fact, in the 2013 \nconsensus report bulletin of the American Meteorological Society said: \n``The number of severe regional snowstorms that occurred since 1960 was \nmore than twice the number that occurred during the preceding 60 \nyears'' in the United States of America. So my question to the Senator \nfrom California is: Shouldn't we be debating this issue of increased \nfrequency of snowstorms, of rain storms, of droughts, of extreme \nweather conditions? And isn't this something that Members should be \nallowed 1 minute, at least, to address, if not a full debate of these \nissues that have been triggered by the Republicans deciding they wanted \nto bring this bill onto the floor as their No. 1 priority for the year \n2015? Is that not the subject we should be discussing and should it not \nbe an open debate?\n  That is the question I propound to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would say in response to my friend's question, I was so \nshocked when the Senator asked for 1 minute to explain his amendment \nand we heard multiple Republicans saying: No, no, a thousand times no.\n  As Senator Durbin said, this is supposed to be the greatest \ndeliberative body in the world. I grew up thinking that was true. I \nnever saw this before where colleague after colleague after colleague \nafter colleague was essentially shouted down. I haven't seen it here.\n  It has reached a new low with a Republican majority since. They \nabsolutely won a huge election victory. There is no question about it. \nThere was the promise that it would be an open process, and then we \ncan't even have colleagues talk for 1 minute.\n  I know the Senator from New Jersey has a question as well. I yield to \nthe Senator from New Jersey, because time is running out at 5:30.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. BOOKER. I am grateful that Senator Boxer will yield for a \nquestion.\n  This is a question I have of Senator Boxer, and I wish to get her \nfeedback because of her years of experience, her wisdom, and her depth \nof understanding on this issue. I think there needs to be an amendment \nfor critical protection.\n  The need for regulation requires agencies to supplement already \nissued environmental impact statements when significant new \ncircumstances come about. When there is information about these new \nchallenges to the environmental impact of a project, something really \nhas to happen.\n\n[[Page S454]]\n\n  So this pending bill deems that the final environmental impact \nstatement issued last January would fully satisfy the NEPA, that this \nwould remove the obligation of permitting agencies to supplement that \nEIS if any new circumstance or information is discovered.\n  The amendment would change that and would preserve the obligation of \nagencies to supplement--if we had such an amendment, it could really \nprotect that.\n  I was told by a lot of people that NEPA is sort of referred to as the \nenvironmental modern day Magna Carta. In other words, it is such a \ncritical set of protections. If we have a circumstance in which there \nis a significant change in the pipeline--say they just decide to change \nthe direction or move it a little bit and it goes through an entirely \nnew area--not to be able to take into consideration new information, \nnew circumstances where an environmental impact statement abated, seems \nto be wrong. It actually seems to be giving this company, this foreign \ncompany, more information, more opportunity than our current American \ncompanies.\n  I would love for the Senator to comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Senator Booker should be proud of this contribution to \nthis debate and what he is doing in the environment committee.\n  Let me say quickly--because I know we are running out of time--here \nis the deal. You raised the golden standard--NEPA, the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act. The underlying bill says everything is \nsatisfied. All you want to make sure of in your amendment is that if \nthere is new information which shows this could harm the public--maybe \ncause more cancer, cause more asthma, and cause other problems--that we \nneed a supplemental EIS, that we need a supplemental study before we \napprove this pipeline. Right now, they are not letting you offer that \namendment.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, today we are voting to end debate on the \nKeystone Pipeline bill.\n  I want to be clear right from the start. I do not support this bill. \nI will vote against cloture and against final passage of the Keystone \nPipeline bill. And I am disappointed about the way it is being jammed \nthrough to a vote.\n  I supported the motion to proceed to this bill for one reason and \nonly one reason--because we were assured there would be an open \namendment process.\n  We started that process last week. We have worked back and forth \nbetween Republican and Democratic amendments. Many of those amendments \nare important. And I believe we should continue until every Senator who \nwants to amend this bill has had a chance to make his or her case.\n  I have an amendment for a renewable electricity standard which would \ncreate hundreds of thousands of 21st-century American jobs in my State \nand across the country. We owe it to all Americans to consider this and \nother amendments that would improve the bill.\n  The bill as it stands is not acceptable on many levels.\n  First, I am concerned that the new leadership chose to begin with a \nbill mandating a single pipeline for a foreign private company. This is \na questionable use of the Senate's time and an unprecedented piece of \nlegislation. Congress has never gotten involved in mandating a pipeline \nof this nature. But that is where we are. Now we are voting to cut off \ndebate. The majority leader moved last week--late in the night--to set \naside the Democratic amendments and bring an end to debate.\n  So we have a bill with a questionable beginning and a regrettable \nending. The result is a missed opportunity to seriously address the \nenergy needs of our country.\n  I said at the beginning of this debate that we are faced with a \nchoice, a profound choice. We can deny that our climate is warming. We \ncan fall behind our economic competitors. We can ignore the danger to \nour planet and to our security. That is one choice. Or we can move \nforward with a clean energy economy, with an energy policy that makes \nsense, that creates jobs, that protects the environment, and that will \nkeep our Nation strong.\n  We had a good debate on climate change during this bill about whether \nor not humans significantly contribute to it. Many Senators made it \nclear where they stand. Many agree that yes humans are significantly \ncontributing to climate change.\n  But while that is good for the record, it doesn't do much for the \nreality, because we have fallen short of taking any real action to \naddress this great challenge. In fact, we are now compounding the \nproblem by trying to pass this bill.\n  The bill lacks a comprehensive energy policy; it lacks even trying to \nset one. This is not a ``do it all'' energy bill. This isn't even a \n``drill, baby, drill'' bill. This is a ``drill, Canada'' bill.\n  I believe we should continue working on the bill to address serious \nclimate solutions, like a renewable electricity standard. The Keystone \nPipeline is an investment in doing things the old way--importing \nforeign oil. Instead of doubling down on foreign oil, we should be \ntalking about how we can move America forward by investing in the \nhomegrown energy of the future.\n  A national renewable electricity standard would combat global \nwarming, while creating hundreds of thousands of jobs across the \ncountry. It will help maximize our energy potential, while \nstrengthening our economy and our energy security.\n  Let's vote on that, and let's move forward to meet the real energy \nneeds of American families.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the \ncloture vote on S. 1, the Keystone XL Pipeline bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is entered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we are here this evening, after the \nconclusion of two cloture votes where we have failed to get the \nsufficient 60 votes that are required to cut off debate and move \nforward on this bill.\n  As the floor manager, I will be working with my counterpart on the \nenergy committee, Senator Cantwell, to define a list of amendments and \ndefine the universe we are talking about. Perhaps we can work toward an \nagreement that will allow for additional amendments to be processed and \nultimately allow us to get to passage of the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  This measure, S. 1, is a bipartisan measure that will work to create \njobs for this country and will not only help with our relationship with \nour friends and allies to the north but is also widely supported by the \nAmerican public. I am hopeful that what we will be able to do tonight--\nby working with colleagues--is to again define how we will get to the \nfinal resolution of this very important bill.\n  Last week we saw this measure include several important energy \nefficiency bills--including the adoption of the measure of the Senator \nfrom Ohio--particularly the one provision that relates to water \nheaters, which is very time sensitive. We were also able to add two \nsense-of-the Senate provisions to S. 1. One provision relates to the \noil spill liability trust fund and the other provision is related to \nthe issue of climate change.\n  Here we are, more than 2 weeks into debate on the Keystone XL \nPipeline, and we voted on a total of 24 amendments to the bill. We \nvoted on more amendments last week than we did in all of 2014. In fact, \nThursday was a long day for all of us. We moved out 15 amendments, and \nthat was as many as we had voted on in all of 2014. In 2014, this \nSenate voted on 15 amendments. This past Thursday, we voted on 15 \namendments in one day on this Keystone bill. We are now up to 24 \namendments, and we have made some progress.\n  I am very aware that not everyone is fully happy with where we are \nright now. We hit our first bump in the road--back to regular order--\nbut that is the way we have to roll with some things every now and \nagain. I hope we are at the point where we will be able to get back on \ntrack, a track that will allow for again closure of this very important \nmeasure.\n  I wish to remind Senators that we are in this place where we had to \nvote on cloture because we got to a point last week where a unanimous \nconsent request to vote on the then-pending 12 amendments was blocked. \nI will also remind colleagues that invoking cloture on a bill does not \nend all debate. We still have up to 30 hours of additional debate time \nleft, and during that time amendments that are germane to the \nunderlying bill can still be called up, considered, and voted on. We \nhave quite a few of those left.\n  In fact, at last count the amendments that have been filed to date--\nthere are 143 amendments that I have on my tally today that have been \nfiled. I don't know if that is a current, up-to-the-minute accounting. \nWe asked Members to have their amendments in by 3 this afternoon and \nsecond-degrees filed by 5 p.m. My point to colleagues is that there is \nstill much to be done with this bill if your interest is voting on \namendments.\n  I wish to repeat something that the majority leader commented on when \nwe came into session just a little bit ago. We were on this bill just 2 \nmonths ago, and at that time there was a grand total of zero amendments \nthat we voted on--zero. So now, as I mentioned, we have at least three \nthat have been incorporated into the bill already--two sense of the \nSenate, one on climate, one on the oil spill liability trust fund, and \none on energy efficiency. Again, there are some 140 to 150 amendments \nthat have been filed.\n  I am glad we have this process going on. I am glad to see these \namendments. For those who suggest that somehow or other the majority is \nclosing down the opportunity for debate or to offer amendments, all we \nneed to do is look where we were 2 months ago. Two\n\n[[Page S456]]\n\nmonths ago this bill had zero amendments. Fast forward to today, and we \nhave had votes on 24 amendments to this bill. We have adopted at least \n3 of those amendments, and again there are some 140-odd amendments that \nare out there.\n  I want us to get through this measure, and I wish to do so in a way \nthat is respectful to the process, respectful to Members, and that \ndignifies this institution. We have a lot out there, and I recognize \nthat.\n  I have had Members from both sides of the aisle ask me: How do I get \nmy amendment pending? How do I get it to the point so it can \nconsidered? We will be working on that issue tonight and into the \nmorning.\n  I thank my colleague from Washington because I do think we have truly \nbeen trying to work in good faith.\n  My colleague from North Dakota has a few words on the process, and \nthen I would like to reclaim my time for just a few more moments, if I \nmay.\n  With that, I turn the floor over to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I thank the bill manager on our side of \nthe aisle, the good Senator from Alaska, as well as the bill manager on \nthe Democratic side, the Senator from the State of Washington, for \nworking together and trying to get a list of all of the amendments and \ndo everything possible to get them scheduled for a vote.\n  I ask that Members on both sides of the aisle work with the bill \nmanagers to try and get a list of amendments so they can be scheduled \nfor a vote. As the Senator from Alaska said, we have already had at \nleast 19 amendments. We know there are more amendments that Senators \nwould like to have a vote on, and we appreciate and understand that. \nThere has been a real effort to try to get those votes scheduled.\n  Again, I thank the bill managers for their hard work and ask that \nMembers on both sides of the aisle work with the bill managers to try \nand get those amendments identified where they need to have a vote and \nget them scheduled so we can get to the votes in a timely manner so \nMembers can have as much information as possible ahead of time in order \nto consider their respective issues and have a vote.\n  We have to remember that in trying to go back to an open amendment \nprocess and regular order, there is some work on figuring out how to \nget that going and to do so in a bipartisan way, and of course we are \nworking through it on this legislation.\n  A final point: At the end of the day, we will be discussing more \nabout this legislation, but it comes down to how the individual Members \nof this body feel about this underlying legislation. It is about \nenergy, jobs, economic growth, and national security at a time when \nenergy security for our country is so very important. Again, this goes \nto the underlying merits.\n  Let's see if we can't get these amendments scheduled and vote on them \nand move this along as well as we can this week and get that done. It \nis not only important for this legislation, but we want to have that \nsame kind of open process with other legislation as well. It is about \ngetting the work done for the American people.\n  With that, I yield back to the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his \nleadership on this issue. He has been persistent, diligent, and very \narticulate as we have moved through the process, and I appreciate that \na great deal.\n  I thought I was going to be spending the vast majority of my time \nthis week going through each of these many amendments that Members have \npresented. As I mentioned, we have 140-plus amendments. But my \nattention on Keystone and the issues in front of us was dramatically \npulled away because of an announcement by the administration which I \nlearned of late on Friday evening, and which was the first announcement \ntoday.\n\n  The fact is I am not in a very good mood right now. I am not in a \nvery good mood, and I think it is probably true to say that most \nAlaskans are not in a very good mood, because folks back home woke up \nSunday morning to the news that this President effectively declared war \non our economic future in the State of Alaska.\n  I know those are pretty hard words. It has been suggested by some in \nthe administration that perhaps I am overreacting. Let me tell my \ncolleagues, when our economic opportunities as a State, which lie in \nour natural resources, are denied us as a State and the promises that \nwere made when we entered the Union--the compact we made--we are now \nnot able to see those promises, then there is nothing else. There is no \nother way to describe it than that it is a war on our economic future.\n  We have winter going on in Alaska right now. In my hometown where I \nwent to high school, I think it was about 30 below this weekend. Up on \nthe North Slope, temperatures are about 60 degrees below zero. It is \npretty cold.\n  The President, in his video where he made his announcement that he is \nmoving to put the Arctic Coastal Plain in de facto wilderness, \ndescribed the area in the North Slope as fragile, that the wildlife is \nfragile. I will tell my colleagues, the area in the coastal plain, the \narea in ANWR is an amazing place. It is a special place, as are so many \nplaces in Alaska. It is an amazing place. I am blessed to call it home. \nBut the President decided on Sunday that this was the perfect day to \nannounce his unilateral decision to manage the Arctic Coastal Plain as \nde facto wilderness.\n  Now the coastal plain--and I don't have my maps, but we are going to \nbe seeing a lot of maps of Alaska and ANWR coming up here. The coastal \nplain is the area on the very northern part of the State, and it is \npart of the nonwilderness portion of ANWR. People need to understand \nthat ANWR is a huge area. It is 19.7 million acres. It is an area the \nsize of the State of South Carolina. There are portions of ANWR that \nhave been designated as wilderness and they were designated as \nwilderness back in 1980, along with other areas in the State of Alaska \nthat were designated as wilderness. In fact, so much wilderness--close \nto 60 million acres of wilderness designated in 1980--so much so that \nthere is actually a provision in the law, in ANILCA, that says, that is \nenough. Alaska has given enough, in the sense that more than half of \nthe wilderness area in the United States of America is in Alaska. That \nis, Alaska has more than half of all of the other wilderness in all of \nthe remaining 49 states. Alaska has more than half. So the sense was \nthere will be no more wilderness declarations in Alaska. Yet, the \nPresident announces Sunday that, in addition to the coastal plain, \neffectively all of the balance of ANWR will be managed as wilderness.\n  So what does this mean to a State such as Alaska? Again, history is \ngoing to be important in this discussion going forward because the area \nin the coastal plain--the 1002 area--and it is designated as such \nbecause of a section in the law--the coastal plain was specifically set \naside in 1980 for further study of its oil and gas potential. So a \ndecision was made back in 1980 where we had more than 100 million acres \nin Alaska that were turned into Federal law, but it was recognized that \nthis area--that 1.57 million acres--was unique because of its resource \npotential. It was identified in law as such. And it said, We are going \nto reserve this. We are going to study it for its oil and gas \npotential.\n  Then, in the 1980s, the Reagan administration did just that. They \nstudied the coastal plain and they recommended that it be open to \nresponsible energy development. Ever since then we have been seeking \npermission to open up just 2,000 acres on the coastal plain for that \nvery purpose--for oil and gas exploration.\n  We are not talking about opening up the full coastal plain. We are \nnot talking about touching any of the area that was designated as \nwilderness in 1980. We are talking about a development that would have \nan impact on an estimated surface area of 2,000 acres in a 1.57-million \nacre area that has been set aside specifically for this.\n  So when we think about what that means, we learn that 2,000 acres is \n.1 percent of the entire 1002 area. It is .01 percent of ANWR. When we \nput it into context, 99.9 percent of ANWR would remain untouched if all \nwe were seeking to do was to access the 2,000 acres.\n  We also know that if we were able to access this small area within \nthe coastal plain that we can gain access to an\n\n[[Page S457]]\n\nestimated 10.3 billion barrels of oil. If we produce oil at that rate \nof 1 million barrels a day, it will last almost 30 years.\n  Right now we have an oil pipeline in Alaska, the Trans-Alaska oil \npipeline, which bisects the State 800 miles from the North Slope down \nto Valdez, and it has been doing a fine job of providing resource to \nthe country in an environmentally sound and safe manner. It is an \nengineering miracle. It is fabulous. What it lacks right now is more \noil in the pipe. We are less than half full. So the State of Alaska is \nbeing aggressive in looking for how we might not only fill up the pipe \nto help Alaska and to help the country and to bring about jobs and \nbring about revenues, but how we can do so in a responsible manner.\n  We think we have some pretty high standards in Alaska, and we need \nto. This is extreme environment. It is tough working there right now, \nlet me tell my colleagues. They don't shut down because it is cold. In \nfact, this is the only time of the year they can explore out there, \nbecause the environmental safeguards are such that we can't take \nexploration rigs out on the tundra in the summer where it might leave a \nmark. No. We wait until it is the coldest, the darkest, and the ground \nis frozen as far as it possibly can. So this is the time of year that \nwe are hoping to be able to do more.\n  But what this President is doing is not only saying no to that 2,000 \nacres we are seeking to access that will be bringing us a million \nbarrels a day, potentially, for 30 years and allowing for jobs and a \nresource--no to that 2,000 acres--he would say no forever. He would not \nonly say no to oil and gas development, but no to anything else. No \nroad, no airstrip, no nothing.\n  The President is saying the Congress has to make this decision, and \nin fairness, that is true. It is only the Congress that can make that \ndecision to convert the coastal plain to permanent wilderness. But the \nreality is he has made this decision, and he has made it without us. \nWhat happens under this comprehensive conservation plan--this CCP--this \narea is now immediately treated as wilderness, with or without our \napproval. So that designation may not be there, but how is it being \ntreated? It is being treated as wilderness.\n  I would assert this is in clear violation of the ``no more \nwilderness'' clause--the ``no more'' clause in ANILCA. It is so \nfrustrating. It is so infuriating to think that we acknowledged that \nsome 30 years ago, when ANILCA was passed, and that recognition--when \nso much of the State of Alaska was put off limits to any form of \ndevelopment, to place it in wilderness status and to have the Federal \nGovernment agree that we had done our part, that we had contributed \nenough of our lands.\n  The Presiding Officer is from a State that has wide open spaces. What \ndo we do as a State if we have so much of our State--66 percent of the \nState of Alaska that is federally held? And we all know there are \ndifferent aspects to Federal public lands. BLM lands mean something, \nPark Service means something, refuge status means something, and \nwilderness status means something else altogether. So when we \nacknowledged and the Federal Government acknowledged no more in Alaska, \nwe thought that would be respected. We thought that might be respected. \nBut, apparently, this President is going to choose to ignore it.\n  My colleagues can tell this is an argument and a debate I feel very \nstrongly about, and I feel very strongly about it because I have been \nliving with it my entire adult life. For as long as I can remember, we \nhave been talking about how might it be possible to look into these \nextraordinary reserves and resources that we know are in the 1002 area. \nThere have been highs and there have been lows. Back in 1995, when it \nwas my father and Ted Stevens who were working this issue, they were \nable to successfully get it through the Congress only to have it vetoed \nby President Clinton. And then 10 years later, it was Senator Stevens \nand myself who were able to get it so close; we were one vote shy in \nthe Senate. The House has passed ANWR, I believe Congressman Young told \nme today, on 12 separate occasions. Now we are back yet another 10 \nyears later. So maybe this is an issue that keeps coming back every 10 \nyears.\n  This wasn't the worst part of the news I was dealing with this \nweekend. At the same time I was given a heads-up that the \nadministration was going to be releasing this CCP--this comprehensive \nconservation plan that will treat ANWR as wilderness--I was told that \nwe are going to see the announcement of the administration's 5-year \nlease/sale plan. That is substantial for us. As folks know, we have \nbeen trying to advance the leases that have been sold in the Beaufort \nand in the Chukchi for some period of time, and it has been a tortured \nprocess, as many people know. But what we are told is that with the \nlease/sale that will be announced, portions of the Beaufort Sea and the \nChukchi Sea will be indefinitely withdrawn from the next 5-year plan \nfor the Outer Continental Shelf which, again, is due to be released.\n  I think it is important to know we have had deferrals off of our \ncoasts in the Beaufort and the Chukchi, but these are no longer going \nto be deferrals. They are going to be withdrawals, which means that not \nonly will they not be included in this lease sale from 2017 to 2022, \nbut they will stay in place until such time--it is an indefinite \nwithdrawal--as the next President, whoever he or she may be, should \ndecide to change it. It is different than a withdrawal.\n  What it then says to us is, okay, no, we are going to lock up ANWR \npermanently so that the resources that may be available to you--as much \nas a million barrels a day coming down through your pipeline to supply \nthis country--no, put that off limits, and, oh, the offshore you want \nto try to advance, we are going to make it a little more difficult \nbecause we are going to take these areas and we are not going to \ninclude them in this 5-year lease sale. In fact, we are going to \nindefinitely withdraw them.\n  This could have significant impact on our ability to access the \nestimated 23 billion barrels of oil of Alaska's North Slope. Again, \nwhen we are talking about how we are going to fill up that pipeline, we \nhave been working toward those opportunities offshore. But there is a \nthird gut punch to Alaska that is coming--a third.\n  Remember, all these were supposed to be unveiled this week. What a \nweek.\n  First, close off ANWR permanently.\n  Second, make the offshore that much more difficult.\n  And third is in the area where all those who said no to wilderness, \ngo over to the National Petroleum Reserve, that is where you should be \naccessing this oil. Well, okay, that is where folks are going. \nConocoPhillips is trying to access some leases in the National \nPetroleum Reserve. These are leases that were awarded in 1998, so more \nthan a few years to be working through all of the issues here.\n  What we learned was that the terms and conditions of the mitigation \nthat are going to be required by the Department of the Interior to \nallow Conoco to proceed with the alternative that would allow for a \nshort road to access the pad, those mitigation costs and other \nrequirements are going to be so much that the project will no longer be \neconomic.\n  Think about it. Years in the process and the permitting and the cost \nthat goes into it, years to get there.\n  I don't think most people know--do you realize how much oil is \nproduced on Federal lands in Alaska? It is a real easy answer because \nit is a big fat zero. There is none. There is no oil that is produced \non Federal lands. We have been trying to make it happen.\n  We have been going to the National Petroleum Reserve because we have \nbeen put off limits with ANWR. It hasn't been made permanent \nwilderness. We haven't been able to access it because that too takes \npermission from Congress. So the whole area where our State has these \nresources--these reserves, ANWR to the east, Beaufort, Chukchi \noffshore, National Petroleum Reserve--Alaska--what this administration \nis doing is saying this ``all of the above'' strategy for an energy \nplan for America, we are starting to think in Alaska that means \neverybody but Alaska.\n  I just can't articulate the anger, the frustration. As I tried to \nconvey my thoughts to the Secretary, I said, I am just not sure if this \nadministration doesn't care about Alaska and its people at all or \nwhether you even think of us. But I have come to the conclusion that \nthey still view us as a territory, a\n\n[[Page S458]]\n\nplace where you could come in and do what you will because you are a \nterritory. Well, we are not a territory. We are 1 of the 50 States. We \nare one of those stars on that flag. Last time I checked, we had just \nas many rights as any other star on that flag.\n  What is coming at my State and the arrogance with which this \nadministration is treating us is unacceptable, and it will not stand. \nEverybody wants to know, what are you going to do about it? What are \nyou going to do about it? I am going to make sure that people \nunderstand who we are, that people understand that there are human \nbeings who live in the 1002 area. You are going to take an area and \ndeclare it wilderness. People live there. Children go to school there. \nYes, we actually have a polar bear watch to make sure the kids don't \nleave their homes early in the morning to go to school when it is still \ndark, and there might be a polar bear out there.\n  Things are different in Alaska, but we still live there. We still \nwant a quality of life for the people that is not unlike what we would \nhave here. We don't want to have communities where we still have no \nsanitation facilities, where people are hauling their human waste in a \nbucket in the corner of the house and dumping it in a lagoon. We don't \nwant to be in that situation. But you know what, it seems as though we \nhave to get permission to do anything, and that permission is routinely \ndenied. Or if it is denied, they delay it indefinitely so that it adds \nto your cost.\n  We pay more for our energy. We pay more to keep warm in the State of \nAlaska than you do anywhere else. You might say, of course, it is \ncolder up there. You know, back here it is going to be cold in New \nYork. There is nobody in New York who is paying $10 a gallon for fuel \nlike the people in Kobuk are paying. There is nobody in Massachusetts \nwho is going to get hit by this storm and it is going to be cold and is \npaying $7.50 for fuel like the people in Fort Yukon are paying.\n  We live there because we want to live in Alaska. It is an amazing \nplace. We make a lot of sacrifices. But one of the sacrifices that we \nwon't make, one of the things we will not give up, is to be treated \nlike some second-class citizens, to be treated like a territory that \nhas no rights. So when we are full participants and we say there are \nspecial places in Alaska that should be wilderness--and we signed off \non that in 1980--then negotiate with us. Talk to us about what happens \nnext.\n  But I made the statement--again, it is harsh words, but I have \nsuggested that this administration is one that is willing to negotiate \nwith Iran, but they are not willing to negotiate with Alaskans. Those \ndays are over. Those days are over.\n  We have some issues to deal with in front of us right now as we move \nthrough the legislation in front of us. We have been focused on energy \nfor a good couple of weeks-plus now. I am glad of that. I am glad we \nare going to be able to work through a process where we can move \nthrough some of these amendments. But know that the words I have spoken \ntonight on the floor are words that come from my heart as an Alaskan.\n  This is not about politics. This is not about me being able to wield \nsome muscle because I have the gavel in the interior appropriations \ncommittee. This is about Alaska as a State and our rights as a State. \nThis is about a compact that was made with the State of Alaska, about \nhow we would be able to use and access our lands, how we would be able \nto care for the people who call Alaska home. This is pure passion that \ndrives my comments, and my comments will be echoed not only by the full \nAlaska delegation, as small as we are, but by our Governor, by our \nlegislature, by our elected officials, by people who live all around \nthe State, including the people who live in the coastal plain in ANWR.\n  This is serious, and Alaskans are going to take this very seriously. \nYou will be hearing a lot more from us.\n  With that, I thank my colleagues for the indulgence of time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. May I first inquire of the distinguished bill manager \nwhether I may take a moment to seek to call up an amendment or whether \nthey have present business they need to attend to on the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I was going to give some comments in addition to my \ncolleague from Alaska about the process and where we are and respond to \nsome of the comments she has made. If the Senator from Rhode Island \ncould wait a few minutes, is that possible?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Happily.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Point of inquiry: Do I understand that the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island wishes to make his amendment pending or just speak to \nthe amendment?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I simply wish to make my amendment pending, and at a \nconvenient time I would like to do that. There was a bit of an aura of \ngood feeling on the floor when the distinguished chairman of the energy \ncommittee and distinguished Senator from North Dakota were discussing \nan orderly approach for getting the amendments pending. Since then, we \nhave heard a good deal about frustration and anger and a bad mood, so I \nam not sure--maybe a little time to revert to that previous aura might \nnot be in order, but I am only seeking to get my amendment pending.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I do know the Senator from Washington \nand I were hoping to get a plan and a proposal for colleagues so that \nthey would better understand how we might proceed tomorrow. And because \nwe haven't had that opportunity to do that as of yet, I would like the \nchance to consult with Senator Cantwell here. My concern is that if we \nstart getting all these amendments pending right now before we reach \nsome kind of a path forward, it could get complicated.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Rather than face an objection to my unanimous consent \nrequest, I will defer it until the chairman and her ranking member have \na chance to go through that process, and I will come back at an \nappropriate time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island. We are here \ntonight because we haven't ended debate on the Keystone Pipeline bill. \nWe haven't ended debate because our colleagues voted to not end debate \non this important measure, and I think for good reason.\n  Our colleagues from both sides of the aisle got to offer amendments \nlast week, to discuss them, and have a chance to vote on them. I would \nsay this is a very different process from what happened in December, \nwhere basically an up-or-down vote was going to be given on a process.\n  So I am glad my colleagues--like from Michigan where they had a major \ntar sands spill in their State--who want to offer amendments on \npipeline safety can do so. I want my colleagues to be able to offer \namendments as it relates to security and safety, particularly when it \nrelates to safe drinking water and the issues of the pipeline.\n  Since this bill has been introduced, two major pipeline spills have \nbeen discovered. So just within the time we have been on this bill, 3 \nmillion gallons of brine spilled from a pipeline in North Dakota. That \nwas discovered on January 6, the same day we started with this bill \nbeing introduced.\n  On Friday North Dakota officials discovered that the contamination \nfrom the spill reached the Missouri River. So on January 17, 30,000 \ngallons of oil were spilled into the Yellowstone River, a different \nincident, from a pipeline that broke in Eastern Montana. It temporarily \nshut down drinking water services for 6,000 people in Glendive, MT. So \nyou bet these issues are important to me, and they are important to my \ncolleagues. I hope we do not have to rush through the process of having \na vote on these amendments. I think all of my colleagues see the \nThursday night event, where the discussion was, let's get four or five \namendments or six pending amendments and then coming back 1 hour later \nto table them is not the kind of legislative process we are used to \nhere.\n  I hope in the next couple of days my colleague and I can work on \nthese in a much more productive fashion, with the list of amendments \nthat Members want to offer and a timely way to debate them. Hopefully \nmy colleague from Alaska and I could actually work\n\n[[Page S459]]\n\nwith our colleagues, and either get some of them accepted or work for a \nvote schedule that would actually allow us to have the vote and have \nthe debate as opposed to tabling.\n  This Senator is not arguing that any side does not have a right to \ntable an amendment. I am simply saying: I think colleagues want to know \nwhat the process is going to be and whether they can discuss this.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a story that is \nabout one of those pipeline spills. It is about the Federal Government \nissuing warnings to the pipeline company in November about the concerns \nregarding those spills.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From EnergyWire, Jan. 23, 2015]\n\n          Feds Issued Warning to Pipeline Company in November\n\n                           (By Mike Soraghan)\n\n       Federal officials issued a warning late last year to the \n     owner of the Montana pipeline that contaminated a city's \n     drinking water for keeping poor records about the condition \n     of the system.\n       And the owners of the Poplar pipeline have had at least \n     seven pipeline spills since early 2008, records show, along \n     with other spills at production facilities.\n       Bridger Pipeline LLC officials say the warning letter from \n     the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration is \n     unrelated to the leak of 50,000 gallons of oil into the \n     Yellowstone River.\n       ``I don't believe there is a link between that letter and \n     what we're dealing with,'' said Bridger spokesman Bill \n     Salvin. ``That seems to be a difficult connection to make.''\n       A thick layer of ice on the river is hampering cleanup \n     efforts centered on Glendive, Mont., where the water \n     treatment plant was shut down after cancer-causing benzene \n     was detected in supplies.\n       Crews have recovered about 10,000 gallons of oil from the \n     rupture directly beneath the river, about 50 feet from the \n     south shore.\n       The spill's cause remains unclear, but oil sheens have been \n     reported as far away as Williston, N.D.\n       The warning letter last year resulted from a 2012 \n     inspection by federal officials. Chris Hoidal, director of \n     PHMSA's Western Region, wrote that the company had conducted \n     24 inspection digs for external anomalies, but then employees \n     failed to note the condition of the pipeline as required.\n       Salvin said that ``steps have been taken'' to address the \n     concerns laid out in the letter.\n       ``We take all requirements very seriously,'' he said.\n       Federal officials have undertaken another inspection in \n     connection with the record-keeping, in addition to the spill \n     investigation.\n       The warning came about six years after a spill that led to \n     a more serious enforcement action by PHMSA. The agency said \n     that the company failed to accurately update its reports on a \n     May 2008 spill from the pipeline.\n       In the same enforcement action, PHMSA charged that Bridger \n     failed to perform a pressure test on tubing installed at a \n     pipeline station in 2007 and 2008.\n       The agency also alleged that the company was too slow to \n     review its emergency operations manuals and failed to keep up \n     on inspections. The company paid a $45,000 fine.\n       This image was taken from a drone surveying the ice \n     slotting oil containment trench carved in the ice of the \n     Yellowstone River near Crane, Mont. Photo courtesy of Unified \n     Spill Command.\n       The company also paid a $100,000 fine in an enforcement \n     action brought in 2005 regarding the qualifications of its \n     personnel.\n       PHMSA inspections also led to two other enforcement actions \n     in September 2005 and February 2007 that did not lead to \n     fines.\n       Montana records show that Bridger Pipeline had two spills \n     in 2009, another in 2010 and a fourth in 2012. The total \n     released in the four spills was about 3,300 gallons of crude \n     oil.\n       In August, a gasket failure caused a Bridger pipeline to \n     spill about 4,000 gallons of crude in Mountrail County, N.D.\n       In addition, another company's 6-inch fuel line was broken \n     during excavation of a new pipeline by Bridger on Sept. 1, \n     2014, in McKenzie County, N.D. Dry natural gas was released \n     to the atmosphere, but inspectors noted that it could have \n     led to an explosion.\n       Bridger is part of Casper, Wyo.-based True Oil LLC. In May \n     2014, True's Belle Fourche pipeline ruptured, spilling 25,000 \n     gallons of crude oil into an ephemeral drainage near Casper, \n     according to federal records. The oil traveled about 3 miles \n     in the drainage.\n       True Oil's production operations have had at least 16 \n     spills since early 2009 in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and \n     North Dakota, according to state records. The largest was a \n     spill of more than 30,000 gallons of oil and wastewater in \n     2011 in Campbell County, Wyo.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. To me this is an issue where we have had some debate \nabout the pipeline and the oilspill liability trust fund. I would hope \nwe would come back to that issue because these issues about spills and \nsafety and security should be part of the debate. But I go back to the \nlarger issue which is I hope we turn down this legislation overall.\n  To me all of the issues we are talking about, whether it is about \nsafe drinking water, whether it is about oilspills and the requirements \non these companies or if it is about whether TransCanada can take U.S. \nproperty under eminent domain or whether it is about the route itself, \nall of these questions in my mind are premature for us, the Congress, \nto decide.\n  Over 60 percent of the American people say they want this pipeline \ndecided in a normal process. They want the State Department, in this \ninstance because it crosses a border, to be the entity that determines \nnational interest. So I do not want to predetermine that when there are \nso many important issues to be negotiated. The very company that wanted \nto negotiate with the State Department on this pipeline was negotiating \nsome of the original routing. Yet at the very time the State Department \nwas telling them the original routing would not work, they were here \ntrying to persuade Members to vote for the authority to override the \nPresident and to give that routing, which we now know was flawed.\n  I do not want to be premature about this. I do not want to be \npremature about cutting off debate. I want to get to these amendments \nbefore us and get the bill done with the input of my colleagues, given \nthat the debate was brought up to the floor.\n  If you ask me what I want to debate, I would be debating some other \nlegislation because I do not think this bill is going to be signed by \nthe President of the United States.\n  I would be debating energy tax policy on clean energy items. I would \nbe debating other things that I think would be impacting more our \nenergy strategy for the future, our economy, and job creation. I think \nthere are a lot of those out there. I hope my colleague from Alaska and \nI, once this debate is over with, will be able to sit down and talk \nabout these issues, in a bipartisan fashion, and work with the \ncommittee.\n  In 2007, we passed the Energy Independence and Security Act out of \nthe energy committee on a bipartisan basis. It was landmark legislation \nthat unleashed a lot of investment. It unleashed investment in making \nsure we had higher fuel efficiency cars in our country, which was good \nfor the consumer because they got a car that got more mileage. It made \ninvestments in things such as the smart grid and other energy \ninfrastructure.\n  I hope that is what we will get back to, because when I look at what \nis happening--I know my colleague from Alaska just talked about some of \nthese issues as it related to Alaska. I know she means what she says \nwhen she says she is speaking from the heart and working hard for \nAlaskans. I visited Alaska with her and my colleague, then-Senator-\nfrom-Alaska Mark Begich. I visited many parts of Alaska.\n  I understand. Alaskans want to have an economic opportunity. They \nwant their energy to be cheaper. I would say I am empathetic to the \nissue because we have five refineries in the State of Washington. We \nare the fifth largest refining State in the Nation. A lot of our oil \ncomes from Alaska. So I can tell you that people in the Northwest are \nfurious that even though we have those refineries--so a lot of refining \ncapacity and the oil comes from Alaska--we still have some of the \nhighest gas prices in the Nation. Many times we have asked for various \ninvestigations about why we have the highest gas prices in the Nation \nand why this issue continues to plague us.\n  I know my colleague, when she speaks about the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge or ideas about more drilling, that it is about getting \nmore oil supply. But more oil supply from Alaska has not helped \nWashington consumers have cheaper gasoline prices.\n  So I want to continue to diversify our economy off of fossil fuels \nand onto other things. I hope we will get a chance to work on an energy \nbill that does that. If I could just address for a couple of minutes \nthe issue of the President's decision to move forward on a plan that \nwould help preserve the Arctic wildlife refuge as wilderness. My \ncolleague from Alaska mentioned this issue is something that has been \ngoing on for some time. She is right.\n  The predecessors that she and I--the former chair of the energy \ncommittee, Scoop Jackson, and the former late Senator Ted Stevens--\neverybody has\n\n[[Page S460]]\n\nbeen a part of this. I actually was here at a pretty dramatic floor \ndebate on this issue in 2005, in which some people wanted to open the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge for drilling, even to the degree that \nthey put that as a rider on the Defense bill. We were able to stop \nthat. I think that was the will of Congress, that they did not want to \nsee drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  But we have had this discussion since 1960, when Dwight Eisenhower \nset aside originally 9 million acres, and in 1980, thanks to the work \nof Scoop Jackson, Congress passed the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act, which expanded the refuge to 19 million acres.\n  I have visited the refuge. I do believe it is a critical habitat for \nwildlife and the Gwich'in people who called this the sacred place where \nlife begins. It is truly special. I do think we have had many \ndiscussions about this. This action probably will not be the last of \nthem, but I do applaud the President for taking the Arctic refuge, \nwhich is habitat for 45 different species of land animals, 36 different \nspecies of fish, 180 species of birds--and has the greatest variety of \nplant and animal life of any park or refuge in the polar Arctic. I do \nbelieve it is an ecosystem and an ecosystem that is unlike anything \nelse we have in the United States.\n  So I am proud the President has taken what has been a refuge that was \nlacking a plan and has now put a wilderness plan in place or the \nelements of what it will take to preserve those various species and \nanimals and that very special place.\n  I know my colleague feels very strongly about the President's \nannouncement. I think a refuge plan that is based on science and public \ncomment--we have had a plan, but this is the first plan to say we are \ngoing to protect this area. It recommends 12 million acres of refuge, \nincluding the coastal plain as wilderness. It is one of the most \npristine and unique public places.\n  I am confident America can meet our energy needs without opening the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge. I am convinced we can come up with an \nenergy strategy that is much more compelling for the future of the \nUnited States, one in which we can lead and one in which we can help \nother countries, whether it is what the President did with China in \ngetting an agreement or working with India or all the things we are \ndoing to try to be a leader in what is energy efficiency and ways to \nimpact the marketplace so consumers can look for cleaner, more \nefficient uses of fuel.\n  So this is going to be a continuing debate in this Congress between a \n19th century view of energy policy and a 21st century view of energy \npolicy. I would ask my colleagues to think about these countries the \nPresident has just recently visited. He went to China. No one thinks \nChina's air standard is what we should have in the United States. India \nhas had its own challenges. They have hundreds of millions of people \nwho are without electricity needs.\n  So the question is whether these sources of energy are going to be \nthat solution, whether a dirty source of fossil fuel is going to be the \nsolution or whether we can work together on cleaner energy solutions. I \nthink we can do that.\n  In fact, I am excited the United States can be a leader in these \ntechnologies, which will result in more job growth, just as those \nprevious energy bills did when we worked together for higher fuel \nefficiency standards, for more energy efficiency, to come up with more \nsources of diversified fuel. I am very confident we are going to, in \nthe next few years, usher in a new era of aviation.\n  We have already proven we can fly airplanes with a 50-50 drop in jet \nfuel. We now have to prove we can manufacture those large sources and \nget planes flying on that. What a great accomplishment that will be in \nreducing carbon emissions and giving the flying public and those \nairlines something that is much more affordable than what we have been \ndealing with for the last 10 or 15 years.\n  I look forward to my colleague and I working tomorrow--some tonight \nand a little bit starting early tomorrow--on how we move forward with \nthis legislation. I know my colleague and I see a path forward. Similar \nto any two people who are trying to manage a bill on the floor, we also \nknow we have all of our colleagues to work with because nothing in the \nSenate operates unless it operates through our process and working \ncollaboratively or, I should say, it can work, it is just going to take \na very long time.\n  So we pledge to work in the next few days to try to get an amendment \nprocess that will not be prematurely cut off after 1 hour of a pending \nbill but will come to terms, and hopefully our colleagues will work \nwith us to limit the number of those amendments and we can move forward \nto legislation that we think will help our economy grow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize the remarkable \nstrength and spirit of the Central Illinois Xpress basketball team and \nits coach Tariq Toran.\n  As the only team of girls in an all-boys fifth grade basketball \nleague in Springfield, IL, the Central Illinois Xpress has defied the \nodds and emerged as a powerhouse in the Illinois AAU boys' league. With \nan impressive record of 8 wins and 2 losses in the first half of the \nseason, Coach Toran and the Central Illinois Xpress girls have made a \nname for themselves not just back at home, but across the Nation.\n  Strong, confident, and determined, the team comprised of nine girls \nages 10 and 11 years old do not shy away from hard work and tough \ncompetition on the basketball court. With a series of two-on-one drills \ncoupled with push-ups and sprints, these girls know how to practice \nhard and play hard. The Xpress girls use their summers to compete in a \nhigher division comprised of older girls, which helps prepare them to \nplay against tough teams during the season.\n  This tireless preparation and fearless attitude brought Coach Toran \nto sign the girls up for the all-boys' league this year. So far, the \nteam's success has been undeniable. With their dribble drives, crisp \npasses, and methodical game play, the Central Illinois Xpress players \nhave racked up more than enough wins to show the boys, and the \ncommunity, that they are a force to be reckoned with this season.\n  These girls know what it means to push themselves for excellence, to \nfight for something against the odds, and to prove themselves to those, \nincluding some of the boys they are playing, who don't expect a girls \nteam to be strong and play smart, aggressive ball.\n  It is my pleasure to wish these fifth-grade girls in Springfield the \nbest of luck in the second half of this season.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/26/senate-section/article/S460-3", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S460-S461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING THE VERMONT STATE POLICE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, it is a delight to call the Senate's \nattention to an outstanding Vermonter who was recently recognized for \nhis work to help Vermonters who have struggled with social and economic \ninjustice.\n  Since 1997, the Burlington Free Press has invited readers to nominate \na Vermont resident to be recognized as Vermonter of the Year. Those \nnominated are among the best doers and visionaries the Green Mountain \nState has to offer, and each nominee has made a difference in his or \nher community. Previous winners have included philanthropists, college \npresidents, a former Governor and a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. On \nthe eve of the New Year, the Burlington Free Press named Hal Colston \nthe 2014 Vermonter of the Year.\n  Hal is a resident of Winooski and certainly deserves this honor. \nSince relocating to Vermont 25 years ago, Hal's dedication to social, \neconomic, and racial justice has served his community well. He has \nmaintained a steadfast voice for those unable to be heard on their own.\n  Hal is well known for his entrepreneurial spirit, and he has \nsuccessfully created and led numerous nonprofit initiatives. In \nannouncing Hal's selection, the Free Press aptly calls him a ``serial \ndo-gooder.'' He received national recognition after founding Good News \nGarage, which enables individuals and families to move away from \npoverty by providing reliable transportation. Similarly, he recognized \nthat those in poverty are often without the support networks necessary \nto move beyond such vulnerable circumstances. As a result, he \nestablished NeighborKeepers, an organization that focuses on building \nsupportive community networks that direct families toward the resources \nthey need to succeed. Today he leads the Partnership for Change, a \ndiverse group of community stakeholders seeking to remodel the \nBurlington and Winooski School Districts by establishing a student-\ncentered learning system.\n  As communities work to overcome the challenges of poverty and \nindividuals pursue more prosperous lives for themselves and their \nfamilies, it is the passionate dedication to serve by leaders such as \nHal Colston that makes the greatest difference.\n  In recognition of Hal Colston's service, I ask unanimous consent that \nAki Soga's article from the December 31, 2014, edition of the \nBurlington Free Press be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Dec. 31, 2014]\n\n                   Vermonter of the Year: Hal Colston\n\n       You might call Hal Colston a serial do-gooder.\n       The Winooski resident has laid down a track record of work \n     to improve the lives of people in the community during his \n     25-year tenure in Vermont.\n       Colston is best known as the founder of Good News Garage, \n     the nonprofit that fixes donated vehicles for low-income \n     people.\n       He also is known for launching NeighborKeepers, an \n     initiative to help families in need build relationships with \n     those who can provide the support they need.\n       He was instrumental in forcing Vermont to confront the \n     issue of racial profiling by the police.\n       Colston says he sees every day as an opportunity to make a \n     difference.\n       ``We get them one at a time with no guarantee for \n     tomorrow,'' he said. ``May all of us spend our days wisely to \n     improve the common good.''\n       Colston's understated demeanor often belies his passion. He \n     works to give voice to those who are unable to be heard on \n     their own. He has shown the courage to tackle difficult \n     issues.\n       Colston's quiet devotion to bringing the people together \n     and looking out for those who find themselves in unfortunate \n     circumstances especially stand out in a year that saw the \n     streets of this country fill with protest--both peaceful and \n     violent--against injustice.\n       For his years of service to the community in the name of \n     social and economic justice, the Burlington Free Press \n     editorial board names Hal Colston 2014 Vermonter of the Year.\n       In nominating Colston for Vermonter of the Year, Laban Hill \n     of Winooski writes, ``Hal has spent his life devoted to our \n     community and making a difference in both small and large \n     ways.''\n       Colston's work with Good News Garage has earned him \n     national recognition, including an appearance on the Oprah \n     show. The idea is simple. For many, one of the bigger \n     barriers to economic independence is the lack of reliable \n     transportation. Good News Garage tackles that problem in the \n     most direct way possible by awarding reliable cars to those \n     in need.\n       Colston founded the organization in 1996 after meeting a \n     Lutheran minister he had heard in Philadelphia shortly before \n     moving to Vermont. That chance encounter led to developing an \n     idea and seed funding from what he calls a pan-Lutheran \n     organization. He launched the nonprofit under the wing of the \n     Lutheran Social Services New England.\n       Nearly two decades later, Good News Garage has awarded more \n     than 4,000 vehicles.\n\n\n                             second career\n\n       His career in community service also includes a stint as \n     associate director of Community Action in Burlington, now \n     Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity, as executive \n     director of the Vermont Commission on National and Community \n     Service and as diversity coordinator for the social services \n     nonprofit HowardCenter.\n       Colston also spoke out clearly and firmly when African-\n     Americans in the community charged that local police were \n     using racial profiling in stops.\n       In an April 2007 My Turn piece in the Free Press, Colston \n     wrote, ``I believe that racial profiling in Vermont is an \n     epidemic,'' going on to recount his own experience with \n     ``driving while black.''\n       Colston did more than complain. He worked to open a \n     dialogue within the community, including the police, that \n     allowed people to talk openly about issues surrounding race.\n       ``We're building trust,'' he said. ``I don't believe we \n     will ever eradicate racism, but how do we heal from the \n     wounds?''\n       All this was a major shift for a man who had made a career \n     as a chef and restauranteur in Philadelphia, and arrived in \n     Vermont in 1989 to become the director of catering at the New \n     England Culinary Institute in Essex.\n       Colston called his career change a midlife crisis, but said \n     the work put him in touch with his core values, ``truth and \n     justice.''\n       Today, Colston is engaged in what is perhaps his biggest \n     challenge to date. He serves as director of Partnership for \n     Change, a collaboration between the Burlington and Winooski \n     school districts. The mission is to re-imagine public \n     education to better prepare students from diverse social, \n     economic and cultural backgrounds to succeed in school, in \n     their careers and as members of their communities.\n       ``The reason I love Vermont is it's got its challenges. But \n     it's really on a human scale. You can have a conversation,'' \n     he said.\n       For his steady faith in the ability of each person to make \n     a difference, and putting that faith to work in the service \n     of his community, Hal Colston is the 2014 Vermonter of the \n     Year.\n\n\n                          a nominating letter\n\n       I would like to nominate Hal Colston for Vermonter of the \n     Year.\n       Hal is director of Partnership for Change, which is \n     remodeling Burlington and Winooski school districts by \n     establishing a student-centered learning system that enables \n     all learners to develop skills, knowledge, and relationships \n     necessary to become confident, motivated, and self-sufficient \n     learners who are successful in college and careers and are \n     engaged in their communities.\n       Hal and his team are changing the way education is \n     delivered in our communities so that it is more rigorous and \n     more equitable.\n       Over the years Hal has been an integral and essential part \n     of our community. He founded Good News Garage, which is one \n     of the first nonprofit social enterprise car donation \n     programs in the U.S. He also founded NeighborKeepers, which \n     was a community nonprofit that helped the generational poor \n     become financially secure.\n       Hal has spent his life devoted to our community and making \n     a difference in both small and large ways. He seems like the \n     ideal candidate for the Burlington Free Press's Vermonter of \n     the Year. In addition, there has never been a person of color \n     who has been recognized as Vermonter of the Year. It's about \n     time.\n\n[[Page S462]]\n\n       There are so many people of color in Vermont who are making \n     important contributions to our community. Now is the time to \n     begin recognizing them.\n     Laban Hill,\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/26/senate-section/article/S462-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LORENZO GOCO\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute and thank a \ndedicated and capable individual, Lorenzo Goco, who retired from the \nSenate on Friday after 20 years of expert service.\n  For the past 6 years, Lorenzo has served as the deputy staff director \nof the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, SSCI. He has worked on \nthe committee since 1995, when he was brought over by Senator Bob \nKerrey. He has seen the highs and the lows of Senate life, and has made \na valued contribution to the committee, to the Senate, and to the \nnational security of the United States.\n  Since the beginning of my chairmanship of the committee in 2009, \nLorenzo has been the heart of the Democratic staff. Without drawing \nattention to himself, he has gotten things done--whether it meant \nsetting the schedule and wrangling agency witnesses to attend on short \nnotice, assisting the intelligence community to see the wisdom of the \ncommittee's approach, or bridging the divide between the majority and \nminority in the rare case of disagreement, Lorenzo kept the committee \non track and headed in the right direction.\n  As the deputy staff director, Lorenzo is responsible for everything \nbut gets the credit for nothing. He has represented the SSCI at the \nweekly meeting of Democratic staff directors more often than the actual \nstaff director, and he has had my full faith in representing the \ncommittee and me countless times. Often, a line of committee staffers \nwill build in front of his door as people seek his advice on how to \nhandle an issue or ask a question about a program.\n  Classification prevents me from relating on the Senate floor most of \nthe projects that Lorenzo has contributed to or overseen in his time on \nthe committee staff. But they include numerous reviews of CIA covert \nactions, reviews of acquisition programs by the National Security \nAgency and the National Reconnaissance Office, and the budget review of \nthe Defense Intelligence Agency.\n  Due to CIA's declassification of the underlying information, I can \nsay that Lorenzo was part of the committee's excellent work in \ninvestigating CIA's role in a shootdown of a missionary plane in Peru. \nHe was instrumental in the committee's report on the prewar \nintelligence assessments of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, and a \nconstant force behind the staff's work on the Study of CIA's Detention \nand Interrogation Program.\n  The committee's success in enacting six intelligence authorization \nbills in the past 6 years is in good measure a result of Lorenzo's work \nin drafting the legislation and the classified annexes the contain, \nworking with other committees in the Senate and the House, and \nnegotiating provisions with the executive branch.\n  There are plenty of congressional staff that are passionate advocates \nfor aggressive action for this cause or that. Other staff focus on \nprotecting their boss and as a result are more judicious and \ndeliberate. Some are experts on process; some are experts on substance. \nLorenzo is all of the above. His depth of experience on intelligence \nmatters is unparalleled today in the Senate. He fights strongly for \nwhat he believes in, and has at times pushed me to be stronger on a \ncause than I might otherwise be. But he is always cool, calm, and \ncollected, and manages to navigate the buffeting winds and tempestuous \ntimes that we face all too often.\n  I am sorry to see a key part of my team go, but I wish Lorenzo the \nbest of luck. I have no doubt that he will have more time to spend with \nhis wonderful wife Audrey and his three boys, whom I know are the \nsource of unending pride, and perhaps the occasional bout of parental \nfrustration. With any luck, they'll grow up like their father.\n  Thank you, Lorenzo, for your steadfast service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/26/senate-section/article/S462-2", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S462-S463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RESTORING FULL TIME TO FORTY HOURS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nmy remarks from last week's Senate Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee hearing be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Restoring Full-Time to Forty Hours\n\n       Let me start by telling some stories of what's happening in \n     Tennessee:\n       In Murfreesboro, Tennessee, Middle Tennessee State \n     University has started limiting hours for part-time workers. \n     This means students can no longer accept multiple on-campus \n     work assignments. And graduate assistants might have to wait \n     tables instead of picking up extra on-campus grant-funded \n     research projects that would better further their careers.\n       From its headquarters in Knoxville, Regal Entertainment \n     Group, the nation's largest movie theatre chain, announced \n     last year that it was cutting employee hours from 40 to below \n     30 in order to comply with Obamacare. According to a news \n     report, ``One Regal theatre manager [said] the move has \n     sparked a wave of resignations from full-time managers who \n     have seen their hours cut by 25 percent or more.''\n       In Johnson City, Pam Cox, the director of finance for \n     Johnson City Public Schools, told a local news outlet about a \n     year ago that her district will have to hire more people to \n     work fewer hours. She said, ``It'll be challenging to find \n     people and it'll also hurt the employees because where \n     they've been able to work as much as they wanted in these \n     types of positions with no benefits attached to it now we're \n     going to be saying, `we can't let you work . . . even though \n     you want to and you're good at your job, we can't give you \n     the hours, give you the pay, because we can't afford to give \n     you the insurance.' ''\n       So why are these things happening in Tennessee--and in \n     every other state across the nation?\n       Obamacare requires businesses with 50 or more full-time \n     employees to provide health insurance to those employees or \n     pay a penalty at tax time. That penalty is $2,000 for each \n     employee whom the government says should have been covered by \n     an employer plan and $3,000 for every employee who receives a \n     subsidy in the exchange.\n       The law, passed without any Republican support, defined \n     full-time as an employee who works more than 30 hours a week. \n     It is a strange definition--one that sounds more like France \n     than the United States.\n       The average American between the ages of 25-49 works 8.8 \n     hours per day, or 44 hours per week, according to the \n     American Time of Use Survey published by the Bureau of Labor \n     Statistics.\n       The Obamacare definition of full-time is nearly one-third \n     lower.\n       Many businesses can't afford Obamacare's mandate and must \n     reduce their number of full-time employees.\n       The result of all this is that thousands of workers are \n     getting a pay cut. Their work schedules are being reduced to \n     29 hours a week and below.\n       This is not enough money for these workers to earn a \n     living. Many must take second jobs.\n       A Hoover Institution study found the 30-hour definition \n     puts 2.6 million working-age Americans with a median income \n     under $14,333 for individuals and $30,000 for families at \n     risk of losing jobs and hours. The study found:\n       89 percent of those affected don't have a college degree.\n       60 percent are between the ages of 19 and 34.\n       63 percent of those most at risk of lost hours are women, \n     of which half have a high school diploma or less.\n       These are Americans who are often working one of their \n     first jobs, trying to work their way up the economic ladder. \n     You have to start with a lower-paying job, a job that doesn't \n     require as many skills, and hope that someday your hard work \n     will lead to a higher-paying one.\n       Many of these Americans are working in service industries, \n     such as hospitality, retail and restaurants. But the \n     Obamacare provision is affecting all kinds of employers.\n       In September 2014, Investor's Business Daily reported that \n     at least 451 employers, county governments, public schools, \n     community colleges and universities across the country have \n     laid off staff or reduced employee work hours to comply with \n     the new Obamacare definition of full time.\n       Our public schools can't charge higher prices to cover \n     these mandates. They have to cut services like special \n     education, coaches and bus drivers.\n       Three surveys published by Federal Reserve Banks in August \n     found employers are increasing their proportion of part-time \n     workers.\n       The Federal Reserve Banks of New York and Philadelphia \n     specifically asked manufacturers what changes they had made \n     because of Obamacare, and in both cities, nearly 1 in 5 \n     respondents reported that they had increased their proportion \n     of part-time workers.\n       The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta also surveyed \n     businesses about changes in part-time employment and found \n     that 25 percent of respondents currently have a higher share \n     of part-time workers primarily because ``full-time employee \n     compensation costs\n\n[[Page S463]]\n\n     have increased relative to those of part-time employees.'' \n     More troubling is that 31 percent of respondents believe they \n     will have more part-time workers 2 years from now.\n       There is bipartisan support for repealing this provision. \n     This bill has 34 cosponsors--mostly Republicans, including \n     every Republican member of this committee--but Senator \n     Donnelly and Senator Manchin of West Virginia, also a \n     Democrat, support it.\n       Republicans have talked a lot about wanting to repair the \n     damage of Obamacare. We have also talked about wanting to get \n     results.\n       This bipartisan bill should be an important step to doing \n     both.\n       In fact, this reminds me of why so many of us like being on \n     this committee--because the issues we work on affect so many \n     Americans.\n       When we talk about fixing No Child Left Behind, we're \n     talking about 50 million children in 100,000 public schools.\n       When we talk about making it simpler to apply for a Pell \n     Grant to go to college, we're talking about simplifying a \n     form that 20 million families fill out each year.\n       When we talk about modernizing the Food and Drug \n     Administration and making it easier for Americans to access \n     lifesaving drugs, we're talking about something that affects \n     nearly every American.\n       But today we are focused on 2.6 million Americans who are \n     mostly low-income and at risk of losing jobs and hours.\n       I look forward to hearing what our witnesses have to say.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/26/senate-section/article/S463-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO COMMEMORATE THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE RELEASE OF THE IRAN \n                                HOSTAGES\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON.

Next week, the Senate Banking Committee is meeting to consider \nperspectives on the strategic necessity of Iran sanctions that will \nfurther the debate. I, for one, welcome that important discussion, \nalthough I recognize that some of my colleagues hold views that are \ndifferent from my own on how best to contain Iran.\n  There is, however, yet another important policy matter related to \nIran that not only deserves but also demands the unified, bipartisan \nsupport of every Senator. Thirty-four years ago today, January 20, \n1981, 52 of our fellow American citizens returned home after a \nharrowing 444-day ordeal of being illegally held hostage in Iran. We \nsent these diplomats, Foreign Service personnel, along with officers \nand enlisted members of our Armed Forces, to Iran in service to our \nNation as they were seeking only to strengthen ties between our two \ncountries. There was even an American businessman involved. \nNevertheless, they all paid dearly for this service by being forced to \nendure humiliating treatment, brutal interrogations, mental and \nphysical torture, and even mock firing squad executions while their \nfamilies suffered endless waiting and genuine fear of their loved ones' \nimminent demise.\n  Although their return was a joyous occasion for our entire Nation and \nwe celebrated as one people honoring our heroes, those 444 days took a \ntoll not only on the hostages but also on their family members--a toll \nthat continues for many to this day. Unfortunately, we failed to \nrecognize both the long-term impact their incarceration experience and \nill treatment would have on many of them and the support they would \nneed. In many instances, the results have been tragic. Among the former \nhostages and their families, there have been suicides, advanced PTSD-\ntype depression, divorces, alcoholism, and drug dependency. \nUnfortunately, Phil Ward, a communications officer from Virginia who \ncommitted suicide in the fall of 2012, was one who never fully \nrecovered from the cruelty of those events.\n  We must help to ease this burden and provide these brave Americans \nwith the same measure of justice and healing our courts have already \nawarded to other hostage victims and their families. While the Algiers \nAccords, the document which secured the release, bars the former \nhostages and their families from legal action against Iran for the \nbrutality they endured, to this day they remain not only the first \nvictims of modern hostage-taking but the only Americans barred from \nseeking justice from Iran. The former hostages and their families have \nalready waited more than three decades to experience the full support \nof the government they so heroically served and to see some \naccountability by their captors. Therefore, I will soon introduce \nlegislation to compensate the hostages and their families by assessing \npenalties on those who continue to do business with Iran in violation \nof U.S. sanctions policy. This legislation, however, represents but one \nsolution to an issue that is three decades overdue. Another or perhaps \nan additional option would be to strongly recommend that as a condition \nof the ongoing nuclear negotiations, such compensation come directly \nfrom ``frozen'' assets that for more than a year now have been released \nto Iran at the rate of $700 million a month.\n  Accordingly, I look forward to righting this injustice by working \nwith any or all of my colleagues as we stand united in support of the \nformer hostages and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/26/senate-section/article/S463-2", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S463-S464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PENN STATE UNIVERSITY WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the Penn State \nUniversity Nittany Lions Women's Volleyball program for winning the \n2014 National Collegiate Athletic Association, NCAA Championship.\n  Led by four returning starters and legendary coach Russ Rose, the \nPenn State University Nittany Lions concluded the 2014 season by \ndefeating the Brigham Young University Cougars in straight sets to win \nthe NCAA Championship. The Nittany Lions finished with a record of 36 \nwins and only 3 losses.\n  With the 2014 championship, the Nittany Lions have claimed six of the \nlast eight NCAA Championships and seven overall in women's volleyball, \nsetting the record for the most women's volleyball championships by a \nsingle program in history.\n  The 2014 Nittany Lions Women's Volleyball team brought together a \ngroup of student-athletes who excelled both on the court and in the \nclassroom. For their efforts on the court, four Nittany Lions were \nselected to the AVCA Division I All-America team, with Senior Micha \nHancock earning both First-Team All-American honors and becoming the \nfourth Nittany Lion in program history to earn AVCA DI National Player \nof the Year honors.\n  Special congratulations go to Junior Megan Courtney who was selected \nas the 2014 NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player and to Freshman Ali \nFrantti, who earned AVCA DI National Freshman of the Year honors.\n  Not to be outdone in the classroom, six Nittany Lions earned spots on \nthe Fall Academic All-Big Ten list for their academic performances this \nseason.\n  Today I want to recognize the significant contributions that the Penn \nState University Women's Volleyball team has made to collegiate \nathletics and to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania with Coach Russ Rose \nat the helm. I wish them all the best as they continue to lead by \nexample for student-athletes everywhere and set the stage for the \nprogram's continued success into the future.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, today the United States ranks 12th in the \nworld in the percentage of 25-34 year olds achieving post-high school \ndegrees. We need to make changes that help keep students engaged in \ntheir futures while also ensuring our educational programs are \nadequately preparing students for the jobs of the 21st century.\n  Career and technical education, CTE, programs are proven to help keep \nstudents more engaged in the classroom and less likely to drop out of \nhigh school, and to help meet the needs of high-growth, skill-intensive \nindustries looking for the next generation of workers. The U.S. \nDepartment of Education announced that the average U.S. high school \ngraduation rate is 80 percent, while the graduation rate for students \nin CTE concentrations is higher than 90 percent. 81 percent of high \nschool dropouts say real-world learning opportunities would have kept \nthem in school.\n  The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act is a major \nsource of Federal support for the development\n\n[[Page S464]]\n\nof career and technical skills among secondary and postsecondary \nstudents. Last reauthorized in 2006, the Carl D. Perkins Career and \nTechnical Education Act needs to be modernized to meet the demands of \nthe 21st century workforce and ensure that students have access to the \nhighest-quality CTE programs.\n  This is why I am pleased to introduce with my colleagues, Senator \nPortman and Senator Baldwin, the Educating Tomorrow's Workforce Act, \nwhich would amend the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education \nAct to raise the quality of CTE programs. This legislation defines what \nconstitutes a rigorous CTE curriculum and requires Perkins grant \nrecipients to incorporate key high-quality elements in their programs \nincluding credit-transfer opportunities; academic and technical skills \nassessments; training tools that align with today's industries; CTE-\nfocused professional development for teachers, administrators, and \ncounselors; and CTE curriculum alignment with local, regional, and \nState workforce demands. Additionally, the bill improves links between \nhigh school and postsecondary education to help ease attainment of an \nindustry recognized credential, license, apprenticeship, or \npostsecondary certificate to obtain a job in a high-demand career field \nand promotes partnerships between local businesses, and other community \nstakeholders to create pathways for students through work-based \nlearning opportunities.\n  When I was Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, I worked on a \nnumber of educational issues, but one that I was most proud of was \nstarting the Governor's Career and Technical Academies. At the start of \nmy term as Governor we had nine academies. The Republican Governor who \nfollowed me continued the academies, and at the end of his term there \nwere 23. The Educating Tomorrow's Workforce Act encourages these models \nand allows states and localities to use Perkins grant funding to \nestablish CTE-focused academies.\n  I am proud to introduce this commonsense, bipartisan legislation to \nraise the quality of CTE programs and ensure that high-quality career \nand technical education helps students develop skills that meet the \nneeds of 21st century employers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/26/senate-section/article/S464-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    REMEMBERING DALTON VERNON MARTIN\n\n Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I wish to honor the memory and \nservice of Dalton Vernon Martin, chief petty officer, U.S. Navy, \nRetired, and sherriff's deputy, East Baton Rouge Sherriff's Department, \nwho passed away 4 years ago, on January 23, 2011. Mr. Martin devoted \nhis life and career to the service of others which was evident in his \ncombined 61 years of military and civil service to our great Nation and \nthe Baton Rouge community.\n  Born in St. Francisville, LA, Mr. Martin first excelled as a high \nschool boxer, compiling a record of 63 victories in 65 bouts. He \ndedicated that resolve and fighting spirit towards serving and \ndefending his country, enlisting in the U.S. Navy to fight in World War \nII and the Korean war, including the Pacific battles of the Gilbert and \nMarshall Islands, Tarawa, and Okinawa. Mr. Martin served onboard the \nUSS Charleston, USS Taswell, and the USS Indianapolis.\n  After a distinguished 38-year career in the Armed Forces, Mr. Martin \nretired from active duty and embarked on a new mission of service as a \ndeputy of the East Baton Rouge Sherriff's Office. Here, Mr. Martin \nspent 23 years protecting his fellow citizens and upholding the rule of \nlaw.\n  Mr. Martin lived a life of service, but he never sought to label \nhimself as the hero he truly was. He spoke honestly and openly about \nthe fear and sadness that are inseparable from the glory and honor of \nserving in combat. He was grateful for the opportunities afforded by \nhis service to visit the farthest reaches of the world, but he served \nfor no other reason than to defend his country and one day return home \nto his beloved Louisiana.\n  If the measure of a person is by what they leave behind, then Mr. \nMartin sets a standard to which we should all aspire. His life's story \nis yet another testament to the strength and legacy of the ``greatest \ngeneration.'' And for his wife Christy, his children Paul, John, and \nSusan, and his grandchildren Erin, Tristan, Madeleine, Jack, Lauren, \nand Caroline, his spirit and legacy live on. The country he helped to \npreserve as the greatest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the \nworld remains forever grateful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/26/senate-section/article/S464-2", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MATTHEW J. WATTS\n\n Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I wish to honor Pastor Matthew \nWatts, a dear friend and a truly inspiring West Virginian whose \nministry career spans more than three decades.\n  I have personally known Reverend Watts for many years now, and he \ntruly embodies what it means to be a great West Virginian. He is a man \nof deep conviction and unwavering passion for justice. He is an \nuplifting force to many and a role model to many more.\n  I have known Pastor Watts for many years, and as the former Governor, \nthe reverend would visit often and bring me his thoughts, suggestions, \nand ideas. I always appreciated his sincere candor and genuine interest \nin improving our state.\n  As a native of Mount Hope, located in beautiful Fayette County, \nPastor Watts currently serves as senior pastor of the Grace Bible \nChurch of Charleston. He is a graduate of the West Virginia Institute \nof Technology with a bachelor of science in civil engineering, which \nled to a 20-year career with the Union Carbide Corporation. His \ntheological study and training from the Moody Bible Institute of \nChicago and the Christian Research and Development Center in \nPhiladelphia, combined with his years of experience in corporate \nAmerica, have blessed him with a vitally unique perspective on economic \ndevelopment.\n  In December of 1996, he left Union Carbide to pursue his ministry and \nfocus on community service projects. A year later, he established the \nHOPE Community Development Corporation, a nonprofit organization with \nthe mission of empowering inner-city communities through spiritual \nrenewal, education, employment training and economic development.\n  With this perspective, he developed Kingdom Management Consultants, \nwhich assists minority owned businesses with startup and expansion, as \nwell as provides supportive strategies to those seeking employment.\n  His active community involvement has truly set the standard in West \nVirginia throughout the years. Much of his community service is still \ndone through the HOPE Community Development Corporation, which now has \na branch specifically for youth.\n  Reverend Watts always amazes me with his unique ability to relate to \nstrangers. While he is strong in stature and his voice is so \ncommanding, his approach is dynamic, sincere, and composed.\n  His years of unwavering service and leadership have certainly not \ngone unrecognized. In 1996, he received the West Virginia Small \nBusiness Administration's Small Business Advocate of the Year Award. In \n2002, Pastor Watts was awarded the Washington Times Foundation \nLeadership Award for Faith Based Organization of the Year. He was also \nthe 2004 recipient of the Crown of Peace Award for Exemplary Leadership \nin Reconciliation and Peacemaking from the Inter-religious and \nInternational Peace Council.\n  Pastor Watts is a strong leader, mentor, and friend to so many within \nWest Virginia. It takes a truly remarkable individual to accomplish so \nmuch in community service. Particularly now, having just celebrated Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr. Day and as we near Black History Month, it is \nfitting that we should celebrate such an inspiring individual as Pastor \nWatts. His community service programs have empowered countless minority \ngroups within our State and are sure to continue the tradition of \nexcellence for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/26/senate-section/article/S464-3", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S464-S465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n[[Page S465]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/26/senate-section/article/S465-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/26/senate-section/article/S465-2", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:33 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 7.

A bill to aid and support pediatric involvement in reading \nand education; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce with my colleague, Senator \nGrassley, the Prescribe a Book Act I thank Senators Markey, Stabenow, \nand Warren for joining us as original cosponsors of this bipartisan \nbill.\n  Literacy skills are the foundation for success in school and in life. \nDeveloping and building these skills begins at home, with parents as \nthe first teachers. Children who are read to frequently at home are \nmore likely to become frequent readers themselves in later years. \nIndeed, according to Scholastic's Kids and Families Reading Report, \namong children ages 6-11, 60 percent of frequent readers, those who \nread 57 days per week for fun, were read to aloud by a parent 5-7 times \nper week before they entered kindergarten. This highlights the \nimportant role that parents play in building their children's literacy \nskills.\n  To help support the parental role in literacy, the Prescribe a Book \nAct would create a federal pediatric early literacy grant initiative \nbased on the long-standing, successful Reach Out and Read program. The \nprogram would award grants on a competitive basis to high-quality \nnonprofit entities to train doctors and nurses to discuss with parents \nthe importance of reading aloud to their children and to give books to \nchildren at pediatric check-ups from 6 months to 5 years of age, with a \npriority for children from low-income families. It builds on the \nrelationship between parents and medical providers and helps families \nand communities encourage early literacy skills so children enter \nschool prepared for success in reading.\n  I was pleased to see last year that the American Academy of \nPediatrics, AAP, recognized the important role that pediatric providers \nplay in enhancing children's literacy skills In a policy statement, AAP \nrecommended that pediatric providers promote early literacy development \nfor children from birth to at least kindergarten entry, including by \ncounseling parents on the importance of reading to their children and \nthrough providing age-appropriate books to high-risk, low-income young \nchildren.\n  Evidence shows that that the pediatric literacy model works. Research \npublished in peer-reviewed, scientific journals has found that parents \nwho have participated in the Reach out and Read program are \nsignificantly more likely to read to their children and include more \nchildren's books in their home, and that children served by the program \nshow an increase of 4-8 points on vocabulary tests. I have seen up \nclose the positive impact of this program on children and their \nfamilies when visiting a number of Rhode Island's Reach Out and Read \nsites. Building on existing efforts, which in the past have been \nsupported by Federal funding included in the appropriations process and \ndistributed by the Department of Education, and matched by tens of \nmillions of dollars from the private sector and State governments, the \nPrescribe a Book Act would establish a formal authorization modeled on \nthis type of successful public-private partnership. By so doing, it \nwould leverage Federal dollars to expand pediatric literacy initiatives \nso that more young children reap the developmental benefits of having \nbooks at home and being read to by their parents.\n  I urge our colleagues to join us in cosponsoring the Prescribe a Book \nAct, and to work to include its provisions in the upcoming \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN:\n  S. 252.

Res. 40\n\n       Whereas any acquisition by the Government of the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran of a nuclear weapon would pose a grave \n     threat to international peace and stability and the national \n     security of the United States and United States allies, \n     including Israel;\n       Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran is a \n     leading state sponsor of terrorism, continues to materially \n     support the regime of Bashar al-Assad, and is responsible for \n     continuing and gross violations of the human rights of the \n     people of Iran;\n       Whereas, since 2006, the United Nations Security Council \n     has adopted multiple resolutions demanding an end to the \n     Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran's illicit nuclear \n     activities and Iran's full cooperation with the International \n     Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regarding its nuclear program and \n     international commitments;\n       Whereas the United States Government has led the \n     international community in imposing costly economic sanctions \n     against the Islamic Republic of Iran, which have contributed \n     to the decision of the Government of the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran to return to the negotiating table and provided leverage \n     to press Iran's leaders to agree to end Iran's illicit \n     nuclear activities;\n       Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran \n     entered the present negotiation with the five permanent \n     Member States of the United Nations Security Council, plus \n     Germany (the ``P5+1''), having previously violated its \n     commitments under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \n     Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, London, and Moscow July \n     1, 1968, and not complied with multiple United Nations \n     Security Council Resolutions;\n       Whereas the Joint Plan of Action, also known as the interim \n     agreement, was entered into by the P5+1 and Iran on November \n     24, 2013, in order to facilitate good faith negotiations \n     toward a final comprehensive agreement that prevents Iran \n     from developing a nuclear weapon;\n       Whereas, under the Joint Plan of Action, the Government of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran has ceased enrichment of near-20 \n     percent uranium gas, eliminated its stockpile of near-20 \n     percent uranium gas, halted significant construction \n     activities at the Arak nuclear reactor, halted the \n     installation of additional centrifuges and not operated its \n     most advanced centrifuges to accumulate enriched uranium, \n     agreed to more intrusive international inspections of its \n     enrichment sites and provided managed access to its \n     centrifuge assembly workshops, centrifuge rotor production \n     workshops and storage facilities, and uranium mines and \n     mills;\n       Whereas the International Atomic Energy Agency concluded in \n     a January 20, 2015, report that Iran has not enriched uranium \n     above 5 percent at any of its declared facilities, has not \n     made ``any further advances'' to its activities at the Natanz \n     and Fordow fuel enrichment plants or the Arak reactor, and \n     has continued to provide managed access to uranium mines and \n     mills, daily access to the enrichment facilities at Natanz \n     and Fordow, and managed access to centrifuge assembly \n     workshops, rotor production workshops, and storage \n     facilities;\n       Whereas the P5+1 and Iran have extended the terms of the \n     Joint Plan of Action and have set a target date for reaching \n     a political framework agreement by the end of March 2015 and \n     a deadline of July 1, 2015, to reach a final comprehensive \n     agreement, including relevant technical annexes;\n       Whereas, in a public speech on January 12, 2015, United \n     States Permanent Representative to the United Nations \n     Samantha Power stated that, ``increasing sanctions would \n     dramatically undermine our efforts to reach this shared goal \n     . . . of getting Iran to give up its nuclear program'';\n\n[[Page S469]]\n\n       Whereas, during a press conference on January 16, 2015, \n     Prime Minister David Cameron stated that, ``it's the opinion \n     of the United Kingdom that further sanctions [against Iran] \n     or further threat of sanctions at this point won't actually \n     help to bring the talks to a successful conclusion and they \n     could fracture the international unity that there's been, \n     which has been so valuable in presenting a united front to \n     Iran'';\n       Whereas, during a press conference on January 16, 2015, \n     President Barack Obama stated, ``On Iran, we remain \n     absolutely committed to ensuring that Iran cannot develop a \n     nuclear weapon. The best way to achieve that now is to create \n     the space for negotiations to succeed. We should not impose \n     further sanctions now; that would be counterproductive and it \n     could put at risk the valuable international unity that has \n     been so crucial to our approach.'';\n       Whereas any final comprehensive agreement with the \n     Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran must prevent Iran \n     from developing a nuclear weapon in any manner;\n       Whereas any final comprehensive agreement with the \n     Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran must allow for the \n     prompt reimposition of sanctions if the Government of the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran fails to comply with the final \n     comprehensive agreement; and\n       Whereas Congress retains the sole authority to repeal \n     statutory sanctions against the Government of the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     Senate--\n       (1) reaffirms that it is the policy of the United States \n     that the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran will not \n     be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon and that all \n     instruments of United States power and influence must remain \n     on the table to prevent this outcome;\n       (2) supports the ongoing diplomatic efforts of the United \n     States Government and the members of the P5+1 countries to \n     reach a comprehensive agreement with Iran that prevents Iran \n     from acquiring a nuclear weapon;\n       (3) affirms that support for the prompt reimposition of \n     suspended sanctions as well as the imposition of additional \n     sanctions against Iran would be strong and widespread in the \n     Senate in the event--\n       (A) negotiations fail to achieve a comprehensive agreement;\n       (B) Iran violates the Joint Plan of Action; or\n       (C) Iran violates any final comprehensive agreement on its \n     nuclear program;\n       (4) agrees that future new sanctions against Iran may \n     include measures further targeting Iran's energy, financial, \n     and strategic economic sectors, and its foreign currency \n     transactions, as well as the designation of additional \n     Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran officials linked \n     to its illicit nuclear program and sanctions evasion; and\n       (5) supports the universal rights and democratic \n     aspirations of the people of Iran.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/26/senate-section/article/S469-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 41--CONGRATULATING THE NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY \n    FOOTBALL TEAM FOR WINNING THE 2014 NATIONAL COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC \n     ASSOCIATION DIVISION I FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP SUBDIVISION TITLE\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN (for himself and Ms. Heitkamp) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING CLIMATE CHANGE.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) Congress is in agreement with the opinion of virtually \n     the entire worldwide scientific community and a growing \n     number of top national security experts, economists, and \n     others that--\n       (A) climate change is real;\n       (B) human activities contribute to climate change; and\n       (C) climate change has already begun to cause problems in \n     the United States and around the world;\n       (2) the Energy Information Administration projects that \n     fossil fuels could continue to produce 68 percent of the \n     electricity in the United States through 2040; and\n       (3) it is imperative that the United States invest in \n     research and development for clean fossil fuel technology.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 146.

Mrs. SHAHEEN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed \nto amendment SA 2 proposed by Ms. Murkowski (for herself, Mr. Hoeven, \nMr. Barrasso, Mr. Risch, Mr. Lee, Mr. Flake, Mr. Daines, Mr. Manchin, \nMr. Cassidy, Mr. Gardner, Mr. Portman, Mr. Alexander, and Mrs. Capito) \nto the bill S. 1, to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline; which was \nordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       After section 2, insert the following:\n\n     SECTION __. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING GREEN BUILDING \n                   PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) The U.S. building sector consumes nearly 40 percent of \n     the nation's energy.\n       (2) Investments in building efficiency are among the most \n     cost-effective, energy-saving measures the federal government \n     can deploy to save money for taxpayers, families and \n     businesses, grow the domestic economy, create jobs, reduce \n     emissions and make the United States more energy secure.\n       i. The State Energy Program converts every dollar of \n     federal finding into $7.22 in energy cost savings, according \n     to a study by Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The study also \n     found that for every $1 of State Energy Program federal \n     funding, the program leverages $10.71 in state and non-\n     federal funds.\n       ii. The Weatherization Assistance Program saves low-income \n     families up to 22.9 percent on their home energy costs.\n       iii. From 2009 to 2011, the Federal Energy Management \n     Program arranged energy savings performance contracts that \n     leveraged almost $1.2 billion in private-sector investment to \n     save the federal government and taxpayers more than $3.5 \n     billion in energy and water costs.\n       iv. A 2012 analysis of federal appliance and equipment \n     efficiency standards prepared by the American Council for an \n     Energy Efficient Economy and the Appliance Standards \n     Awareness Project found that federal efficiency standards \n     already established would save consumers about $27 billion in \n     2010, increasing to $61 billion in 2025.\n       (3) Federal building energy efficiency programs related to \n     the construction and operations and maintenance of buildings \n     play a key role in cost-effectively reducing energy and water \n     waste in both the private and public sector.\n       (4) Reducing energy and water use in buildings requires a \n     network of federal programs that strategically target \n     different segments of the diverse building sector and use a \n     variety of approaches.\n       (5) The Government Accountability Office report, entitled \n     ``2012 Annual Report: Opportunities to Reduce Duplication, \n     Overlap and Fragmentation, Achieve Savings, and Enhance \n     Revenue'' recommends enhanced coordination between agencies \n     to increase effectiveness of complimentary programs. This \n     report did not find any specific instances of program \n     duplication and it did not recommend the elimination of any \n     green building programs.\n       (b) Sense of Congress--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       1. The federal government successfully employs a variety of \n     federal green building programs to address the complex \n     challenge of reducing energy and water waste in buildings.\n       2. Federal green building programs save U.S. families, \n     taxpayers and businesses energy and money, boost domestic job \n     creation and strengthen the U.S. economy.\n       3. The federal government should encourage enhanced \n     coordination between agencies, State and local governments, \n     tribes and the private-sector to increase continued \n     effectiveness and avoid unnecessary duplication of federal \n     green building programs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 148.

FINDINGS AND SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (referred \n     to in this section as ``LIHEAP'') is the main Federal program \n     that helps low-income households and senior citizens with \n     their energy bills, providing vital assistance during both \n     the cold winter and hot summer months.\n       (2) Recipients of LIHEAP assistance are among the most \n     vulnerable individuals in the country, with about 90 percent \n     of LIHEAP households having at least one member who is a \n     child, a senior citizen, or disabled, and approximately 20 \n     percent of LIHEAP households including at least one veteran.\n       (3) The number of households eligible for LIHEAP assistance \n     continues to exceed available funding, with current funding \n     reaching just 20 percent of the eligible population.\n       (4) The average LIHEAP grant covers just a fraction of home \n     energy costs, leaving many low-income families and senior \n     citizens struggling to pay their energy bills and with fewer \n     resources available to meet other essential needs.\n       (5) Access to affordable home energy is a matter of health \n     and safety for many low-income households, children, senior \n     citizens, individuals with disabilities, and veterans.\n       (6) Funding LIHEAP at $4,700,000,000 annually would ensure \n     that more low-income households, households with children, \n     senior citizens, individuals with disabilities, and veterans \n     can meet basic home energy needs.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that LIHEAP should be funded at not less than $4,700,000,000 \n     annually.\n       (c) Date of Enactment.--This section takes effect on the \n     day after the date of enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 157.

Mr. President, I come to the floor this evening to speak \nabout our ongoing debate about the Keystone XL Pipeline and the need \nfor this debate to shift to a much larger conversation.\n  Tonight, as we are continuing in what has been 1\\1/2\\ weeks of debate \nin our Senate about this single, foreign-owned pipeline, it is my hope \nthat we will begin a larger, broader conversation about America's \nenergy and climate needs.\n  We have so far voted on amendments confirming that climate change is \nreal, on the future of natural gas and oil exports, on energy \nefficiency provisions, on rules to ensure that we buy American, and on \nfunding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the oilspill fund.\n  I, myself, have an amendment, No. 115, that I am hoping we will have \na chance to take up, debate, vote on, and pass--one that recognizes \nthat given that the Senate has acknowledged the reality of climate \nchange, we must now move forward to take action to prepare to adapt to \nthose changes--changes that have already begun.\n  I come from the State of Delaware, the lowest mean-elevation State in \nAmerica, where our Governor, Jack Markell, has led a community-driven \nprocess of preparing for adapting to the coming impact on our \ninfrastructure--our public, private, State, local, and Federal \ninfrastructure in Delaware.\n  We have to recognize that our Federal Government will have financial \nliabilities to help State, local, and tribal governments prepare for \nthe impacts of climate change on their infrastructure and to prepare \nfor the impacts of climate change on our Federal infrastructure.\n  My amendment, I hope, will be taken up, debated, and passed, but the \nlarger point I want to make is this is just the beginning of the much \nlarger debate we need to have about our Nation's energy and climate \nfuture.\n  Energy has long been and will remain central to a strong, diverse, \nand vibrant economy for our Nation. Throughout our history, Americans \nhave benefited greatly from abundant sources of energy at home. From \ncoal to oil to natural gas, we have been blessed by natural resources \nthat have powered our economy. But new challenges today require new \napproaches. As human-generated greenhouse gas pollution wreaks havoc on \nour global climate, we need to come together to create a cleaner and \nlower-carbon energy future.\n  There is no single pathway to stop climate change or to deal with it, \nbut there are a number of approaches we need to look at and that I hope \nwe will consider taking.\n  Tonight I wish to briefly mention four different areas where there \nwere bipartisan bills in the last Congress--areas that I hope, in the \nspirit of comity and debate in the Senate, we could reconsider and make \nthem part of this broader energy and climate debate.\n  First, we could start by establishing and implementing a national \nquadrennial energy review which would ensure that every administration, \ncurrent and future, takes a hard look at our Nation's energy landscape, \nthe challenges that we face, and to build a blue print for how we will \ndeal with these challenges and overcome them.\n  Today we already conduct these kinds of quadrennial reviews for the \nPentagon, for the State Department, and for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. They allow us to take a big picture and strategic look at our \npolicies, our challenges, and to chart a predictable, longer term path \nforward.\n  It is time we did the same for our country's energy challenges. This \nadministration is already at work doing this, but Congress needs to act \nto ensure that future administrations will continue this practice.\n  Second, we can invest in clean and renewable energy and in energy \nefficiency technology so that we can out-innovate the rest of the world \nand lay the groundwork for job creation, not only for today but for \ntomorrow. We can do this through sustained, annual program funding and \nthrough smart and innovative financing models that lower the cost of \nclean energy, such as expanded master limited partnerships.\n  Third, we can improve the way our national labs collaborate with the \nprivate sector so that the innovation pipeline that takes ideas from \nthe lab to the market is smooth, efficient, and predictable so that \ntoday's discoveries are tomorrow's world-changing products.\n\n[[Page S489]]\n\n  And, fourth, we can improve STEM education and skills training \nthroughout America so that every day we are training tomorrow's future \nenergy innovators.\n  We can do this. We need to do these things.\n  I will admit that at times it can seem quite daunting. But in this \ncountry we should have no doubt that if we focus our greatest minds on \nthese challenges, there is no limit to what we can achieve. The bottom \nline to all this is that we don't have a choice. Pretending otherwise \nis an exercise in denial.\n\n  We need to curb emissions from transportation. We need to reduce \npollution from powerplants. We need to better finance clean energy \nsolutions. We need to strengthen our infrastructure so we are more \nresilient in the face of coming climate challenges. We need to address \nthe real challenges of energy and water demand. We need to improve our \nregulations so that we do more to protect and conserve our land. And we \nneed to invest in research, development, and the demonstration of new \nand innovative technologies. Overall, we can and should institute smart \nand market-based regional and national policies that will lower carbon \npollution and send businesses and households the signal that the future \nis in cleaner not in dirtier energy technology.\n  We need to do all this and bring the rest of the world along as well \nbecause our national energy and climate challenges are not just ours, \nthey are the world's, and we need to come together around the world to \nget this done. The administration's clean power plan rules and the \nrecently announced accord with China are all great initial steps in \nthis direction. It is my hope as we continue this debate that we will \ncome together in the Senate to show we are willing to rise to these \nchallenges as a nation as well.\n  Mr. President, for me, all of this ultimately comes down to our \nobligations--yes, of course, to our Nation, to our constituents, to our \nhome States, but particularly as parents to our children and to future \ngenerations. Every day when I get to return home from the train station \nafter taking what is often a late-evening train from Washington to \nDelaware, I get to see my family, and it is my children who leave me \nmost concerned about the question of whether I will be leaving them a \nsafer and healthier world than we received.\n  My daughter Maggie in particular is passionate about the environment \nand is concerned about whether what we do here is not just helping to \ncreate jobs today--although that is an important issue for us to turn \nto--but whether we are helping to preserve our world for tomorrow. \nMaggie helps keep me focused not just on this quarter, this month, this \nelection, or this term, but on the next 50 years and on whether what we \ndo here leaves to our children and their children a cleaner and a \nbetter and brighter future. That is what our focus should be--on the \nfuture, on what we are doing not just for today but for tomorrow and \nall the days after that.\n  I hope when the debate about this one pipeline is over we will \nrefocus our energies on the bigger picture and on the great and big \nchallenges we face together. That is what we get elected to do, and \nthat is what our time demands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/26/senate-section/article/S489-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S489-S490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a few minutes \nabout our Nation's economic relationship with Africa and one area of \nconcern I have as we work toward further strengthening our ties.\n  Since its passage under President Clinton, the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act, known as AGOA, has been a powerful tool for increasing \ntrade and boosting economies across the African Continent, and no \ncountry has taken greater advantage of the opportunities provided \nthrough AGOA than South Africa.\n  Over the past 4 years, as the chairman of the African Affairs \nSubcommittee of the Committee on Foreign Relations, I have worked \nclosely with African leaders and know the importance of AGOA to their \neconomies and to their growing middle classes. Just last week I met \nwith a group of African trade ministers who emphasized to me how \nimportant prompt reauthorization of AGOA is to them, to their nations, \nand to tens of thousands of men and women who work in reliance upon \nAGOA.\n  AGOA is not a partisan issue. I have worked closely with my \nRepublican colleague and friend from Georgia Senator Isakson on its \nreauthorization. But, as I have also long believed, trade must be fair, \nand with increased trade comes a responsibility by both parties to play \nby the same set of rules.\n  I am concerned because I fear that South Africa's refusal to drop its \nantidumping duties that prevent American poultry from having free and \nfair access to the South African market will have negative \nrepercussions for our relationship and South Africa's economy.\n  Much of the time, nations will use antidumping duties to prevent \nother countries from exporting artificially cheap goods into their \neconomies, putting their own businesses at an unfair disadvantage. But \nwhat South Africa has done for years in this area lacks any merit. They \nare using the same justification that China has used to ban American \npoultry imports. They claim our poultry is being sold below market \nvalue. Not only is this claim false, the World Trade Organization \nrecently deemed China's nearly identical ban to be illegal.\n  American companies want the chance to sell healthy, affordable, and \nsafe poultry to South Africa and at a fair market value. So during the \nAfrica leaders summit last August, which brought the heads of state of \nmore than 50 African nations here to Washington and to our Capitol, I \nhad the opportunity to meet with President Zuma of South Africa as well \nas other South African senior officials. During our meeting we \ndiscussed their country's policies toward our country, the importance \nof renewing AGOA, and also my concerns about their unfair practices \nwith regard to our poultry industry. I was optimistic that following \nour constructive conversations, we could work together with them and \nwith South Africa's poultry industry to get rid of this inappropriate \ntrade barrier. In September we also had constructive meetings where our \nAmbassador and their Ambassador were present, and leaders of both \npoultry sectors began constructive conversation. But soon thereafter \ntheir willingness to engage abruptly stopped. They apparently think \nthey can continue to benefit from AGOA and shirk their most basic trade \nresponsibilities.\n  In my home State of Delaware the poultry industry supports more than \n13,000 jobs and has long been the backbone of our agriculture sector. I \nhave made clear to our friends and partners in South Africa that \nalthough I deeply believe in their nation's promise and future, my \nfirst responsibility is and always will be to my home State and my \nconstituents. Across the country--and Senator Isakson's State of \nGeorgia is the single biggest poultry-growing State in the country--the \nUnited States supports 1.8 million American jobs, contributing more \nthan $470 billion to our Nation's economy.\n  So I want to be clear about this tonight, as I have been before. I \nsupport AGOA's reauthorization, and I hope we can negotiate a fair path \nforward. But South Africa cannot expect to continue to reap the \nbenefits of increased trade without following fair trade rules. They \ncan't expect us to open up our markets wide to duty-free and quota-free \naccess for South African goods if they will not fairly open theirs. If \nthey insist on maintaining their longstanding and illegal antidumping \nduties on American poultry, I will do everything in my power to ensure \nthey do not continue to benefit from AGOA. The choice is theirs.\n  Senator Isakson of Georgia and I communicated this concern to \nPresident Zuma back in December in writing, and this week we will write \nto the Senate Finance Committee with the same message. We only have a \nshort period of time where we can get a long-term extension of AGOA \ndone, and I will work hard to reauthorize and improve AGOA so its \nbenefits are even more widely felt on the continent of Africa, but I \nwon't allow it to include countries that violate fair trade rules, \nwhich means an important ally and partner of the United States--South \nAfrica--won't be included if they are not willing to play by the rules. \nThere\n\n[[Page S490]]\n\nare too many jobs at stake, too much work to do to allow a critical \ntrading partner such as South Africa to continue its unfair treatment \nof American industry.\n  I hope and pray we can still resolve this needless impasse, but if we \ndon't, my commitment and my path forward is clear.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/26/senate-section/article/S490-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 11 A.M.
