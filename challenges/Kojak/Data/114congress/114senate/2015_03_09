Mr. President, as I speak here today President Obama and \nhis administration are engaged in negotiations to prevent Iran from \nbuilding a nuclear weapon. These negotiations are unprecedented and \nvery critical to our country and the world. The stakes couldn't be \nhigher. We as leaders should do everything we can to help these \nnegotiations succeed. When it comes to preventing Iran from obtaining a \nnuclear bomb, we should put partisanship way to one side.\n  Sadly, though, the judgment of my Republican colleagues seems to be \nclouded by their abhorrence of President Obama. Today Republican \nSenators actually sent a letter to the Iranian leadership aimed at \nsabotaging these negotiations.\n  Let's be very clear. Republicans are undermining our Commander in \nChief while empowering the Ayatollahs. Just last week Prime Minister \nBenjamin Netanyahu was here in the Capitol decrying the evil intent of \nthe Iranian leadership. Republicans at that speech, which took place \ndown the hall from where we stand today, in the House Chamber, stood, \napplauded, stomped their feet, and yelled in support of what the Prime \nMinister of Israel had to say. Today those same Republicans are trying \nto negotiate with the very same leaders in Iran with whom Netanyahu \nsaid we shouldn't be negotiating. This simply doesn't make sense.\n  The outcome of the negotiations between the United States, France, \nthe United Kingdom, Germany, China, Russia, and the entire world is so \nimportant. The main participants in these negotiations are the United \nStates, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, China, and Russia. Even \nthough we are one of the negotiators, the negotiations affect the \nentire world. This letter is a hard slap in the face of not only the \nUnited States but our allies. This is not a time to undermine our \nCommander in Chief purely out of spite.\n  We should always have a robust debate about foreign policy, but it is \nunprecedented for one political party to directly intervene in an \ninternational negotiation with the sole goal of embarrassing the \nPresident of the United States.\n  Throughout the 8 years of President Bush's Presidency, Democrats--I \ndisagreed with his foreign policy. I spoke about it on the floor lots \nof times. We know the disaster of the war in Iraq. But even at the \nheight of our disagreements with President George W. Bush, Senate \nDemocrats never considered sending a letter to Saddam Hussein or other \nIraqi leaders at the time--never considered it, nor to be an \nembarrassment to the Commander in Chief, George W. Bush.\n  So I say to my Republican colleagues: Do you so dislike President \nObama that you would take this extraordinary step? Obviously so.\n  Barack Obama is the President. This is an extraordinary step, and why \nit was taken, I really don't understand, other than a dislike of the \nPresident. Barack Obama is President. I have agreed with him on certain \nthings, and I have disagreed with him on certain things, but he is my \nPresident, and he is a President to all of us. It is time for \nRepublicans to accept that the citizens of our country twice elected \nPresident Obama by large margins as President of the United States.\n  Obviously Republicans don't know how to do anything other than \nattempt these seemingly juvenile political attacks against the \nPresident. Congressional Republicans don't know how to get things done. \nThey don't know how to govern. If you don't believe what I just said, \nlook at the press today; read a newspaper; look at the news. The \npundits all agree that the Republicans are in a state of disarray here \nin the Congress of the United States. They don't know what to do or how \nto do it.\n  Today's unprecedented letter, originated by a U.S. Senator who took \nhis oath of office 62 days ago, is a kind of pettiness that diminishes \nus as a country in the eyes of the world. The Republicans need to find \na way to get over their animosity toward President Obama. I can only \nhope they do it sooner rather than later.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield to the assistant leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for his remarks on this letter.\n  I can't think of a precedent where we have had one political party in \nthe Senate try to intervene in international negotiations.\n  In this situation, if these negotiations fail, it is pretty clear to \nme that one of the options on the horizon will be military action \nagainst Iran. I pray to goodness that we never reach that point.\n  But I wish to ask the Senator from Nevada, those who are so anxious \nto scuttle these negotiations, to undermine these negotiations, do you \nthink they have reflected on the fact that the alternative could be \nanother war in the Middle East?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, with whom I have served in this \nCongress for 33 years, I have never seen anything like it. I have never \nseen anything like it.\n  I disagreed with President Bush so very much on what he was doing to \nour country, but I would never ever have considered anything even close \nto this.\n  The only thing I can figure out is what I said. The dislike of the \nPresident is so intense by the Republican leaders that this is what \nthey are doing. They can't accept the fact that this good man, Barack \nObama--this man with the unusual name--was elected twice by \noverwhelming margins by the people of this country, and he is doing his \nvery best to try to alleviate a problem that exists.\n  It would be better for the world--I think everyone should acknowledge \nthat--if we could work something out with Iran so they don't get \nnuclear weapons, and we have to try to do that. To prejudge what is \ngoing to come, if anything--the President of the United States said \nthere is less than a 50-percent chance he can get it done, but \nshouldn't we let him try?\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for another question, in the \nhistory of the Senate to date, back to the 1940s when Senator \nVandenberg from Michigan joined in a bipartisan effort on foreign \npolicy as one of the hallmark events in the history of this great body, \nand for decades when we served in the Senate, kind of the stock phrase \nwas that politics ends at the water's edge when the President is \nrepresenting the United States overseas. We can argue and use our \nconstitutional powers to argue back and forth, but we want to give the \nPresident the authority to try to protect and defend this country.\n  Can the Senator from Nevada, who is a student of history, recall any \nother time when a group of Senators--a partisan group of Senators--\nreached out to a party in negotiations with the United States directly, \nas this letter has done?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I guess my thoughts have been clouded \nby the people I have worked with here. It was just a few years ago that \ntwo outstanding U.S. Senators who will go down in the history books--\nDan Inouye and Ted Stevens. One was a good Republican, and one was a \ngood Democrat. They worked arm in arm on issues that made our country a \nbetter country. They would never ever consider such a thing. If they \nwere here today, they would be on this floor demanding: What is going \non here? One of these two men was a ranking member of the defense \nappropriations committee that funds the military. These two men worked \ntogether on that subcommittee for more than a decade, and they worked \ntogether.\n\n[[Page S1325]]\n\n  My judgment is clouded by the people I have worked with here who \nwould never consider anything like this.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will ask the Senator from Nevada a further question. \nDidn't we also have a similar precedent when Senator McCain and Senator \nKerry were leaders in an effort to finally establish diplomatic \nrecognition of Vietnam and normalize relations? This was a bipartisan \neffort to try to move us beyond a painful chapter in our history which \ncost so many American lives. That, too, was bipartisan, as I recall.\n  Mr. REID. And if anyone should have some ill feelings about Vietnam, \nJohn McCain, who came to the House of Representatives with the Senator \nand me, was in a prison camp for 5 years and 4 of those years were in \nsolitary confinement. John Kerry was shot, was wounded--highly \ndecorated, but he had a little beef with the Vietnamese. And they \nworked together because they thought it would be good for our country \nto reestablish relations with that country.\n  So my mind is--I repeat--clouded with the experience I have in this \nbody with leaders such as Mark Hatfield, a Republican, who would never \never consider anything like this.\n  I am dumbfounded that 47 of my colleagues would sign a letter. Last \nweek they were over here, as I said, jumping up and down and cheering \nthe Prime Minister of Israel because he was denigrating what was going \non in Iran--you can't negotiate with these people--and now they are \nsending a letter to the same people whom they were cheering against \njust a week ago?\n  Would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/09/senate-section/article/S1325-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last Saturday marked the 50th anniversary \nof what has come to be known as Bloody Sunday. In March of 1965, \nCongressman John Lewis, then a young man fresh out of college, and Rev. \nHosea Williams led 600 brave civil rights activists across the Edmund \nPettus Bridge in Selma, AL.\n  These courageous men and women, and children marching with them, were \nmarching in pursuit of the most fundamental right--the right \npreservative of all others--the right to vote. What they received that \nday, however, were brutal beatings from police batons as State troopers \nturned them back and chased them down.\n  A few days later, President Lyndon B. Johnson addressed the Nation \nand called on Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act. Within months, \nthe legislation was signed into law--guaranteeing that the fundamental \nright to vote would not be restricted through clever State and local \nschemes, such as poll taxes and literacy tests.\n  I was proud to join Congressman Lewis on a trip to Selma about 10 \nyears ago for a ceremonial walk across the bridge to mark the 40th \nanniversary of Bloody Sunday. As we marched on a Sunday morning in the \nfootsteps of the civil rights giants, we celebrated a bill that has \noften been called the most significant civil rights law ever passed by \nCongress. Little did we know that 8 years later, in 2013, the Supreme \nCourt would strike down a major provision of that law.\n  In Shelby County v. Holder, by a 5-to-4 vote, a divided Supreme Court \nstruck down the provision of the Voting Rights Act that required \ncertain jurisdictions to preclear changes to their voting laws with the \nDepartment of Justice. The decision effectively gutted the Voting \nRights Act.\n  In the aftermath of the Shelby County decision, several State \nlegislatures pushed through discriminatory and onerous restrictions on \nvoting that previously would have required Department of Justice \nclearance.\n  We have heard disturbing stories of a 93-year-old veteran and a \nnearly 70-year-old doctor who were turned away from the polls in Texas \nbecause their IDs did not meet the specifications of an onerous new \nState law. We heard about Florida's faulty voter verification efforts \nthat disproportionately flag Hispanic citizens for removal from the \nvoter rolls. And we have heard how the elimination of out-of-precinct \nvoting and cuts to early voting impacted minority voters in North \nCarolina.\n  It is hard to believe that 50 years after Selma, we are watching \nState legislatures pass legislation restricting opportunities to vote \nin America. None of us want to subscribe or endorse voter fraud--not a \nperson on either side of the aisle--but this goes far beyond it.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee on the Constitution, I held \nhearings in Florida and Ohio, where they were enacting restrictive laws \nto limit opportunities to vote--limiting the time you can vote, \nrequiring IDs.\n  In each of those States, I called as my first witnesses elected \nofficials of both political parties. I asked, in both States, the same \nquestion to the first panel of witnesses: What has happened in your \nState by way of voter fraud that has led you to restrict the \nopportunity to vote in your States of Ohio and Florida? The answer was: \nNothing--nothing.\n  Then we discussed how many people have actually been prosecuted for \nvoter fraud that led to this tightening of the laws and limiting the \nopportunity to vote. In Ohio, the answer was: We think in the last 10 \nyears, a few people might have been prosecuted. This clearly was not a \nproblem in need of a solution. This was clearly an effort made in these \nState legislatures to restrict the opportunity to vote for certain \nAmericans. Why? If you believe in this country, if you believe in \ndemocracy, if you believe in the right to vote, why do so many State \nlegislatures--under the guidance of a group called ALEC--why are they \nchanging their laws to restrict the right to vote? Clearly it is \nbecause they want certain people to find it more difficult to vote.\n  When I chaired this subcommittee and I had this series of hearings, \nwe heard over and over again that these laws have a disproportionate \nnegative impact on lower income individuals, minorities, youth, \nelderly, and other vulnerable populations.\n  I wish that 50 years after Bloody Sunday, our society had reached a \npoint where the protections of the Voting Rights Act were no longer \nnecessary. But we have seen in State after State that we still need the \nprotections of the law, or people--good American citizens--will be \ndenied their opportunity to cast a vote in an election.\n  So in order to truly honor the foot soldiers of Bloody Sunday, we \nhave to do more than vote for congressional medals. We have to work \ntogether to pass the Voting Rights Amendment Act to ensure the Federal \nGovernment is once again able to fully protect the fundamental right to \nvote for all American citizens.\n  The Voting Rights Amendment Act, which Senator Leahy, Senator Coons, \nand I plan to reintroduce soon, will undo the damage of the Shelby \nCounty decision. Our bill will restore the Voting Rights Act by \nupdating the formula that determines which jurisdictions must preclear \nchanges to their voting practices with the Justice Department.\n  In 2006, Congress reauthorized the Voting Rights Act with an \noverwhelming bipartisan vote. The spirit of Bloody Sunday--the spirit \nof Selma, AL--was alive and well 9 years ago, when both political \nparties stood up and said: We are both going to endorse it. It is the \nright thing to do.\n  Mr. President, 390 Members in the House out of 435 voted for it, and \n98 Senators--from both political parties--voted to reauthorize it, 9 \nyears ago.

Mr. President, I might also reflect on that victory 50 \nyears ago and think about another civil rights milestone that we have \nan opportunity to act on this week--this week--in Washington.\n  Two weeks ago, the Judiciary Committee favorably reported the \nnomination of Loretta Lynch to the full Senate. If confirmed by the \nSenate, Ms. Lynch will become the first African-American woman to serve \nas Attorney General of the United States.\n  In January, she gave moving testimony to the committee about sitting \non her father's shoulders as a young girl so she could witness civil \nrights activists planning sit-ins and marches in the early 1960s.\n  Ms. Lynch is incredible. She is so well qualified that in the course \nof 2 days of hearings, there was virtually no negative question asked \nof her. She handled it so well.\n  She has now waited 121 days for confirmation by the Senate. Loretta \nLynch has waited longer than any nominee for Attorney General in the \nlast 30 years. She languishes on the calendar. It is embarrassing to \nthink that after all of the speeches and all of the reflection of this \nlast weekend on the progress we have made in civil rights in America, \nthis woman, whose nomination in and of itself is a civil rights \nvictory, is being held up in the Senate for no obvious reason.\n  As Congressman Lewis said in a recent letter to the Judiciary \nCommittee, Ms. Lynch ``recognizes the value of all people and has \nfought vigorously to ensure their equal protection under the law.'' \nJohn Lewis said: ``She will carry the torch of justice to help make the \nUnited States a more perfect union.''\n  Mr. President, we are not a perfect union. We will strive throughout \nour history to reach that almost impossible goal. There is a lot of \nwork we need to do, and each generation must accept it. First we need \nto confirm Loretta Lynch, and let's do it soon. Let's do it this week \nso she can lead the Department of Justice and continue the fight to \nmove our Nation forward. And we must restore the Voting Rights Act so \nthe Justice Department has the tools it needs to ensure the efforts of \nthose who marched 50 years ago.\n  As I said before, no other Attorney General nominee in the last three \ndecades has had to wait this long to receive a confirmation vote on the \nfloor of the Senate. By way of comparison, the Democratic-controlled \nSenate confirmed Michael Mukasey as Attorney General 53 days after his \nnomination was announced.\n  Ms. Lynch was reported out of the Judiciary Committee on February 26 \nin a bipartisan vote. On that day, the Judiciary Committee also \nreported out the nomination of Michelle Lee to be Director of the \nPatent and Trademark Office as well as a bill called the Justice for \nVictims of Trafficking Act.\n  The majority leader has scheduled a vote on Ms. Lee for today, and he \nhas said the Senate will vote this week on the trafficking legislation. \nWhy is Ms. Lynch's nomination being kept in limbo while these other \nmatters are being scheduled ahead of her? There is no reason to stall \nthe process for Ms. Lynch any further. The majority leader should \nschedule a confirmation vote without delay.\n  When we have that confirmation vote, I will be proud to vote in \nsupport of Loretta Lynch. She is a nominee of outstanding \nqualifications, integrity, and judgment. She has been confirmed twice \nbefore by the Senate to serve as the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern \nDistrict of New York, and she has served in that position with \ndistinction. She has prosecuted some of the highest profile cases in \nthe country, and she has received widespread praise for her diligence \nand her no-nonsense approach.\n  Ms. Lynch is a prosecutor's prosecutor. But her resume stands out for \nother reasons as well. She received undergraduate and law degrees from \nHarvard. She has private sector experience at prestigious law firms, \nincluding working as a defense attorney and on civil matters. And she \nhas international experience working for the U.N. International \nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda.\n  Through it all, Ms. Lynch has never forgotten her roots, growing up \nas the daughter of a minister and a school librarian in North Carolina. \nLoretta Lynch's life is a testament to the fact that in America, glass \nceilings can be shattered through hard work, perseverance, and \noutstanding performance on the job. Now the Senate is in the position \nto confirm this historic nominee to serve as our next Attorney \nGeneral--once her floor vote gets scheduled.\n  I think Ms. Lynch will do an excellent job. But don't take it from \nme. Let me read some of the praise for Ms. Lynch that has come from \nindividuals and groups that have endorsed her.\n  Here is what the president of the National District Attorneys \nAssociation, Michael Moore, said about her:\n\n       On behalf of the National District Attorneys Association, \n     representing 2500 elected and appointed District Attorneys \n     across the United States as well as 40,000 assistant district \n     attorneys, I write in strong support of Loretta Lynch's \n     nomination to lead the Department of Justice as the next \n     Attorney General of the United States. As prosecutors facing \n     challenges in the field from violent crime, to human \n     trafficking, to gangs and drug traffickers, our membership \n     feels that Ms. Lynch understands the operational nature of \n     these challenges and will be a strong independent voice at \n     the helm of the Department.\n\n  Here is a letter signed by 25 former U.S. attorneys, both Republicans \nand Democrats, including Patrick Fitzgerald and Scott Lassar from my \nhome State of Illinois. They said:\n\n       We are all former United States Attorneys. Some of us \n     served in Republican administrations, some in Democratic \n     administrations. We all share a deep commitment to the rule \n     of law and an abiding respect for the Department of Justice. \n     . . . We firmly believe that Ms. Lynch will make an \n     outstanding Attorney General. . . . we believe that Ms. Lynch \n     has the experience, temperament, independence, integrity, and \n     judgment to immediately assume this critically important \n     position.\n\n  Law enforcement groups support Ms. Lynch, too. Here's a letter from \nthe President of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, \nRichard Beary. He said:\n\n       The IACP believes that Ms. Lynch's years of service have \n     clearly demonstrated that she has the qualifications and \n     experience necessary to be an effective leader of the U.S. \n     Department of Justice . . . The IACP urges you to confirm Ms. \n     Lynch's nomination rapidly.\n\n  Here is a letter from the president of the Federal Law Enforcement \nOfficers Association, representing 26,000 active and retired federal \nlaw enforcement officers. He expressed his full support for Ms. Lynch \nand said:\n\n       FLEOA stands behind her proven leadership and her support \n     for those who investigate and enforce the federal statutes. . \n     . . Her accomplishments and her leadership continue to \n     resonate in the law enforcement community, and she possesses \n     the requisite institutional knowledge that is required of the \n     position of Attorney General.\n\n  These are just some of the endorsements that Ms. Lynch has received. \nShe has also been endorsed by other prosecutor and law enforcement \ngroups, bar associations, business leaders, civil rights organizations, \nand former top Justice Department officials from both parties.\n  As I mentioned earlier, this past weekend marked the 50th Anniversary \nof Bloody Sunday when 600 civil rights marchers were beaten on the \nEdmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, AL. Our Nation's conscience was shocked \nby the image of John Lewis, now a Congressman from the State of \nGeorgia, being beaten and badly injured on Bloody Sunday by troopers \nwith nightsticks.\n  John Lewis has spent his life marching for the cause of justice. He \nspeaks with a voice of moral authority that all of us should heed. \nSeveral weeks ago Congressman Lewis sent a letter to the Judiciary \nCommittee in support of Ms. Lynch.\n  I want to read an extended excerpt from the letter I mentioned \nearlier. Congressman Lewis said:\n\n       With over 30 years of legal experience, Ms. Lynch is \n     unwavering in her efforts to create a more just society. A \n     Harvard graduate with an extensive career in public service, \n     private practice, and academia, she recognizes the value of \n     all people and has fought vigorously to ensure their equal \n     protection under the law.\n       She will carry the torch of justice to help make the United \n     States a more perfect\n\n[[Page S1327]]\n\n     union. Ms. Lynch's commitment to civil rights stems from her \n     family's roots in North Carolina. Her father, a Baptist \n     minister, preached at a church where students would meet to \n     organize anti-segregation boycotts. Her grandfather, a \n     sharecropper and pastor in the 1930s, helped people in his \n     community who faced challenges under the Jim Crow system.\n\n  I will never forget Loretta Lynch's description of her father raising \nher onto his shoulders so she could witness the civil rights protestors \nin his church. The fact that this young girl could be the first \nAfrican-American woman to serve as our Nation's Attorney General is \nanother milestone on our Nation's long, slow march to establish a \n``more perfect union.''\n  The bottom line is this: Loretta Lynch is extraordinarily well-\nqualified to serve as Attorney General. She has been extensively \nvetted, and she has performed admirably while in the spotlight of that \nprocess. And Members of the Senate have had plenty of time to review \nher qualifications.\n  It is time to move forward and hold a vote on Ms. Lynch. There is \nnothing to be gained by further delay. I hope the majority leader, \nSenator McConnell, will call her nomination for a vote and I hope all \nmy colleagues will support this outstanding nominee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/09/senate-section/article/S1327-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1327-S1328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HUMAN TRAFFICKING\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, we spend a lot of time, as one would \nexpect in a legislative body, talking about the technical aspects of \nlegislation and the procedure we use to consider it and pass it, a \nsubject which perhaps many of us enjoy but which probably turns the \npublic--puts a glaze in their eyes and bores them because they don't \nsee the relevance of it.\n  We talk about motions to proceed and cloture and filibusters, but \nwhat is important in the Senate is the subject matter of the \nlegislation that we apply this procedure or these rules to. This week \nin the Senate we will be undertaking a very important subject; that is, \nhow to protect our fellow citizens, many of them children, who are \nneeding our help and waiting to be rescued. Those are children who are \nbeing trafficked in the commercial sex and forced-labor trade--not over \nthere, not necessarily just in some other country, but right here in \nthe United States of America.\n\n  I believe that we are all created in the image of God, that all human \nbeings are entitled to be treated with dignity and respect. But the \ncriminals who traffic in human flesh treat these same human beings \ncreated in the image of God as a thing. They treat these children as a \ncommodity to be bought and sold. To me that is the very definition of \nevil. A few weeks ago the Judiciary Committee heard from several \nwitnesses on what has been called modern day slavery--human \ntrafficking.\n  I know many of us thought that slavery was an ugly part of our \nNation's beginning but certainly only something in the past. But the \ntruth is that there exists today something that you could legitimately \ncall modern day slavery, and that is human trafficking. Now, even \nthough institutionalized slavery has long been cast into the dustbin of \nhistory and is something we read about in our history books, human \ntrafficking, particularly sex trafficking, still affects the lives of \nhundreds and thousands of our children.\n  Tragically, many of them are young girls. As the father of two \ndaughters, it turns my stomach to realize that a majority of the human \nbeings who are trafficked are girls who are of middle-school age. In \nthe Judiciary Committee, we heard from Malika Saada Saar who represents \na wonderful organization called Rights4Girls.\n  Malika spoke of a young woman named Aviva. According to Malika, Aviva \nwas in foster care when a trafficker kidnapped her and held her hostage \nfor almost a year. During this time, we learned in the Judiciary \nCommittee during that hearing, Aviva was sold to as many as 10 \ndifferent men a night. Of course, she did not understand. She could not \ncomprehend why an adult man would want to buy her body when she was \njust a child.\n  When law enforcement officials found Aviva, she was arrested for \nprostitution at the age of 15. Let me repeat that because it is \nimportant. This young girl who was kidnapped, raped, and sold nightly--\ndaily--was treated like a criminal, not a victim. In 1992 Holly Austin \nSmith ran away from home and was forced into a sex trafficking ring the \nsummer before her freshman year of high school.\n  Within hours of running away, 14-year old Holly was sold for $200 to \na man who wanted her for sex because he said she reminded him of his \ngranddaughter. When police eventually found Holly--still only a child, \nscared and confused, as you can only imagine--they treated her as a \ncriminal, not as a victim. Too often these children, who are not of the \nage of consent, are treated as child prostitutes.\n  As many of us who have worked on this issue for some time know, there \nis no such thing as a child prostitute. If you are not of the age of \nconsent, you cannot consent, and you cannot agree to be used in such a \nhorrific way. These are children who are bought and sold for sex--plain \nand simple--as nauseating as that truth is. Malika powerfully said \nduring our hearing: ``There should be no difference between raping a \nchild and paying to rape a child.'' Now, the individuals who commit \nthese crimes--not just the people who traffic in them but the people \nwho purchase these services--too often pay a fine and get on with their \nlives. Yet they are the child rapists who should be treated as the sex \ntraffickers they are.\n  If it were not for the demand, sex trafficking would not have a \nbusiness model. But unfortunately, there is too great of a demand. But \noften the people who purchase these children are treated with impunity. \nTomorrow, I expect the Senate will move to consider legislation that I \nhave introduced with a number of our colleagues from Minnesota, \nIllinois, and Oregon. Indeed, there are a number of Senators who have \nalready contributed a lot of very good and constructive work to the \nproduct we will turn to tomorrow.\n  The bill is called the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. The \nmost important thing that it does is that it ends the culture of \nimpunity for the people who purchase children and other victims of \nhuman trafficking. It holds the so-called johns and the pimps \naccountable, and it does not focus on the victim who should be treated \nlike a victim and helped to heal and get on with their lives. But too \noften they are the ones who are prosecuted and treated as a criminal.\n  Instead of being treated as criminals, this bill makes sure that the \nfuture Avivas and Hollys are treated for what they are, and that is as \nvictims. What this bill also does is it takes the money and assets \nforfeited from convicted human traffickers and directs it to services \nfor the victims. So future Avivas and Hollys would have a shelter, a \nplace to live, a roof over their head, a bed to sleep in, and somebody \nwho loves them and cares enough to help them heal and get on with their \nlives. That is the kind of treatment these victims of human trafficking \ndeserve--not jail time.\n  We know that Washington can be a dysfunctional place more times than \nwe would like to admit. So often there are political issues or \nideological issues that divide us. But the fight against human \ntrafficking reminds us that it does not have to be this way. Indeed, I \nwas heartened a few weeks ago when this particular piece of legislation \npassed the Judiciary Committee with unanimous support. All Republicans \nand all Democrats on the committee voted to support it.\n  Indeed, Republicans and Democrats--not just in Congress but across \nthe country--support this legislation, as evidenced by the more than \n200 different organizations, from victims' advocates to law enforcement \ngroups, which have joined forces to fight this modern day slave trade \nand to support the legislation we will turn to tomorrow. It is a fight, \nsadly, that must be acknowledged and it must be fought. But it is a \nfight we can win, finally delivering our Nation's promise of freedom to \nthose who are enslaved.\n\n[[Page S1328]]\n\n  It is not the kind of slavery we read about in our history books or \nthe kind that resulted or helped precipitate the Civil War, but it is \nthe kind that goes on unbeknownst to most Americans and most people but \nwhich represents that seamy underbelly of society, one that we must \nexpose and one we must reveal as the evil that it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/09/senate-section/article/S1328-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n OFFICE OF COMPLIANCE ADMINISTRATIVE AND TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT OF \n                                  2015\n\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Madam President, this past weekend, Americans gathered in \nSelma, Alabama. They did that to mark the 50th anniversary of Bloody \nSunday. Many of us are old enough to remember that day when hundreds of \nbrave men and women marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. There, \nthey were savagely beaten because they dared to stand up for their \nright to vote--a right that we in Vermont take as inalienable. Their \nblood, their sweat, and their tears helped pave the way for the Voting \nRights Act. They ultimately helped move our Nation toward what is \nsupposed to be a ``more perfect Union.''\n  In commemorating the bravery of these foot soldiers for justice, we \nare reminded of what we can accomplish if we stand on principle and we \ncome together, Republicans and Democrats, to do what is right. At a \ntime when lawmakers seem far too polarized on the most important issues \nfacing our Nation, I was encouraged to see leaders from both political \nparties join President Obama and Congressman Lewis, and so many others \nthis weekend in Selma. President George W. Bush shared the stage with \nPresident Obama to honor the brave men and women who inspired the \nNation and helped bring about historic change.\n  I was proud to work with President Bush on the reauthorization of the \nVoting Rights Act, along with the Republican Chairmen of the House and \nSenate Judiciary Committees, Congressman Sensenbrenner and Senator \nSpecter. We can see them on each side of President Bush in this picture \nof the bill signing. We can see Congressman Sensenbrenner standing \nthere and the late Senator Specter standing there. I was standing over \nhere with my camera as one of the people who helped move the bill \nthrough. President Bush had invited me to attend and I took this \nphotograph at the signing ceremony. I am going to give this photograph \nto President Bush because it is the only photograph where we can \nactually see his hand and his signature going down. That is because I \nwas the only person with a camera, standing behind the President. I \ndon't say that to praise my photographic ability; I say that to praise \nPresident Bush for signing the bill.\n  In response to the Supreme Court's Shelby County decision--a decision \nwhere five members of the Supreme Court decided they had a far better \nidea than virtually all House Members and Senators--I have been working \nwith Congressman Sensenbrenner on bipartisan legislation that would \nrestore the Voting Rights Act. This is so that President Obama can sign \na bill as President Bush did. Unfortunately, no Republican Senator has \nyet stepped forward to join me in introducing this legislation in the \nSenate.\n  The Republican Party of 2006, along with their President, reached \nacross the aisle to advance the cause of voting rights, saying they \nwere not there for any particular party, they were there for all \nAmericans. I am still hopeful the Republican Senate of 2015 will \ncontinue the bipartisan tradition that President Bush and Republican \nleaders did in 2006.\n  The civil rights milestones we celebrate this month can't be just \nhistorical discussions to be talked about in a history class somewhere. \nThe plain reality is that racial discrimination in voting still exists \nin this country. Chief Justice Roberts acknowledged that very fact in \nhis opinion in Shelby, and he asked Congress to update the Voting \nRights Act. I wish we had not had the Shelby decision--I think it was \nwrong on many counts--but the majority in the Supreme Court voted that \nway. I agree with the Chief Justice that it is time for us in the \nCongress--Republicans and Democrats alike--to act.\n  In his inspirational speech in Selma on Saturday, President Obama \nnoted that 100 Members of Congress had come to Selma to honor people \nwho died for the right to vote. He then laid out a challenge by saying, \n``If we want to honor this day, let that hundred go back to Washington \nand gather 400 more, and together, pledge to make it their mission to \nrestore the Voting Rights Act this year. That's how we honor those \npeople on this bridge.''\n  I agree with him. We should come together, as this body has done so \nmany times before, to restore the Voting Rights Act and to reaffirm our \nsteadfast commitment to equal protection under the law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/09/senate-section/article/S1328-3", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1328-S1329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LYNCH NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today, in that same spirit, I urge all \nSenators to come together to confirm Loretta Lynch to be our next \nAttorney General and the first African-American woman ever to hold this \nposition. The delay of her confirmation is unprecedented and \nunwarranted. It should end.\n  It has been 121 days since President Obama announced his intention to \nnominate Ms. Lynch. Her nomination was reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee on a bipartisan basis 11 days ago. In the last 30 years, no \nAttorney General nominee has waited longer than Loretta Lynch to \nreceive a floor vote after being reported from committee.\n  I think of what we did when President Bush was in the last 2 years of \nhis Presidency. Democrats had just taken back the majority in the \nSenate. He nominated a person for Attorney General--actually a person I \nvoted against--but I moved that person forward anyway because I felt \nthe President of the United States deserved to have an Attorney \nGeneral. I moved that person through in half the time we have had to \nwait for Loretta Lynch.\n  Ms. Lynch has broad support from Democrats and Republicans across the \nlegal and law enforcement communities. So there is no excuse. She \nshouldn't be treated differently than previous nominees. Actually, she \nshould receive a vote tonight, along with the other nominees who are to \nbe confirmed. She should not be treated any differently than President \nBush's nominee.\n  So in the wake of the bipartisan and inspirational celebration in \nSelma, let us come together to honor the difficult work of the Justice \nDepartment. Let's schedule a vote to confirm the first African-American \nwoman to serve as Attorney General of the United States. Let us show \nthe American people what we can do when we come together. Let us \nfinally vote to confirm Loretta Lynch.\n  I see the majority leader on the floor. I don't want to take his \ntime.\n\n[[Page S1329]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On the issue of abuse of \npublic trust, she has prosecuted both Democrats and Republicans.\n  I mentioned a few minutes ago that when George W. Bush was in the \nlast two years of his term, he was a lameduck President and Democrats \nhad just taken over control of the Senate. The President nominated \nJudge Mukasey to be Attorney General. Because I disagreed with Judge \nMukasey on the question of torture, I told the President I would vote \nagainst him, but I also told him that any President has a right to at \nleast have a vote on their nominees. I moved him forward in 53 days--\nthat is from the time his nomination was announced until he was \nconfirmed. And that includes the time it took for the paperwork to get \nup here and the rest of the process. I put him through the committee, \ngot him onto the floor, and he was confirmed in 53 days.\n  Now we have been waiting 121 days for Loretta Lynch, who came to the \nJudiciary Committee with far more law enforcement background. I don't \nknow what the difference is between this man, Judge Mukasey, who took \n53 days and Loretta Lynch.\n  In fact, I will give you another Attorney General nominee I also \ndisagreed with and voted against, but who I, as chairman, helped bring \nto a vote. President Bush nominated John Ashcroft--a former Senator who \nhad just been defeated--to be Attorney General. I put him through in 42 \ndays--42 days from the time his nomination was announced until he was \nconfirmed. Forty-two days.\n  So Ashcroft went through in 42 days. Judge Mukasey went through in 53 \ndays. Loretta Lynch has waited 121 days.\n  I was involved with the nominations of these two men even though I \ndisagreed with them. When Republicans took back control of the Senate \nthere was another Attorney General in between who took 86 days. But for \nthe two men when I was Chairman: 42 days for John Ashcroft; 53 days for \nJudge Mukasey. But Loretta Lynch has been waiting 121 days and still \nhasn't had a vote. Is it any wonder that people have concern about the \nU.S. Senate when she has to wait all that time just to get a vote up or \ndown? Up or down, that is all we ask. So let's hope she can be \nscheduled, voted on and confirmed because with her record as a tough \nprosecutor, that is the sort of person I would like cracking down on \nterrorists, cracking down on those who defraud this country, cracking \ndown on traffickers, as she has in the past.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Lee and Marti Nominations\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I welcome the Senate's action today to \nconfirm two well-regarded practitioners to important leadership \npositions charged with protecting and promoting intellectual property.\n  Michelle Lee, who is nominated to serve as the Director of the Patent \nand Trademark Office, USPTO, will be the first woman and first Asian \nPacific American to hold this position. She is also the daughter of \nimmigrants who moved to this country and contributed to the growth of \nSilicon Valley through her father's career as an electrical engineer. \nHer historic nomination is an American success story, and it is fitting \nthat she is confirmed today to lead the office that is home to \ncountless stories of successful innovation and creation by Americans \nthroughout the country.\n  The USPTO has been without a Senate-confirmed director for more than \n2 years, which is far too long for an office that is so important to \nour Nation's innovators and to our economy. Close to 600,000 patent \napplications and 450,000 trademark class applications are filed with \nthe office each year. By serving America's innovators, the USPTO helps \nVermonters and citizens across the country build their businesses and \nbring their inventions to the global marketplace.\n  Ms. Lee is charged with leading this office at a time when too many \nbad actors are abusing the patent system. Something must be done to \naddress misconduct by bad actors who are targeting everyone from small \nbusinesses in Vermont to larger companies that are crucial to our \neconomy. Congress plays an important role in this discussion, and as I \nhave said for the last 2 years, we must enact balanced reforms to \nensure the patent system can thrive. While that discussion continues in \nCongress, the USPTO Director must ensure the policies we currently have \nin place work for the diverse patent community.\n  Among those policies is carrying out the landmark reforms in the \nLeahy-Smith America Invents Act, the greatest transformation to our \npatent system in over 60 years. This landmark law has helped simplify \nthe process for patent approval, reduce backlogs at the USPTO, and \nharmonize our patent system with the rest of the world. The AIA sought \nto improve patent quality by creating new and more efficient \nadministrative proceedings at the USPTO. Three years later, the USPTO \nhas now received over 2,000 petitions for post-grant review. These \nmeasures are important to help businesses that fall into the crosshairs \nof overbroad patents. But improving the quality of patents also \nimproves their value for inventors and investors, too. The USPTO is \ndoing tremendous work to implement these new programs under Ms. Lee's \ncurrent leadership as Deputy Director of the office. Because of the \nAIA, there are now four satellite offices around the country to make \nthe USPTO more accessible to inventors and small businesses. The USPTO \nhas strengthened its pro bono program and used its fee-setting \nauthority created by the AIA to gain better financial independence.\n  These are profound improvements, but strong leadership at the USPTO \nis needed to ensure the America Invents Act helps our patent system to \nthrive in the 21st century. As the USPTO's Deputy Director, Ms. Lee has \nproven to be thoughtful, balanced, and respectful of the diverse \nperspectives across the patent community. I look forward to continuing \nthe Judiciary Committee's productive relationship with Ms. Lee and with \nthe USPTO.\n  I also welcome the Senate's action today to confirm Daniel Marti as \nthe second Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator, or ``IPEC.'' \nThe IPEC was created by legislation I authored in 2008, the PRO-IP Act, \nwhich passed the Senate with unanimous support. In creating this \nposition, our goal was to take a comprehensive approach to intellectual \nproperty enforcement within the U.S. government, to ensure that law \nenforcement has the tools it needs, and that agencies are working \ntogether efficiently. The first IPEC, Victoria Espinel, built a strong \nrecord in this position, and I am confident Mr. Marti will do well \ncontinuing this important work.\n  The protection of intellectual property is important to our Nation's \ncreators, artists, inventors, and businesses alike. Whether one is a \nfilmmaker whose work is being copied and distributed online without \npermission, or a family-owned business in Vermont that discovers knock-\noff copies of its products being sold at half the price, intellectual \nproperty theft harms innovators across the country. It also harms \nconsumers, as we have learned from the repeated, devastating stories of \nvictims who inadvertently purchased counterfeit medicines or other \nproducts not knowing they were of dangerously low quality.\n  The IPEC plays an important role coordinating law enforcement and \nindustry efforts to address these pressing issues. Nowhere is this work \nmore important than in addressing counterfeiting and infringement in \nthe online world--a complex, global problem that requires creative, \nthoughtful solutions. Just last month, leading advertising networks \nannounced a new initiative to help ensure that they avoid inadvertently \nsupporting websites that serve no legitimate purpose other than to \ntraffic in stolen content and property. Search engines have now \nacknowledged that they, too, have a responsibility to help address \nillegal activity online. I hope Mr. Marti will renew the IPEC's work to \nsupport and encourage these voluntary initiatives, and will continue \nthese efforts with other actors who drive so much of the online \neconomy. Every business that operates in the Internet ecosystem has a \nrole to play.\n  Mr. Marti is currently the managing partner of the Washington, DC \noffice of Kilpatrick, Townsend & Stockton LLP. A graduate of Georgetown \nUniversity and Emory University School of Law, he has spent his entire \nlegal career specializing in intellectual property law, with a focus in \ntrademark law and the protection of intellectual property both \ndomestically and internationally.\n  I look forward to continuing the Judiciary Committee's productive \nrelationship with Mr. Marti and the IPEC office. Last year, Senator \nGrassley and I sent a letter to President Obama urging him to nominate \na candidate to fill the IPEC position, which has been vacant for over \n18 months. I chaired a confirmation hearing for Mr. Marti in December \nin the hope that the Senate would move swiftly with his confirmation \nthis year. With Mr. Marti's confirmation today, the IPEC office can \nreturn fully to its important work.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on two \nnominees charged with important responsibilities in the enforcement of \nour Nation's intellectual property laws.\n  The first is Daniel Marti, who is nominated to become Intellectual \nProperty Enforcement Coordinator in the Executive Office of the \nPresident.\n  The second is Michelle Lee, who is nominated to become the next Under \nSecretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the \nU.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\n  The United States is a world leader in the innovation of cutting-edge \ntechnologies and products that improve our daily lives. Importantly, \nthe United States' economy, indeed every industry, relies heavily on \nintellectual property.\n  Because intellectual property rights are critical to the Nation's \neconomic well-being, we need strong and capable leaders at the helm of \nthe offices that deal with patents, trademarks and copyrights. And \nbecause the top positions at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and \nthe Office of the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator have \nbeen vacant for quite some time, I am pleased that we are able to fill \nthem today with two highly qualified candidates.\n  Mr. Marti and Ms. Lee have proven track records in the field of \nintellectual property law and are well respected by the intellectual \nproperty community.\n  Their experience and expertise are of the caliber required for their \nrespective positions. I believe they are excellent candidates for these \npositions, and I will support their nominations.\n\n\n                        Vote On Marti Nomination\n\n  The question now occurs on the Marti nomination.\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today on the 50th anniversary of \nthe Selma marches and to call on Congress to come together to protect \nall Americans' sacred right to vote.\n  In March of 1965, thousands of Americans came together in Alabama to \nmarch the 54-mile highway from Selma to the State capital of \nMontgomery. They marched in defiance of the segregationist repression \nin the Jim Crow South. They marched to demand that Black American \ncitizens be allowed to exercise their constitutional right to vote.\n  On March 7, 1965, 50 years ago this week, some 600 civil rights \nmarchers headed east of Selma on U.S. Route 80. That day, March 7, \nwould go down in history as Bloody Sunday. They got as far as the \nEdmund Pettus Bridge, 6 blocks away, where State and local law \nenforcement attacked them with billy clubs and tear gas and drove them \nback into Selma.\n  This photo reflects the scene on the bridge where John Lewis and \nothers were being struck down with batons. Images of peaceful marchers \nbrutally attacked by uniformed State troopers were broadcast worldwide. \nSeeing how peaceful activists who sought to ensure the franchise were \ntreated by the very law enforcement officers sworn to uphold the law in \nSelma shocked the conscience of Americans everywhere and began an \nawakening that would ultimately lead to the passage of the 1965 Voting \nRights Act.\n  Two days later, on March 9, Martin Luther King, Jr., led a symbolic \nmarch to the same bridge where they were confronted by State troopers. \nStill awaiting requested Federal protection, and seeking to minimize \nthe risk of additional violence, Dr. King turned the marchers around \nand led them back to the church where they had started.\n  Dr. King knew the threat of Jim Crow had to be stopped by the law, so \nhe sought Federal court protection for a third full-scale march from \nSelma to the State capital in Montgomery. Ruling in favor of the \ndemonstrators, Federal District Court Judge Frank M. Johnson, Jr., \nwrote:\n\n       The law is clear that the right to petition one's \n     government for the redress of grievances may be exercised in \n     large groups . . . and these rights may be exercised by \n     marching, even along public highways.\n\n  On Sunday, March 21, 2 weeks after Bloody Sunday, approximately 3,200 \nmarchers set out for Montgomery, walking 12 miles a day and sleeping in \nfields. By the time they reached the capital on Thursday, March 25, \nthey were 25,000 strong.\n  As Dr. King said standing in front of the capital that day:\n\n       Selma, Alabama became a shining moment in the conscience of \n     man. If the worst in American life lurked in its dark \n     streets, the best of American instincts arose passionately \n     from across the nation to overcome it.\n\n  Less than 5 months after the last of the three marches, President \nLyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965--landmark \nlegislation that fundamentally transformed voting rights in the United \nStates, particularly in the Jim Crow South.\n  As Americans, we all owe a debt of gratitude to those who marched, \nthose who bled, and in some cases those who died, to transform the \nVoting Rights Act from a bill into a reality.\n  This past weekend a group of Republican and Democratic lawmakers \ntraveled to Selma, AL, to join President Obama and former President \nBush in honoring those brave Americans who worked tirelessly and at \ngreat personal cost to secure equal rights for all citizens regardless \nof their race. As our Nation thinks about their tremendous patriotism \nand sacrifice this month, it is a particularly appropriate time to talk \nabout the role Congress can play in safeguarding the hard-won rights of \nminority voters by working to restore the integrity of the Voting \nRights Act.\n  The oath of office that each of us takes when we become a Senator is \nto ``support and defend the Constitution''--and that means supporting \nand defending voting rights, which are explicitly enumerated in our \nU.S. Constitution.\n\n[[Page S1332]]\n\n  In her dissent in 2013, the Shelby County case, Justice Ginsberg \nhighlighted the legislature's heightened responsibility where the \nprotection of citizens' access to polls is a concern, writing that when \nit is confronting ``the most constitutionally invidious form of \ndiscrimination, and the most fundamental right in our democratic \nsystem, Congress's power to act is at its height.''\n  Well, over the past 50 years Congress has indeed acted. We have \nworked on a bipartisan basis to ensure that our citizens do not face \ndiscrimination at the polls.\n  In 1965, in response to a slew of violent attacks against civil \nrights activists, culminating in the attack on peaceful marchers \ncrossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge, we passed the Voting Rights Act, a \nbill that aimed to ``remedy 95 years of pervasive discrimination in \nvoting rights, which [had] resulted in the almost complete \ndisenfranchisement of minorities in certain areas of the country.'' \nThat act has been rightfully cited as a ``crown jewel'' of America's \ncivil rights laws, and for the past 50 years it has expanded minority \nparticipation in elections by removing first-generation barriers to \nballot access, such as literacy tests and poll taxes. Moreover, the law \nalso helped to tackle so-called second-generation barriers to voting, \nsuch as voter ID requirements, elimination or curtailment of early \nvoting, voter registration restrictions, and residency restrictions.\n  Since the act was passed in 1965, Congress has again and again \nreaffirmed its commitment to equality in Federal elections by \nreauthorizing the law in 1970, 1975, 1982, and most recently in 2006 \nwhen we voted to extend it for another 25 years. That 2006 vote was not \na close one. The bill enjoyed what the press described as \n``overwhelming bipartisan backing,'' passing the House by a vote of 390 \nto 33 and by a Senate vote of 98 to 0. That is pretty persuasive \nbipartisan backing for taking on the most invidious form of \ndiscrimination--discrimination in the right to vote. That vote \nrepresented a strong affirmation that equality is not a partisan issue. \nWe can and we have worked together to ensure that all Americans are \nable to participate in our democracy by exercising their right to vote.\n  Unfortunately, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down key provisions of \nthe Voting Rights Act 2 years ago in 2013. So now it is once again \nCongress's duty--our duty--to work together to reform the Voting Rights \nAct. To anyone who doubts the continued need for a robust Voting Rights \nAct, I submit the following:\n  In 2006, while sections 4 and 5 were still in effect, the House \nJudiciary Committee found that the Voting Rights Act was still a \ncritical tool for countering discrimination. The committee observed \nthat ``discrimination today is more subtle than the visible methods \nused in 1965. However, the effect and results are the same, namely a \ndiminishing of the minority community's ability to fully participate in \nthe electoral process and to elect their preferred candidates of \nchoice.''\n  That report further found that ``despite the substantial progress \nthat has been made'' since the Voting Rights Act was first passed in \n1965, ``the evidence [of discrimination] before the Committee \nresemble[d] the evidence before Congress in 1965, and the evidence that \nwas present again in 1970, 1975, 1982 and 1992.''\n  The behavior of various States in the aftermath of the 2013 Shelby \nCounty ruling highlighted the critical role that sections 4 and 5 \nplayed in protecting minority voters. For example, as the Brennan \nCenter for Justice noted on the same day the Supreme Court issued its \ndecision, Texas officials announced it would implement a draconian \nphoto ID law which had been blocked by section 5 because of its racial \nimpact. Initial estimates suggested that it would impact 600,000 to \n800,000 registered voters in Texas who did not have a government-issued \nphoto ID.\n  Texas was not alone. North Carolina quickly enacted a series of laws \nthat drastically restricted voters' access to the polls by imposing a \nstrict photo ID requirement, significantly reducing early voting and \nlimiting the timeframe for voter registration--so three different \nmeasures.\n  It is particularly telling that North Carolina legislators \ndeliberately waited for the Supreme Court to strike down the \npreclearance requirements of section 5 to propose the legislation, \nunderstanding that laws with such a discriminatory effect would likely \nnot pass muster under the Voting Rights Act.\n  In North Carolina, more than 300,000 registered voters lacked a DMV-\nissued ID. Of those, one-third were African American.\n  In 2008, the vast majority of African Americans--70 percent--who \nvoted in North Carolina voted during the early voting period. So North \nCarolina's significant reduction in early voting was cynically \ncalculated to reduce the turnout of African Americans at the polls.\n  These States are not alone. The Brennan Center for Justice found that \nin the aftermath of the Shelby County case, ``at least 10 of the 15 \nstates that had been covered in whole or in part by section 5 \nintroduced new restrictive legislation that would make it harder for \nminority voters to cast a ballot.''\n  Simply put, these States' behavior shows that access to our \nfundamental right--the right of every citizen to be heard through \nelections--is suffering in the wake of the Shelby County decision.\n  We cannot let our civil rights laws return to once again being, as \nDr. King said before the passage of the Voting Rights Act, mere \n``dignity without strength.'' We owe it to those who sacrificed before \nus, who sacrificed to form a more perfect Union, to work together on a \nbipartisan basis to restore the Voting Rights Act.\n\n  I stand ready to work with any of my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle in this esteemed body to make that happen. I hope every Senator \nfeels the same and understands that access to the polls--the right to \nvote--is the throbbing heart of a democracy, and without that the \ndemocracy is deeply damaged.\n  Fifty years ago this month, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said at the \nfoot of the Montgomery capitol: ``The battle is in our hands.'' Today, \nin Congress, in the U.S. Senate, the battle is in our hands. It is our \nresponsibility to debate and pass such legislation to protect and \ndefend the right to vote for every American.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/09/senate-section/article/S1332-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1332-S1333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING BILLY CASPER\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a hall of \nfame golfer, a remarkable husband, and a loyal friend--Billy Casper. \nLast month, Billy passed away peacefully at the age of 83. I know I \nspeak for all who knew him when I say he will be sorely missed.\n  Billy Casper was a champion both in golf and in life. Between 1956 \nand 1975, he won 51 tournaments on the PGA tour, including the U.S. \nOpen in 1959 and again in 1966. In 1970, he defeated Gene Litler to \ncapture the Masters in what was the tournament's last 18-hole playoff. \nDuring his long and illustrious career, he claimed many titles, \nincluding five Vardon Trophies for the low-scoring average that year. \nHe was also a member of eight U.S. Ryder Cup teams and still holds the \nrecord for the most Ryder Cup points earned by a U.S. team member. He \nwas inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1978.\n  Later in his career, Billy captured nine senior PGA tour wins between \n1982 and 1989. I am proud that one of these victories came in Jeremy \nRanch, UT--the State Billy adopted as his home.\n  Billy first came to Utah in 1959 to play in the Utah Open. During \nthat week, he and his wife Shirley fell in love with Utah and \neventually relocated permanently. He was an active member of the Utah \ngolfing community and was inducted into the Utah Sports Hall of Fame in \n2013.\n  Since his passing, several professional golfers have offered tributes \nin honor of Billy's memory. Jack Nicklaus, widely considered the \ngreatest golfer of all time, said the following about Billy:\n\n\n[[Page S1333]]\n\n\n       Billy Casper was one of the greatest family men--be it \n     inside the game of golf or out--I have had the fortunate \n     blessing to meet. He had such a wonderful balance to his \n     life. Golf was never the most important thing in Billy's \n     life--family was. There was always much more to Billy Casper \n     than golf . . . It was not even a year ago, someone asked \n     Billy how he wanted to be remembered, and he said, ``I want \n     to be remembered for how I loved my fellow man.''\n\n  Mike Reid, a fellow PGA Tour competitor and Utahn, said the following \nabout Billy: ``He taught by example, that while we strive for \nexcellence in golf, success should never come at the cost of the \nrelationships we hold dear.''\n  To Billy and his wife Shirley, family was always the first priority. \nThey are the proud parents of 11 children, 6 of whom are adopted, and \nthey now have over 70 grandchildren and many great-grandchildren. When \nhis sons were old enough Billy would have them caddie for him on tour \nso that he could spend that special time with them. He gave freely of \nhimself and spent countless hours in the service of others, both in \ngolf and in church callings.\n  Billy Casper was one of the very best in his chosen profession, but \nat the same time, he never let the trappings of the world overshadow \nwhat was most important to him--his friends, his faith, and his family. \nI am profoundly grateful that Elaine and I were able to call Billy and \nShirley friends. I will miss Billy Casper dearly, as will all who knew \nhim. May his memory remind us all of the importance of kindness, \ncharity, love, and optimism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/09/senate-section/article/S1333-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRECOGNIZING THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST NATIONAL \n                               LABORATORY\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today, with my colleague Senator \nCantwell, we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Pacific Northwest \nNational Laboratory, PNNL, a true example of scientific excellence \nlocated in our home State of Washington. For the past 50 years, PNNL \nhas served as the Department of Energy's premier chemistry, \nenvironmental sciences, and data analytics national laboratory and has \ntackled some of our Nation's most complex and urgent challenges.\n  In 1965, Battelle won a contract to operate a research and \ndevelopment lab at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington State. \nThen known as Pacific Northwest Laboratory, its scientists provided \ncritical support to plutonium production and nuclear waste cleanup at \nHanford. Through its commitment to excellence and innovation, the lab \ngrew and evolved to serve the ever-changing needs of our Nation. In \n1969, the Pacific Northwest Laboratory's scientific prowess caught the \neye of NASA, which chose the lab to analyze lunar soil samples that \nwere collected after landing a man on the Moon. The lab changed its \nname to the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in 1995, and in 1997 \nopened the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory. This state-of-\nthe-art national scientific user facility provides researchers from \naround the Nation and the world with experimental instruments, a high-\nperformance supercomputer, and specialized staff allowing them to \nadvance energy and environmental discoveries.\n  Today, the lab employs 4,300 people at its main Richland campus, the \nmarine research facility in Sequim, and in satellite offices in \nSeattle, Tacoma, Portland, and Washington, DC, and conducts $1 billion \nin research annually for the Department of Energy, Department of \nHomeland Security, National Institutes of Health, and many more. While \nit is clear PNNL serves as a cornerstone of the Tri-Cities economy, the \ndedicated staff are also key leaders in the community. The lab has made \nit a priority to invest in STEM education, playing an important role as \na founding partner in one of Washington State's first STEM high \nschools. Delta High School is now educating our next generation of \nscientists and engineers. In higher education, PNNL supported efforts \nto create a Washington State University branch campus in the region \nwhich led to WSU Tri-Cities opening its doors in 1989. I am \nconsistently impressed with PNNL's contributions to the local \ncommunity.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I join my colleague, Senator Murray, in \ncommemorating the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's 50th \nanniversary. As our constituents in Washington State know, PNNL is an \nintegral part of our economy. The lab has a total economic output of \n$1.3 billion and supports more than 6,800 jobs in Washington. PNNL's \ncommitment to commercialization and technology transfer has brought \nresearch out of the laboratory and into the real world, further \nbolstering PNNL's reputation as a national scientific leader and \nsupporting Washington State's economy.\n  I am reminded each day how the work at PNNL impacts our daily lives. \nDuring my visits to the Port of Seattle, I know that PNNL has deployed \nradiation detection systems that keep our ports safe. And when I watch \na movie at home, I know that the DVD I use is possible because of \nPNNL's advancements in digital data storage technology. Because of \nthese and other important contributions, PNNL has earned more Federal \nLaboratory Consortium Awards than any other national laboratory, holds \nmore than 2,300 U.S. and foreign patents, and fostered the creation of \n108 spin-off companies that remain open today.\n  PNNL plays a unique role in addressing our Nation's energy demands by \nfurthering research in climate change, advanced biofuels, and the \nelectric grid. In the 1990s, the lab helped create the Global Change \nAssessment Model to help institutions across the world explore the \nimpacts of climate change and the different policy proposals to address \nit. The scientists at PNNL have also developed a cutting-edge chemical \nprocess that transforms algae to crude oil in minutes, a technology \nthat could help our Nation reduce its dependence on foreign oil. And \nthe lab continues to lead in assessing cyber security threats by \ndeveloping and testing technology to help protect the electric grid. \nWith its stellar record of commercializing research, I have no doubt \nthat PNNL's work will continue to meet the United States' energy \nchallenges in the future.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, together Senator Cantwell and I have been \nproud supporters and advocates for PNNL here in the other Washington, \nworking to make sure our colleagues and the administration understand \nthe important research it conducts, and the significant contributions \nit makes to the Tri-Cities community. Over the past 50 years, PNNL has \nbenefited from a talented and committed staff of scientists, engineers, \nand nontechnical staff, a dedicated and committed operator in Battelle, \nand a strong partner in the Department of Energy. Congratulations to \nPNNL. I know Senator Cantwell and I look forward to PNNL's future \ncontributions to Washington State, the Nation, and the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/09/senate-section/article/S1333-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1333-S1334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AWARENESS WEEK\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I wish to express support for Multiple \nSclerosis Awareness Week, and to express the need for greater Federal \ninvestment in medical research.\n  I regret that severe weather prevented me from doing this last week, \nwhich was Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week. Multiple Sclerosis \nAwareness Week is a time for Americans everywhere to help others learn \nmore about multiple sclerosis, and to do what they can to make a \ndifference for those who suffer from this disease.\n  Multiple sclerosis can be devastating for the individuals who suffer \nfrom it, as well as their families. Each year, I am proud to work with \nSenator Collins to recognize multiple sclerosis patients, their \ncaregivers and their families by introducing a resolution in support of \nMultiple Sclerosis Awareness Week. Senator Collins and I worked \ntogether again on a resolution for 2015. I am pleased to say that this \nresolution, S. Res. 98, cleared the Senate on March 4. It is a \ntestament to the support of the Senate for the 400,000 Americans who \nare estimated to be suffering from this terrible disease.\n  While it is important to recognize the toll taken by multiple \nsclerosis, it is just as important to note that it is but one of many \ndebilitating or deadly diseases for which we lack a cure, or for which \nexisting treatments are inadequate. For many of these diseases, we have \nmade great progress due to federally funded biomedical research. \nUnfortunately, when medical inflation is taken into account, the \nNational Institute of Health's, NIH, budget has been\n\n[[Page S1334]]\n\nfalling for nearly a decade. This is unacceptable.\n  We must reverse the decline in NIH funding, and work to support other \nFederal research programs. The research done by these programs saves \nlives and improves quality of life. Funding these programs also makes \nsound economic sense: Federally funded biomedical research is an \nimportant driver of economic growth throughout the United States. In \n2013, NIH grants to my State alone supported an estimated 23,122 jobs. \nHowever, while the United States has been the world leader in medical \nresearch, other nations such as China are dramatically ramping up their \ninvestment, threatening our dominance in the field. We must work to \ncontinue investments that support patients, improve quality of life and \ncreate jobs that benefit all Americans.\n  In addition to advocating for NIH funding with Senator Burr--\nindicative of the bipartisan support the NIH budget enjoys--I am also a \ncosponsor of S. 289, the American Cures Act, which would authorize \nincreases in Federal research budgets at the NIH, but also at the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Defense \nHealth Program and the Veterans Medical and Prosthetics Research \nProgram. As we support those suffering from multiple sclerosis, we must \nalso remember the importance of federally funded medical research. We \ncannot afford, from a public health or economic standpoint, not to \nsupport biomedical progress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/09/senate-section/article/S1334-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           RECOGNIZING THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF AUTISM SPEAKS\n\n Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge Autism \nSpeaks as they celebrate 10 years as a leading organization dedicated \nto serving people with autism and their families. Founded by Bob and \nSuzanne Wright--concerned grandparents of a child with autism--on \nFebruary 25, 2005, Autism Speaks has grown to become not just a \nnational leader in the conversation about autism, but a world leader.\n  Ten years ago, Congress had yet to pass the landmark law now known \nafter two reauthorizations as the Autism CARES Act. The estimated rate \nof autism in the United States--according to data from the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention--at that time was about 1 in 150. Today, \nthe CDC estimates that the rate of autism is about 1 in 68. These same \nfigures show that my home State of New Jersey has the highest rate of \nautism incidence in the Nation, at 1 in 45. It is because of the \ncountless stories of people from my home State--from the parents \nseeking help for their children, to the teachers and counselors who \nhelp people on the autism spectrum to grow and develop, to the \nresearchers seeking to understand the causes of autism--that I am so \npassionately committed to confronting the challenge of autism, and \nAutism Speaks has been a leading voice on this issue for a decade.\n  Over the past 10 years, Autism Speaks has committed more than $525 \nmillion towards autism research, awareness, services, and advocacy. \nMost of these funds have gone to support science and medical research, \nincluding a new partnership with Google through the MSSNG program, \nwhich will sequence and store the world's largest database of genomic \ninformation on autism. Autism Speaks has raised awareness of autism \nworldwide, and has partnerships with organizations in 60 countries \nacross the globe. Autism Speaks provides funds for services for people \nwith autism through a number of grant programs and scholarships. It is \nalso no secret that Autism Speaks has served as a leading advocate in \nseeking Federal legislation to address the challenges of autism.\n  I am proud to have championed the passage of the Autism Coordination, \nAccountability, Research, Education and Support Act, also known as the \nAutism CARES Act, which passed this body by unanimous consent on July \n31, 2014. President Obama signed the Autism CARES Act into law on \nAugust 8, 2014. This law ensures that we continue the critical programs \nestablished in 2006 that provide for autism research as well as support \nservices to individuals on the autism spectrum and their families. The \nAutism CARES Act also makes a number of updates and improvements on the \noriginal law, starting with better organization and coordination of \nFederal autism programs, including new mechanisms to ensure that goals \nare being met and that Federal dollars are being spent efficiently. It \nalso requires that a report be written that focuses on the needs of \nyoung adults on the autistic spectrum or with another developmental \ndisability and the challenges they face when they transition from \nschool-based services to those they need during adulthood, which is a \ncritical need that often goes unspoken. Autism Speaks' advocacy on \nbehalf of those with autism and their families was vital to securing \noverwhelming bipartisan support for this law and ensuring that it \npassed through Congress and into law.\n  As they mark their 10th anniversary, I congratulate Autism Speaks for \nthe decade of great work that they do and express my gratitude and \nsupport as they serve as a leading voice in our national discussion on \nautism for decades to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/09/senate-section/article/S1334-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1334-S1335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. WILLIAM MEEHAN\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Dr. William \nA. Meehan, who has served with great distinction and honor at \nJacksonville State University for more than 40 years. I have known him \nsince he became president in 1999, and my admiration for his leadership \nand for Jacksonville State University has only grown each year. Dr. \nMeehan is retiring from his post as president of JSU on June 30, 2015, \nwhere his extraordinary leadership and vision will be sorely missed.\n  Dr. Meehan, along with his board of trustees, set a bold vision for \nJacksonville State University. He inspired his team to put students \nfirst, to inspire their intellectual curiosity, and to nurture critical \nthinking, communication skills, and creativity in problem-solving. He \nled the creation of the university's first bold strategic plan that \nfocuses on 21st-century skills.\n  President Meehan set a course for JSU that would not only move the \nuniversity forward but would fast-forward. Now, starting in the fall of \n2015, 500 entering freshmen at JSU will have an iPad; these students \nwill have global technology at their fingertips and be prepared for the \nrigors of their academic pursuits.\n  Under President Meehan's leadership JSU has excelled in many \npursuits. Research funding continues to rise, with more than $23 \nmillion in grants received last year, an increase of 515 percent. ACT \nscores of incoming freshmen have risen significantly over the past \ndecade, housing occupancy rates have improved from 64 percent to 90 \npercent, and student-to-faculty ratio is a stellar 17 to 1 under Dr. \nMeehan's leadership. JSU now enjoys a wide alumni base of more than \n60,000 in all 50 States and 95 countries around the world.\n  President Meehan has focused the university on innovative approaches \nsuch as the creation of 12 interdisciplinary centers that yield \npractical applications and solutions to real-world problems. These \ncenters concentrate on regional education, teaching and learning, \nsecurity, applied forensics, disaster and community resilience, disease \necology, ecosystems, behavioral studies, economic development, \nemergency preparedness, environmental policy, and veteran support.\n  Further, under President Meehan's leadership, JSU was just awarded a \n10-year reaffirmation of accreditation by the Southern Association of \nColleges and Schools Commission of Colleges, SACSCOC. JSU also enjoys \nsignificant program accreditations, attesting to the high-quality \nacademics provided. JSU is also fierce on the playing field and lays \nclaim to being the only school in the Nation to hold NCAA national \ntitles in football, men's basketball and baseball at the Division I or \nDivision II levels.\n  President Meehan has a deep and abiding commitment to partnerships \nwith K-12, community colleges, and the region in which he serves. He \nhas extensive service with community initiatives and on education, \neconomic development and community service strategic boards. His view \nof education is a seamless process flowing from kindergarten through \ngraduate school,\n\n[[Page S1335]]\n\nwhich results in a high quality talented professional workforce.\n  In addition to his strong and lasting legacy at JSU, President Meehan \nprides himself with a loving family. He is married to the former \nElizabeth Stevens and is father to twin boys Drew and Will and daughter \nCarol Grace. President Meehan is a devoted member of the First Baptist \nChurch of Jacksonville, AL.\n  On April 3, 2015, there will be a community-wide event to honor Dr. \nMeehan and his family.\n  On a personal note, I have found President Meehan to be one of \nAlabama's best university presidents. He is a driving force behind \nJacksonville State University's sturdy and solid growth in all areas, \nfrom strong increases in academic scores to building on the community's \nfine reputation. He has been a constant source of information and good \nadvice to me and the State's congressional delegation. He is, as all \nknow, deeply committed to this great university, whose unique character \nhe has further developed. I consider him a personal friend and a \nvaluable advisor.\n  Please join me in thanking Dr. William Meehan for his tireless \ndedication to Jacksonville State University and the surrounding \ncommunity. His exemplary service in higher education is an inspiration, \nand because of his leadership, JSU is one of the great jewels of \nAlabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/09/senate-section/article/S1335-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECOGNIZING SKYRUNNER\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, American small businesses are \ncultivating the Nation's brightest minds to innovate with ingenuity. \nTechnological advancement is a crucial element in fostering economic \ngrowth, increasing educational opportunities, and retaining high-\nskilled, technical jobs. Its importance cannot be understated. This \nweek, I am honored to recognize a small business that highlights this \nexciting aspect of today's economy. Congratulations to this week's \nSmall Business of the Week, Skyrunner, located in Shreveport, LA.\n  Stewart Hamel and Gilo Cardozo created the Skyrunner in order to \nreinvent recreational sports vehicles--an all-terrain buggy that also \nflies. Located in Northwest Louisiana, Skyrunner has combined a \nrecreational off-road vehicle with paragliding equipment that allows \nthe driver to use the machine in either of its two modes: car and \nflight. When in car mode, the vehicle boasts a rugged, dependable frame \nideal for demanding terrains. The flight mode deploys the latest in \nreflex paragliding technology, allowing the vehicle to float back down \nto the ground upon entering the air. The vehicle's top speed reaches \n115 miles per hour and can accelerate to 62 miles per hour in 4.3 \nseconds, which can launch the vehicle into the air with minimal effort.\n  The Skyrunner is more than just a recreational vehicle. With its \nminimum weight and outstanding performance, the Skyrunner has the \npotential to be incorporated as a valuable tool for various Federal \nagencies, local and State governments, and adventure enthusiasts alike. \nCEO Stewart Hamel of Shreveport believes his spin on the all-terrain \nvehicle will revolutionize the way we manage natural resources, protect \nFederal lands, aid in natural disasters, and adventure into the \nwilderness.\n  When moving its headquarters to Louisiana from the United Kingdom, \nSkyrunner struggled to get a unique military application approved to \nimport products because a bureaucrat at the U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency was blocking the application. Fortunately, I was able \nto advocate on Skyrunner's behalf to move past bureaucratic red tape, \nwhich allowed the company to begin pre-production of their product in \nShreveport, LA. With a handful of prototypes under their belt, \nSkyrunner begins mass production of their aerodynamic dune-buggy within \nthe next few months.\n  It is important that we cut through government regulations to allow \nour small businesses to act on innovative ideas and develop their \nproducts, market base, and workforce. By supporting these local small \nbusinesses, we can bring new technology, jobs, and state-of-the-art \nequipment to the areas that need it most. Congratulations again to \nSkyrunner for being selected as Small Business of the Week.

Mr. President, I rise in opposition to S.J. Res. 8 which \nwas passed by this body earlier last week but without a veto-proof \nmajority. It would protect corporations looking to rig union elections, \nalways at the expense of working families. Our labor movement helped \nbuild the middle class and fought for protections so many Americans \ntake for granted: overtime pay brought about because of collective \nbargaining, child labor laws, collective bargaining, and talking to \nMembers of Congress. Child labor laws, safer workplaces, unemployment \ninsurance, workers compensation were all brought about because people \ncame together in unions to organize and bargain collectively and came \ntogether in unions to talk to State legislators and Members of Congress \nin support of unemployment insurance and in support of safer work laws, \nchild labor laws, and workers' compensation.\n  I am wearing my lapel with a picture of a canary in a birdcage. It \nwas given to me 20 years ago at a workers' Memorial Day rally in \nLorain, OH, a city on Lake Erie, about 25 miles west of Cleveland. This \npicture illustrates what the mine workers used to do 100 years ago. \nThey took a canary down to the mines. If the canary died from lack of \noxygen or toxic gas, the mine worker got out of the mines.\n  He was on his own. He did not have a union in those days strong \nenough to protect him. He did not have a government in those days that \ncared enough to protect him. Since the days of the canary in the \nbirdcage down in the mines, we have seen Congress move forward on \nworkers' compensation, on minimum wage, on unemployment insurance, on \nprohibition of child labor. Much of that progress, many of those \nadvancements were because of the labor movement.\n  The growing voice of workers at the table was critical to all of \nthese advances made especially in the early part of the 20th century. \nThen it was Social Security, then it was Medicare and Medicaid, and \nthen it was all of the other things that helped us together, from Head \nStart to Pell grants, that helped create a middle class.\n  The labor movement got children out of the sweatshops and into the \nclassrooms. We expanded the rights of workers, we expanded the rights \nof women, we expanded the rights of people of color, and prosperity \nfollowed, shared by a growing portion of the country.\n  This week I led a delegation with Senator Scott--a Republican from \nSouth Carolina--to Selma, AL, and also to Montgomery and Birmingham to \nmark the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, where the young--mostly \nstudents--were nonviolently walking across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in \nSelma, and they were attacked by State troopers and local police and \nlocal deputized citizens of Alabama who participated in the melee and \nbeat up a number of those students. That got the Nation's attention, \nand the Nation pushed Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act. Labor \nunions were there. Labor unions were there to ensure if we work hard \nand we take responsibility, we can work in a safe environment, with \ndecent wages and benefits that allow us to take care of our family. But \nover the last decade that has changed. Workers in working families have \npaid the price. It used to be as profits went up, wages went up with \nthose profits because the workers who helped those companies be \nprofitable shared in the wealth they created.\n  That is not socialism. That is what happened in American capitalism \nfor decades after World War II. When profits went up, wages went up, in \nlarge part because unions at the bargaining table--through the process \nof collective bargaining--made sure that as their workers were \nincreasingly productive and companies did better and better and \nexecutive salaries went up, workers got a piece of the pie. But since \nthe 1970s, profits have gone up, but wages have been pretty stagnant. \nAmerican workers, our workers, continue to be the most profitable and \nmost productive and talented in the world, but the rewards for \nproductivity gains go to an ever-dwindling number of the richest \nAmericans. So as companies do better and better and stockholders do \nbetter and better, as profits go up and up, workers simply have not \nshared in the wealth they have created. They have not gotten their \npiece of the pie that they have earned. A big part of that is the \ndecline of the labor movement. Today the middle class accounts for the \nsmallest share of our national income since World War II. I will say \nthat again. The middle class accounts for the smallest share of our \nnational income since World War II.\n  It is not a coincidence that workers are reaping fewer of the rewards \nof their work while union membership has declined. That is why the \nNational Labor Relations Board proposed the rule change which is so \nimportant and why it is critical that Republican efforts--Republicans, \nagain, doing it on behalf of the largest corporations in America--are \nnot successful. This change would make modest, commonsense reforms to \nmodernize and streamline the election process by which workers form \nunions.\n  Right now companies seeking to block workers' rights to form a union \ncan delay elections sometimes up to 2 years, and they can drag out \nanti-union campaigns, they can intimidate workers, and they can find \nreasons to fire organizers. Delay works in the corporations' favor, as \nworkers leave the jobs, as workers who wanted the union get discouraged \nfrom the union, and delay almost always works on the side of the \nemployer.\n  Workers have a right to timely elections, the right to make up their \nown minds free of intimidation. Choosing one's representation is a \nright we cherish as Americans, and the National Labor Relations Board \nrule preserves it for our workers. The NLRB rule would cut back on the \nfrivolous court cases these corporations file over and over, these \nfrivolous court cases that companies use to stall elections. It would \nallow NLRB hearing officers to move forward with an election despite \npending litigation, the stalling tactics of frivolous lawsuits to \nensure workers aren't silenced by expensive legal battles.\n  These reforms will not only help workers but also help businesses \nthat act in good faith by streamlining the election process. This isn't \nan antibusiness move the workers and unions want to engage in, it is a \ncooperative move because moving quickly will bring everybody to the \ntable more quickly.\n  Right now the election process varies widely from State to State. It \nrelies on outdated forms of communication. This change will provide \ncertainty to workers and businesses alike and will allow both to file \nelectronically instead of only by mail, saving everyone time and money.\n  The lobbying effort by corporations on this is opposed to filing \nelectronically. Imagine that. It is 2015. Why do they want to do that? \nBecause they want to slow down the process. We know the consequences. \nStalling tactics have real consequences for workers. We have seen that \nover and over again.\n  In Massillon, OH--a city near Canton, south of Akron, in Northeast \nOhio--nurses at Affinity Medical Center elected to form a union in \nAugust 2012. Ann Wyat, who was awarded Nurse of the Year, was fired for \nleading the activities for unionization. The company did everything it \ncould to crush the unionizing efforts. I have been to that hospital. I \nhave met with those nurses. I have talked to them about this. The NLRB \nfound in favor of the workers, ruling that Affinity Medical refused to \nbargain and used illegal coercion and intimidation tactics, but still \nthe company refused to comply with Federal labor law. The matter went \nto Federal court, which ruled in favor of the nurses and filed an \ninjunction against Affinity Medical for failing to follow NLRB rulings, \nfor breaking Federal law.\n  Last month a jury in a civil court ruled unanimously and awarded the \nwrongfully terminated nurse $2 million in damages. It was serious \nenough what they did to this nurse that the jury ruled this nurse was \ndue $2 million, not just because of the inconvenience to the nurse and \nthe denial of her rights but the punishment for a company that breaks \nthe law.\n  Two and a half years later Affinity Medical is still stalling, and no \ncontract has been agreed to. The nurses in Massillon deserve better. \nAll workers deserve better. That is the importance of this NLRB ruling, \nto make it a more level playing field.\n\n[[Page S1341]]\n\n  That is what the American labor movement and our commitment to our \nworkers is about--to speak out on behalf of honest pay for an honest \nday's work. It is a story of a nation--and a government--respecting the \ndignity of work and reflecting the decency and dedication of workers.\n  It has been nearly 80 years since American workers' right to \ncollective bargaining has been confirmed. We have been doing this \nexperiment for 80 years. Rather than ending that right--and, with it, \nsqueezing the middle class--we should be working to preserve and expand \nthe rights of workers.\n  We need equal pay for women, and we need a minimum wage that supports \nfamilies. The minimum wage is worth 30 percent less today in real \npurchasing dollars than it was 30 years ago. Rather than eroding that, \nwe need to strengthen and grow the middle class, and we need paid \nfamily leave and paid sick leave.\n  We need to be able to make it a little bit easier for a union, for \nworkers to stand up to corporate interests when workers' interests are \nnot respected.\n  That should be on the Senate's agenda, but sadly it is not. Instead, \nwe have wasted our time on a resolution that we know will fail--all to \npay back political scoring points for those corporations that fund \ncampaigns and continue to dissolve organized labor. Without a veto-\nproof majority--and the resolution wasn't even close to that last \nTuesday--we know it is nothing more than an empty gesture. Just as \nimportantly, we know that if this resolution succeeded, it would do \nreal damage to working Americans by impeding their ability to come \ntogether to organize and to build the power they have in numbers to be \nable to get their fair share of the American dream.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/09/senate-section/article/S1341-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXTENSION OF CHIP FUNDING\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, it has been 1 month since I took to the \nfloor of this body to urge my colleagues to work together to extend \nfunding for the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP. Just this \npast month, I have held roundtables at almost every major city in Ohio \nto hear more about what CHIP means to people in Ohio. At each of these \nroundtables, I spoke with families who depend on CHIP to get their kids \nthe care they need.\n  Please understand that there are 130,000 Ohio children who are \neligible for CHIP and who have benefited from CHIP, and in almost every \ncase they are the sons and daughters of parents who work. These are \nparents who don't make enough money and don't work at a place where the \nemployer provides insurance. They may be $9, $10, $11 or $12 an hour \njobs. They are working, and the income they are making simply isn't \nenough to buy insurance for their kids and for their families. So that \nis the importance of rewarding work. These 130,000 children now have \ninsurance because of a bipartisan bill, the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. They have had it for 20 years.\n  It is in jeopardy now. Last week I was at the John R. Maloney Health \nCenter in Columbus, where more kids rely on CHIP than anywhere else in \nthe State. Some 13,000 children in Franklin County alone have health \ncoverage because of CHIP.\n  I spoke with Meredith Mendoza, a mother living in Gahanna, OH. She \nworks full time as a medical interpreter and makes too much to qualify \nfor Medicaid but not quite enough to afford health insurance, and her \nemployer doesn't provide it. Three of her four children have \naffordable, comprehensive coverage because of CHIP.\n  CHIP provides a sigh of relief for parents such as Meredith because \nCHIP means better access to comprehensive care for their children. \nProviding health insurance to low-income children isn't just the right \nthing to do; it is the smart thing to do.\n  This is why it is the smart thing to do. It allays the anxiety that \nso many families have about one of their children getting sick. It \nhelps families feel more secure that they won't be wiped out \nfinancially and in other ways by a sick child. It helps that child do \nbetter in school because the child will miss fewer days and the child \nwill feel better. It gives that child preventive care. It means \nvaccines, preventive health care, getting physicals, and it means \ndental care. It means better performance in school. CHIP means all of \nthat.\n  But the problem is that the CHIP law is until 2019. We authorized it \na couple years ago. The funding runs out in September. My Governor, the \nRepublican Governor of Ohio, wants to see us fund CHIP through 2019 so \nwe can continue to provide this insurance to all 130,000 children in my \nState.\n  If we don't act now, States will have to assume that CHIP is \nexpiring, as they go through their budget process. In other words, CHIP \nfunding runs out in September, but States--through their legislative \nprocess, where fiscal years often end during the early or mid-summer--\nneed to begin to work this through their budgets right now.\n  The Utah legislature adjourns this week, March 12; New Mexico, March \n21; Idaho, April 3; Tennessee, April 17; Alaska, April 19; Iowa, April \n21; and Montana, April 27. All but seven State legislatures adjourn \nbefore September. That makes the need to act even more dire.\n  That is why I was proud to introduce legislation last month called \nthe Protecting And Retaining Our Children's Health Insurance Program \nAct, or PRO-CHIP. It has been endorsed by every children's hospital in \nOhio, almost all of them around the country, several national groups--\nthe March of Dimes, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Children's \nHospital Association, Families USA--all kinds of people, and all kinds \nof groups.\n  CHIP just makes sense. Protecting health coverage, protecting health \ninsurance, and providing health insurance to low-income children isn't \njust the smart thing to do; it is the right thing to do.\n  I call on my colleagues to pass the CHIP refunding bill so that it \ndoesn't run out in September. Then States can plan so we can provide \nthe health insurance to 10 million children--almost all of whose \nparents work for a living and who simply don't make enough money to \nprovide insurance for their families.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/09/senate-section/article/S1341-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
