Mr. President, I took a trip up to Boston this weekend \nto address the Kennedy Institute. It was really a unique experience.\n  I was there in a full-scale representation of the Senate Chamber to \ndiscuss how the real Senate is beginning to get back to work. I \nexplained how committees are working again so Senators can have more of \na stake in the legislative process. I explained how we are allowing \nmore open floor debate and more amendment opportunities so Senators can \nbetter represent the voices of their constituents. And I explained how \nwe are getting the fundamentals back on track, such as passing a \nbudget.\n  This doesn't mean we have ironed out all the Senate's challenges. It \ndoesn't mean a new era of good feelings beckons just around the corner. \nAnd it doesn't mean an exertion of will won't be necessary every now \nand then. But it does mean that we are beginning to open the Senate \nback up, and in a way that will make shared achievement more likely.\n  Recall just last week, when we overwhelmingly passed a bill to give \nthe American people more of a say in President Obama's negotiations \nwith Iran. Although we weren't able to consider nearly the number of \namendments I would have liked to have seen considered to strengthen the \nbill, the legislation did provide for congressional oversight of any \ncomprehensive agreement.\n  The White House had been threatening to veto that bill, but it passed \nwith the bipartisan support of 98 percent of Senators anyway.\n  Later this afternoon, we will take up another Iran-related measure \nthat I hope we will pass with similar bipartisan enthusiasm.\n  The resolution of the junior Senator from Idaho is simple. It calls \non the administration to use the tools it has in pursuit of what should \nbe a bipartisan goal: securing the release of American citizens being \nheld as hostages by the regime in Iran.\n  One of those Americans, Saeed Abedini, has reportedly been held \nprisoner for what would appear to be the supposed crime of attempting \nto build and operate an orphanage--the supposed crime of building and \noperating an orphanage.\n  Beaten, denied access to medical care, and locked away in solitary \nconfinement--that is apparently how the Iranian regime deals with those \nwho dare to show love and compassion to others. No American should find \nthis acceptable, just as no American should find it acceptable to \nimprison unjustly a reporter or a grandson coming to see his \ngrandmother.\n  I think we can all agree that, at the very least, the American people \nshould\n\n[[Page S2744]]\n\nnot be rewarding Iran for its disgraceful human rights abuses and that \nwe should not be granting Iran access to the funding it desires to \nfurther its nuclear weapons program and terrorist proxies while this \nexploitation continues.\n  So I call on every Senator to join us in standing up for human \nrights. Let's pass Senator Risch's legislation later this afternoon.\n  I mentioned earlier that committees are beginning to get back to work \nin the new Senate. We have seen a lot of bipartisan committee action in \nrecent weeks. One standout achievement was the Finance Committee's \noverwhelming passage of bipartisan trade legislation, 20 to 6. It is \nincredibly important for American workers that we pass this bill. \nWithout it, foreign countries will continue to be able to discriminate \nagainst American products and American produce, while we have some of \nthe lowest duties in the world.\n  We need strong and fair trade legislation that expands Congress's \noversight over the administration and sets clear rules and standards \nfor its trade negotiators. That is the Bipartisan Congressional Trade \nPriorities and Accountability Act in a nutshell.\n  Yet some talk about preventing the Senate from even debating the \nbill. I would tell you, I think this would be a big mistake. The \nBipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act \nreported by the Finance Committee is already a strong bill, and we will \nhave an amendment process on the floor that will allow Members the \nopportunity to advance their priorities. Voting to proceed to a bill is \na vote that says this is worthy of debate--worthy of debate. Well, \ncertainly this bill is indeed worthy of debate, supported by the \nPresident of the United States.\n  So I commend Senator Hatch, Senator Wyden, and their colleagues on \nthe Finance Committee for getting us this far. My hope is that we can \ncontinue this debate tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/11/senate-section/article/S2744-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I must comment on some of the statements \nthat my friend the Republican leader has made.\n  We have been able to accomplish a few things during this work period, \nand the reason we have been able to do so is that we, the minority, \nhave cooperated.\n  For 4 years, my Republican colleagues in the minority objected to \neverything we tried to do--everything. I don't mean most everything; I \nmean everything. That was a plan they had. I have mentioned before and \nI will mention again that they decided they would make sure that Obama \nwas not reelected. That failed. And, No. 2, they were going to oppose \neverything he tried to do, and they have done that overwhelmingly. So \nit was really hard for 4 years to get things done.\n  Now, my friend the majority leader can talk all he wants about how \nmuch we have gotten done. Look at what we have been able to accomplish. \nThe majority of the measures we have done could have been done before, \nif Republicans had not objected to them and stopped us from moving to \nthose matters.\n  So we are going to continue to do everything we can to move measures, \nin conjunction with my Republican friends, but we shouldn't be hearing \na lot of speeches here about how great things are now, because every \ntime that happens I am going to come and tell everybody what has \nhappened for 4 years.\n  Government is all about priorities. What do we, as Senators, value \nthe most? With only a few days before the Memorial Day recess, I am \ndisturbed and distressed by the Republicans' priorities. For example, \nthe majority leader knows that the Federal highway program expires this \nmonth--not next month, this month. He knows that the highway trust fund \nruns out of money a few weeks later. Why then are Republicans making no \nserious effort to pass a long-term reauthorization of the Federal \nhighway program?\n  I can easily answer this question. They do not know how to pay for \nAmerica's next jobs bill. So with no as the answer, they again do \nnothing. Another short-term extension--this is one of many--one of \nmany. I think the last I remember, the last my staff brought me up to \ndate--I think it has been 12 or 15 times that it has been extended for \nshort periods of time. This is not good. This is such bad news for \nevery State--every State--because the directors of the departments of \ntransportation can't do anything long term. The only way to have a good \nprogram for construction is to be able to look ahead.\n  As the Senator from Vermont said the other day, Vermont's season to \nbe able to do construction work is very short, and they can't do long-\nterm planning when the money is only going to be available for a few \nmonths.\n  So this is really unfortunate and really too bad. I say again, this \ncould be America's next jobs bill. So it is really too bad.\n  We also have the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, known as \nFISA. It expires on June 1. It must be extended and reformed. Last \nweek, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the bulk \ncollection program, as currently constructed, is not authorized under \ncurrent law--meaning the law is illegal. It would be irresponsible for \nthis Congress to merely reauthorize and not reform. How can we \nreauthorize something that is illegal? We can't. We shouldn't. Why \nwould anyone agree to reauthorize a program which our circuit courts \ndeem to be illegal?\n  My friend the majority leader keeps talking about extending the \nprogram for 5\\1/2\\ years. Extending an illegal program for 5\\1/2\\ \nyears? That is not sensible. What should happen is that we should move \nforward and do something that is needed here; that is, do it all over \nagain.\n  The House of Representatives is sending us on Wednesday a new FISA \nbill, one that has been vetted by those people concerned about the \nrights of our citizens. They have determined that what the House has \ndone is good. They have passed it out of committee 25 to 2. Senator \nLeahy has a bill over here that is almost identical to that bill. So I \ncan't understand why we just don't wait until the House sends us that \nbill and we turn around immediately and give it to the President as \npassed by the House of Representatives. The President will sign it. He \nrealizes the program has to be changed. We cannot reauthorize a program \nthat is illegal.\n  So I hope we can move forward on what the House has done. To his \ncredit, Senator Leahy is not saying: We have to have my bill. He is \nsaying: If we don't do my bill--Senator Leahy's bill--pass the House \nbill. That would be good.\n  This is the only bipartisan, bicameral solution we have today that \nwill end the illegal bulk collection program in its current form and \nreform and reauthorize key provisions of FISA. Otherwise, I am not the \nonly one, Mr. President. I was told walking over here that the junior \nSenator from Kentucky is not going to let the extension of FISA take \nplace.\n\n  So why don't we just go ahead and get it done now; that is, when the \nHouse sends us their bill, say we are going to pass that and send it to \nthe White House for signature.\n  I hope the majority leader will reassess his priorities and instead \nchoose to protect Americans' civil liberties.\n  What is the business of the day, Mr. President?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/11/senate-section/article/S2744-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2744-S2745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to continue our efforts to \nhonor the 198 North Dakotans who gave their lives while serving in the \nVietnam war.\n  Together with Bismarck High School's 11th graders and their teachers, \nmy office is reaching out to the families and friends of these fallen \nheroes to learn about their lives. I am humbled to learn the tidbits \nshared with us about each young man, and I wish I could dedicate a \nwhole speech to each unique life.\n  Today, I also want to highlight the service and contributions to \nNorth Dakota and our country by my good friend Rick Maixner of \nBismarck. Rick served as a Navy pilot during the Vietnam war, earning \nmany distinguished medals for his aerial service. He then served the \nState of North Dakota as a State senator and member of the State house \nof representatives. In his forties, Rick earned his law degree. \nThroughout his career, he has always been a true public servant. I wish \nRick a very happy 70th birthday.\n  Now I will share about the lives of some of the North Dakotans who \ndid not come home from the Vietnam war.\n\n\n                              James Freidt\n\n  James Freidt was from Grand Forks and was born May 5, 1947. He served \nin the Army's 1st Cavalry Division. James was 20 years old when he died \non October 11, 1967.\n  James's father served our country during World War II and received a \nPurple Heart for his service.\n  James was one of 10 children and was one of three children in his \nfamily to die tragically.\n  His family and friends called him Jimmy and remember him as a very \nprotective brother who was always smiling. The siblings have fond \nmemories of playing games like kick the can together.\n  Shortly before beginning his tour of duty, James was able to attend \none of his sisters' weddings. The family is grateful for that good \nmemory of James. He was killed just over 1 month after arriving in \nVietnam.\n\n\n                        Robert ``Bobby'' Schmitz\n\n  Robert ``Bobby'' Schmitz was from Martin and was born February 25, \n1944. He served in the Army's 4th Infantry Division. Bobby was 25 years \nold when he died on September 16, 1969.\n  He was the oldest of six children. His father, Eugene, and a brother, \nDenny, also served our country in the Army. Growing up, Bobby helped \nhis family with farming and their dairy cows. He and his brother, \nDenny, were both on the wrestling team. Bobby graduated from NDSU with \na degree in business administration before serving in Vietnam. He was \nengaged to be married and was looking forward to starting his life with \nhis fiancee after he completed his service.\n\n\n                          Loren ``Doug'' Hagen\n\n  Loren ``Doug'' Hagen was born in Fargo on February 25, 1946. He \nserved as a Green Beret in the Army Special Forces. On August 7, 1971, \nDoug died. He was 25 years old.\n  Doug was the eldest of three sons. He was an Eagle Scout and an honor \nstudent. After graduating from NDSU with a degree in engineering, Doug \nenlisted in the Army. His goal was to find his best friend from high \nschool, who had gone missing in action 2 years prior.\n  Doug was killed 2 weeks into his second tour of duty, which was 1 \nweek prior to his being promoted to captain.\n  Doug was awarded the Medal of Honor for extraordinary heroism for his \nactions trying to rescue his fellow soldiers on the day he died. His \nMedal of Honor was presented to his father by President Gerald Ford at \nthe White House in 1974.\n  Last month, the American Legion Post 308 was created in West Fargo \nand was named the Loren ``Doug'' Hagen Post in his honor.\n  I am grateful to Jordan Haluzak, Jasmine Nice, Brady Bieber, and Alex \nLove of Bismarck High School for sharing with us about Doug and his \nfamily. Jordan is related to Doug and is learning more about his family \ntree through this project.\n\n\n                           Michael Himmerick\n\n  Michael Himmerick was from Valley City and was born November 28, \n1947. He served as a Navy medic for a group of 100 marines. Michael \ndied on April 6, 1967. He was 19 years old.\n  Michael was one of four boys, and two of his brothers also served in \nthe Navy. His family called him Mickey, and the marines he served with \ncalled him Doc. His bother Jim says Michael was one heck of a \nballplayer. He was scouted by four Major League Baseball teams when he \nwas a sophomore in high school, but he threw his arm out the summer \nafter his junior year.\n  Jim remembers Michael's plans to put his intelligence and military \nexperience to good use to become a doctor after completing his service.\n\n\n                             Larry Sikorski\n\n  Larry Sikorski was from Fairmount and was born April 1, 1947.

He had four brothers, Chet, \nRichard, Daniel, and Orrin--all of whom served our country in the U.S. \nmilitary.\n  Larry's nephew Dale was just 1 year younger than Larry. He cherishes \nhis memories of building a raft together, just like Huck Finn and Tom \nSawyer. They spent 3 days together building it, but, unfortunately, \nonce sent into the river, the raft did not float.\n  Dale remembers Larry as being outgoing and very intelligent. Larry \nearned straight A's while studying predentistry at the University of \nNorth Dakota before enlisting in the Marines.\n  Before going to Vietnam, when Dale dropped Larry off at the airport, \nLarry told Dale he would never see him again.\n\n\n                     Richard ``Jimmy'' Gaffney, Jr.\n\n  Richard ``Jimmy'' Gaffney, Jr., was from Fargo. He was born October \n23, 1948. He served in the Marine Corps' Echo Company, 2nd Battalion, \n7th Marines. Jimmy died on July 13, 1968.

During his first 13-month tour of \nduty in Vietnam, he was promoted to the rank of corporal.\n  In letters he mailed to his family, Jimmy wrote that he had made a \nlot of good friends in his fellow soldiers. When his first tour came to \nan end, Jimmy signed up for a second tour. Shortly after starting his \nsecond tour of duty, he was killed by a land mine.\n\n\n                              Richard Volk\n\n  Richard Volk was from Minot. He was born March 20, 1949. He served in \nthe Marine Corps' Echo Battery, 2nd Battalion, 12th Marines. Richard \ndied on March 19, 1969, the day before his 20th birthday.\n  Richard was one of 11 children. Three of the four sons in his family \nserved our country in the military. At one point, Richard and his older \nbrother, Stephen, were both serving in Vietnam at the same time.\n  Richard was a hard worker, working on the Soo Line Railroad and at \nhis brother-in-law's restaurant, the Pantry Cafe. His brother Virgil \nremembers that Richard loved hunting and fishing. Virgil said Richard \nwas the best looking in the family, and he knew it.\n\n\n                               Roger Svir\n\n  Roger Svir was from Park River and was born December 1, 1950. He \nserved in the Army's 1099th Transportation Company, called the River \nRats. Roger died on September 26, 1971. He was 20 years old.\n  He was the oldest of four children. His father and seven uncles \nserved our country in World War II and Korea.\n  During high school, Roger worked for a potato farmer and shared his \nearnings with his mother Virginia. His mother cherishes her memories of \nRoger and his cousin playing together along the river and of Roger \nfixing his car.\n  He had plans to buy a piece of land with his father and start their \nown farm. After Roger died, his father thought he was too old to start \nfarming alone, and he gave up on the dream.\n  Roger was proud to hold the same position as an Army River Rat ship \nfitter that his father held during World War II.\n\n\n                              Willis Weber\n\n  Willis Weber was from Valley City and was born July 1, 1937.

He served in the Army's 1st Cavalry Division. Steve died on \nOctober 31, 1969. He was 19 years old.\n  Steve's siblings remember him as an exceptional brother with good \nlooks and long eyelashes. He held closely the Native American values of \ntruth, life, family, and God. Steve was a firm believer in the United \nStates and the obligation to help those who asked, so he chose to \nenlist. He had plans to become a teacher after completing his service.\n  Steve's sister Elyse believes the whole town where they lived in \nCalifornia mourned Steve's death. It took the family years after his \ndeath to be able to say ``Vietnam'' and even longer to be able to say \nSteve's name.\n\n\n                             Steven Hanson\n\n  Steven Hanson spent his early childhood in Aneta and was born October \n27, 1949. He served in the Army's 101st Airborne Division. Steve died \non September 24, 1971. He was 21 years old.\n  His family and friends called him Steve. While growing up, Steven's \nfather Gordon served as a Lutheran pastor in the small town of Dazey, \nand the family traveled all over the world with his father's work as an \nArmy chaplain.\n  Steven's younger brother by 10 years, David, tells of a letter the \nfamily received from a fellow soldier whose life Steven saved the day \nhe died.\n  The letter described Steven as the pilot of his helicopter crew of \nfour soldiers. Steven's helicopter was shot down, but he was able to \nguide it to a semicontrolled crash landing. A fellow pilot of Steven's \nalso had survived a recent crash, and Steven was heard joking on the \nradio to tell so-and-so that he now has safely landed one, too.\n  One of his crew members was pinned under the helicopter and injured, \nso Steven helped to free him and called the evacuation helicopter. \nLater, a second chopper came and dropped down the cable to take Steven \nand his crewman to safety, but they were drawing fire, and the cable \ngave way. Steven fell 100 feet to his death.\n\n  In addition to his parents and siblings, Steven left behind a wife \nand son.\n\n\n                                Leon Cox\n\n  Leon Cox was from Jamestown and was born May 4, 1934. He enlisted in \nthe Army's 1st Infantry Division. Leon was 35 years old when he died on \nMay 17, 1969.\n  Leon, or ``Fuzzy,'' as he was affectionately called by his family, \nwas the seventh of 12 children. Leon grew up in a family dedicated to \nserving our country. His father served in World War I; two brothers, \nJohn and Alex, served in World War II; and two other brothers, Donnie \nand Jim, served in Korea.\n  Leon made a career out of his military service. During his senior \nyear of high school, he joined the National Guard and was deployed to \nKorea. After returning from his deployment, he joined the Army and was \nstationed in Germany, where he and his wife adopted a young girl named \nNicolette.\n  Leon's family remembers him as a proud man who believed in his \ncountry.\n\n\n                            Gunder Gunderson\n\n  Gunder Gunderson was from Walhalla and was born on July 25, 1941. He \nserved in the Army's 1st Cavalry Division. Gunder was 24 years old when \nhe died on November 23, 1965.\n  His fellow platoon soldier, Paul Guglietta, says that it was an honor \nto serve in the same platoon as Sergeant Gunderson. Paul remembers \nGunder as being dedicated, hard-working, and very intelligent. He \nalways drove himself to improve on everything he did. Paul was injured \nat the same time Gunder was killed and says that Gunder was a brave and \ncourageous soldier.\n\n\n                               Roy Wagner\n\n  Roy Wagner was from Bismarck and was born February 23, 1947. He \nserved in the Army's 1st Infantry Division. Roy died October 2, 1967, \nat the age of 20.\n  When Roy's brother Toby was drafted, Roy decided to enlist. When the \ndraft board met the brothers together, they decided that Toby should go \nhome because he had a wife and kids. Roy was more than happy to take \nToby's place.\n  While in Vietnam, Roy met a young Vietnamese boy whose parents had \nbeen killed in the conflict. It was Roy's intention to adopt the boy \nonce he married his fiancee while on leave, but Roy was killed before \nhe could marry his sweetheart or adopt the boy.\n  The day he died, Roy was in the field with five other soldiers. The \ngroup was led into a tunnel and ambushed. Three of the men were shot, \nand Roy knew that he needed to buy them some time. He stood at the \nfront of the group shooting at the enemy until all of the other men got \nout. He took seven bullets, saved all five men, and lost his life that \nday. All five men later contacted the family to tell them of Roy's \nself-sacrifice.\n  The AMVETS post in Bismarck is named after Roy to honor his service \nand his sacrifice.\n  I wish to thank Bismarck High School students Kyra Wetzel and Hunter \nLauer for sharing their research about Roy Wagner with us.\n  These are just a few of the brave men who served our country in \nVietnam. As we are now experiencing the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam \nwar, commemorated by an official proclamation by the President, I think \nit is important that we honor those who were killed in action and that \nwe share their stories with the next generation of North Dakotans, the \nnext generation of Americans, so they can truly appreciate the \nsacrifice of those who served us in the U.S. military and certainly the \nsacrifice which gave the last great measure of their lives.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst).

Madam President, at 5:30 p.m. today, we are going to vote \non S. Con. Res. 16, which calls on the Government of Iran to release \nAmericans who are being held. It also calls on the government to \ncooperate in finding, locating, and ultimately releasing Bob Levinson.\n  Robert Levinson, a retired FBI agent, while visiting the tourist \nIsland of Kish in the Persian Gulf, which is a part of Iran, suddenly \ndisappeared in 2007. It has been 8 years since his disappearance, which \noccurred on March 9, 2007. Since Bob is a part of this resolution, this \nis just another of a continuing conversation this Senator from Florida \nhas had over the course of the last 8 years. It is unbelievable that it \nhas been 8 years.\n  It wasn't until 2010--3\\1/2\\ years after his disappearance--that the \nLevinson\n\n[[Page S2747]]\n\nfamily received a proof-of-life video. Then, 1 year later, they \nreceived photographs of Bob, in April of 2011. Since then, nothing.\n  Now, if the Government of Iran really wanted to help, they could. It \nmay be that one part of the Iranian Government is keeping it from other \nparts. It could be the military--or the special part of the military, \nthe Quds Force--knows, and it may be that the Foreign Minister and the \nPresident of Iran do not have the facts. But there is somebody in Iran \nwho can produce the facts, if he wanted to, and that is the Supreme \nLeader.\n  Now, in this era of intense negotiations over preventing Iran from \nhaving a nuclear weapon and preventing them from the ability to develop \na nuclear weapon any time in the next 10 years without us at least \ngetting 1 year's advance notice so we can take countermeasures; in this \ntime of intense discussions with Iran--of course, it is constantly \nbrought up by our negotiating team, including Secretary of State Kerry, \nbut it is rather inexcusable that the only answer Iran has is, We don't \nknow anything about Bob Levinson.\n  This is, of course, personal to the FBI community because the hostage \nis one of their retired agents. It is personal to us in Florida as \nwell. Bob left behind a wife, seven children, and four grandchildren. \nChristine Levinson lives in Florida. A number of the FBI agents who \nhave tried to help her over the course of the years also live in \nFlorida. We are hopefully and prayerfully expectant that if it is a \nsuccessfully concluded negotiation to prevent Iran from having a \nnuclear weapon, that the Government of Iran will immediately release \nall Americans who are in jail whom we know about and likewise will make \nthe effort to find Bob and bring him home to his wife and seven \nchildren. That is what humanity would absolutely require.\n  So at this particular time--8 years-plus into the process--we make \nthis plea for former FBI agent Bob Levinson.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, spring in Washington, DC, is one of \nthe most beautiful times of the year, as it is in Connecticut and \naround the country. We have endured a tough winter in the Northeast--a \nlot of snow and a lot of cold. And now a lot of potholes are all around \nthe country. Spring means potholes, which are endemic not only to the \nNortheast but to our roads all around America. Potholes are just the \nlatest reminder of infrastructure challenges facing our Nation. That is \none reason why this week is, in fact, Infrastructure Week, a time when \nwe should be focusing on rail and roads, the decaying and aging \ninfrastructure that bedevils and hobbles our Nation as we seek to \ncompete globally. And our businesses in Connecticut seek to compete \nnationally as well as globally.\n  This time of year is also the beginning of the construction season, \nespecially in the colder regions of the country, such as the Northeast \nand Iowa, Nebraska, and the Midwest.\n  In Connecticut, construction workers are ready to go, ready to take \nadvantage of this chance to address our aging and decaying \ntransportation assets.\n  I know that trade is on our agenda this week. I urge and implore that \ntrade be set aside, that the trade bill be delayed--not forever, by any \nmeans. As the leader of our caucus has urged--our leader Harry Reid has \nimplored that we focus on infrastructure. We face a deadline. May marks \nthe last month of MAP-21, the law governing surface transportation \nfunding. On May 31--just 20 days from now--the authorization governing \nour highway trust fund will expire. That is right. There is a highway \ncliff that we are just days away from going over. This Nation will go \nover that cliff unless we act, and now is the moment. Now is the time. \nNow is our opportunity, and it is an opportunity that will not excuse \nus from acting.\n  The bill covers more than just funding. It is crucial to keeping our \nroadways safe. Now, 2014 was a record year for auto recalls, auto \nproblems, and issues. So part of what needs to be done in addressing \nthe expiration of MAP-21 is to make safety a priority. But it cannot be \nachieved if we don't address the fundamental challenges of our aging \ninfrastructure.\n  Fundamental reforms are needed at the NHTSA and other safety \nwatchdogs to make sure our constituents are safe. So one would think \nnow would be the time to discuss legislation that would fix our streets \nand stop potholes from imperiling our drivers and put construction \nworkers back on the job, providing a lifeline to nearly 2 million \nAmericans who have jobs directly tied to the transportation sector.\n  One would think we would want to cut down on our unemployment. In the \nconstruction sector, joblessness remains at a 10-percent level. You \nwould think that now is the time to be advancing a multiyear, long-term \nbill that will provide certainty to States and municipalities so they \ncan finalize planning for long-term projects. You would think that now \nis the time to take a hard look at our safety oversight agencies--\nNHTSA, the FRA, the Federal Highway Administration--and to make reforms \nand increase the tools that they have in fines and penalties they can \nexact to protect all who rely on our transportation network.\n  Unfortunately, the approach of this Congress is going to be, as \nengineers say, patch and pray. Patch the potholes, patch the roads, \npatch the railroads--even when the tracks are cracked, even when \nballasts are failing. Patch the bridges. Patch and pray. We are about \nto become a nation of patch and pray when it comes to decaying, \ndeficient roads, bridges, railroads, and all the vital nuts and bolts, \nliterally, that transport our Nation.\n  How ironic it is at this moment--when it is spring, when the \nconstruction industry is about to rely on the opportunities it has to \nput people back to work, and when many of us in this Chamber and others \nat school commencements will be talking about the big ideas, the big \nchallenges, the big dreams and hopes that our graduates have for the \nfuture--that we are thinking small. We are thinking about patching--\npatching our highway transit fund for months, maybe until the end of \nthe year. A nation that patches and prays cannot be exceptional, cannot \nbe a great nation when it comes to shortchanging investments in the \nvital facilities, in the nuts and bolts, in the roads and bridges that \nmake it a national competitor.\n  This kind of short-term extension of a highway and transit system \nfails to match the challenges that our Nation faces. We spend less and \ninvest less as a percentage of our gross domestic product than many \nother industrialized nations. Europe and China spend far more as a \npercentage of their gross domestic product than we do.\n  So I call on the leadership, my good friends and colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle, to make infrastructure our priority for this \nweek, as it should be for this decade. Within this decade, according to \nsome projections, one in four of our bridges will be 65 years or older, \nmaking them even more prone to decay and disrepair.\n  The consequences are real and costly. Bridges collapse, such as the \n50-year old Skagit River Bridge in Washington. The bridge collapsed \nsending cars into the river below. That wasn't a remote bridge. It was \nover Interstate 5, a major artery on the west coast. Of course, we all \nremember the 2007 bridge collapse in Minneapolis. We remember the \nMianus River Bridge collapse in Connecticut, the Bridgeport derailment \ndue to decaying and cracking tracks that were improperly repaired. We \nremember where lives were lost because of a derailment and the failure \nto invest in train communication and signaling that could have \nprevented that tragedy. We remember the railroad grade crossings where \ninsufficient investment in modern technology causes deaths all around \nthe country--hundreds of them every year--not to mention billions of \ndollars due to these collisions, derailments, crashes on the roads, \ncosting lives and imperiling our Nation's future.\n  A short-term patch robs our States and municipalities of the \ncertainty\n\n[[Page S2748]]\n\nthey need to contract what is essential to construction at the lowest \npossible cost in the most efficient way. The certainty and reliability \nin funding are essential to our municipalities, knowing what their \nresources will be not just this year but into the future and driving \nthe bargaining with contractors and subcontractors.\n  It is not just because of our rebuilding needs that we need this \ninvestment. There are also many other significant related issues that \nwe must address to keep our roads and bridges safe and reliable. We \nneed to ensure that trucks on the road aren't too big, that truck \ndrivers have enough rest, that our railroads are properly overseen, \nthat constant train control is implemented, that testing for physical \nand emotional problems is done regularly and reliably. And the long \nlist of NTSB regulations needs to be finally addressed and implemented.\n  We are in a time when we are talking to young men and women as they \ngraduate from school about those big ideas and about their futures and \ndreams, when we invoke what is best and brightest about America, our \nforesight, our strength, our courage to take risks, to invest in \nourselves and our future. It is the same spirit that led to the \nbuilding of the Erie Canal, the transcontinental railroad, and the \ninterstate highway system. Those initiatives were not partisan \ninitiatives. The greatest generation came back from World War II and \nbuilt the interstate highways under the leadership of President Dwight \nEisenhower. He was committed to making America one Nation in its roads, \ntying us and binding us together as a Nation through that investment. \nHe had the courage--as we should today--to say that what is great about \nAmerica is what we give back, what we are willing to invest--not only \nfor today, but for tomorrow.\n  And we are in danger today in this Chamber, in this Nation, of being \none of the first generations that left a lesser America for our \nchildren. Think of it--a lesser America at a time when the words \n``exceptional'' and ``exceptionalism'' trip off the tongues of many of \nour colleagues here in the Chamber. We need to match that rhetoric with \nreal action.\n  So today, let us resolve that we will debate and act on a long-term \ninvestment program to make sure that our roads and bridges, our \nrailroads and airports, and the ports that could make our Nation the \nenvy of the world are matching our rhetoric and our goals; that they \ntruly make us competitive for businesses in Connecticut and around the \nNation, competitive on the global scene, where competition has never \nbeen tougher and where our infrastructure needs to be better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am back on the floor again for ``Waste \nof the Week'' No. 10. As my colleagues know, I have been coming down \nevery week talking about waste, fraud, and abuse, ways we can save \ntaxpayer dollars. While we have not been able to address, \nunfortunately, tragically, the larger issue of the plunge into deficit \nspending and debt that our Nation has incurred over the past several \nyears, in particular--every effort, every bipartisan effort, has been \nthwarted by the President's refusal to engage in that, and yet the debt \nclock keeps on ticking. We keep spending more money than we take in. We \nkeep putting more and more of a burden on future generations as well as \nour own.\n  Our economy is not growing. One of the reasons is that we have not \nachieved fiscal responsibility in the Congress. So while we have not \nbeen able to address the larger issue, we can at least address some of \nthose issues that have been documented as waste, fraud, and abuse, \ndocumented by nonpartisan agencies that are established for the sole \npurpose of weeding out some of the excess spending that is not \nessential to the functioning of government.\n  We have put up some pretty interesting numbers relative to what we \nhave achieved. We are already over $50 billion of spending that has \nbeen documented as totally unnecessary. Some of it has been of the \ncharacter of somewhat ridiculous. Some has been very, very substantial. \nWe are going to continue to do this, pointing out to the American \ntaxpayer and pointing out to government officials who run these \nagencies and make these decisions that we simply cannot afford to keep \ndoing this.\n  So today's waste of the week will be addressed, hopefully by the \nAppropriations Committee, which will soon be working now that we have \npassed a budget, to distribute those funds that are necessary for the \nfunctioning of government.\n  I am urging them to use a system and means of identifying what is \nessential and what is not essential. Now, there may be some things we \nwould like to do but cannot afford to do. They need to be put on hold \nuntil we can do them. But there are a lot of issues and a lot of \nspending that goes on that should not be done in the first place.\n  Significant savings can be made. Even though it is much smaller than \nwhat we need to do, we certainly can address issues that will save \ntaxpayer dollars and better allocate spending for government. When our \nprevious Governor in Indiana, Mitch Daniels, took over, he brought with \nhim a resume as former Director of the Office of Management and Budget. \nThen-President George W. Bush gave him the name ``The Blade.'' ``The \nBlade'' looked at every small, little detail of spending and asked a \nlot of questions: Why are we doing this? How can we save? How can we \nmake government more efficient? There are essential things government \nhas to do. But when he became Governor, he transferred over some of \nthat knowledge and expertise and started doing some simple things, \nasking some simple questions: Why are we spending money on this? Why \nare we spending money on that?\n  Let me give you just a couple of examples. He gathered some of his \nstaff and said: I want you to go out and put pennies on the tires of \nour State-owned vehicles wherever they are housed. Wherever they are \nparked, put pennies on them. He waited several months then said: Now, \ngo back and identify all of those vehicles where the pennies are still \non the tire. In other words, they had not been moved. They had not even \nbeen shifted to another parking spot. They simply were just sitting \nthere.\n  Well, interestingly enough, he found that many unused State vehicles \nstill had the pennies on their tires. If they had been sitting there \nfor months and nobody was using them, why are we paying for them? Why \nare we spending money on purchasing these? Let's sell them off, save \nsome money for the State. They obviously are not necessary. It was one-\nthird of the State's fleet of vehicles.\n  Another thing he did, he said: Let's look at our printing costs. The \nState had its own printing operation. He said: Let's shop around and \nsee if the private sector can do this more effectively and efficiently. \nOf course, they did find a private vendor in Indiana that did it much \nmore effectively.\n  You save a lot of money just going black and white, maybe not quite \nas pretty, maybe not quite as attractive as color, but another way to \nsave money.\n  These are small things, but when you total them up for all the \nagencies that are in Washington--as was determined by the National \nCommission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform--it adds up to a lot of \nmoney. This government is more vast than anyone can possibly imagine.\n  Well, the Commission found that Federal agencies could save at least \n$10 billion over 10 years by cutting out waste in federal travel, \nprinting and vehicle expenses. So here again is a waste of the week \nthat we are going to add to our ever-increasing gauge of the waste. All \nthis now in red, these are what we have been adding, the 10 items that \nwe have added. We are approaching now, looks like $60 billion, on our \nway to $100 billion. I think we will probably be having to add \nextensions to this because, folks, I mean, there is waste out there, \nthere is fraud out there, there is abuse out there like you would not \nbelieve.\n\n[[Page S2749]]\n\n  Should we be dealing with the larger question, the runaway \nentitlements, the lack of money to adequately fund NIH or scientific \nresearch or education but we cannot because our budget is totally out \nof control? Should we be doing this? Absolutely. That is what we are \nhere for. We have talked about this for the last 5 years since I have \nbeen back here. Despite the many alternatives that have been presented \nto the White House, every one has been rejected.\n  So at least let's do those things where we have more control through \nthe appropriations process and better manage government, make it more \nefficient and make it more effective. That is why we point out these \nand we will continue to point out these in the ``Waste of the Week'' \nNo. 10. I cannot wait to get down here next week and do No. 11.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I have had the honor of \ngetting to know the family of Amir Hekmati. He is a patriotic American \nfrom Flint, MI, who served his country honorably and bravely as a \nmarine between 2001 to 2005 in Iraq and Afghanistan. He is an American \ncitizen but also became a dual citizen with Iran in order to be able to \nvisit his grandmother and other family members in Iran.\n  In August 2011, he was visiting his grandmother and was arrested by \nthe Iranian authorities and charged with spying for the CIA, which was \nabsolutely false, absolutely trumped-up charges. He was then deprived \nof a fair trial and jailed on those totally trumped-up charges.\n  Of those Americans confirmed as prisoners in Iran, none have been \nincarcerated longer than Amir Hekmati. He has been waiting the longest \nto come home. He has been tortured and is locked inside a prison \nnotorious for its deplorable conditions. Meanwhile, Amir's father is \nbattling terminal brain cancer.\n  I was very honored to have the opportunity to spend time with his \nfamily--his mom and dad, his sister and two brothers--who are \npassionately engaged in speaking out, coming to Washington, meeting \nwith the State Department, and making sure we are laser-focused on \ntheir brother and their son. My heart went out to them.\n  Think about all of us who have children. Speaking to his mom and dad, \nit is frightening, it is deplorable, it is outrageous, and he needs to \ncome home--now.\n  I can't say enough about the love and devotion of the Hekmati family. \nI have had a number of different opportunities to meet with them. \nAmir's sister and brother have frequently been here in Washington \nmaking sure we are not forgetting about this brave marine. They have \nfought so hard for his freedom.\n  I also commend Congressman Dan Kildee, who represents the Hekmati \nfamily in Flint, MI, for being a great partner and such a strong \nadvocate and a strong voice on behalf of Amir and his family.\n  This resolution is a clear message to the Iranian Government: If you \nwant a seat at the table with the rest of the international community, \nfree Amir Hekmati now, as well as all the other U.S. citizens who are \nbeing held as hostages.\n  Our thoughts and prayers go out to all of their families. I can tell \nthis body that for us, in Michigan, we are laser-focused on making sure \nthat Amir Hekmati's name is lifted up at every opportunity and that it \nis very clear that this brave, courageous marine who served our country \nso well has the full support of our government to bring him home \nimmediately.\n  I congratulate and thank my colleague.\n  I am proud to be one of the cosponsors on this resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Stabenow for her work on \nthis resolution and for her actions on behalf of her constituent who is \nbeing held in Iran. She has been extremely helpful in bringing this \nresolution forward.\n  I see Senator Risch on the floor. I want to state one last time that \nbecause of Senator Risch, we are on the floor tonight with a vote in \nthe full\n\n[[Page S2750]]\n\nSenate. I thank him for his tenacity and persistence on bringing this \nresolution forward so we can focus this on the four Americans being \nheld by Iran and our desire to get them home as soon as possible and \nuse every tool we have at our disposal on behalf of those Americans.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Risch for his leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, in addition to thanking Senator Risch \nfor his tenacity and making sure we are at this point with this \nresolution, I must also go back to our vote last week and the \nincredible work of our two colleagues in a bipartisan way, as we saw \nSenator Corker and Senator Cardin come together and lead us forward \nwith a very thoughtful piece of legislation that makes clear the role \nof the Senate in a very important process right now in negotiations.\n  I thank Senator Cardin as the ranking member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee for his leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senators \nPortman, Roberts, Kirk, Boozman, Sasse, and Rounds as cosponsors to S. \nCon. Res. 16.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for those kind words. \nI think ``tenacity'' is probably an appropriate description. I would \nlike to have had a little more tenaciousness if it would have resulted \nin better and stronger language than we have. Nonetheless, we have what \nwe have.\n  I congratulate Senator Cardin and Senator Corker for their hard work \non the resolution that passed here last week, which went out of here \nwith only one dissenting vote. It was a difficult process, to say the \nleast. Obviously, it didn't rise to the level that a lot of us wanted \nto see where this--it could have and should have been handled like a \ntreaty. Indeed, it is a treaty. No matter what else we call it, it is a \ntreaty. Nonetheless, we are where we are. We are better off with these \nthings than without. We are going to wait to see how this plays out as \nthe summer unfolds. We have an important June 30 date. Once an \nagreement is reached, then, of course, we will be on the floor talking \nand discussing the appropriateness of the agreement.\n  There are a lot of us who have been critical of how this started and, \nfor that matter, where we are today. In my judgment, this shouldn't \nhave even started. They shouldn't have even sat down at the table until \nthese people were released and/or accounted for. Nonetheless, we are \nwhere we are.\n  There are four people we are talking about in this resolution. \nSenator Stabenow already referred to one and gave an excellent \ndescription of where we are with that individual.\n  Next, I will talk about the gentleman from California who is also \nbeing held. His name is Jason Rezaian. He has been held on unspecified \ncharges since July 2014, denied access to an attorney in violation of \nIran's own laws and international norms, for that matter.\n  Robert Levinson of Florida is a retired FBI agent who was pursuing an \ninvestigation in Iran. He was abducted off Kish Island, off the coast \nof Iran, in March 2007. His whereabouts are unknown. The Iranian \nGovernment has repeatedly said they are not holding Levinson, but \ncertainly they should cut loose the information they have, and this \nresolution requires them to do so.\n  Lastly, I want to talk about Saeed Abedini. Pastor Abedini is a \nconstituent of mine from Idaho. He is an ordained Christian minister. \nHe has family in Iran. At the time he was arrested, he was in Iran \nvisiting family and in the process of setting up and running an \norphanage. He is detained at the present time in Evin Prison, which is \nconsidered one of the worst prisons in Iran. He has been held in \nsolitary confinement, physically beaten, denied access to necessary \nmedical treatment as a result of abuse, and was denied access to his \nlawyer until just before trial.\n  He had a trial. He was convicted and sentenced to 8 years. And his \noffense--his offense--was being Christian and pursuing Christianity in \na country where this is not permitted. I think it is shocking to most \nAmericans that this could happen in today's age. This is barbarous \nconduct by a regime that knows no shame. This man should be released \nfrom prison and should be released forthwith. He has done absolutely \nnothing that is a threat to the Iranian people or, in fact, to the \nIranian regime--those are two different things we are talking about \nhere. He has done nothing to be a threat to those people, and he should \nbe released.\n  Iran thinks it elevates its position in the world because it does \nthese kinds of things. It does not. Certainly it shows toughness but a \nbarbarian type of toughness that the world is not impressed with at \nall.\n  This is a country which pushes the envelope whenever it can. This \ncountry is at the heart of virtually every problem we have in that part \nof the world. Most importantly, it is one of if not the most prominent \npromoters of terrorism in the world. Some time ago, this was thought of \nas a good thing by some of these nations that do not rise to what they \nshould be on the world stage as an important nation. Terrorism was \nthought of as a way that things could be done.\n\n  In recent years, most every country has had it with terrorism. It is \nno longer something people look at and say, well, yes, there is \nterrorism, but you need to understand the root causes. That is gone. \nThat is absolutely gone. The other countries in this region have had it \nwith terrorism. Everyone in the region now is going to feel that as we \ngo forward.\n  There is hope for Iran. The demographics in that country show there \nis a real disconnect between the people of that country and the regime \nthat operates that country. Most notably, as a downside for the present \nregime, is that the demographics show that the vast majority of people \nwho are living in Iran are young people. They have a different view of \nthe world than the regime does. They are a secular people who do not \nwant to be ruled by religious fanatics, which is what they have today. \nIn any event, the world is watching how this is going to unfold.\n  Now, we have a clear expression--and Senator Cardin made mention of \nthis. We ran this as a separate document, not as part of the resolution \nwe passed last week. This is a separate document, where we are going to \nhave a clear expression of the nature and the view of what the world \nthinks of this and the view that the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Congress \ntakes of the conduct that Iran is engaged in. It is a separate view, \nand I believe it will be very helpful to the notion that this regime in \nIran cannot--cannot--continue down the road it is going down. The Iran \nregime purports to represent its people. What it is doing is not \nhelpful to the Iranian people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I will yield back all remaining time, with the consent \nof my colleague from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question occurs on agreeing to S. Con. Res. 16.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act expires \nin a matter of weeks. Senator Lee and I have a bipartisan bill, the USA \nFREEDOM Act, that would end the use of section 215 to authorize the \nbulk collection of Americans' phone records and replace it with a more \ntargeted program. It also would enact other important reforms to bring \nmore accountability and transparency to government surveillance. The \nSpeaker of the House of Representatives is bringing that same bill for \na vote in the House on Wednesday.\n  Last week, some opponents came to the floor to voice their \nopposition. They claimed that ending this bulk collection program would \nsomehow put our national security at risk and that a bulk collection \nprogram like this could somehow have prevented the September 11 \nattacks. But the facts are not on their side. According to the headline \nof a recent National Journal story, these opponents of reform have made \n``dubious claims in defense of NSA surveillance.''\n  I agree these claims are dubious, and I want to set the record \nstraight. I ask unanimous consent that the National Journal story dated \nMay 8, 2015, and an analysis by the Center for Democracy and Technology \nof similar claims be printed in the Record.\n  One Senator stated on the Senate floor last week, ``If this program \nhad existed before 9/11, it is quite possible we would have known that \n9/11 hijacker Khalid Al Mihdhar was living in San Diego and was making \nphone calls to an Al Qaeda safe house in Yemen.''\n  Another seemed to suggest that the bulk collection program would \n``have prevented 9/11.''\n  When I was chairman in the last Congress, the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee held six hearings to examine revelations about government \nsurveillance activities. At one of those hearings, I asked former \ncounterterrorism official Richard Clarke, who was working in the Bush \nadministration on September 11, whether the NSA bulk collection program \nwould have prevented those attacks. He testified that the government \nhad the information it needed to prevent the attacks but failed to \nproperly share that information among Federal agencies.\n  Senator Bob Graham, who investigated the September 11th attacks as \nhead of the Senate Intelligence Committee, likewise has said that \n``there were plenty of opportunities without having to rely on this \nmetadata system for the FBI and intelligence agencies to have located \nMihdhar.''\n  The other claim that has been made repeatedly over the past few days \nis that, as one Senator put it, the bulk collection of Americans' phone \nrecords is ``very effective at keeping America safe.'' Another stated \nthat the USA FREEDOM Act would ``eliminate the essential intelligence \nthis program collects.''\n  But numerous national security experts also have concluded that the \nNSA's bulk collection program is not essential to national security. \nThe President's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications \nTechnology, which included two former national security officials, \nstated:\n\n       The information contributed to terrorist investigations by \n     the use of section 215 telephony metadata was not essential \n     to preventing attacks and could readily have been obtained in \n     a timely manner using conventional section 215 orders.\n\n  Former Acting CIA Director Michael Morell testified to the Senate \nJudiciary Committee that the review group's recommendation to end the \ngovernment's collection of that data and instead allow the government \nto search phone records held by the telecommunications providers would \nnot add a substantial burden to the government. That is precisely the \napproach of our bipartisan USA FREEDOM Act.\n  Last year, the Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney \nGeneral supported a prior version of the USA FREEDOM Act, which also \nended bulk collection under section 215 and replaced it with a more \ntargeted phone records program. The Attorney General and the Director \nof National Intelligence said that our bill ``preserve[d] essential \nIntelligence Community capabilities.''\n  These individuals are not newcomers to the issue of national \nsecurity. They understand the threats to our Nation. They do not have a \npolitical motive. They have the best interests of our Nation and its \nvalues in mind when they tell us that we can end the dragnet collection \nof innocent Americans' phone records and keep our country safe.\n  The USA FREEDOM Act does not just end NSA's bulk collection program \nunder section 215. It also fills other gaps in our intelligence \ncapabilities. It ensures that the government can quickly obtain \nbusiness records--including phone records--in emergency situations. It \nensures that if a foreign terrorist who poses a serious threat comes \ninto the United States, the government does not have to stop its \nsurveillance while it seeks emergency wiretap authorization from the \nAttorney General. It ensures that the government need not terminate \nFISA surveillance on a foreigner who temporarily travels outside the \nUnited States. And it ensures that the FBI has the tools it needs to \ninvestigate individuals who are facilitating the international \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction on behalf of a foreign \ngovernment or terrorist organization. These provisions were requested \nby the FBI and by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. \nThey were not part of the bill that was filibustered in the Senate in \nNovember.\n  As a final matter, it is notable that there has been not a single \nSenate committee hearing on surveillance reform or the expiring \nprovisions in the 5 months of this new Congress under Republican \nleadership. There has been zero committee consideration on the bill \nthat Senator McConnell has now brought directly to the Senate calendar \nthat would simply extend these\n\n[[Page S2752]]\n\nexpiring provisions. I recall the promises that under new leadership \nthe committees would work through regular order, but that has not \noccurred even though it was apparent to all last year that we would \nneed to grapple with long-overdue reforms. This lack of leadership or \nany committee process is also despite the fact that the leader and \nchairmen of the relevant committees would not even let us debate the \nUSA FREEDOM Act last year, in part because it had not gone through \ncommittee. As the process moves forward this year, we should not be \nhearing complaints about lack of process from those who did not provide \nit.\n  There is no question that the USA FREEDOM Act contains far-reaching \nsurveillance reforms. But the most high-ranking intelligence officials \nin the country have endorsed its approach because it is a responsible \nbill. It protects Americans' privacy and keeps them safe. The Senate \nshould take up the bill once the House passes it this week.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From National Journal, May 8, 2015]\n\n     Republicans Make Dubious Claims in Defense of NSA Surveillance\n\n\n   Mitch McConnell and his cohort of security hawks are stopping at \nnothing to renew the spy agency's phone dragnet. But how fair is their \n                                defense?\n\n                            (By Dustin Volz)\n\n       One by one, several powerful Republican senators took to \n     the floor Thursday morning to offer one of the most full-\n     throated defenses of the National Security Agency's bulk \n     collection of billions of U.S. phone records since Edward \n     Snowden exposed the program nearly two years ago.\n       The crux of their argument is unmistakable: The NSA's \n     expansive surveillance powers need to remain intact and \n     unchanged to keep Americans safe from potential terrorist \n     threats--and if these powers existed before Sept. 11, 2001, \n     they may have assisted in preventing the attacks on the World \n     Trade Center and the Pentagon.\n       But some of the talking points used by Senate Majority \n     Leader Mitch McConnell and his allies appear to rely heavily \n     on assertions that are either dubious in their veracity or \n     elide important contextual details.\n       Here is a review of some of their declarations:\n       Claim: ``Not only have these tools kept us safe, there has \n     not been a single incident, not one, of intentional abuse of \n     them.''--McConnell\n       McConnell may have been referring specifically to the phone \n     records program here, but the NSA does not, as he implies, \n     have a spotless record.\n       According to a 2013 inspector general report, NSA analysts \n     intentionally misused foreign surveillance authorities at \n     least a dozen times in the past decade, sometimes for the \n     purpose of spying on their romantic interests. So-called \n     ``loveint''--short for ``love intelligence''--was revealed by \n     the inspector general in response to a letter sent from \n     Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who this year renewed a call \n     for the Justice Department to provide an update on how it was \n     handling its investigation into the alleged willful abuses \n     and to ``appropriate accountability for those few who violate \n     the trust placed in them.''\n       Additionally, a 2012 internal audit obtained by The \n     Washington Post found that the NSA has violated privacy \n     restrictions set in place for its surveillance programs \n     thousands of times each year since 2008. The audit found that \n     most--though not all--infractions were unintended.\n       Claim: ``The compromise legislation rolls us back to the \n     same thing we were doing pre-9/11.''--Senate Intelligence \n     Chairman Richard Burr\n       The USA Freedom Act referenced by Burr would reauthorize \n     three key surveillance provisions under the post-9/11 Patriot \n     Act. It would usher in several reforms related to \n     transparency and oversight, but it would keep those \n     authorities intact. Section 215 of the law would no longer \n     allow for the bulk collection of U.S. phone metadata by the \n     NSA, but the authority--created after 9/11--would still \n     exist.\n       Claim: ``The alternatives to the current program would not \n     come close to offering the capabilities that now enable us to \n     protect Americans.''--Sen. Tom Cotton\n       Cotton's claim does not align with the stance of Director \n     of National Intelligence James Clapper and then-Attorney \n     General Eric Holder, who sent a letter to lawmakers last year \n     expressing their support for an earlier iteration of the \n     Freedom Act. ``The intelligence community believes that your \n     bill preserves essential intelligence-community capabilities; \n     and the Department of Justice and the Office of the Director \n     of National Intelligence support your bill and believe that \n     it is a reasonable compromise that enhances privacy and civil \n     liberties and increases transparency,'' the letter read. That \n     version of the Freedom Act is widely considered more limiting \n     of surveillance powers than the one being debated in Congress \n     this year.\n       Claim: ``One alternative offered by opponents of this \n     program is to have phone companies retain control of all call \n     data and provide the NSA only the data responsive to searches \n     phone companies would run on the NSA's behalf. This is not \n     technologically feasible.''--Cotton\n       The reliance on phone companies to retain call data already \n     occurs, as they are the ones who turn the records over to the \n     government in bulk. Cotton, who voted for a pared down \n     iteration of the Freedom Act last year when he served in the \n     House, cites an 85-page study from the National Research \n     Council to support this assertion. But the Arkansas freshman \n     appears to be conflating its findings, which dealt with \n     whether software could fully replace bulk collection, with \n     what backers of the Freedom Act are attempting to do. \n     ``Although no software can fully replace bulk with targeted \n     information collection, software can be developed to more \n     effectively target collection and to control the usage of \n     collected data,'' the report concluded. Cotton's \n     reservations--that the new system may take longer than the \n     old--have more to do with process than technological \n     capabilities.\n       Claim: ``Here's the truth. If this program had existed \n     before 9/11, it is quite possible that we would have known \n     that the 9/11 hijacker Khalid al-Mihdhar was living in San \n     Diego and making phone calls to an al-Qaida safehouse in \n     Yemen. There's no guarantee we would have known. Theres no \n     way we can go back in time and prove it, but there is a \n     probability that we would have known and there's a \n     probability that American lives could have been saved.''--\n     Sen. Marco Rubio.\n       Rubio hedges his language several times with this claim, \n     but the statement still omits important context. As reported \n     by a 2013 ProPublica investigation, ``U.S. intelligence \n     agencies knew the identity of the hijacker in question, Saudi \n     national Khalid al-Mihdhar, long before 9/11 and had the \n     ability find him, but they failed to do so.'' Such missed \n     opportunities to disrupt Midhar's activities, which were \n     being monitored by at least as early as 1999, reflect a \n     failure of information sharing among intelligence agencies, \n     ProPublica notes, and are described in detail in the 9/11 \n     Commission report.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        Senators' Questionable Claims About NSA Bulk Collection\n\n\n                   Center for Democracy & Technology\n\n       On May 7th, 2015, the Second Circuit issued a ruling that \n     declared the NSA's bulk collection of Americans' phone \n     records was clearly unlawful under the Section 215 of the \n     PATRIOT Act. The ruling provided another boost to supporters \n     of surveillance reform and the backers of the USA FREEDOM \n     Act. Hours after the ruling came down, several U.S. \n     Senators--Mitch McConnell, Richard Burr, Tom Cotton, Jeff \n     Sessions, and Marco Rubio--took to the Senate Floor to \n     forcefully defend the NSA's bulk collection program. The \n     Senators made some statements that merit a second look, and \n     serious skepticism.\n       Claim 1: The NSA's bulk collection of Americans' phone \n     records is essential to national security. ``Under \n     consideration in the House and proposed in the Senate is the \n     socalled USA FREEDOM Act, which will eliminate the essential \n     intelligence this program collects.''--Senator Tom Cotton\n       The weight of public evidence contradicts this claim, based \n     on statements from experts with access to classified \n     intelligence:\n       The Attorney General and the Director of National \n     Intelligence stated that the USA FREEDOM Act of 2014--which \n     is in all ways identical to or less restrictive of \n     surveillance than the 2014 bill--``preserves essential \n     Intelligence Community capabilities'' though the bill ``bans \n     bulk collection under a variety of authorities.''\n       The President's Review Group noted in 2014 that the bulk \n     collection program yielded information that was ``not \n     essential to preventing attacks and could readily have been \n     obtained in a timely manner using conventional section 215 \n     orders.''\n       The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board stated in \n     2014: ``Based on the information provided to the Board, \n     including classified briefings and documentation, we have not \n     identified a single instance involving a threat to the United \n     States in which the program made a concrete difference in the \n     outcome of a counterterrorism investigation. Moreover, we are \n     aware of no instance in which the program directly \n     contributed to the discovery of a previously unknown \n     terrorist plot or the disruption of a terrorist attack.''\n       Senators Wyden, Heinrich, and Udall said in 2013 ``[We] \n     have reviewed this surveillance extensively and have seen no \n     evidence that the bulk collection of Americans' phone records \n     has provided any intelligence of value that could not have \n     been gathered through less intrusive means.''\n       It's important not to conflate the value of Sec. 215 \n     overall with the effectiveness of the use of Section 215 for \n     bulk collection. Sec. 215 can be used for targeted--not just \n     bulk--data collection. The USA FREEDOM Act ends nationwide \n     bulk collection under Sec. 215, but preserves the \n     government's ability to use Sec. 215 for more targeted \n     collection. What is at stake with USA FREEDOM is not Sec. 215 \n     itself, but its continued use for bulk domestic surveillance.\n       Claim 2: The bulk collection program could have stopped 9/\n     11. ``Here is the truth. If this program had existed before \n     9/11, it is quite possible we would have known that 9/11 \n     hijacker Khalid Al Mihdhar was living in San Diego and was \n     making phone calls to an Al\n\n[[Page S2753]]\n\n     Qaeda safe house in Yemen.''--Senator Marco Rubio\n       A bulk collection program was not necessary to find Al \n     Mihdhar prior to 9/11. As the PCLOB report details, the NSA \n     had already begun intercepting calls to and from the safe \n     house in Yemen in the late 1990s. Since the government knew \n     the number of the safe house, and Al Mihdhar was calling that \n     number, it would only be necessary to collect the phone \n     records of the safe house to discover Al Mihdhar in San \n     Diego. This is, in fact, an example of how targeted \n     surveillance would have been more effective than bulk \n     collection. The 9/11 Commission Report and other sources note \n     that the CIA was aware of Mihdhar well before the attack and \n     missed multiple opportunities to deny him entry to the U.S. \n     or intensify their surveillance of him.\n       Claim 3: Bulk collection of phone records is the same as a \n     subpoena. ``This is the way the system works and has worked \n     for the last 50 years--40 years at least. A crime occurs. A \n     prosecutor or the DEA agent investigates. They issue a \n     subpoena to the local phone company that has these telephone \n     toll records--the same thing you get in the mail--and they \n     send them in response to the subpoena.''--Senator Jeff \n     Sessions\n       The Second Circuit opinion, which held that the bulk \n     collection program is unlawful, included a lengthy comparison \n     of subpoenas and the bulk collection program. The bulk \n     collection program encompasses a vastly larger quantity of \n     records than could be obtained with a subpoena. The Second \n     Circuit notes that subpoenas typically seek records of \n     particular individuals or entities during particular time \n     periods, but the government claims Sec. 215 provides \n     authority to collect records connected to everyone--on an \n     ``ongoing daily basis''--for an indefinite period extending \n     into the future.\n       Claim 4: The government is only analyzing a few phone \n     records. ``The next time that any politician--Senator, \n     Congressman--talking head, whoever it may be, stands up and \n     says ``The U.S. Government is [. . .] going through your \n     phone records,'' they are lying. It is not true, except for \n     some very isolated instances--in the hundreds--of individuals \n     for whom there is reasonable suspicion that they could have \n     links to terrorism.''--Senator Marco Rubio\n       The NSA's telephony bulk collection program collects the \n     phone records of millions of Americans with no connection to \n     a crime or terrorism. These records are stored with the NSA \n     and they are analyzed scores of times each year when the NSA \n     queries the numbers' connection to the phone numbers of \n     suspects. Moreover, until 2014, when the NSA suspected a \n     phone number was connected to terrorism, the NSA analyzed the \n     phone records ``three hops'' out--querying those who called \n     those who called those who called the original suspect \n     number. As a result, the PCLOB estimated, a single query \n     could subject the full calling records of over 420,000 phone \n     numbers to deeper scrutiny. In 2014, the President limited \n     the query to ``two hops''--though this can still encompass \n     the full call records of thousands of phone numbers. The USA \n     FREEDOM Act (Sec. 101) would authorize the government to \n     obtain ``two hops'' worth of call records from telecom \n     companies.\n       Claim 5: The USA FREEDOM Act threatens privacy by leaving \n     phone records with telecom companies. ``[T]he opponents of \n     America's counterterror programs would rather trust \n     telecommunication companies to hold this data and search it \n     on behalf of our government. [. . .] In addition to making us \n     less safe, the USA FREEDOM Act would make our privacy less \n     secure.''--Senator Mitch McConnell\n       The telecom companies already have the phone records since \n     the records are created in the normal course of their \n     business. The USA FREEDOM Act does not shift control of data \n     from NSA to telecoms; the bill limits the volume of what the \n     government can collect from companies with a single 215 \n     order. Keeping the records with the phone companies, as the \n     USA FREEDOM Act would require, does not create a new privacy \n     intrusion, or, according to the public record, pose new \n     security risks. In contrast, it is highly intrusive for the \n     government to demand companies provide a copy of the \n     communication records of millions of Americans on a daily \n     basis to a secretive military intelligence agency for data \n     mining.\n       One last important point: The discussion on the Senate \n     Floor centered exclusively on the bulk collection of phone \n     records. However, the debate and the legislation before \n     Congress are not just about one telephony metadata program. \n     The debate is over whether the government should have the \n     authority to collect a variety of records in bulk under the \n     PATRIOT Act. The government has claimed that its bulk \n     collection authority extends to any type of record that can \n     reveal hidden relationships among individuals--which could \n     include phone call, email, cell phone location, and financial \n     transaction records. Framing the issue in terms of phone \n     records makes the problem seem much smaller than it is, \n     especially as our society moves into a technology-enabled \n     future where each individual will create much more metadata \n     and digital records than the present. The stakes are high.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/11/senate-section/article/S2753-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, the mission of U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection, CBP, is broad and diverse. The more than 60,000 men and \nwomen of CBP protect our borders at and between our ports of entry. \nThey protect Americans against terrorists and the instruments of \nterror. They enforce our laws and help boost our economic security and \nprosperity by facilitating trade and travel. While the roles they play \neach day may differ, the men and women of CBP share one common goal: to \nkeep our country a safe, secure, and resilient place where the American \nway of life can thrive. They provide selfless service to our country, \nand they do so with honor and distinction under an ever-present and \nevolving threat.\n  Today I wish to pay tribute to the agents and officers who have given \nthe ultimate sacrifice in the service of our Nation.

Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the \nRecord a copy of my remarks at the American Action Forum.\n  The remarks follow.\n\n\n                              DEREGULATION\n\n       Thank you for what the American Action Forum does. I've had \n     a burr under my saddle for a long time about too much federal \n     regulation. You always in politics have a hot button. That's \n     my hot button. I had it when I was governor. I had it when I \n     was university president. I had it when I was Education \n     Secretary. I probably contributed to it when I was Education \n     Secretary, so I've been trying ever since to do something \n     about it.\n       Overregulation is annoying. It wastes time and money. It \n     interferes with prompt decision making. It superimposes \n     someone else's judgment on what you are trying to do. It \n     interferes with your freedom. It comes from Washington, D.C. \n     It usually prescribes a one-size-fits-all solution that \n     doesn't fit the world in which you live.\n       Washington, D.C., in my judgment, is populated by too many \n     elected officials of both political parties who think that \n     because they take a one-hour airplane ride from their \n     hometown that they suddenly get smarter when they get here.\n       Nothing used to make me more mad as governor than to look \n     up towards Washington and see some member of Congress coming \n     up with a big idea, holding a press conference, passing a \n     law, taking credit for some great leap forward and sending \n     the bill to me as governor. Then the next thing I know, that \n     congressman would be home in Tennessee at the Lincoln Day \n     Dinner or the Jackson Day Dinner giving a big speech about \n     local control.\n       So, I've had a burr under my saddle for a long time about \n     too much federal regulation.\n       I'm going to talk about two subjects this morning: \n     overregulation of higher education and regulatory guidance. \n     What connects the two? Federal government overreach.\n       The case of higher education has been the piling up of \n     well-intentioned regulations that strangle our 6,000 colleges \n     and universities.\n       The case of regulatory guidance, is the inclination of our \n     legislative bureaucrats to forget why we had an American \n     Revolution, which was against a king.\n       The agencies appear to be using guidance, which is free of \n     notice and comment requirements--that means that people don't \n     have any say about it--to put binding requirements on \n     American businesses and colleges and universities.\n       To solve the problem, we have to have a bipartisan desire \n     in Congress to weed the garden of bad laws and bad \n     regulations and keep the garden clear. It's always been very \n     hard to pass a law in this country. It ought to be very hard \n     also to create a new regulation.\n       The good news is I believe for the first time in a long \n     time there is bipartisan interest in weeding that garden. I'd \n     like to tell you a little bit more about it.\n       Let me begin with higher education regulations.\n       Sometimes it's best to approach an issue with examples, so \n     let me use three.\n       More than a year ago, Vanderbilt University in Nashville \n     hired the Boston Consulting Group to determine how much it \n     costs the university to comply with federal rules and \n     regulations on higher education.\n       The answer: $150 million in a single year--or 11% of the \n     university's total non-hospital expenditures.\n       Chancellor Nick Zeppos of Vanderbilt says this adds about \n     $11,000 in additional tuition per year for each of the \n     university's 12,700 students.\n       The second example:\n       Each year, twenty million families fill out a complicated \n     108-question form called the FAFSA.\n       108 questions. Now, think about this: 20 million American \n     families fill this out. If you want a federal grant or you \n     want a federal loan, you fill this out first and you fill it \n     out every year. Now, you can do it online. After you've done \n     it a few times, you know, it gets easier. But, several of our \n     experts in this country that came from all different \n     directions testified before our education committee in \n     Congress that we only really needed two questions. What's \n     your family income? And what's the family size? That would \n     give you 95% of what you needed to know for the government to \n     give out the $100 billion of student loans and the $33 \n     billion of Pell grants that it gives out every year.\n       So, Senator Michael Bennet and I and Cory Booker and \n     Richard Burr and Johnny Isakson, six of us, Democrats and \n     Republicans have a bill in to cut this FAFSA to the two-\n     question short form.\n       Now, we may not get that far, but it'll be closer to this \n     short form than the FAFSA when we get through.\n       And, the President has even said he thinks it is a good \n     idea. In his budget, he said that he could think of thirty or \n     forty questions that could come off this.\n       Now, these aren't evil people who are putting questions on \n     here. They're just well-intentioned people who say now, I've \n     got an idea. I'd like to know this. They don't think about \n     the fact that 20 million people have to fill this out.\n       The problem with this is a couple of obvious things. One is \n     it wastes time and money. But the other problem is it \n     discourages people from going to college who we'd like to \n     have go.\n       The President of Southwest Community College in Memphis \n     said he thinks he loses 1,500 students each semester because \n     of the complexity of the form.\n       Tennessee has become the first state to make community \n     college tuition free for qualifying students, but first every \n     applicant must fill out that FAFSA. Now that tuition is free, \n     the principle obstacle to a Tennessee high school senior \n     going to community college is a federal, complicated set of \n     regulations.\n       The third example: Ten years ago and again three years ago, \n     surveys by the National Academy of Sciences--not the \n     Republican National Committee, the National Academy of \n     Sciences--found that principle investigators spend 42 percent \n     of their time associated with federal research projects on \n     administrative tasks instead of research.\n       I then asked the head of the National Academies what a \n     reasonable period of time would be for a researcher to spend \n     on administrative tasks. He said, well, maybe about 10 \n     percent.\n       Now, think about how many billions we could save.\n       We, taxpayers give NIH $30 billion a year, $24 billion to \n     research and development at colleges and universities.\n       The President has asked for another billion for NIH \n     research. The Republican House has said let's make it $2 \n     billion more every year.\n       But, the average annual cost of NIH research projects is \n     $480,000, and if we reduce spending on unnecessary red tape \n     by $1 billion, we could potentially fund a thousand multi-\n     year grants.\n       Twenty-four of the 30 billion dollars that goes to NIH goes \n     to university-based research. At the moment, 42% of an \n     investigator's time is spent on administrative tasks.\n       This piling up of regulations is one of the greatest \n     obstacles to innovation and cost consciousness in higher \n     education has become--and the reason is us, the federal \n     government.\n       So if all of us created the mess, then it is up to all of \n     us to fix it.\n       We've begun to do that.\n       Here's the good news: On the Senate education committee, \n     which I chair, there is a bipartisan effort to examine these \n     regulations--to identify which ones are the problems, and see \n     if we can get rid of them or simplify them.\n       More than a year ago, four members of the committee--\n     Senator Mikulski and Senator Bennet, two Democrats, and \n     Senator Burr and I, two Republicans--asked a group of \n     distinguished educators to examine the federal rules and \n     regulations for colleges and universities. They returned to \n     us a document with 59 specific recommendations--requirements \n     and areas for Congress and the Department of Education to \n     consider--including 10 that were especially problematic. They \n     told us that the colleges and universities were operating, in \n     their words, in a ``jungle of red tape.''\n       I had a letter from a university president in Missouri who \n     said that in his forty years of being in higher education, he \n     had never been so oppressed by regulations.\n       Most of these are common-sensical things; for example, in \n     our proposal to fix the student aid form, we suggest that \n     students apply for student aid in their junior year in high \n     school instead of their senior year.\n       Now, why does that make so much difference?\n       Well, one is if you know in your junior year, you're going \n     to get this much in a Pell grant and this much in a loan, you \n     can shop around and know where you're going.\n       Right now, you don't know the amount of money you'll get \n     until after you're already enrolled in the school. So, that \n     doesn't make any sense. In addition, you're asked in your \n     senior year, which is the current way they do it, to report \n     what your tax returns showed. Well, you haven't filed your \n     tax returns yet for that year.\n       So, there are all sorts of unnecessary confusion, which \n     could be solved by just moving the application time from the \n     senior year in high school to the junior year.\n       The other area is regulatory guidance. Now, this is the \n     kind of subject that usually puts people right to sleep--\n     unless you're a\n\n[[Page S2755]]\n\n     victim of it--but we see the ugly effects of government \n     overreach.\n       It's very hard to pass a law in this country for good \n     reason.\n       Our revolution was against a king. We chose to be \n     represented by an elected Congress. They're the ones who are \n     supposed to make the laws. Our Constitution makes it pretty \n     hard to pass a law.\n       In some of our laws, Congress delegates some of the details \n     of how to implement the laws to federal agencies--but it does \n     it with specific requirements: Before those rules come out, \n     the people who are governed have a chance to have a say. \n     That's called notice and comment before you have a federal \n     regulation.\n       Well, what's happening today is some of these agencies are \n     using something called guidance to get around that \n     requirement, to use the guidance as a non-binding way to tell \n     the people. It's supposed to be a non-binding way of \n     suggesting to people how to follow regulations that are \n     properly in place, but what the agencies are doing is using \n     the guidance to make new laws.\n       For example, I asked the assistant secretary for Civil \n     Rights at the U.S. Department of Education last year, whether \n     she expects our more than 6,000 colleges and universities to \n     comply with her agency's guidance--these are issued without \n     any sort of notice or comment.\n       She answered, ``We do.''\n       So her agency is writing detailed guidance governing 22 \n     million students on 7,200 campuses and it could be some \n     individual's whim or idea.\n       How frequent is this? The distinguished group of educators \n     led by the Vanderbilt Chancellor and the University of \n     Maryland Chancellor who recommended the 59 changes in \n     regulations that I talked about said that every single work \n     day, on average, there's a new guidance or rule from the U.S. \n     Department of Education to a college and university.\n       So, here you are operating with federal grants and loans at \n     a Catholic college out in the Midwest, and you know every \n     single day something's going to change from Washington about \n     what you're doing.\n       It's very important that Congress make the law. It's very \n     important because Congress answers to the people. That's the \n     way our government ought to work.\n       When Congress isn't doing its job, the people can throw the \n     bums out. It is very hard for the voters to do that to an \n     unelected bureaucrat, say in the Civil Rights office at the \n     U.S. Department of Education.\n       So, I'm about to begin a project with one of our \n     outstanding new senators, James Lankford of Oklahoma, to \n     examine whether agencies are abusing guidance and how to \n     solve that problem.\n       Thank you for inviting me here to speak to you today about \n     this burr that's been in my saddle for a long, long time.\n       I think that what you are trying to achieve here today is \n     one of the most important things we can do in Washington--\n     because as hard as it is to pass a law, it is almost harder \n     to end one.\n       Probably the most famous comment about that came from \n     Ronald Reagan who said: ``No government ever voluntarily \n     reduces itself in size. Government programs, once launched, \n     never disappear. Actually, a government bureau is the nearest \n     thing to eternal life we'll ever see on this earth!''\n       Well, at least once or twice, I'd like to prove him wrong.\n       Thank you very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/11/senate-section/article/S2755-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2755]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING REED BARRETT\n\n Mr. BARRASSO.

Mr. President, today, I rise to speak in \ncelebration of International Migratory Bird Day. Every spring, \nwaterfowl such as canvasback ducks, northern pintails and goldeneyes, \nraptors such as sharp shinned hawks, broad winged hawks and kestrels, \nwarblers, buntings, and of course orioles like Maryland's State bird, \nthe Baltimore oriole, return north for the summer to breed, raise \nhatchlings, and brighten the United States' wildlife spectrum during \nthe months of spring and summer. It is an exciting time of year for \nbirders and naturalists who enjoy witnessing the annual return of these \nspecies from the tropics and who contribute billions of dollars to the \noutdoor recreation economy on travel and gear to support their passion \nand interests in the very special bird species who return to the United \nStates every year.\n  In support of conserving these important migratory bird species, in \nMarch I reintroduced legislation to reauthorize the Neotropical \nMigratory Bird Conservation Act. This bill promotes international \ncooperation for long-term conservation, education, research, \nmonitoring, and habitat protection for more than 350 species of \nneotropical migratory birds, such as the Baltimore oriole. Through its \nsuccessful competitive, matching grant program, the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service supports public-private partnerships in countries \nmostly in Latin America and the Caribbean. Up to one-quarter of the \nfunds may be awarded for domestic projects.\n  More than half of the bird species found in the U.S. migrate across \nour borders, and many of these spend winter in Central and South \nAmerica. This legislation aims to sustain healthy populations of \nmigratory birds that are not only aesthetically beautiful but also help \nour farmers through consumption of billions of harmful insects and \nrodent pests each year, providing pollination services, and dispersing \nseeds. Migratory birds face threats from pesticide pollution, \ndeforestation, sprawl, and invasive species that degrade their habitats \nin addition to the natural risks of their extended flights. As birds \nare excellent indicators of an ecosystem's health, it is troubling \nthat--according to the National Audubon Society--half of all coastal \nmigrating shorebirds, like the common tern and piping plover, are \nexperiencing dramatic population declines.\n  The Baltimore oriole is a neotropical migratory bird whose song and \nbright orange and black plumage brightens all of the Northeastern and \nMidwestern United States each spring and summer. Sadly, Baltimore \noriole populations have steadily declined despite legal protections \nunder the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 and the State of Maryland's \nNongame and Endangered Species Conservation Act. Likewise, the iconic \nred knot, whose legendary 9,000-mile migration centers on a stopover in \nthe Mid-Atlantic States, is decreasing in population quickly. Threats \nto these beloved Maryland birds are mainly due to habitat destruction \nand deforestation, particularly in Central and South America, where the \nbirds winter. In addition, international use of toxic pesticides \ningested by insects, which are then eaten by the birds, is \nsignificantly contributing to their decline. Conservation efforts in \nour country is essential, but investment in programs throughout the \nmigratory route of these and hundreds of other migratory bird species \nis critical.\n  The goal of International Migratory Bird Day is to raise awareness \nabout the plight of these birds during this special time of year when \nthese birds are returning to the United States, and my legislation is \ncritical to the conservation of these species.\n  The Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act has a proven track \nrecord of reversing habitat loss and advancing conservation strategies \nfor the broad range of neotropical birds that populate the United \nStates and the rest of the Western hemisphere. Since 2002, more than \n$50.1 million in grants have been awarded, supporting 451 projects in \n36 countries. Partners have contributed an additional $190.6 million, \nand more than 3.7 million acres of habitat have been affected. In 2014, \nthe grants totaled $3.6 million, with $12 million in matching funds \nacross 20 countries.\n  On International Migratory Bird Day 2015, I am working with the \nsponsors of the bipartisan sportsmen's package, S. 659, and the \nleadership of the Environment and Public Works Committee to incorporate \nthe Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act into this legislation \nas it moves through committee. While sportsmen do not hunt songbirds, \nthe financial assistance this program provides for habitat conservation \nprovides cobenefits for games domestic species like wild turkey, deer, \npheasant, elk, and quail, and the international investments benefit the \nconservation of sandhill cranes and migratory waterfowl that are \npopular game species. The resources of this program also help conserve \ncritical wetland habitat which is incredibly important coastal and \nfreshwater fish species like bass, perch, and sturgeon, as well as both \nmigratory and resident duck and geese species. Incorporation of the\n\n[[Page S2757]]\n\nNeotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act into the bipartisan \nsportsmen's package would add a new element of game species \nconservation that will help ensure the presence of important game and \nfish species for generations of hunters and anglers and outdoor \nenthusiasts alike.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this simple reauthorization of this \ncost-effective, budget-friendly program that has been highly \nsuccessful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/11/senate-section/article/S2757-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO GREGORY LEACH\n\n Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President. I wish to commend the courageous \nactions of Gregory Leach, a transportation security specialist-\nexplosives at Lihue International Airport and a resident of Hawaii. Mr. \nLeach helped to rescue three swimmers who were in danger of drowning. \nHis heroism and selflessness deserve to be recognized on the Senate \nfloor today.\n  Mr. Leach moved to Hawaii from Arkansas earlier this year to work as \na transportation security specialist-explosives at Lihue International \nAirport. As a transportation security specialist-explosives, he \nsupports screening operations to protect our transportation system from \nexplosive threats.\n  This past March, on the beach in Wailua, Kauai, Mr. Leach noticed \nthree swimmers who were struggling to return to shore. He acted quickly \nand decisively, grabbing a rescue buoy and swimming out to the group. \nOne of the swimmers was unconscious, and Mr. Leach brought the man back \nto shore. He returned to the water to help the remaining two swimmers, \nand once all the swimmers were safely on the beach, Mr. Leach conducted \nchest compressions on the unconscious man until rescue personnel \narrived. Mr. Leach's selfless efforts ensured that two of the swimmers \nsurvived. Unfortunately, the unconscious man later passed away.\n  According to Mr. Leach's supervisor, lead transportation security \nspecialist-explosives Duane Samiano:\n\n       Transportation Security Specialist-Explosives Leach did not \n     hesitate to render aid in a life threatening situation to \n     individuals he did not know. His actions speak greatly to his \n     courage, selflessness and dedication to others. I am very \n     proud to have him on my team. He is a great asset as a \n     Transportation Security Specialist-Explosives and represents \n     himself and this agency with excellence.\n\n  I commend Mr. Leach for his actions, and I hope that his courage \nserves as an example for others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/11/senate-section/article/S2757-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/11/senate-section/article/S2757-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/11/senate-section/article/S2757-4", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2757-S2758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n        EC-1542.

A bill to expand the HUBZone program for communities \naffected by base realignment and closure, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to better \ntailor the HUBZone program to meet the needs of communities affected by \nthe closure of U.S. military installations through the Base Closure and \nRealignment, or BRAC, process. I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleague from Maine, Senator King, in introducing this legislation, \nthe HUBZone Expansion Act of 2015.\n  This issue hits close to home for both Senator King and me. When \nLoring Air Force Base closed in 1994 through the BRAC process, my home \nof Aroostook County lost 15 percent of its population. Senator King \nlives in Brunswick, ME, which also experienced a considerable drop in \npopulation when it lost a major naval air station in 2011.\n  Military bases are often the economic heart of the towns and cities \nin which they are located, and communities can struggle for years to \novercome the closure of those facilities as the redevelopment process \nis often lengthy and riddled with bureaucratic hurdles.\n  In recognition of these challenges, Congress passed legislation \nproviding HUBZone status for 5 years to military facilities closed \nthrough the BRAC process. This status allows small businesses located \non former military bases or in ``economically distressed communities'' \nwith high rates of poverty or unemployment to obtain certain Federal \ncontracting preferences.\n  According to the Small Business Administration, there are currently \n107 BRAC-related HUBZones in the U.S. Unfortunately, for many of the \ncommunities surrounding closed military bases, HUBZone status has not \nalways had the intended effect. One of the reasons is simple. The law \ndefines the geographic boundaries of a BRAC-related HUBZone to be the \nsame as the boundaries of the closed base. When combined with the \nrequirement that 35 percent of the employees of a qualifying business \nlive within the HUBZone, redevelopment efforts are slowed or stalled. \nVery few people actually live on these former bases, making it \ndifficult, if not impossible, for businesses and job seekers alike to \nmeet the HUBZone requirements.\n  We have seen this very situation play out following the closure of \nthe former Brunswick Naval Air Station, which closed as a result of the \n2005 BRAC round. When the Navy left, Brunswick and its neighbor, \nTopsham, lost more than 2,400 military and civilian personnel. These \ntwo towns have a combined population of just 22,000, so losing these \njobs has taken a significant economic toll. Because so few people live \nwithin the actual boundaries of the former naval air station, its \nHUBZone designation does not provide the help these communities need.\n  To address this first concern, our legislation would permit \nprospective employees who live just outside of the boundaries of the \nclosed base to count toward the 35 percent requirement. Employees who \nlive in the census tracts touching the boundaries of the closed base, \nand in census tracts that touch those census tracts, would be included, \nproviding a large enough pool of potential workers for qualifying \nbusinesses to locate within the HUBZone.\n  A second reason that businesses have difficulty benefiting from the \nHUBZone program is because closed bases are given HUBZone status for a \nlimited time, only 5 years. Local economic development agencies working \nto attract new businesses to a former base cannot begin until a base is \nclosed, and this process can take many years. Because HUBZone \npreferences only apply for 5 years from closure, businesses often lose \nyears of program eligibility. In fact, the Association of Defense \nCommunities reports that in the seven years following the 2005 BRAC \nround, only \\1/3\\ of former base property has been transferred to local \nauthorities for redevelopment. Our legislation would address this \nproblem by extending the period of time for which a closed base is \neligible for HUBZone status from 5 years after closure to 8 years.\n  Steve Levesque, the Executive Director of the Midcoast Regional \nRedevelopment Authority, oversees the redevelopment of the former \nBrunswick Naval Air Station. Steve supports this legislation, \nexplaining that BRAC facilities do not have adequate residential areas \nneeded to support the 35 percent residency requirement and that \nbusinesses cannot ``realize the HUBZone benefits for BRAC'd \ninstallations as envisioned by Congress.''\n  Heather Blease is a Mainer who has explained the need for these \nchanges as well. Heather is an entrepreneur who opened a small business \nat the former Brunswick Naval Air Station in 2013. She has described \nthe HUBZone law as ``flawed,'' because the limited number of residences \non the base make it nearly impossible to meet the 35 percent residency \nrequirement. She says that this proposed legislation ``would make all \nthe difference in the world'' for her business, and would create needed \njobs for Mainers.\n  The Association of Defense Communities also supports our effort to \ntailor the HUBZone program to make it more usable by closed military \nbases.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the HUBZone Expansion Act of 2015 to \nhelp communities and the people most affected get back on their feet \nafter the loss of a military installation, closed through the BRAC \nprocess.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Association of Defense Communities,\n\n                                                      May 5, 2015.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Armed Services Committee, United States Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jack Reed,\n     Ranking Member, Armed Services Committee, United States \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mac Thornberry,\n     Chairman, Armed Services Committee, House of Representatives, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Adam Smith,\n     Ranking Member, Armed Services Committee, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman McCain, Ranking Member Reed, Chairman \n     Thornberry and Ranking Member Smith: On behalf of the \n     Association of Defense Communities Board of Directors, I want \n     to express my deep appreciation for your leadership to \n     support defense communities across the country. As the \n     leading organization serving communities with active, \n     realigned or closed military installations, ADC represents \n     more than 200 communities, states, regions and their \n     partners.\n       Communities impacted by the Base Realignment and Closure \n     (BRAC) process continue to face severe, long-term economic \n     distress. To assist in these communities' recovery, Congress \n     authorized additional support in the Small Business \n     Reauthorization Act\n\n[[Page S2762]]\n\n     of 1997, declaring that military bases closed by BRAC are \n     eligible for designation as Historically Underutilized \n     Business Zones (HUBZones). As you know, the HUBZone program \n     allows small businesses in disadvantaged areas additional \n     opportunities to compete for federal procurements. Eighteen \n     years later, the HUBZone designation remains integral for \n     attracting small businesses to these communities and is one \n     of the few available federal tools supporting a community's \n     economic transition.\n       While the intent of Congress was to provide the HUBZone \n     designation to help closed military installations attract \n     small businesses, one aspect of the HUBZone program actually \n     works against these redevelopment areas. Under the current \n     law, 35 percent of a business's employees also must live in a \n     HUBZone area. Because a military installation's HUBZone area \n     encompasses only the boundaries of the former base, many \n     closed military installations do not have a substantial \n     number of HUBZone-certified residential areas from which to \n     draw a sufficient workforce for the businesses desiring to \n     locate on those properties. It often is impossible, \n     therefore, for a business looking to relocate to these \n     communities to qualify for HUBZone status. Further, there \n     traditionally are many delays in the multi-year process \n     through which local redevelopment authorities assume control \n     of former federal property, leaving little or no opportunity \n     to recruit small businesses before the statutory five-year \n     HUBZone designation has expired.\n       ADC is honored to endorse the current bipartisan \n     legislative language offered by Senators King and Collins and \n     Representatives Pingree and Poliquin, and support its \n     inclusion in the FY 2016 National Defense Authorization Act \n     (NDAA). The proposal would (1) allow small businesses in \n     HUBZone areas to recruit personnel from a broader workforce \n     and (2) extend from five years to eight years the period for \n     which a BRAC-impacted community could be designated a \n     HUBZone. If adopted, this language would be extremely helpful \n     to communities across the country that have supported our \n     nation's military missions but now are struggling to overcome \n     distinct economic challenges. ADC is hopeful that your \n     colleagues will support this provision and its inclusion in \n     the FY 2016 NDAA as that important legislation moves forward.\n       Thank you again for your leadership on this and other \n     important issues. We look forward to working with you and \n     your colleagues to further strengthen America's defense \n     communities.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                   Michael Cooper,\n     President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/11/senate-section/article/S2762-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2762]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 176--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 2015 AS ``NATIONAL BRAIN \n                       ANEURYSM AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Mr. MARKEY (for himself, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Durbin) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 176\n\n       Whereas a brain aneurysm is an abnormal saccular or \n     fusiform bulging of an artery in the brain;\n       Whereas an estimated 1 out of every 50 people in the United \n     States has a brain aneurysm;\n       Whereas brain aneurysms are most likely to occur in people \n     between the ages of 35 and 60, and there are typically no \n     warning signs;\n       Whereas brain aneurysms are more likely to occur in women \n     than in men by a 3-to-2 ratio;\n       Whereas young and middle-aged African-Americans have a \n     higher risk of brain aneurysm rupture compared to Caucasian \n     Americans;\n       Whereas, based on a 2004 study, the most recent year with \n     readily-available data, the combined lost wages of survivors \n     of a brain aneurysm rupture and their caretakers for 1 year \n     were $138,000,000;\n       Whereas various risk factors can contribute to the \n     formation of a brain aneurysm, including smoking, \n     hypertension, and a family history of brain aneurysms;\n       Whereas approximately 6,000,000 people in the United States \n     have a brain aneurysm;\n       Whereas an unruptured brain aneurysm can lead to double \n     vision, vision loss, loss of sensation, weakness, loss of \n     balance, incoordination, and speech problems;\n       Whereas a brain aneurysm is often discovered when it \n     ruptures and causes a subarachnoid hemorrhage;\n       Whereas a subarachnoid hemorrhage can lead to brain damage, \n     hydrocephalus, stroke, and death;\n       Whereas, each year, more than 30,000 people in the United \n     States suffer from ruptured brain aneurysms, 50 percent of \n     whom die as a result;\n       Whereas, annually, between 3,000 and 4,500 people in the \n     United States with ruptured brain aneurysms die before \n     reaching the hospital;\n       Whereas a number of advancements have been made in recent \n     years regarding the detection of aneurysms, including the \n     computerized tomography scan, the magnetic resonance imaging \n     test, and the cerebral arteriogram, and early detection can \n     save lives;\n       Whereas various research studies are currently being \n     conducted in the United States in order to better understand, \n     prevent, and treat brain aneurysms;\n       Whereas the United States spends only $1.30 per person for \n     research each year on the approximately 6,000,000 people of \n     the United States who suffer from brain aneurysms; and\n       Whereas the month of September would be an appropriate \n     month to designate as ``National Brain Aneurysm Awareness \n     Month'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 2015 as ``National Brain Aneurysm \n     Awareness Month''; and\n       (2) continues to support research to prevent, detect, and \n     treat brain aneurysms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/11/senate-section/article/S2762-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2762-S2763]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 177--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF MAY 10 THROUGH MAY 16, \n                   2015, AS ``NATIONAL POLICE WEEK''\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Coons, Ms. \nMurkowski, Ms. Heitkamp, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Donnelly, Mr. Blunt, Mr. \nSchumer, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Rounds, Mr. Menendez, Mr. \nAlexander, Ms. Warren, Mr. Cotton, Mr. Brown, Mr. Tillis, Mr. Franken, \nMr. Thune, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Scott, Mr. Kaine, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \nWarner, Mr. Rubio, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Toomey, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Wicker, \nMrs. Feinstein, Mr. Tester, and Mr. Peters) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, some in this body seem to be on the verge \nof approving the largest trade deal in our Nation's history with little \ndebate, one rushed hearing, and barely any understanding of what we are \nsigning on to. The last time Congress considered fast-track was 13 \nyears ago; the Senate spent 3 weeks considering that bill.\n  But some would like to condense consideration of the biggest trade \ndeal we have ever debated--ever debated--and have it done in advance of \nMemorial Day; the reason--they know that the more we talk about U.S. \ntrade policy, the more the American public does not like it.\n  Trade promotion authority will give up Congress's authority to amend \ntrade agreements. Not only will this affect the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership agreement and so-called TTIP, the United States-European \nUnion agreement, it will affect any trade deal until 2021. With TPP and \nTTIP, 60 percent of the world's GDP is at stake. Millions of American \njobs are on the line. This is too important to rush through with little \ndebate and little congressional input.\n  With the Memorial Day recess approaching, there simply is not enough \ntime to consider fast-track in a manner that allows full debate and \nconsideration of amendments. We do not even know if the Senate will \nvote on all four bills as a package that we considered in the Finance \nCommittee or just vote on fast-track or some combination of the four. \nIf we voted on fast-track alone, we would be giving new rights to \ncorporations while turning our backs on critical trade enforcement \nmeasures and the workers who are left behind by unfair foreign trade. \nImagine if just TPA--fast-track--gets to the President's desk; we will \nhave done nothing on enforcement and we will have left out help for \nworkers who have lost their jobs because of what this institution did. \nFast-tracking fast-track will prevent us from having serious debates on \nissues from public health, to the auto industry, to international \nmonetary policy.\n  During the Finance Committee's consideration of this bill, I filed 88 \namendments to the package of four bills, 81 of those to fast-track \nalone. I offered a number during markup, and I will offer more on the \nfloor. I know Senator Menendez had a very important amendment--and he \nwill be speaking in a moment--in the Finance Committee that was \nadopted. I know other colleagues have amendments that will be \nconsidered. We should debate these amendments to legislation as \nimportant as this.\n  Now the majority leader, who just spoke, wants us to rush this bill \nthrough, to fast-track fast-track in the last few days just to get it \ndone, just so the public won't be able to find out what is in it. We \nowe it to the American people to not rush through something as \nimportant as our national trade policy. We owe it to the American \npeople to spend the limited time available on the floor passing a job-\ncreation bill, such as the highway bill, which is set to expire May 31, \nrather than a provably job-killing trade agreement, as NAFTA was, as \nPNTR was, as CAFTA was, as South Korea was.\n  We know the real answer, that this deal amounts to more empty \npromises. If it were really good for the American worker, why can't the \nAmerican worker see it? More corporate handouts, more worker sellouts.\n  As many of my colleagues know, this trade agreement simply doesn't \nwork for us. This is what is wrong with the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n  First, with China, there is no guarantee it will not join later. \nThere is no prohibition in this language--as far as we can see, with \nthe limited access to the text--that China can't backdoor into this \nagreement without a vote of Congress, without any examination from the \nAmerican public.\n  Second, what happens to competition? American workers are paid a \nliving wage. In Vietnam, the average wage is $3 per day. How do we \ncompete with that? With currency. We know China has gamed the currency \nsystem year after year after year. They don't play by the same rules as \nwe do.\n  Corporations shift from democratically elected governments to \ncorporations. We have seen it in tobacco, we have seen it in public \nhealth, and we have seen it with minimum wage, where corporations can \nsue foreign governments. Corporations in one country can sue a \ngovernment, even if that government has passed a law democratically \nthrough a democratic process.\n  Our trade deals amount to corporate handouts and worker sellouts. \nPeople in my State know what has happened since NAFTA. They promised \nNAFTA would bring millions of jobs. Instead, we have lost 5 million \nmanufacturing jobs in this country since 1994. It is only since the \nauto rescue in 2010 that we have begun to gain those jobs back.\n  We know our trade deals were for small business to compete with \ncompanies abroad that pay their workers pennies on the dollar. These \nforeign companies don't have to abide by the same American laws that we \ndo.\n  With so much to do at home and so much at stake in this deal, we \nshouldn't be rushing the process of considering fast-track. We should \nbe working on a living wage. We should be working on paid sick and \nfamily leave. We should be working on equal pay for equal work. We \nshould be working on investment to infrastructure and innovation. \nInstead, the majority leader\n\n[[Page S2765]]\n\nwants to fast-track, fast-track. He wants to put this trade agreement \non the floor as quickly as possible.\n  This body should deliberate methodically and carefully before we \nagree to become a rubberstamp for the White House's trade policy. It \nhas not worked for us in the past; it will not work for us in the \nfuture. This body should not be rushing to give up our authority on \ntrade.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/11/senate-section/article/S2765-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2765-S2766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND TRADE\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to draw attention to the \ninternational plight of human trafficking and its relationship to our \nNation's trade agenda.\n  According to the State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report, \n``Human trafficking'' is about recruiting, harboring, transporting, \nproviding or obtaining a person for compelled labor or commercial sex \nacts through the use of force, fraud or coercion. It is an unacceptable \nglobal scourge that must end and cannot be rewarded by any trade \nagreement.\n  Sexual exploitation, forced labor, forced marriage, debt bondage, and \nthe sale and exploitation of children around the world should be a \nglobal cry for justice. But as Benjamin Franklin once said: ``Justice \nwill not be served until those who are unaffected are as outraged as \nthose who are.''\n  Today, we are all outraged at the violence, the psychological terror, \nand the greed that drives human trafficking. We are outraged that there \nare 50 million refugees and displaced people around the world, the \nlargest number since World War II, many of whom are targets of \ntraffickers. We are outraged that 36 million women, children, and men \naround the world are subjected to involuntary labor or sexual \nexploitation. We are outraged when we hear that over 5 million of them \nare children, that forced labor generates about $150-plus billion in \nprofits annually, the second largest income source for international \ncriminals next to the drug trade.\n  For the victims of these crimes, the term ``modern slavery'' more \nstarkly describes what is happening around the world, and it must end.\n  The Trafficking Victims Protection Act requires that the State \nDepartment annually publish a Trafficking in Persons Report, known as \nthe TIP Report, which ranks each country based upon the extent of \ngovernment action to combat trafficking.\n  Tier 3 in that listing is the worst of these rankings. It indicates \nthat a government does not comply with the Trafficking Victims \nProtection Act's minimum standards, and it is not making significant \nefforts to do so. Tier 3 countries are those that have not even taken \nthe most basic steps to address their human trafficking problem and \nhave not provided protection for trafficking victims.\n  In the most recent TIP Report published, the State Department ranked \n23 countries as tier 3. Countries such as North Korea, Iran, and Cuba \nhave flaunted international legal norms and threatened to upend global \nsecurity.\n  I am most disappointed to say that Malaysia--a middle-income country \nby most standards, a party to the Trans-Pacific Partnership \nnegotiations--has the resources and the wherewithal to address human \ntrafficking within its borders but has for years failed to take \nsufficient action to warrant an upgrade on the TIP Report. So it is \nunfortunate that the scale of the human trafficking problem in Malaysia \nis vast, and it is in sectors that will directly benefit from increased \ntrade when TPP trade agreement is concluded.\n  The State Department's 2014 Trafficking in Persons Report states:\n\n       Many migrant workers on agricultural plantations, at \n     construction sites, in textile factories, and in homes as \n     domestic workers throughout Malaysia are exploited and \n     subjected to practices indicative of forced labor, such as \n     restrictions on movement, deceit and fraud in wages, passport \n     confiscation, and imposition of significant debts by \n     recruitment agents or employers.\n\n  Most disappointingly, the State Department wrote last year that the \nMalaysian Government was neglecting the problem. The 2014 TIP Report \ncontinues:\n\n       Malaysian authorities continued to detain trafficking \n     victims in government facilities for periods of time that \n     sometimes exceeded a year; victims had limited freedom of \n     movement and were not allowed to work outside the facilities. \n     The government provided minimal basic services to those \n     staying in its shelters; NGOs--with no financial support from \n     the government--provided the majority of rehabilitation and \n     counseling services. . . . The government identified 650 \n     potential victims in 2013--significantly fewer than the 1,096 \n     potential victims identified in 2012. It reported fewer \n     investigations (89 compared to 190) and fewer convictions \n     (nine compared to 21) compared to the previous year.\n\n  Furthermore, in January, 2013, the Malaysian Government implemented a \npolicy that places the burden of paying immigration and employment \nauthorization fees on foreign workers rather than on employers, \nincreasing the risk of workers falling into debt bondage. And, while \nnearly a year has passed since the State Department issued its 2014 \nreport--as recently as April 17, this past month--the U.S. Ambassador \nto Malaysia said the Malaysian Government needs to show greater \npolitical will in prosecuting human traffickers and protecting their \nvictims if the country hopes to improve on its current lowest ranking \nin the TIP Report.\n\n  It is precisely to combat crimes such as these that Congress has \ntaken action this year to fight modern slavery. Earlier this year, the \nForeign Relations Committee, under the leadership of Chairman Corker, \nheld an important hearing on human trafficking on February 4. On April \n22, Congressman Chris Smith of New Jersey held a House subcommittee \nhearing examining the State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report, \nemphasizing the need to maintain the integrity of the tier ranking \nsystem.\n  On that same day, April 22, the Senate voted 99 to 0 for the Justice \nfor Victims of Trafficking Act, authored by Senator Cornyn. Later that \nday, in the Committee on Finance, a bipartisan group of 16 Senators \nvoted for my amendment to prohibit fast-track procedures from applying \nto any trade agreement with a country ranked as tier 3--the worst \nranking.\n  Congress has never before approved a free-trade agreement, much less \nfast-tracked one, with any country while it was ranked tier 3, and I do \nnot believe we should start now.\n  I want to be clear. The amendment I offered and which was adopted \nwith a bipartisan vote in the Committee on Finance is not meant to \nsingle out Malaysia or any other country. My antitrafficking provision \nto the fast track bill is a simple bipartisan statement of our American \nvalues. Contrary to the administration's comments, my amendment is not \na poison pill. I don't know when trying to fight human trafficking \nbecomes a poison pill. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  Senator Cornyn, perhaps the Senate's strongest advocate for victims \nof human trafficking, voted for my amendment. Senator Portman, the \nformer U.S. Trade Representative, voted for my amendment. Senator \nWyden, the ranking member of the Committee on Finance and coauthor of \nthe Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act, \nalso voted for my amendment.\n  In total, 10 members of the Committee on Finance who voted for my \namendment also voted for the fast-track bill. I cannot believe we would \nhave seen such a strong bipartisan vote from so many Senators who \nsupport fast track if this amendment were truly a poison pill.\n  Now, the administration has recently said this amendment would remove \nour ability to use our trade dialogue to encourage countries to take \naction on human trafficking. But I want the record to reflect the fact \nthat trade negotiations with the United States have not improved most \ncountries' human trafficking performance. It is clear that years of \nengagement with Malaysia on this issue, even with the carrot of the TPP \nnegotiations hanging before it, have not been enough to generate action \nfrom the Malaysian government.\n  Of the 17 countries the United States has entered into trade \nagreements with since 2001--the first year of the Trafficking in \nPersons Report--eight have not improved their trafficking in persons \nrankings since their trade deals entered into force. So for almost a \ndecade and a half, eight have not improved their rankings since the \ntrade deals entered into force, and three countries\n\n[[Page S2766]]\n\nhave actually had their trafficking in persons rankings downgraded \nafter their trade deals entered into force.\n  The facts are abundantly clear. Free trade negotiations have never \nbeen a successful tool in encouraging other countries to improve their \nperformance on combating human trafficking.\n  Now, I understand the administration's concerns over the effect of my \namendment on the current TPP negotiations. But I hope that as the State \nDepartment finalizes the 2015 report, there is no undue influence to \nmove countries around in order to benefit the administration's trade \nagenda. The integrity of the TIP report is at stake. And rest assured \nthe Congress will provide the appropriate oversight to ensure that \nintegrity. After all, in the State Department's own words, the TIP \nReport ``is the U.S. Government's principal tool to engage foreign \ngovernments on human trafficking.''\n  Furthermore, I now understand the administration is reaching out to \nhuman rights groups, seeking compromise language that would address the \nconcerns about human trafficking in our trade partners that I and \nothers have spoken of. So I am pleased the administration recognizes \nthe validity of my position as adopted by the Committee on Finance and \nagrees that it is appropriate to address human trafficking in this \ntrade bill.\n  Let me close by saying I want to remind my colleagues that the fast \ntrack negotiating authority is precisely the point at which Congress \nlays down the rules, the conditions, and the principles by which the \nadministration is granted our constitutional prerogative to negotiate \ninternational trade deals. Any suggestion that the bipartisan statement \nof negotiating principles of the Senate Committee on Finance is an \ninterference with the administration's prerogatives gets that \nconstitutional relationship backwards. We set the terms. The \nadministration follows those terms in their negotiations. It is not our \njob to trim our principles to match the deal they have already \nnegotiated.\n  This goes to the very heart of our congressional duties and to the \nheart of our constitutional power over international trade, and I \nbelieve it goes to the heart of the debate over fast-track authority \nitself that we began in the Committee on Finance and will soon engage \non here on the Senate Floor as early as tomorrow. Do we set the terms \nby which our trade powers are delegated to the administration or do \nthey dictate the terms they will accept?\n  That brings me to the question of the trade bill we may be \nconsidering as early as tomorrow. We do not know whether the hard-\nfought product of the Committee on Finance will be respected. We do not \nknow if a major trade preference package or long-awaited trade \nenforcement reforms will be included. When we are asked to vote on \ncloture tomorrow, at least at this point, will we be voting for a blank \npiece of paper? How can any Member in their right mind vote to move \nforward when they do not even know what they are moving forward on?\n  I have asked to see the text, because I want to see, among other \nthings, whether the amendment that was adopted by the Committee on \nFinance on human trafficking is in there. I am told we don't have it. \nIt is nearly 7 o'clock the evening before we will vote at 2:30 \ntomorrow. How do Members of the Senate vote in blank on the most \nsignificant trade bill we have had in well over a decade? That is not \ngood enough for me, and it should not be good enough for the Senate.\n  So I hope as we move forward to consider a fast-track bill, my \ncolleagues will bear in mind the importance of protecting the process \nof the Senate Committee on Finance, just as we have protected the \nprocess of every committee that has a bill brought to the Senate Floor. \nThat is why I am asking my colleagues to keep this amendment in the \nbill and help fight the scourge of modern slavery in the countries we \ntrade with.\n  The bill reported by the Committee on Finance puts a strong emphasis \non our need to match the actions we take on human trafficking at home \nto those we take in the international arena. And while we may not agree \nwith the specifics of our trade policy, I hope when the fast-track bill \ncomes to the floor, the Senate will stand together, reaffirming our \ncommitment to holding our trading partners accountable for their lack \nof action on combating human trafficking.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/11/senate-section/article/S2766-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
