Mr. President, this afternoon the Senate will engage \nin a debate of immense importance to our country. I again ask every \nSenator to reflect upon its gravity.\n  At its heart, this is about more than just the short term prospects \nof one agreement or the long-term legacy of one President or the narrow \ninterests of one political party. Wrapped within are larger questions \nabout the prospects for stability in a region, the potential for safety \nin a nation, and the continued role for our country in a dangerous and \nuncertain world.\n  We can't escape these questions. Their answers carry the potential to \ntouch every American and future generations.\n  The American people deserve our deliberate and considered responses. \nThey deserve a Senate that can rise to the moment. Tired talking points \nwon't get us there. A filibuster won't do it, either. But here is what \nwill: Respecting each other will get us there. Serious discussion will \nget us there. A debate worthy of the moment will get us there. So that \nis what I am calling for again today.\n  I ask every Senator to join me at their desks this afternoon so that \nwe might listen to colleagues as well as debate colleagues. A serious \ndebate and an open vote on this issue is the very least our country \nshould expect. That is the least we should be able to give them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/09/senate-section/article/S6477-6", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday my friend, the chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, Senator Corker of Tennessee, said: ``I \nrecognize, and have all along, that it takes 60 Senators to advance \nlegislation and get to a final vote on a bill or resolution.'' No \nequivocation, no dancing around the issue--the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee established what we have known all along: It takes \n60 votes.\n  His counterpart, Senator Cardin of Maryland, also agrees that 60 \nvotes was always the intention. One Senator at the hearings voted no on \nthe resolution because he didn't want it to be 60 votes. Everybody else \nvoted for that. Forty-seven Republican Senators sent a letter to the \nAyatollah, explaining to them how the Senate works. In that letter, all \n47 Republican Senators acknowledged that it takes three-fifths votes to \nget things done here in the Senate.\n  So that is over and done with. The resolution before us will take 60 \nvotes to pass. The direct quote from Senator Corker that I read is in \nblack and white. There aren't any words of mine; those are his words. \nThat is a direct quote from the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  So that is what we have. Republicans have clearly conceded that it \ntakes 60 votes to advance a resolution of disapproval.\n  Filibusters stop debate. We are willing to have all the debate the \nRepublicans want--2 hours, 2 days, whatever they want. It has to be \ncompleted by next Thursday. That is the only deadline that I can see.\n  The good news is that Senate Democrats, of course, on this side of \nthe aisle, continue to propose that following ample debate, the Senate \nthen proceed directly to a vote on final passage. Of course, it would \nhave a 60-vote threshold, as the chairman of the committee said \nyesterday. There would be no need for any other procedural votes. We \nwould just do that. There is no need for the Republican leader to \ncontinue wasting the Senate's time--and it is precious.\n  Look at what we have this week. There is basically one more \nlegislative day this week. Next week, we have two days, Monday and \nTuesday, which are long-time celebrations by the entire Congress of a \nJewish holiday. We have the deadline of September 17 for this matter \ndealing with Iran to be completed, as far as Senate floor action. \nStaring us in the face at the end of the\n\n[[Page S6478]]\n\nmonth is that government funding will be gone. We have to do something \nabout that. And we know, as we have heard all the threats by Republican \nSenators, that we are not going to fund the government unless something \nis done with Planned Parenthood. Those things take time. We have to get \nto that. Every day we waste here on the floor, trying to figure out \nwhat the Republicans want to do, is time that we should be spending on \nhow we are going to fund the government.\n  There is no question that the Republican leader now has a very real \nand important decision to make. We have a lot of work to do this month. \nWe can't afford to waste time with unnecessary procedural votes.\n  We also have some things we have to be involved in here that are \ngoing to slow up what we do. We have the President of China coming \ntoward the end of the month. We have the Pope coming. We expect as many \nas 500,000 people here on both sides of the Capitol during the short \ntime the Pope is here on Capitol Hill.\n  We have so many things to do. We need to have a path forward, as I \nmentioned already, to keep the Federal Government from shutting down \nbecause of a lack of funding. We need to figure out a way to keep our \nhighway trust fund solvent, which it is not now. We need to do \nsomething about cyber security, and we need to consider important tax \nextenders legislation, as well as how to avoid default on the debt \nlimit. They are all going to converge at about the same time.\n  Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans have very real deadlines that \nwe must meet. We can't meet them because of the procedure in the Senate \nunless the Republican leader allows us to have some time on the floor. \nWhat we don't have is time to waste on Republican-contrived procedural \nfights that have no basis in fact or reality. It is time for \nRepublicans to abandon their plans to slow down a vote on final passage \nof the Iran nuclear agreement resolution of disapproval and move on to \nother matters.\n  Mr. President, would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/09/senate-section/article/S6478-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 12:30 \np.m. will be equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that until 12:30 \np.m. today, the time during quorum calls be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I might, through the Chair, if Senator \nCorker would like to take his 5 minutes first, I am happy to allow \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for her tremendous \ncourtesy, and I will actually take 1 minute.\n  This afternoon we are going to have a very sober and dignified debate \nabout a foreign policy issue of huge consequence to our Nation and \ncertainly to the world. I wish to thank Senator McConnell and Senator \nReid for setting up a format that reflects that. I know many of my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle have been concerned about \namendments that may call for this to be a different type of debate. I \nwould like to point out that the leader yesterday filled the tree. I \njust want people to know that.\n  I wish to thank Senator Cardin and Senator Menendez before him for \nthe way we have all been able to work through a lot of issues that have \ncome up. What I hope doesn't happen today is that, somehow or another, \nwe begin referring back to incidents and trying to turn this into some \ntype of partisan debate. We worked through August. Things happened all \nalong the way. We worked through those. We ended up with the ability as \na Congress, on an executive agreement, which we all know was meant to \nbe implemented without any congressional involvement whatsoever, going \nstraight to the U.N. Security Council--we all worked together to figure \nout a way to have this debate and then vote on the substance of this \nlegislation.\n  So I want to thank my friends on both sides of the aisle. It passed \noverwhelmingly--98 to 1. I think, actually, the Senator from California \nwas absent on that day. I look forward to a very substantive debate \ntaking place on this most important issue.\n  Later today, I will have longer and more formal comments to make \nabout the substance of what was agreed to by the administration and \nother countries involved in the process.\n  I am looking forward to this. I want to say again to my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle that I think we set this up in a manner to \nbe a dignified, sober debate about one of the most important foreign \npolicy issues that will come before us. Thankfully it is coming before \nus because we all forced it to come before us, to have this debate, and \nto be able to weigh in.\n  I yield the floor. I thank very much the Senator from California for \nher courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to thank my chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Corker, for his courtesies. We do not \nagree on this particular matter, but there are a lot of matters when it \ncomes to foreign policy on which we do agree. I do agree this should be \na very straightforward debate--either you are for this agreement or you \nare not.\n  I think the fact that Congress is voting on it is good. I did support \nthat in the committee. That calls for regular order as far as the way \nwe treat this very important vote.\n  I am very proud to stand here today as the longest serving member \nsitting on the Foreign Relations Committee today. Out of all of the \nmembers, I have been there the longest. When I got there, I did not \nhave these gray hairs. I am not blaming any of the topics that came \nbefore us for these gray hairs; however, we have had some tough \ndebates, and this certainly is one of them. I know my friend has a lot \nto do. I just want to say I was pleased to yield to him because I think \nhe has set the right tone.\n  Colleagues, this is a vote we are going to long remember, a vote on \nan arms control agreement that came about for only one reason. That \nreason is, our President and his team--former Senator John Kerry, now \nSecretary of State; Wendy Sherman, the chief negotiator--they were part \nof the team, and many others worked tirelessly against the most \nvitriolic opposition.\n  The President stood firm. I want to say to him today: Thank you, Mr. \nPresident. In that race for President that you ran, you were very clear \nthat you were going to reach out your hand and see if we could avoid \nanother war in the Middle East. I hope and pray this Senate will give \nus and the world this opportunity.\n  As the President has said, a military option is always on the table. \nIt is in our Constitution that the President can respond to a threat. \nSo nothing in this agreement takes a military response off the table. \nBut it does say\n\n[[Page S6479]]\n\nthat diplomacy should have a chance to work. This diplomacy includes \nmuch of the world. That is why it is so remarkable.\n  I also want to give special thanks to two former Secretaries of \nState--Colin Powell, a Republican, and Hillary Clinton, a Democrat--for \nweighing in on the side of diplomacy. As Senators, we deal with \nthousands of issues in the course of our careers, but we will long \nremember those that actually change the course of history. Those kinds \nof votes are votes of conscience, and they are votes about which we \nmust look deeply into our hearts and into our minds. We have to look at \nthe facts. Facts are stubborn things. No matter what 30-second ad there \nis, no matter what newspaper ad there is, there are facts that are \nobvious. I want to go through those facts. I have them here on this \nchart.\n  One, this agreement cuts off the uranium pathway to a bomb. It does \nit by reducing Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium by 98 percent and \nseverely restricting its ability to enrich uranium. That is No. 1.\n  Two, it cuts off the plutonium pathway to a bomb. They do that by \ndismantling Iran's Arak reactor's core and replacing it with a core \nthat cannot produce weapons-grade plutonium. That is the second part of \nthe agreement.\n  Three, it includes the most intrusive inspections regime ever \nnegotiated. Let me repeat that. The deal includes the most intrusive \ninspections regime ever negotiated. This means 24/7 monitoring of \nIran's declared sites as well as inspections to the entire nuclear \nsupply chain, from its uranium mines and mills, to its conversion \nfacility, to its centrifuge manufacturing and storage facility. This is \ncritical. It provides the International Atomic Energy Agency--you will \nhear it referred to as the IAEA--with the mechanism to require that \nIran grant access to its suspicious sites. No other international \nagreement has ever done this before. So when you hear colleagues say, \n``Well, Iran has 24 days, you know, to hide things,'' all the experts \nwill tell you that you can hide a computer, but you cannot hide nuclear \nmaterial. It has a half-life of thousands of years. But no other \ninternational agreement, not even the agreements we have with the IAEA, \nsay that the IAEA has a deadline where access has to be granted to \nsuspicious sites.\n\n  Next, it requires the Iranians to disclose their past nuclear \nactivities before they can receive any sanctions relief. Let me say \nthat again. The Iranians have to disclose their past nuclear activities \nbefore they can receive any sanctions relief.\n  Lastly, if Iran cheats, the United States and our allies will be able \nto snap back multilateral sanctions. There is a process there that \ngives us a lot of power to do that.\n  Because of all of this, more than 100 nations support this deal, \nincluding many of our closest allies, such as the United Kingdom, \nGermany, Australia, France, Japan, and Canada--100 nations. That is why \n29 of the Nation's top scientists, including 6 Nobel laureates, call \nthe deal ``innovative and stringent'' and even say it can serve as a \n``guidepost for future agreements.'' One hundred nations, 29 of our \nNation's top scientists. That is also why 60 bipartisan national \nsecurity leaders support it, including leaders such as Madeleine \nAlbright, Thomas Pickering, and Ryan Crocker. You know those names. You \nknow those people. They have integrity. They have intelligence. They \nhave experience. They were appointed by Republicans and Democrats \nalike. They point out that there are no viable alternatives to this \nagreement. They are right.\n  Anyone--you are going to hear this from my Republican friends--anyone \nwho says we should go back to the bargaining table--and you are going \nto hear this over and over again: Oh, just go back to the bargaining \ntable. Anyone who says that after 20 months of negotiations and huge \nsupport in the world is either engaging in fantasy or they truly want \nto sink this deal. So if you hear somebody say, ``Oh, just go back to \nthe table. Just forget the support of the 100 nations. Just go back and \nrenegotiate this deal,'' let me tell you, they are either engaging in \nfantasy or they want to sink this deal. There is a hard, cold truth \nhere: If we walk away, there will be no agreement. Let's be clear. If \nthat is your position, why don't you say it? But don't say ``Go back to \nthe negotiating table. No problem.'' If we walk away, there will be no \nagreement. America will be isolating itself and undermining its role as \na global leader on arms control. That is why more than 100 former U.S. \nAmbassadors say that without this deal, ``the risks to the security of \nthe United States and our friends and allies would be far greater.'' \nLet me say that again. One hundred former U.S. Ambassadors from both \nparties say that ``the risks to the security of the United States and \nour friends and allies would be far greater'' than if we do the deal.\n  We know right now that Iran has enough nuclear material to build 10 \nnuclear weapons. So whom are you kidding when you say the world will be \nsafer if this agreement falls and Iran is left to continue the \ndangerous course it began way back in 1984? We passed sanctions. We did \nit right here. I spoke on that. I said: We have to keep our eye on \nIran. We don't trust them. So they came to the table.\n  Opposing this agreement means walking away--walking away from the \nvery strategy we embraced when we placed sanctions on Iran. It means \nwalking away from our best friends, our allies, and our trading \npartners.\n  When you probe the opponents of this deal and you say, ``Well, if you \ngo back to the table, you are going to lose 100 nations, many of them \nour best friends,'' do you know what they say? ``Oh, we can just \nsanction those friends. We can just sanction those allies. We can just \nsanction those trading partners.'' Can you imagine going after our best \nfriends? Is that a winning strategy? That is another example of the \nopponents dreaming or scheming--dreaming of a successful go-it-alone \nstrategy or scheming for another war in the Middle East. Those \noptions--go it alone or a war--are self-inflicted wounds we can ill \nafford.\n  Let's put up the statement by Philip Hammond, the United Kingdom \nForeign Secretary. This is what he said. In a meeting with the various \nAmbassadors of the countries that cut this deal, the same thing was \nsaid, but let's say it the way he did. This is the United Kingdom \nForeign Secretary:\n\n       If the United States were to walk away from this deal, \n     international unity would disintegrate. The hardliners in \n     Iran would be strengthened, and we would lose the most \n     effective path to stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.\n\n  Philip Hammond, the UK Foreign Secretary.\n  So, again, look at what he is saying. He is saying that if we walk \naway, the hardliners in Iran would be strengthened. They would win. So \nI ask opponents of this deal: Why do you want to stand with the \nhardliners in Iran? Because you are standing with the hardliners in \nIran who shout ``Death to America,'' ``Death to Israel.'' You are \nstanding with them. They want to kill the deal.\n  I am under no illusion that this agreement solves all of our problems \nwith Iran. I am under no illusions that this agreement will make Iran \nsuddenly some positive player on the world stage that we can cozy up \nto. No. No. That is why this agreement is not based on trust. As \nHillary Clinton said today, it is based on distrust and verification. \nShe is right. This agreement is also based on the most stringent \ninspection regime ever negotiated. Iran is a bad and a dangerous actor. \nI do not think there is any disagreement on that. That is why its \nnonnuclear activities will remain subject to tough sanctions. But here \nis the ultimate question each of us must ask ourselves: Would we rather \nhave a bad and dangerous actor with a nuclear bomb or a bad and \ndangerous actor without a nuclear bomb? My kids would say that is a no-\nbrainer. The answer is obvious. We don't want Iran with a nuclear bomb. \nThat is why we need this deal. If Iran cheats, it will be in front of \nthe whole world. I will be among the first to consider any and all \noptions.\n  I began by saying this is one of the most important votes we will \never cast in our lifetime. I am reminded of another one, my vote \nagainst the Iraq war. It was lonely then--only 23 of us--but you have \nto look at the situation. Some of the leading voices against this deal \nwere the very same people who brought us the Iraq war.\n  Remember Paul Wolfowitz saying the Iraqis would ``greet us as \nliberators''?\n\n[[Page S6480]]\n\n  Remember Dick Cheney, who is out there now saying: Vote no on this \ndeal. Oh, it is terrible.\n  Remember what he said as he drew us into Iraq? He said there was ``no \ndoubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction.'' And \nremember when he said the whole war would be ``weeks rather than \nmonths''? I remember that after 10 years of war.\n  Remember Bill Kristol saying we would ``be vindicated when we \ndiscover the weapons of mass destruction''?\n  And, remember, some of our colleagues who are here today pushed hard \nfor the Iraq war and said it would be great for America and great for \nIsrael. Well, they were wrong then, and they are wrong now.\n  Look, it is no secret that the Prime Minister of our great ally, \nIsrael, is on the other side of this argument, but we must also \nremember that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a cheerleader for \nthe Iraq war and said in 2002: ``If you take out . . . Saddam's regime, \nI guarantee you that it will have enormous positive reverberations on \nthe region.'' Prime Minister Netanyahu argued for the Iraq war saying: \n``I guarantee you that it will have enormous positive reverberations on \nthe region.''\n  Positive reverberations? Instead, devastating consequences. More than \n4,000 of our brave American men and women were killed and nearly 32,000 \nwounded. We know that a lot of the Baathists joined ISIS, and the \nBaathists were loyal to Saddam. Now they are guiding ISIS. No positive \nreverberations there, devastating consequences.\n  If we were completely honest and we really asked the question: Who \nwon the war in Iraq? The answer comes back, Iran. Iran. They have never \nhad more influence in modern times on Iraq than they have today. That \nis why, as a stalwart supporter of Israel and the Israeli-American \nrelationship, I strongly support this deal.\n  I am the proud author of the last two United States-Israel security \nbills passed by Congress. They were called the United States-Israel \nEnhanced Security Cooperation Act of 2012 and the United States-Israel \nStrategic Partnership Act of 2014. I believe, as the author of those \ntwo bills that President Obama signed, this deal makes the United \nStates safer, it makes Israel safer, and it makes the entire world \nsafer.\n  I said that Prime Minister Netanyahu is very clearly opposed, but \nlet's look at some of the top military experts in Israel--experts who \nunderstand what is paramount to Israel's security.\n  Let's look at Ami Ayalon. He is a former head of Shin Bet, Israel's \ninternal security service. He said: ``When it comes to Iran's nuclear \ncapability, this [deal] is the best option. . . .'' Now this isn't just \nsome citizen in the street; this is the former head of Shin Bet, \nIsrael's internal security service, saying this.\n  Then there is Amram Mitzna, a retired major general in the Israel \nDefense Forces, the IDF, former member of the Knesset and former mayor \nof Haifa, who said: ``For Israel's sake and all the people of the \nMiddle East, we must not miss this opportunity.''\n  Then there is Efraim Halevy, former director of the Mossad, who said: \n``Without an agreement, Iran will be free to act as it wishes. . . .''\n  Let me repeat that. This is the former director of the Mossad, who \nsaid: ``Without an agreement, Iran will be free to act as it wishes. . \n. .''\n  These leaders from Israel whom I have quoted are some of the most \nknowledgeable in the world when it comes to Israel's security, and they \nbelieve this deal will make Israel safer. It doesn't change the fact \nthat the Israeli Government opposes this. I agree with that; I \nunderstand that. But there is a split in Israel, and it is worth \ncommenting on it.\n  With their expertise and their knowledge, these endorsements by these \nIsraelis should be taken seriously. Also, the endorsements from our \ncurrent and former colleagues in Congress should be taken seriously.\n  Eleven Jewish former Members have weighed in, saying: ``We championed \nthe U.S.-Israel alliance . . . and we all strongly support this \nagreement because it will enhance the security of the U.S., the State \nof Israel, and the entire world.''\n  I thank them for weighing in. This is one of those debates that is \nvery hard--regardless of your position--because it is emotional, it is \ndifficult, and yet they weighed in, as did the Israeli security \nexperts. Believe me, the pressure on them not to talk was enormous.\n  This deal also has the support of some of the most knowledgeable and \nrespected foreign policy lawmakers who ever served in Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \ntwo opinion pieces, one written by Senators Carl Levin and John Warner \nand another by Senators Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            [Aug. 13, 2015]\n\n                Why Hawks Should Also Back the Iran Deal\n\n                    (By Carl Levin and John Warner)\n\n       We both were elected to the Senate in 1978 and privileged \n     to have served together on the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee for 30 years, during which we each held committee \n     leadership positions of chairman or ranking minority member. \n     We support the Iran Agreement negotiated by the United States \n     and other leading world powers for many reasons, including \n     its limitations on Iran's nuclear activities, its strong \n     inspections regime, and the ability to quickly re-impose \n     sanctions should Iran violate its provisions.\n       But we also see a compelling reason to support the \n     agreement that has gotten little attention: Rejecting it \n     would weaken the deterrent value of America's military \n     option.\n       As former chairmen of the Senate Armed Services Committee, \n     we have always believed that the U.S. should keep a strong \n     military option on the table. If Iran pursues a nuclear \n     weapon, some believe that military action is inevitable if \n     we're to prevent it from reaching its goal. We don't \n     subscribe to that notion, but we are skeptical that, should \n     Iran attempt to consider moving to a nuclear weapon, we could \n     deter them from pursuing it through economic sanctions alone.\n       How does rejecting the agreement give America a weaker \n     military hand to play? Let's imagine a world in which the \n     United States rejects the nuclear accord that all other \n     parties have embraced. The sanctions now in place would \n     likely not be maintained and enforced by all the parties to \n     the agreement, so those would lose their strong deterrent \n     value. Iran would effectively argue to the world that it had \n     been willing to negotiate an agreement, only to have that \n     agreement rejected by a recalcitrant America.\n       In that world, should we find credible evidence that Iran \n     is starting to move toward a nuclear weapon, the United \n     States would almost certainly consider use of the military \n     option to stop that program. But it's highly unlikely that \n     our traditional European allies, let alone China and Russia, \n     would support the use of the military option since we had \n     undermined the diplomatic path. Iran surely would know this, \n     and so from the start, would have less fear of a military \n     option than if it faced a unified coalition.\n       While the United States would certainly provide the \n     greatest combat power in any military action, allies and \n     other partners make valuable contributions--not just in \n     direct participation, but also in access rights, logistics, \n     intelligence, and other critical support. If we reject the \n     agreement, we risk isolating ourselves and damaging our \n     ability to assemble the strongest possible coalition to stop \n     Iran.\n       In short, then, rejecting the Iran deal would erode the \n     current deterrent value of the military option, making it \n     more likely Iran might choose to pursue a nuclear weapon, and \n     would then make it more costly for the U.S. to mount any \n     subsequent military operation. It would tie the hands of any \n     future president trying to build international participation \n     and support for military force against Iran should that be \n     necessary.\n       Those who think the use of force against Iran is almost \n     inevitable should want the military option to be as credible \n     and effective as possible, both as a deterrent to Iran's \n     nuclear ambitions and in destroying Iran's nuclear weapons \n     program should that become necessary. For that to be the \n     case, the United States needs to be a party to the agreement \n     rather than being the cause of its collapse.\n       In our many years on the Armed Services Committee, we saw \n     time and again how America is stronger when we fight \n     alongside allies. Iran must constantly be kept aware that a \n     collective framework of deterrence stands resolute, and that \n     if credible evidence evolves that Iran is taking steps \n     towards a nuclear arsenal, it would face the real possibility \n     of military action by a unified coalition of nations to stop \n     their efforts.\n       The deal on the table is a strong agreement on many counts, \n     and it leaves in place the robust deterrence and credibility \n     of a military option. We urge our former colleagues not to \n     take any action which would undermine the deterrent value of \n     a coalition that participates in and could support the use of \n     a military option. The failure of the United States to join \n     the agreement would have that effect.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                            [Aug. 30, 2015]\n\n                   There Are No Perfect Nuclear Deals\n\n                    (By Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar)\n\n       During the Cold War both Republican and Democratic \n     presidents accepted less-than-\n\n[[Page S6481]]\n\n     perfect arms pacts with the Soviets. We need to do the same \n     with Iran.\n       At the height of the Cold War, the Soviet Union had \n     thousands of nuclear warheads aimed at American cities, and \n     the Soviets were subject to numerous arms controls \n     agreements. But progress was hard-fought and incremental at \n     best. In an ideal world, the Soviet Union would have agreed \n     to more severe constraints than those agreed by Presidents \n     Kennedy, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan and Bush, for example. \n     It would have dismantled all of its nuclear weapons, stopped \n     its human rights abuses and halted its meddling around the \n     world.\n       But, as all of these presidents--Democratic and \n     Republican--understood, holding out for the impossible is a \n     recipe for no progress at all. Congress should take the same \n     approach today to the Iran nuclear deal.\n       We know something about the long history of such \n     agreements. During our combined 60 years in the U.S. Senate, \n     we participated in countless meetings, hearings and trips \n     around the globe focused on reducing the threats posed by \n     weapons of mass destruction. The centerpiece of our efforts \n     was the Nunn-Lugar Act, passed in 1991, which was the basis \n     for two decades of hard work that resulted in the \n     safeguarding and deactivation of more than 7,000 nuclear \n     warheads, hundreds of missiles and bombers, and numerous \n     other elements of the former Soviet Union's WMD programs.\n       These experiences underscored for us that arms control \n     agreements are rarely finished absolutes. Inevitably, their \n     success depends on many factors that play out after the \n     agreement is signed, including alliance cohesion, \n     congressional funding for implementation and the political \n     will of the parties to ensure verification and enforcement.\n       Over the next several weeks, every member of Congress will \n     have the opportunity to weigh the terms of the nuclear \n     agreement against all viable alternatives. In our view, the \n     key questions regarding this agreement are: Will it stop Iran \n     from obtaining a nuclear weapon? What are the risks of going \n     forward with this agreement? And what are the risks if \n     Congress rejects the agreement?\n       The plus-sides of this deal are clear. It includes severe \n     restrictions on uranium enrichment and plutonium production, \n     required transparency into Iranian activities and inspection \n     provisions to assure the international community that Iran's \n     nuclear program is, and remains, peaceful. Reports that Iran \n     will simply inspect itself to address unresolved allegations \n     about its nuclear behavior have been refuted by the head of \n     the International Atomic Energy Agency, who has stated that \n     the arrangements are technically sound, consistent with the \n     IAEA's long-established practices and do not compromise IAEA \n     safeguards standards in any way. Importantly, the agreement \n     taken as a whole will help deter Iranian cheating and provide \n     the means to detect violations in time to take strong action \n     if required.\n       Could we conceive a stronger deal? Of course--that has been \n     true of every arms control negotiation. We have heard critics \n     suggest that Iran would have agreed to entirely dismantle its \n     nuclear enrichment facilities and stop all activities related \n     to its civil nuclear program if only the U.S. had been \n     tougher in negotiations. But had the U.S. taken such an \n     approach in the early 1990s, we would not have encouraged and \n     helped Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus safely \n     accelerate the destruction of their weapons and materials of \n     mass destruction, and the risk of accidents or catastrophic \n     terrorism would have been far higher over the past 20 years.\n       Although there are no absolute guarantees, nor can there be \n     in diplomatic accords, our bottom line is that this agreement \n     makes it far less likely that the Iranians will acquire a \n     nuclear weapon over the next 15 years.\n       As to risks in going forward with the agreement, Congress \n     must listen carefully to both our intelligence community and \n     the IAEA's views on any possible weaknesses in the \n     verification regime, and then work with these entities to \n     mitigate any vulnerabilities, both now and in the years \n     ahead.\n       As with other agreements, Congress must recognize that \n     there is no such thing as ``perfect'' verification. What is \n     crucial, however, is whether ``effective'' verification can \n     be achieved. Can cheating be detected in time to take action \n     before Iran could achieve a militarily significant advance? \n     We believe the answer to that question is yes. The monitoring \n     and verification provisions of this agreement are \n     unprecedented in the history of arms control in their \n     comprehensiveness and intrusiveness, and together with our \n     intelligence capabilities should give us powerful tools to \n     achieve effective verification.\n       Opponents of this agreement have offered criticism that \n     sanctions relief would provide Iran with additional resources \n     that would enable it to intensify its destabilizing behavior \n     in the region. This is a risk, but the argument that this \n     risk can be avoided or reduced by the defeat of this \n     agreement rests on a patently false assumption. Anyone \n     believing that the present effective economic sanctions will \n     be continued by Russia, China, India and other nations if \n     Congress rejects this agreement is in a dream world. This \n     agreement and the alliance that brought Iran to the \n     negotiating table through sanctions has focused on Iran's \n     nuclear activities, not its regional behavior, though both \n     are serious dangers. This alliance could never have been \n     brought or held together to pursue a broad, nuclear and \n     regional agenda on which alliance partners themselves \n     strongly disagree.\n       With or without this agreement, the U.S. must continue and \n     intensify our efforts with other partners to challenge and \n     counter Iran's destabilizing regional activities and \n     strengthen our cooperation with Israel and the Gulf States. \n     If this agreement is rejected, both of these objectives \n     become more difficult.\n       Finally, and perhaps most importantly, members of Congress \n     must think long and hard about the consequences if this \n     agreement is turned down. There is no escaping the conclusion \n     that there will inevitably be grave implications for U.S. \n     security and for U.S. international leadership in the decades \n     ahead. Sanctions allies will go their own way, reducing the \n     effectiveness of our financial tools and leaving Iran in a \n     stronger position across the board. Any future effort by this \n     president or the next to assemble a ``sanctions coalition'' \n     relating to Iran or other security challenges will be \n     weakened. U.S. leadership, diplomacy and credibility, \n     including efforts to achieve support for possible military \n     action against Iran, will all be severely damaged.\n       If, however, the Iran agreement is upheld by Congress, the \n     hard work of monitoring and enforcement is just beginning. \n     This Congress and future Congresses, as well as future \n     presidents, have a large and continuing role to play in the \n     decades ahead if ``stopping the Iranian bomb'' is to become a \n     reality. Congress must insist that Iran be held to its \n     commitments while not obstructing the agreement. The U.S. \n     must make clear our commitment to the security of our allies \n     and friends in the Middle East, through security assistance \n     and a clear policy that Iranian meddling in the region will \n     be firmly resisted. It must be clear which congressional \n     committees are responsible for oversight and monitoring of \n     implementation and compliance. There should also be clear \n     requirements for the president to report to Congress on \n     intelligence associated with Iran. In addition, Congress must \n     provide funding to the IAEA for its activities in monitoring \n     Iranian compliance with this agreement as well as other \n     nuclear proliferation activities in the Gulf region.\n       These crucial September votes will require members to \n     search their own consciences. Whether they vote ``yea'' or \n     ``nay,'' they must first look in the mirror and ask whether \n     they are putting our nation's interest first.\n       Our own conviction is that this agreement represents our \n     best chance to stop an Iranian bomb without another war in \n     the Middle East.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. These are two Democrats, two Republicans, leaders all--\nrespected, effective. These former colleagues understand the risks of \nmilitary action, and they are right. They know this deal doesn't rule \nout the use of military force. The United States can strike if we need \nto, but we must first try diplomacy. Since when are we afraid of that?\n  We can try diplomacy because we are the most powerful Nation on \nEarth. We should try diplomacy, and if it fails, we always have all \noptions on the table--as our President has said, as I have said, as \neveryone has said.\n  It is striking to me that we don't have one Republican for this. I am \nkind of amazed. All of the focus was on the Democrats, really. A few \nare opposing and a vast majority are for it.\n  I am surprised that a Richard Lugar couldn't sway anybody, that a \nColin Powell couldn't sway anybody, that a John Warner couldn't sway \nanybody, and, also, the religious communities across the United States \napparently aren't swaying anybody. It is telling that 340 U.S. rabbis \nfear that if the United States rejects the deal: ``. . . the outcome \nwill be the collapse of the international sanctions regime, an Iranian \nrace for nuclear weapons . . . [and] isolation of Israel and the United \nStates from international partners.''\n  There is also support from more than 53 Christian leaders and the \nUnited States Conference of Catholic Bishops, who referred to Pope \nFrancis's hope for a deal that he says is a ``definitive step toward a \nmore secure and fraternal world.''\n  I don't know why we haven't been able to really see bipartisan \nsupport in the Senate. I am puzzled by it. I am saddened by it. It \nappears to me this is political. President Obama wants it. He worked \nhard for it. They don't like it. This is what I think.\n  I may be wrong, but it is hard for me to imagine, with all of these \nsolid Republicans in favor of this deal outside of the Senate and the \nHouse, we cannot seem to have bipartisanship. These faith leaders are \nspeaking on behalf of their synagogues, on behalf their congregations, \nand their faithful. They are speaking for so many Americans, so many \nAmericans who have prayed on this issue and have come to the conclusion \nthat it is best for our Nation.\n\n[[Page S6482]]\n\n  Believe me, it is easier to say no. You can always say: Well, I don't \nlike page 4, line 2.\n  A deal by its very nature is not perfect. It is not. That is why it \nis a deal. Otherwise it would be a fiat. Oh, I want this. OK. We make \ndeals. We do it here all the time, but somehow this deal--because it \nisn't perfect and everyone agrees it isn't perfect--somehow we cannot \nseem to get bipartisanship. It breaks my heart, frankly.\n  Colleagues, this is really a major moment for us, as individuals and \nfor our Nation. We will be judged on this vote, and we should be judged \non this vote. We should be judged on votes that could lead to another \nwar in the Middle East. At least one of our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle admitted his truthful position. I respect that. He \nsaid we can ``set Iran's nuclear facilities back to day zero'' using \nmilitary force.\n  He is voting no on this agreement, and anyone else who joins him \nshould know this: to walk away means Iran could continue its nuclear \nprogram at will. This is not acceptable, and it means a path to war.\n  Let us not tiptoe around this. This option, the option of no \nagreement, isn't going back to the bargaining table because everyone \nhas said--very clearly, all our allies--they are not going back to the \nbargaining table.\n  So we have no agreement, and to walk away means the international \nsanctions collapse. If we think that we, ourselves, can now turn to our \nbest friends and allies, such as the United Kingdom, and say: Well, if \nyou don't go along with us, we are not trading with you anymore--that \nis not going to happen.\n  To walk away means Iran continues its nuclear program because there \nwon't be a deal. To walk away means we will find ourselves isolated \nfrom some of our best allies in the world. Remember, 100 nations \nsupport this deal, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, \nAustralia, Japan, and Canada. To walk away--I believe--means war, and \nthe other side would say: Oh, that is just a scare tactic.\n  It is not a scare tactic. If you cannot go back to the negotiating \ntable because nobody is going back there with you--you can go back. You \nwill be there by yourself. Iran walks away. They continue with their \nprogram, and we are not going to stand for that. We have all said that.\n  So to walk away, in my view, means war. Because when we walk away, \nthere is no deal. Iran keeps its nuclear program, and that cannot be \nallowed to happen.\n  Another one of our colleagues whom we serve with--and I have a lot of \nrespect for and a good friendship with--one said: Bomb, bomb, bomb, \nbomb Iran.\n  You remember that. He is going to vote no on this deal, and that is \ngoing to move us more toward his reality.\n  Wars are easy to start, and they are hard to end. Wars are a stain on \nthe human race, and we should do everything in our power to avoid war. \nNow, avoiding war does not mean giving up strength because, again, a \nmilitary response to Iran is always on the table. And if Iran violates \nthe deal, the whole world will know it. It will be right out there, and \nthe whole world will stand with us in taking action.\n  Diplomacy is the first resort; war is the last resort. I have voted \nfor war, OK. I said: Let's go after bin Laden. I voted for that war. It \nis easy to start, hard to end.\n  So, my colleagues, I will say it again. This is our chance, and this \nis our choice. History will judge us.\n  With this one vote, we have the chance to seize a historic \nopportunity to once again make America a shining example of leadership. \nWith this vote, we have a chance, a real chance, to make this world \nsafer right now for our children and our grandchildren.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for \nher service on the Foreign Relations Committee and her passionate \ncomments. Obviously, I am in a very different place policywise than she \nis.\n  I do want to point out there is bipartisanship here. There is \nbipartisan disapproval. While I know the Senator from California knows \na great deal about foreign policy, as she is the longest serving member \non the committee, the two who have spent more time than anyone \nunderstanding the nature of this deal, the impact it is going to have \non the region--more time because there has been more meetings with \nthem--are the two Democrats, the ranking member today and the former \nranking member, who both oppose this. So there is bipartisanship.\n  I don't view this as political at all. I think we have been able to \nestablish a strong bipartisan bill to vote on this. We have strong \nbipartisanship in both bodies, I might say, in the House and the \nSenate, in opposing this.\n  I hope what we will be able to do is not cast aspersions about \npeople's motives but really debate this on the substance.\n  If I could, and then I will be glad to take my colleague's question.\n  Without objection, I would like to yield the remainder of Republican \ntime as in morning business in this manner: 20 minutes to Senator Cruz, \nwho I think will be here momentarily; 20 minutes to Senator McCain; 15 \nminutes to Senator Vitter; and 5 minutes to Senator Kirk.\n  I don't want to burn up a lot of our time, but if there is no \nobjection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing none, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. I will be glad to take my colleague's question briefly, \nbut I don't want to burn up a lot of our time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Briefly, this is not a lot.\n  What I wanted to point out is exactly that; that you do have a few \nDemocrats, I think four Democrats, who have come down ``no,'' but we \ndon't have one Republican on the other side. That was the only point I \nwas making.\n  So my colleague is right. You have bipartisanship, but I am asking \nwhere are the Republicans supporting this? It just seems odd to me. And \nto me it does feel political from your side because when you have Colin \nPowell, who is for the agreement, and you have John Warner and other \nRepublicans--former ambassadors and military people--it just seems odd. \nI was making that point.\n  But my colleague is right. You do have bipartisan support on your \nside, and I am lamenting the fact that we don't have it on ours because \nit doesn't feel right to me, having gone through these debates in the \npast.\n  Mr. CORKER. I think in closing--I will leave the floor, so I am not \nburning up any more of our time--but I think there are very legitimate \nconcerns about the fact we began this to dismantle Iran's nuclear \nprogram, to end their program, per the President, and by approval of \nthis deal we actually are approving the industrialization of Iran's \nnuclear program--the greatest state sponsor of terror in the world. \nObviously, that creates a lot of issues and concerns. That is why, I \nbelieve, we see so many people disapproving of this agreement.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, let's start out with a little simple math: \n58 to 42 is not a victory for the side with 42. Even in the case of \nObamaCare--a truly disastrous piece of legislation which was forced \nthrough the Congress on purely partisan lines--that legislation \nreceived a majority. This isn't even close. Because not only has the \nRepublican caucus held firm and unanimously rejected this catastrophic \ndeal, we have also been joined by colleagues from across the aisle who \nare not blinded by partisan politics and understand the threat that is \nposed by President Obama's proposed nuclear deal with Iran.\n  I want to take a moment to acknowledge them, as they are among those \nwho know best how bad this deal is. First, Senator Chuck Schumer of New \nYork, who has been a long-time advocate for the State of Israel. It is \nno secret Senator Schumer and I have had our disagreements on a great \nmany issues, but I have been proud to stand with him for Israel and \nagainst this Iranian nuclear deal, and I was proud\n\n[[Page S6483]]\n\nto stand with Senator Schumer when Congress voted unanimously on the \nlegislation I introduced to ban a known terrorist--Hamid Aboutalebi, \nwho participated in the 1979 Iranian hostage-taking--from becoming \nIran's Ambassador to the United Nations.\n  Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the former chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, has likewise come out against this \ncatastrophic deal. Senator Menendez and I have worked together on a \nwide range of issues, including legislation to provide a Rewards for \nJustice reward last summer of $5 million for the capture or kill of the \nHamas terrorist who murdered Israeli American teenager Naftali Fraenkel \nand his two teenage friends.\n  Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland, the ranking member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, whose name is on the legislation on which we are \nscheduled to vote this week. Certainly Senator Cardin knows as much \nabout this deal as anyone, and his opposition should make all Senators, \nparticularly Democratic Senators, take note.\n  Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, my colleague on the Senate \nCommittee on Armed Services, who understands the threats to national \nsecurity posed by this Iranian nuclear deal, I was honored to work with \nhim and have his support for the resolution I introduced condemning \nHamas's use of human shields during Israel's action in Gaza last \nsummer--a disgusting terrorist tactic that was aided and abetted by \nHamas's Iranian sponsors.\n  Democrats should take note that the ranking member on the Foreign \nRelations Committee, the former ranking member on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, and the Democrat scheduled to be the next Democratic leader \nhave all come out and valued national security above partisan loyalty. \nThat ought to be reason to cause every other Democratic Member of this \nbody to take a second assessment of their own decisions.\n  I also want to mention Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, who even \nthough he plans, unfortunately, to vote in favor of this deal, \nmaintains it should go to a vote and not go into effect by default \nbecause the minority can block cloture through a filibuster. In these \ndark times, it is at least encouraging to know there are still a \nhandful of Democrats who, in the tradition of Scoop Jackson, JFK, and \nJoe Lieberman, are willing to put country in front of party, are \nwilling to defend national security. That used to be a robust tradition \non the Democratic side of the aisle. I would that there were more Scoop \nJackson Democrats in the United States Senate. I would that there were \nmore JFK Democrats in the United States Senate. I would that there were \nmore Joe Lieberman Democrats in the United States Senate.\n  It is also telling that not a single Republican was persuaded by the \nPresident and Secretary of State when they told us this is the only \noption; that it is this deal, this catastrophic deal, or war and that \nthis is the very best deal we could have gotten. If that is so, we \nshouldn't have been negotiating in the first place.\n  Indeed, as Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu noted, the one person \ntelling the truth about this deal is Iran's President Ruhani, who \nobserved that Iran has gotten everything they wanted from this deal \nbecause this deal is, as Prime Minister Netanyahu predicted, a very bad \ndeal and a historic mistake.\n  First and foremost, this terrible deal will not stop a virulently \nanti-American and anti-Israeli regime from getting a nuclear bomb. The \nso-called Supreme Leader, the Ayatollah Khamenei, declared that \nIsrael--which he calls the Little Satan--would be nothing in 25 years \nand that those 25 years would be made miserable because of the heroic \nattacks of radical Islamic jihadists. America, he said, was the Great \nSatan. He didn't say this in 1979. He tweeted it yesterday.\n  This is the Ayatollah Khamenei, the person with whom the \nadministration is making a deal that facilitates his having nuclear \nweapons. He is being candid. He is telling us he intends to do \neverything possible to murder as many Israelis as possible and to \nmurder as many Americans as possible.\n  President Obama's deal, if it goes through, will allow Khamenei and \nhis fellow mullahs to retain their centrifuges. They have established \ntheir ``right to enrich'' uranium. They have rejected attempts to \ninspect their sites with possible military dimensions related to their \nnuclear program. Indeed, this deal is without any credible inspection \nmechanism.\n  Not long ago, the administration was promising the American people \nso-called ``anytime, anywhere inspections.'' Those inspections quickly \nmorphed into inspections with 24 days' advance notice--plenty of time \nto ensure that the inspections will never uncover the cheating.\n  But even more laughable, even more farcical, this deal doesn't rely \non American inspectors; it doesn't rely on international inspectors. \nThis deal trusts the Iranians to inspect themselves. It is not much of \nan exaggeration to say the inspection regime envisioned in this deal is \nsimply picking up the phone, calling the Ayatollah Khamenei, and \nasking: Are you developing nuclear weapons? No. Very good; thank you.\n  That is a regime designed to facilitate cheating, to facilitate \nsurreptitious development of nuclear weapons with $150 billion to fuel \nand fund that development.\n  Beyond that, the deal actually obligates signatories to assist Iran \nin developing their program, which, remarkably, the Secretary of State \nsuggests will be used to try to cure cancer, and, even more remarkably, \nobligates signatories to assist Iran in defending against efforts by \nthe nation of Israel to stop a nuclear weapons regime. That is a \nremarkable commitment Senate Democrats have signed on to.\n  In addition, this terrible deal makes concessions to Iran completely \nunrelated to the nuclear program. For example, it provides sanctions \nrelief for designated terrorists such as General Suleimani, the head of \nthe Iranian Revolutionary Guard's elite Quds Force, who should have no \nassociation with the Iranian nuclear program whatsoever. Iran and the \nIranian regime maintain that the nuclear program is not a military \nprogram. Then why is a military general covered in this agreement--this \nman, General Suleimani, who has blood on his hands from the IEDs that \nhe funneled into Iraq that murdered and maimed hundreds of American \nservice men and women?\n  And even while Iranians such as Suleimani get relief, four Americans \nwere cruelly excluded from this deal: Pastor Saeed Abedini, an American \ncitizen imprisoned for 8 years in an Iranian prison for the crime of \npreaching the Gospel; former marine Amir Hekmati; Washington Post \nreporter Jason Rezaian; and Bob Levinson. It is a disgrace on our \nNation that we agreed to any deal with Tehran before they were \nliberated.\n  Finally, this terrible deal provides Iran with some $150 billion in \neconomic relief, which will inevitably be used to finance the violent \nterrorist mayhem that has been a signature of the Islamic Republic \nsince the 1979 revolution. It will, in effect, make the U.S. Government \nthe leading international financier of terrorism. We haven't even voted \nyet on this deal, and we are already seeing the consequences play out \nin real time. Senior Iranian officials, including Suleimani, who is \ntechnically still under a U.N. travel ban, have traveled to Moscow to \nmake arms deals with Vladimir Putin--arms that will flow to Iran's \nterrorist proxies, from Yemen to Gaza to Lebanon to Syria. Syrian \ndictator Bashar al-Assad has gotten an economic lifeline in the form of \na $1 billion line of credit. Senior Iranian officials have announced to \nthe media they will redouble their support for Hamas because they \n``reject the existence of any Israeli on this earth.''\n  If we want to understand who we are dealing with, that clarifies \nexactly what their intent is. In other words, the world's leading state \nsponsor of terrorism, Iran, just got a $150 billion windfall courtesy \nof the U.S. Government.\n  The grim consequences of this activity can be seen on our TV screens \nas we witness hundreds of thousands of panicked refugees fleeing out of \nplaces where Iran's proxies are active. Of course, ISIS and its \naffiliates bear significant responsibility for this crisis. But make no \nmistake about it; Tehran's bloody fingerprints are all over it as well. \nFrom the Houthis to Hamas to Hezbollah, they are enabling\n\n[[Page S6484]]\n\nand financing the radical Islamic terrorists who are making life, from \nNorth Africa to the Middle East, utterly untenable. They are murdering \nChristians and Jews and other Muslims who do not embrace their radical \njihadist dream.\n  This isn't complicated. The American people know this is a terrible \ndeal. That is why President Obama has only been able to persuade a \nminority of their duly elected representatives to support it. It is \nwhy, as Secretary Kerry frankly admitted, they didn't even try to \nsubmit their deal to the Senate as a treaty, as they should have done. \nThey prefer to jam it through by default or by Presidential veto--\nanything to get what they believe will be a domestic political legacy. \nHow typical it is of the Washington cartel that one-third of one House \nof Congress is trying to force this catastrophic deal on our country.\n  Yet even in the face of 42 Democrats making a decision to value \npartisan loyalty over the national security of our country, over \nstanding with our friend and ally the nation of Israel, and over \nprotecting the lives of millions of Americans--even in the face of \nthat--there are still serious steps we can take right now. There are \ntwo individuals in Washington, DC, who have the capacity still to stop \nthis deal. Their names are Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker \nof the House John Boehner. Corker-Cardin was, unfortunately, a very \nweak piece of review legislation, but it did have one small bit of \nteeth in it that ought to be used. Under Corker-Cardin, the review \nperiod does not start until the administration submits the entirety of \nthe deal to Congress. That entirety is defined under Corker-Cardin to \ninclude any and all side deals.\n  This deal has at least two side deals with the IAEA concerning \ninspections. It is the laughable inspection regime that trusts the \nIranians to inspect themselves. Those side deals have not been \nsubmitted to Congress. Under the terms of Corker-Cardin, the review \nperiod has not started and does not start until the entire deal is \nsubmitted to Congress, and the President cannot lift these sanctions \nuntil the review period expires.\n\n  So therefore, I call upon the leadership of my party--Leader \nMcConnell, Speaker Boehner--simply to enforce the terms of Corker-\nCardin. The administration has not submitted the deal. Accordingly, we \nshould not be voting on a resolution of disapproval because the Corker-\nCardin clock never began to start, and under Corker-Cardin, until the \nclock starts, the sanctions can't be lifted.\n  Republicans in this body should not be facilitating this President's \nyet again disregarding the law and doing so in contravention of the \nnational security interests of this country.\n  Two final observations: If and when we vote on this deal, for every \nMember of this body, I agree with my former colleague, former Senator \nJoe Lieberman, who said this may well be the most important vote any \nSenator casts in his or her career. I implore every Democrat who has \ncome out in support of this deal, search your conscience. You can make \na choice other than standing with your own party. You can stand up to \nyour own party. Trust me; I have done it myself. It is not the end of \nthe world.\n  I implore every Democrat: Go home and pray. Go home and ask yourself \nhow you will look in the eyes of the mother or father whose son was \nblown to bits by an Iranian IED that came directly from General \nSuleimani, on whom we are now lifting sanctions; how you will explain \nyour vote that ``your son or daughter's life didn't matter enough to \nme, that I was willing to reward their murderer.'' I can tell you that \nis not a conversation I would ever like to have. I ask every Democrat \nwho has said they support this deal to ask yourself that question.\n  I ask you to ask the question how you will look in the eyes of the \nmothers and fathers and sons and daughters of those who will be \nmurdered by Hamas, by Hezbollah, by the Houthis, by radical Islamic \nterrorists across the globe with the over $100 billion that this deal \ngives them.\n  Osama bin Laden murdered nearly 3,000 people on September 11, 2001. \nBin Laden never had $100 billion at his disposal. This deal gives \npeople every bit as evil, every bit as consumed with bilious hatred \nresources, billions of dollars. And, if this deal goes through, we know \nto an absolute certainty that Americans will be murdered, Israelis will \nbe murdered, and Europeans will be murdered. I ask every Democratic \nMember of this body to think before you cast a vote: How will you look \nin the eyes of the children of those who are murdered by terrorists who \nuse the billions that this deal gives them to kill them? That is blood \nyou can't wash your hands of. When you knowingly and willingly send \nbillions of dollars to jihadists who have declared their intention to \nmurder us, there is no excuse you can hide behind when they carry \nthrough on the intention using the billions of dollars you have given.\n  And, if--God forbid--Iran ever acquires a nuclear weapon, the odds \nare unacceptably high they would, No. 1, use that nuclear weapon above \nour friend and ally the nation of Israel. For every Democrat who \nmaintains he or she is a friend of Israel, you need to be prepared to \nexplain how you facilitated a day that could see a nuclear warhead \ndetonating over Tel-Aviv, murdering millions.\n  When Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke to a joint session of Congress, I \nparticipated in a panel discussion that my office organized with Elie \nWiesel, a Nobel laureate who survived the Holocaust, and when Elie \nWiesel says ``never again,'' it means never again. The one threat that \ncould kill 6 million Jews again is a nuclear Iran. Listen to Elie \nWiesel.\n  The single-most dangerous thing Iran could do with a nuclear weapon \nis launch it from a ship in the Atlantic into the atmosphere and set \noff an electromagnetic pulse, or an EMP, that would take down the \nelectrical grid and could kill tens of millions of Americans. To every \nDemocrat, listen to those voices.\n  Finally, if the Democrats refuse to put our national security \ninterests first, then it will be incumbent on the next President to \nundo the damage. Any competent Commander in Chief should be prepared on \nthe first day--on January 20, 2017--to rip to shreds this catastrophic \nIranian deal and to make clear to the Ayatollah Khamenei and to every \nother jihadist that under no circumstances will the nation of Iran, led \nby a theocratic Ayatollah who chants ``Death to America,'' be allowed \nto acquire nuclear weapons.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The minority whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, what time is remaining on the Democratic \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-six minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-one minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to respond very briefly--very \nbriefly--before yielding to Senator Nelson of Florida.\n  I would say to the junior Senator from Texas that I hope he listened \ncarefully last Sunday when General Colin Powell, former Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff--a man who risked his life in battle for America, \na man who served as Secretary of State under Republican President \nGeorge W. Bush--came forward and endorsed this agreement that has been \nproposed before the Senate. So to suggest that General Powell and so \nmany others are not aware of the security aspects of this agreement I \ndon't believe is a fair characterization. General Powell and others \nunderstand better than I can, better than the Senator from Texas can \nwhat it means to face these security issues. I would like to quote what \nhe said. He said that ``with respect to the Iranians, don't trust, \nnever trust, and always verify.'' So he comes to his conclusion \nsupporting this agreement with the same degree of skepticism that many \nof us do.\n\n  I would not discount for a minute some of the activities that have \nbeen cataloged by the junior Senator from Texas when it comes to Iran, \nbut if you think those were terrible--and they were--imagine Iran with \na nuclear weapon. That is what is at stake in this debate. Currently \nIran has the capacity to build 10 nuclear weapons--10. We want to stop \nthem from doing that, put inspectors in place. So when you list the \nlitany of horrors coming out of Iran's terrorist activities, imagine\n\n[[Page S6485]]\n\nthose activities with a nuclear weapon. Our goal is to stop the \ndevelopment of a nuclear weapon in Iran.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I will vote for the joint agreement. I \nwant the Senate and my colleagues from Florida to understand. I gave a \nlengthy speech as to why I would support this some 5 weeks ago, in the \nearly part of August before we adjourned. Indeed, I, like most every \nother Senator here, feel this is one of the most important votes we \nwill cast. I bring to the table the attempted insight given the fact of \n6 years being a member of the Intelligence Committee and now having the \nprivilege of being a senior member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  The question is, Does this agreement prevent Iran from having a \nnuclear bomb? That is the essential question. Does this agreement do \nthat? This is not an agreement to stop the bad behavior of Iran, which, \nof course, I wish we could. This is not a question of whether we are \ngoing to get Iran to suddenly change its attitude about Israel, which I \nwish we could. This is a question of preventing Iran from building and \nproducing a nuclear bomb. I believe this agreement does it, and I \nbelieve it does it at both the declared sites and a future cheating at \na covert site. Now, there are three declared sites. Those are going to \nbe completely dismantled. The whole program is going to be dismantled.\n  This is misunderstood when you talk about their centrifuges, of which \nthey have the generation of centrifuge that is very modernized. All of \nthose are going to be cut in a third, from approximately 19,000, and \nthey are all going to be first-generation, which is not the modernized \ncentrifuges. That is one thing. But also they have 12,000 kilograms of \nenriched uranium. Do you know how much that is? That is over 13 tons, \nto put it in the lingo Americans understand. That is going to be \nreduced under this agreement by 98 percent to 300 kilograms--in other \nwords, less than one-fifth to make a bomb. And by the way, that \nenriched uranium is going to be cut down not to 90 percent to build a \nbomb but 3.67 percent enriched uranium.\n  Also, going forward, we are going to have the inspection from cradle \nto grave, from the very uranium mines where they dig up the uranium \nrocks, to the processing, which is crushing it into the yellowcake--we \nare going to have constant surveillance of all of this--taking the \nyellowcake, making it into a gas, putting that gas into centrifuges, \nand spinning it so that the uranium comes out of the gas in more \nconcentrated forms, and in the cascade of these centrifuges, then \nbringing it down to the enriched uranium in order to make a bomb.\n  The same thing with plutonium. What about plutonium? In the one \ndeclared site, Arak, they are going to fill it up with concrete, and \nall of the existing plutonium is going to be shipped out of the \ncountry. I hope we are going to have lots of pictures of that as they \ndo this.\n  Oh, by the way, as they shut down this program--talking about this \nmoney which is held in the banks of five foreign countries, which is \nthe Iranian oil money they will eventually get--you hear all these \nfigures: 150, 100. When you subtract the Iranian obligations, the net \namount is still a lot of money--$56 billion--but they don't get that \nuntil they do all of this. And when is that going to be? It will \nprobably be a year from now before they ever get the money that is held \nin the banks of Japan, South Korea, China, India, and Taiwan, banks \nthat are in countries that need oil, that want Iranian oil, especially \nif in the future Iran sells them oil at discounted prices. Do you think \nthose banks, those countries are going to keep that money if we walk \naway from this deal? No. The sanctions are going to dissipate. The \nmoney is going to flow.\n  Thank goodness, because of the joint agreement, that money is not \ngoing to flow--probably a year from now--until they have done all of \nthese things that are required in the agreement of dismantling their \nprogram.\n  What this agreement does is it vastly reduces their ability to \nproduce a bomb unless they cheat. Let's talk about that. Now, I said \nfrom the very beginning--and this was part of my speech 5, 6 weeks ago. \nPresident Reagan said ``trust, but verify'' in dealing with the Soviet \nUnion. I say don't trust, but verify. So the whole point is that if we \nthink they are going to cheat--and I can tell you that this Senator \nthinks they are going to try to cheat, although I think they clearly \nare going to comply with this. And I think the outset--the preamble of \nthe agreement says that it is understood that Iran will never have a \nnuclear weapon. Never ever. But are some elements of their society, \ntheir government, going to try to cheat? This Senator thinks they will. \nCan we catch them? Well, I think we clearly will.\n  First of all, we are going to have a lot more insight into their \nattempted nuclear program than we do now. And by the way, we have a \nvast intelligence network out there, along with our allies, that will \npenetrate. But on top of that, other than the three declared sites of \nIraq, Natanz, and Fordow, which will all be dismantled in the \nreductions that I just mentioned--we will have immediate access to \nthose sites. Any other site that we suspect, that we say we want to \ninspect, the max that they can rope-a-dope us is 24 days.\n  So if they are trying to cheat, could they do a nuclear detonator? \nProbably. But can they build a bomb? The answer is no. Why is it no \nwithout us knowing? Because when that site is suspected and we go in \nand have the inspection, you cannot hide energized, enriched uranium or \nplutonium. The half-life of this stuff is thousands of years. You can't \npaint over it. You can't asphalt over it. We will find it because the \nradioactivity will be there.\n  If they cheat, what happens? The fact that we have caused them to \nreduce all of these things that I have mentioned means we have a year \nin advance to deal with it, whether it is a military strike, whether it \nis the sanctions going back into place.\n  By the way, this is structured so that the United Nations sanctions \ngo right back into place. You say: How in the world can you do that? \nThe U.N. Security Council--any one of those other countries, such as \nChina or Russia, can object.\n  No, that is not how this deal is structured. With the United States \nsaying the sanctions go back--by ourselves--if they have cheated, the \neconomic sanctions of the P5+1--the UK, France, Germany, China, Russia, \nand the United States--go back into place.\n  So we are going to have a year advance if they are cheating. Compare \nthat, please, to if we walk away from the deal today. They can have a \nnuclear bomb within a few months, and the sanctions of our allies will \ndissipate because they have all told us they will dissipate if we walk \naway from the deal.\n  I will conclude with this: If this Senator knows that we are in a \nsituation where if we reject the deal, Iran is going to have a nuclear \nbomb in a few months as opposed to any prospect in the future of them \nhaving a nuclear bomb with us having a year's advance notice but the \nlikelihood that it is 10, 15, 20, 25 years--this Senator feels that the \nworld is going to be a very different place in 15 to 20 years and that \nfor the protection of the interests of the United States and our allies \nright now, including our strong ally Israel, it is important that Iran \nnot have a nuclear weapon, that we are dealing with an Iran that does \nnot have a nuclear weapon in the immediate future and instead that we \npenetrate their society with a much better understanding with them not \nhaving the capability of a nuclear weapon until years and years in the \nfuture.\n  For all of those reasons--and you can tell this is coming right out \nof my heart and is not some written, read speech--it is in the interest \nof the United States that this Senator will vote to support the deal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from \nFlorida's--I am sure heartfelt--remarks, only 21 percent of the \nAmerican people agree with his stated position there, and I am\n\n[[Page S6486]]\n\nsure he will hear from his constituents, as he should.\n  I did not come to the floor this morning to talk about the agreement. \nI will save my remarks, which I have been asked to make, for this \nafternoon.\n\n\n                 Refugee Crisis and American Leadership\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I call attention to the urgent refugee \ncrisis that is happening in our midst. Men, women, and children are \nfleeing by the thousands from the violence and destruction that has \nengulfed the Middle East and North Africa. This crisis didn't come out \nof nowhere like an earthquake or a tornado. Instead, it is the \npredictable result of this administration's policies of leading from \nbehind as conflicts metastasized in the vacuum created through years of \ninaction by President Obama and a total lack of American leadership. \nThis did not happen by accident. It happened because of leading from \nbehind. It happened because this President has refused to lead. When a \nvacuum is created, this is the predictable result which many of us \npredicted.\n  As we know, the vast majority of these refugees are from Syria, a \ncountry which has known little but death and destruction for 4 years as \na murderous dictatorship and a homicidal cult have fought a war against \na common enemy, the Syrian people. As Assad and ISIL fight to rule, \ncruelty and atrocity reign.\n  According to the United Nations Refugee Agency, about 63 percent of \nEuropean asylum seekers in the past 2 years are Syrians, but the truth \nis, the refugee crisis is much bigger than what we are seeing today in \nEurope. Since 2011, well over 200,000 Syrians have been killed, 1 \nmillion injured, 8 million displaced, 4 million forced to seek refuge \nabroad in countries such as Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, and Egypt where \nthe situation is not much better. The United Nations has described this \ncrisis as ``the greatest humanitarian crisis tragedy of our times.''\n  As conditions at refugee camps in the region continue to deteriorate \nwith overcrowding, disease, violence, and exploitation, those who can \nare attempting to escape further west to safer places in Europe. The \nUnited Nations estimates that at least 850,000 people will seek refuge \nin Europe between 2015 and 2016. About a quarter of them will be \nchildren. These children are increasingly leaving their families and \nhomes to make dangerous journeys by sea and land. While they are \nrisking their lives to escape the threat of abduction, sexual abuse, \ntorture and murder, they face an entirely new set of threats on this \ndesperate journey for asylum. Many are on traversing unsafe routes, \nsuffering from starvation, facing the threat of human trafficking, \nenduring debilitating psychological trauma, and, of course, many are \ndying.\n  The U.N. Refugee Agency has stated that about 2,600 people have died \nwhile attempting to cross the Mediterranean this year alone, including \n3-year-old Aylan Kurdi. Aylan grew up in the Syrian city of Kobani, a \ncity situated on the border of Turkey, which in recent years has been \nunder siege by ISIL militants and the Assad regime. Facing increasing \nturmoil and unrest, Aylan's father, Abdullah, and mother, Rehen, did \nwhat any parent would do for their children. They attempted to move \nAylan and his 4-year-old brother Galip to a safer home. Abdullah \narranged for his family to board a boat bound for Sweden by way of \nGreece, a trip that many of his fellow Syrians have attempted over the \nyears. But when the Kurdi family met their smugglers in Turkey, they \nwere surprised how crowded the small, flimsy fiberglass boat was. \nDespite repeated questions about the safety of the voyage, the \nsmugglers assured Abdullah they would be OK.\n  Shortly into the trip, the waters became increasingly rough, crashing \ninto the boat and rocking it back and forth until it capsized, \nlaunching the passengers--including Aylan, his mother, and 4-year-old \nbrother--into the rough waters. Despite Abdullah's strongest attempts, \nhe was unable to save his family.\n  This photo, which was taken shortly after Aylan's dead body was \nwashed ashore, has opened the world's eyes to this devastating crisis. \nWithin hours of this photo being posted, people across the world began \nto share it on social media using a hashtag in Arabic that translates \nto ``humanity washed ashore.'' This image has haunted the world, but \nwhat should haunt us even more than the horror unfolding before our \neyes is the thought that the United States will continue to do nothing \nmeaningful about it.\n  The conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen, and elsewhere in the \nMiddle East and North Africa that have taken the lives of Aylan and \ncountless other desperate refugees are not only a threat to our \nsecurity, but a crisis of conscience. They challenge the moral fabric \nof our Nation and the foundation of global leadership. Let's be clear. \nThe current crisis before us is not a migrant issue. They are not \nmigrants. Migrants leave for economic reasons. It is a mass exodus of \nrefugees who are fleeing conflicts that this administration has refused \nto address for years. As the U.N. High Commissioner stated last week: \n``This is a primarily refugee crisis, not only a migration phenomenon. \nThe vast majority of those arriving in Greece come from conflict zones \nlike Syria, Iraq or Afghanistan and are simply running for their \nlives.''\n  I say to the media: Stop calling them migrants. They are not \nmigrants. They are refugees who are attempting to escape from torture, \nmurder, killing, and genocide. Statements and images like these should \nnot just be a source of heartbreak and sympathy; they should be a call \nto action. The following quote is from the Wall Street Journal \neditorial this morning.\n\n                         Another Syria Failure\n\n       It's hard to believe, but the debacle that is the Obama \n     Administration's Syria policy could get worse. U.S. sources \n     have been leaking that Russia may be preparing for a major \n     military deployment to keep Bashar Assad in power in \n     Damascus. By some reports quoting Western diplomats, a \n     Russian expeditionary force is already in Syria preparing for \n     the arrival of jets and attack helicopters to carry out \n     strikes against Islamic State . . . Mr. Assad is a Russian \n     ally, and Vladimir Putin isn't about to let the Syrian \n     government fall without a bigger fight. Like so much else in \n     the Middle East, President Obama has created an opening for \n     this Russian intervention by minimizing U.S. interests in the \n     outcome of Syria's civil war. He has refused to offer more \n     than token help to pro-Western Syrians, thus ceding the \n     battleground to radical Islamists or the Assad-Russia-Iran-\n     Hezbollah axis. Don't expect a decline in the flow of \n     refugees anytime soon.\n\n  Just a few months after the revolution in Syria began in 2011, \nPresident Obama issued his Presidential Study Directive stating: \n``Preventing mass atrocities and genocide is a core national security \ninterest and a core moral responsibility of the United States.''\n  He went on to say: ``Our security is affected when masses of \ncivilians are slaughtered, refugees flow across borders, and murderers \nwreak havoc on regional stability and livelihoods.''\n  In 2013, President Obama, speaking at the U.S. Holocaust Museum, \nsaid: ``Too often, the world has failed to prevent the killing of \ninnocents on a massive scale. And we are haunted by the atrocities that \nwe did not stop and the lives we did not save.''\n  In a 2013 address to the U.N. General Assembly, President Obama said:\n\n       [T]he principle of sovereignty is at the center of our \n     international order. But sovereignty cannot be a shield for \n     tyrants to commit wanton murder, or an excuse for the \n     international community to turn a blind eye. While we need to \n     be modest in our belief that we can remedy every evil, while \n     we need to be mindful that the world is full of unintended \n     consequences, should we really accept the notion that the \n     world is powerless in the face of a Rwanda, or Srebrenica? If \n     that's the world that people want to live in, they should say \n     so, and reckon with the cold logic of mass graves.\n\n  I strongly suggest, given the fact that there is no policy, no \nstrategy, and no effective way of stemming this horror, that the \nPresident of the United States should say so and reckon with the cold \nlogic of mass graves. That was our President. By the way, I agree with \nevery word he said, but how can the American people reconcile these \nwords with pictures of dead children and desperate refugees literally \nrunning for their lives? How can President Obama say it is our moral \nobligation to do what we can to prevent the worst atrocities in our \nworld but refuse to do anything to stop the atrocities that are \noccurring every single day in Syria and across the Middle East?\n  Where is that President Obama today? Where is the President Obama who \nhas spoken so movingly of the moral responsibilities that great power \nconfers?\n\n[[Page S6487]]\n\n  Unfortunately, the administration is still ``considering a range of \noptions''--I am not making this up--to respond to this issue, a \nNational Security Council spokesman stated this week. In the meantime, \nthe President and his cabinet officials continue to push through an \nagreement that legitimatizes Iran, which is not only the leading state \nsponsor of terror in the world, but the patron of the Assad regime \nresponsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent \nSyrians. After this deal, Iran's power in the region will only be \nenhanced, and it is safe to assume that it will use the billions of \ndollars in sanctions relief to boost arms supplies to Iran's terrorist \nproxies, to sow chaos and instability across the region, and to prop up \nAssad right when he needs it most.\n  As the administration stands by, Russia is capitalizing on America's \ninaction to provide additional support for the Assad regime. According \nto numerous press reports, Russia is establishing a base at an airfield \nnear an Assad stronghold in western Syria. Russia could soon deploy \n1,000 or more military personnel into Syria to conduct air operations \nin support of Assad's forces.\n  Our government is doing what it has sadly done too often in the past, \nreceding our strength and averting our eyes. We try to comfort our \nguilty consciences by telling ourselves that we are not doing nothing, \nbut it is a claim made in bad faith, for everyone concedes that nothing \nwe are doing is equal to the horrors we face. We are telling ourselves: \nWe're too tired or weary to get more involved, that this is not our \nproblem, that helping to resolve this crisis is not our responsibility, \nand that there are no options to end the conflicts around the world \ntoday. The truth is there was plenty that could have been done to avoid \nthe devastation unfolding before our eyes in 2011, in 2012, in 2013, in \n2014. And there is still more we can do today to respond to this \ngrowing crisis.\n  My friends, my colleagues, my fellow Americans, I fear the longer \nthis violence goes on, the more difficult it will be to bring it to an \nend. Failing to do so will leave a dangerous vacuum that enables \nextremism and instability to grow and provides terrorists the space, \nresources, and recruits they need to wreak havoc on the region and \nthreaten the United States of America.\n  It is not too late. We must not avert our eyes from Aylan and the \nmillions of other refugees running for their lives. We must commit to a \nstrategy to defeat the malign forces in the region that are sowing \nchaos and mass destruction. Failing to act now leaves us with even \nfewer options to rectify this terrible chapter in our history.\n  Speaking of history, I am a student of history. I don't believe there \nare exact parallels in American history, but there are certain areas \nwhere a failure to lead leads to catastrophic consequences. In 1938, on \nOctober 5, a man named Winston Churchill--who was shunned by his \ncolleagues and ridiculed in the House of Commons for his constant \nspeaking and warning--in one of my favorites of the appearances he made \nin the House of Commons before his fellow citizens, he said:\n\n       And do not suppose this is the end. This is only the \n     beginning of the reckoning. This is only the first sip, the \n     first foretaste of a bitter cup which will be proffered to us \n     year by year unless by a supreme recovery of moral health and \n     martial vigour, we arise again and take our stand for freedom \n     as in olden time.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak to the \nnuclear agreement with Iran. First, having just come back from the \nregion after having spent Sunday morning in one of the biggest refugee \ncamps inside Syria--where 80,000, more than half of them children under \nthe age of 18, with more than 250 every day leaving the camp because \nthey have lost hope and they are, frankly, more willing to live inside \na dangerous Syria with their lives in danger than to continue to live \ninside of this camp--let me associate myself with the imperative that \nSenator McCain laid before us, that we can do more. I don't agree with \nhis diagnosis of how we got here, nor will I likely agree with his \nsolution in terms of prescriptions to solve the problem, but I \ncertainly agree that this body and the administration should be \nstanding up and bearing our share of the burden when it comes to this \nhumanitarian crisis, having seen it now firsthand for myself.\n  Peace is a messy business. As Yitzhak Rabin said upon the recognition \nof the PLO--a really hard thing for the Israelis to do--he said, ``You \ndon't make peace with your friends, you make it with very unsavory \nenemies.'' It makes sense, right? The definition of peace is the \nsettlement of old disputes or even just one big dispute with someone \nwith whom one has a long history of disagreement or conflict. And \nunless peace comes from unconditional surrender--and that frankly \ndoesn't happen very much in the postnuclear age--then peace by nature \nis going to be a compromise. It doesn't come from one side getting \neverything it wants. Thus, by definition, it is going to feel fairly \nunsatisfactory.\n  I say this because viewing the Iran deal through that prism allows me \nto understand why so many people are voting no, and it allows me to \nunderstand why many of those who are voting yes took a long time to get \nthere, but what I have trouble understanding is all of the revisionist \nhistory that is crowding this Chamber right now. I don't think there is \na single Member of the Senate who didn't in principle support the idea \nof negotiating an end to Iran's nuclear weapons program. And I don't \nremember anyone who didn't understand that the sanctions we layered \nupon Iran were directed at their nuclear program, not their support for \nHezbollah or their detainment of hostages or any other malevolent \nbehavior in the region. Why? Because we had a whole different set of \nsanctions on that activity.\n  But now there is all sorts of Sturm und Drang in Congress over the \nidea that this deal represents a give-and-take between the United \nStates and Iran. Why didn't we get everything, a lot of people are \nasking; and the failure of this agreement to settle all our disputes \nwith Iran at once--but they still do bad stuff, people say. I view \nthese protests largely as cover for a ``no'' vote that is likely about \nsomething else because we always knew this was going to be a \nnegotiation. We can complain about the end balance, but we can't engage \nin a straight-faced argument about the outrageousness of Iran getting \nto keep a few centrifuges. And we can all rage about Iran's support for \nterrorism or their dangerous talk about our sacred ally, Israel, but we \nall passed sanctions bills knowing they were about their nuclear \nprogram, not all of these other activities. Thus, it must stand to \nreason that these sanctions would be removed if Iran came to the table \nand satisfied our concerns about their nuclear program, not our \nconcerns about everything else they do that is terrible.\n  Peace is never perfect. Diplomacy is, frankly, mostly ugly, but it \nmatters. Because why on Earth do we spend $500 billion every year on \nthe world's biggest, baddest, most capable military force if we aren't \nwilling to use it? I don't mean use it in the way that Senator Graham \nor Senator Cotton may mean ``use it,'' I mean use it by entering into \npeaceful agreements that are held in place by the threat of \noverwhelming U.S. military force. Our planes and our bombs and our \nbrigades, these are the muscle that ensures that agreements are lived \nup to, not the muscle that substitutes for a diplomatic agreement. \nAmerica, more than any other country in the world, can afford to take a \ndiplomatic risk because we can clean it up fast if it goes wrong. Now, \nI don't think this agreement is going to go wrong, but I sure like \nknowing that a bunker-busting bomb is waiting in the wings if it does. \nAnd I will sleep better at night knowing that by agreeing to this deal, \nwe are keeping together an unprecedented international coalition that \nwill stand with us if we need to drop that bomb--something they would \nnot do if we dropped it without this agreement.\n  This body often seems to forget that American power is not simply \nexercised through the blunt force of military power. And President \nObama, frankly, is not the first President to be pressed by hawks in \nCongress, and outside of Congress, to forsake diplomacy in favor of \nwar.\n\n  In the first meeting with legislative leaders after the announcement \nof Russian missiles inside Cuba, the bipartisan congressional \nleadership, meeting\n\n[[Page S6488]]\n\nwith President Kennedy, was unanimous in its support for an attack and \nultimately the possible invasion of Cuba. All of them thought that \ntalking to Russia about a negotiated solution equaled weakness. \nPresident Kennedy didn't listen, and over 13 days he worked out a \npeaceful solution to the Cuban Missile Crisis that history looks very \nkindly upon.\n  President Reagan, upon signing the IMF treaty with Russia, leaned \nover to Gorbachev as they announced the deal and said: ``The hardliners \nin both our countries are bleeding when we shake hands today.'' Hawks \nin Congress didn't want an agreement with our sworn enemy, Russia. They \ndidn't understand why we signed a nuclear agreement with a country that \nwas still out for American blood on so many other fronts. But history \ntells us that the IMF treaty was an important piece of our strategy to \nweaken hardliners inside Russia and open that country to reform.\n  I hear this analogy to 1938 and Munich almost every day, and it \ndoesn't just come with respect to this agreement. Almost every time we \nsit across the table from someone we have a disagreement with, the \nclaim is that it is Munich all over again, but Munich is the exception, \nnot the rule. There are plenty more diplomatic agreements to avert war \nthat went right rather than those that went wrong. It doesn't mean we \ndon't use 1938 as a caution, but it doesn't mean it is an automatic \nparallel to every single time we are trying to settle our disputes with \nan adversary at the negotiating table rather than through the means of \narms.\n  Our partners in the Middle East largely get this. I just returned \nfrom this trip, as I mentioned, to the region--Qatar, UAE, Iraq, \nKuwait, and Jordan--with Senator Peters. In every country we visited, \nwe heard about Iran's dangerous activity in the region, including \nsupport for the Houthis in Yemen, funding Shiite militias in Iraq, \npropping up the murderous Bashar al Assad in Syria, pumping money into \nHezbollah and Hamas to threaten Israel, but despite these provocations, \nevery Arab political leader whom we met with--every single one--\nsupports this agreement. They give two basic reasons, and I want to \nshare them because they mirror the reasons for my support as well.\n  First, they know that no matter how dangerous Iran is today, they \nshudder to think how much more dangerous Iran would be if they \npossessed a nuclear weapon. They believe, as I do, that this agreement \nis the best way to keep Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and they \nsupport it, to a country, first and foremost for that reason.\n  Before this deal, Iran had 19,000 centrifuges spinning. After it, \nthey are going to have just a few thousand. Before this deal, Iran was \nenriching up to 20 percent and was only a few months from being able to \nenrich to a level in which they could get on a pathway to a bomb. After \nthis deal, enrichment will be down to 3.7 percent. Before this deal, \nIran had an enormous stockpile of enriched uranium, and after this deal \nthat stockpile is, for all intents and purposes, eliminated--reduced by \n97 percent. Before this deal, the only way we knew what was going on in \nthe nuclear program was through covert surveillance. After the deal, we \nare going to have a network of inspectors crawling over every inch of \ntheir nuclear program to make sure they aren't cheating.\n  Second, our Arab partners whom we visited within the region know that \nall of the problems in the region can't be solved without Iran at the \ntable, and while they aren't sure this agreement by itself will draw \nIran into peaceful negotiations over Syria or Yemen or Iraq--and I \nthink none of us can be sure that is how this will play out--they are \ncertain that a rejection of the agreement by the United States Congress \nwill virtually guarantee that Iran will not come to the table. They \ntalk openly about fearing a newly isolated Iran, the rejection of this \nagreement empowering the hardliners, punishing the moderates, and \npushing Iran away from any constructive dialogue in the region. Our \nArab partners don't love the terms of this agreement any more than the \nU.S. Senate does, but they know the alternative--a retrenched Iran with \na green light to start back up their nuclear program--is the most \ndangerous outcome of all.\n  Our partners understand what supporters of the deal understand; that \nthis idea that if Congress were to reject the agreement, we could come \nback to the table and get a better one is pure fiction. It is pure \npolitical fiction made up by people who don't want to sound like they \ndon't have an alternative plan, when they really don't. No one with any \ncredible diplomatic experience in the Middle East believes that Iran \nwill come back to the table if Congress rejects this deal, and our \ninternational partners have told us to our face that they will not come \nback to the table if we reject this deal. A better deal is fantasy, \nplain and simple.\n  Here is what happens. Here is what really happens if Congress rejects \nthis deal that is supported by all of our negotiating partners--\nBritain, France, Germany, China, Russia--the entirety of the Security \nCouncil and all of our Arab partners in the region. What happens is \nthat Iran starts back up their nuclear program, centrifuges climb to \n25,000, 30,000, enrichment gets closer to the level necessary for a \nbomb, the inspectors get kicked out--our eyes on a nuclear program \ndisappear--and sanctions fray at first and likely fall apart over time \nand Iran gets everything it wants. It gets its nuclear program and it \ngets sanctions relief. What a catastrophic outcome that would be.\n  But as bad as that reality would be, it actually gets worse. We know \nthe hardliners have been marginalized as a result of this deal, and the \nmoderates, which I admit is, frankly, a relative term inside Iran, are \ngaining power. Rejection of this deal would just be a gift to \nhardliners and would likely lead to Ruhani being replaced by a \nRevolutionary Guard proxy who would lead Iran down a path that is even \nmore dangerous--hard to believe--than the path they are on today.\n  Lastly, the United States would just become an international pariah. \nWith all of our partners at the negotiating table, almost every nation \naround the world supporting this agreement, what would it say if the \nU.S. Congress walked away? Our power as a nation would be irreparably \ndamaged.\n  Now, I heard Senator Cruz on the floor earlier today chastising \nDemocrats, yelling at us, about how could we live with ourselves doing \na deal with our mortal enemy Iran. So let me ask him and others who \noppose this agreement, with the rhetoric that he uses, a question in \nreturn: How could opponents of this deal live with themselves if a \nrejection of this deal would result in, No. 1, Iran restarting its \nnuclear program; No. 2, sanctions dramatically weakening; No. 3, \ninspections ending; and, No. 4, hard-liners being in power inside Iran?\n  The fact is that many Republicans opposed this agreement before they \nread it. Senator Cruz opposed it within an hour of its announcement. So \nI don't know how some opponents of this deal can live with themselves \nhaving made a political decision to oppose the most important \ndiplomatic agreement that most of us will vote on during our time here.\n  This is not a perfect deal, but no diplomatic agreement ever is. \nPeace, as the great Israeli leader Yitzhak Rabin told us, is never \neasy. History almost always judges that it is worthwhile.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise to urge all of our colleagues, \nRepublicans and Democrats, to strongly oppose the proposed nuclear deal \nwith Iran and to effectively block it for the sake of the country and \nour national security by supporting the motion of disapproval on the \nSenate floor.\n  I have served in the Senate and the House for about 15 years. It has \nbeen an enormous honor and a serious responsibility. I have taken it \nvery seriously. When I think through all of that service, all of the \nvotes we have cast, all of the debates we have had, I cannot think of \nany more serious than the issue we are debating and voting on here, the \nIran nuclear deal. Maybe there are a few that rank in a similar way--\nafter 9/11, starting that effort to\n\n[[Page S6489]]\n\nroot out terrorists and to oppose those who inflicted massive death in \nour country--but there is none that is more important and more \nsignificant because this deal, this issue goes to the fundamental \nsecurity of America, our future. Are we going to be free from the \nthreat of attack with nuclear weapons by a wildly radical and unstable \nregime? It does not get more basic, more serious than that.\n  The first point I want to make is that this is a dead-serious issue \nbecause the consequences do involve life or death, massive numbers of \nlives or deaths. So if there is any debate, any vote that should be \ncompletely devoid of partisan political considerations, it is this one. \nI urge all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to leave the \npartisanship at the door. This is way more important than that. I would \nhope that would be obvious.\n  With that in mind, it is troubling that President Obama has tried to \nmake this a partisan debate. He has actively, obviously sought to \ninflict partisanship into it, I think simply because that is the way he \nthinks he can hold enough Democratic votes on his side. I think that is \nreally a shame. I hope everyone proves him wrong in terms of the nature \nof the debate and vote we have in this important body.\n  When you look at the agreement, at the specifics of the agreement--I \nwill not go into all of the weeds and all of the issues. I could spend \ndays alone on that. But I do want to focus on two key considerations \nthat are absolutely top in my mind.\n  The first is the very premise and outcome of the agreement because we \nhave gone from a negotiation that was supposed to be about preventing \nIran from ever developing nuclear weapons to a discussion of when they \nare going to do it. We have gone from if to when. This agreement \nensures that they will have the ability to get there even if they live \nunder the full terms of the agreement, and obviously there is a \nconcern, which I will get to in my second point, that they won't. This \nputs our nuclear nonproliferation policy, including the \nnonproliferation treaty, which has been the cornerstone of our policy \nregarding the proliferation of nuclear weapons and particularly in the \nMiddle East for 45 years--this throws it out the window. This puts it \non its head.\n  With this agreement, the United States has agreed that at the end of \na timeline, Iran has full authority to enrich uranium, will be \ncompletely within its rights to do so with no fear of economic or \npolitical repercussions by the major powers, full authority for them to \ngo against 45 years of standing nonproliferation policy. So what \nstarted as strong action, including meaningful sanctions that were \nhaving an impact to make sure Iran never got nuclear weapons, now \nconcedes that they will get there; it is simply a debate about when. \nThat is at the core of this agreement. That is at the core of the \nreason we all must say no and pass the motion of disapproval.\n  If there is any region of the world where we need to maintain this \ntough nonproliferation policy, it is the Middle East. This agreement \nobliterates that. Iran won't be the only new nuclear power over time. \nThere will be a race among Middle Eastern countries to develop nuclear \nweapons because Iran is going to get one. That is inevitable, in my \nmind.\n  The second major point I want to make--the second major issue is \nverification, our ability under the agreement to see that Iran lives by \nit. First, as I said, even under the agreement, we are conceding their \nability to develop nuclear weapons. That is absolutely wrong. But then \nwithin the agreement, we also have nothing near the tools and the \nassurances we need with regard to verification every step of the way.\n  Iran has proved over and over that they will violate these sorts of \nagreements, that they will lie. International agencies have caught them \nin those lies, including the IAEA. That agency and others have noted \nthe difficulty of verification in dealing with Iran. Then we get to \nthis agreement, which makes that difficulty move from significant to \nmonumental.\n  There are lots of details we could look at, but the single most \ntelling is the detail that is in a side agreement between Iran and the \nIAEA that we are not allowed to read. We are having this debate. We \nhave to vote on this motion of disapproval. Yet we are not allowed to \nread this critical side agreement which goes to the heart of the \nability of the world to verify compliance.\n  I brought up this fairly basic issue a few weeks ago when Wendy \nSherman, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, testified \nbefore our committee on banking and urban affairs. I asked her point-\nblank: This side agreement between the IAEA and Iran, have you read it?\n  She answered: Yes.\n  I will be honest with you, I am not certain if that is true, but she \nanswered yes.\n  Then I asked her: Am I, as a representative of the people of \nLouisiana, allowed to read that agreement?\n  She answered through nonresponses: No.\n  I asked her: Do you have to vote on this agreement in your \nresponsibility?\n  No.\n  But I do; correct, Ms. Sherman?\n  Yes.\n  But I don't get to read this critical side agreement with regard to \nverification that goes to the heart of our ability to make sure Iran is \neven following these rules, as lax as they are?\n  Again, through her nonanswer, the answer was clear: No, I don't get \nto read it. The Presiding Officer does not get to read it. Nobody in \nthe Senate who is voting on this gets to read it. Nobody in the House \nof Representatives who is voting on this gets to read it. Forget about \nany slight on the Presiding Officer and me and others personally. It is \nnot about that. We are here to represent the people. I am here to \nrepresent the people of Louisiana. I cannot read what we are voting on? \nThat is absolutely ridiculous.\n  Then, to add insult to injury, come press reports about what we are \nnot allowed to read. Of course, the most significant were the press \nreports from several weeks ago from the AP saying that this side \nagreement had an extremely unusual provision with regard to inspections \nat at least one of Iran's most sensitive military facilities--the \nbiggest concern we have probably in all of Iran. In at least that most \nsensitive military facility and perhaps others, Iran gets to collect \nthe samples. Iran gets to choose and control those who do. The IAEA, \nthe international community, and America do not and are not allowed on \nsite. That just does not pass, I would say, the laugh test. But it is a \nvery serious matter. That is like someone like Alex Rodriguez \ncollecting his own urine and mailing it in. That does not work at a \nbasic level. Yet that, according to very credible reports, is in this \nside agreement that, oh, by the way, we are not allowed to read.\n  For all of these reasons, for our security, for our kids' future, for \nfreedom around the world, for Israel's security, for nonproliferation \nin the Middle East so that we do not have an explosive Middle Eastern \nnuclear arms race, we must pass this motion of disapproval.\n  Again, this goes way beyond politics. This is about our physical \nsecurity, our kids' and grandkids' future. We must all come together, \nlook at the substance of this, and do the right thing. That certainly \ninvolves invoking cloture on this motion so we go to a final vote. I \nbelieve that clearly involves passing this motion of disapproval. I \nurge all of our colleagues to do exactly that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, as do virtually all of the Members of \nthis body, I believe we must prevent Iran from developing a nuclear \nweapon. Because of that, I support the international agreement that the \nSenate is debating this week because I am convinced it is the best way \nto achieve that objective.\n  We can stop Iran's nuclear weapons program in one of two ways, either \ndiplomatically or militarily. Powerful international sanctions, which I \nhave strongly supported, have brought Iran to the negotiating table. \nAnd on July 14, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, \nChina, and the European Union--the so-called P5+1\n\n[[Page S6490]]\n\npowers--concluded an agreement with Iran that, if it is implemented as \nit was agreed to, promises a peaceful, diplomatic solution. Thanks to \nthe Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, Congress has had ample time to \nreview the agreement.\n  I have spent hours and hours studying the text of the agreement and \nscrutinizing our intelligence agencies' classified assessment of their \nability to verify Iran's compliance.\n  As a member of both the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, I attended more than a dozen hearings \nand briefings with administration officials and outside experts--both \nfor and against the agreement. In the end, I have concluded that this \nagreement effectively blocks Iran's pathways to develop a nuclear \nweapon for well over a decade.\n  Right now, what we heard from testimony from both those people who \nsupport and oppose the agreement is that Iran can acquire enough \nfissile nuclear material to make a bomb in less than 3 months. The \nagreement extends this breakout time to at least 1 year by slashing \nIran's stockpile of enriched uranium by 98 percent and banning \nenrichment above 3.67 percent, which is far below weapons grade, for 15 \nyears.\n  The agreement also reduces Iran's number of centrifuges by more than \ntwo-thirds for a decade, and it maintains inspectors' access to Iran's \nuranium mines and mills--so the whole life cycle of uranium--for a \nquarter of a century. These are just some of the many restrictions the \nagreement imposes on Iran.\n  In addition, Iran is bound by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and \nother agreements to a permanent commitment not to pursue nuclear \nweapons and, as part of that agreement, to permit access by inspectors \nto any suspected sites. Of critical importance, the Iran agreement is \nnot based on trust--none of us trust Iran--but it is based on an \ninspections regime that is more rigorous and more intrusive than any \nprevious negotiated agreement. Nuclear experts are confident that we \nwill be able to detect violations by Iran. Thanks to language in the \nagreement that allows the United States to respond unilaterally to a \nviolation by reimposing U.S. and U.N. sanctions, Iran knows that it \nfaces crippling consequences if it violates the agreement.\n  If Congress rejects the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the Iran \nagreement, all of these advantages go away. The risk of an Iranian \nnuclear breakout and a regional nuclear arms race will increase \ndramatically. We will be left with no credible, nonmilitary option for \nstopping Iran's nuclear program.\n  Now, I certainly respect the views of my colleagues who oppose this \nagreement, and I have listened carefully to their arguments. Some of \nthem assert that Iran will find a way to cheat and, therefore, no \ndiplomatic resolution is possible. However, most opponents are careful \nto avoid talk of military conflict and argue that we can reject this \ndeal, that we can rally the world to impose harsher sanctions, and that \nIran will eventually capitulate.\n  But sadly, that premise is at odds with the facts as they currently \nexist. Our negotiating partners in this deal--Britain, France, Russia, \nChina, and the European Union--have concluded that this is a fair \nagreement. In a briefing for Senators last month, the Ambassadors from \nthese nations told us in no uncertain terms that there will be no going \nback to the bargaining table if Congress rejects this agreement. If the \ndeal is rejected, the most likely outcome is that the international \nsanctions regime against Iran would unravel. The United States would be \nisolated, and we would lose credibility as a reliable negotiating \npartner. So, yes, we would retain the ability to act unilaterally, but \nunilateral sanctions have their limits, as we have heard in this body. \nOur military commanders counsel us that even a robust military option \nwould delay, but it would not prevent, Iran from obtaining a nuclear \nweapon because they already have the nuclear know-how.\n  This agreement is not about becoming friends with Iran or turning a \nblind eye to its efforts to destabilize the Middle East. In fact, we \nmust redouble our efforts to help our allies counter Iran's malign \ninfluence in the region.\n  In particular, our commitment to the defense of Israel should remain \nunshakeable. In addition, we must maintain vigorous sanctions against \nIran for its support for terrorism and for its violations of human \nrights.\n  Now, while there are risks to whatever course we take with respect to \nIran, I believe that the choice is clear. Either we recognize that this \nagreement is the best available option or we chase some fantasy \nagreement on our own as international sanctions collapse and Iran's \nnuclear program continues unchecked and our options for stopping it are \nnarrowed.\n  I am convinced that the agreement negotiated by the United States and \nour allies is the least risky approach, and it is the approach that is \nmost likely to succeed. As I said last month in New Hampshire, I intend \nto vote to support this deal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I ask unanimous that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, as I rise, many who fear the pending Iran \nvote feel that it could deliver a mortal blow to the Senate's historic \nsupport for the safety of the families of Israel. Have no fear. No \nmatter what, we will always have a capable majority of Americans who \nsupport the free and democratic tolerant society of Israel. No matter \nwhat the Iranians do, America's commitment will remain to that shining \ncity on Jerusalem's hills, to a nation that has proved that democracy \nand tolerance can thrive in a place even as hostile as the Middle East \nand will remain strong.\n  I represent many people who have survived the Holocaust. Their spirit \nis within the State of Illinois. They prevailed over the worst evil \nthat has ever disgraced our time.

The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, in anticipation of the majority leader \nand minority leader coming to the floor in a moment, I will begin the \ndebate, a debate on the most consequential vote I will ever take as an \nelected official. Certainly, in my 41 years of public service, I have \nnever had a decision to make as serious, as complex, and as meaningful \nas the decision we will make on the Iran nuclear deal negotiated by the \nadministration and the President.\n  I rise in opposition to that agreement and to explain why I will vote \nagainst it, but before I do, I want to compliment three or four members \nin particular on the Foreign Relations Committee: former Chairman \nMenendez from New Jersey, Ranking Member Cardin from Maryland, and \nChairman Corker from Tennessee. Throughout the entire debate on the \nIran nuclear deal, they have been forthright in being sure everybody \ngot every question they wanted answered, that every issue was exposed, \nand that everybody had the time to participate to the fullest degree \npossible. Great leadership on the part of Senator Corker, great \nleadership on the part of Senator Cardin, and great assistance on the \npart of Senator Menendez.\n  In the end, in committee, I voted for the resolution of disapproval \nto vote against the nuclear arrangement with the Iranians, and I want \nto talk about why. First of all, the President said a vote against the \ndeal is a vote for war. I argue with that conclusion. In fact, I think \na vote against the deal is a vote of strength. A vote for the deal is \nan\n\n[[Page S6491]]\n\nappeasement to the Iranian people, to the Iranian ayatollahs, and to a \ngroup of people who have not been trustworthy in negotiations with our \ncountry for the past 60 years.\n  Second, I think it is a vote against strength and for appeasement, \nwhen in fact there has never been a time more important to the United \nStates of America to be stronger than today.\n  Think about this. The bodies of young Syrian children are washing up \non the shore of the Mediterranean. The Russians have established a \nbeachhead in the Crimea, the Ukraine, and now in the Arctic. Last week, \nour President went to Alaska and the Chinese sent five ships off the \ncoast just to wave the Chinese flag in the face of our President.\n  Our diplomacy around the world is faltering and failing because we \nare not resolved. We are not as strong as we used to be. Diplomatically \nwe are not respected and militarily we are not feared. It is time we \nmade sure the vote we cast on this Iranian nuclear deal is not a vote \nthat sends another signal of weakness but instead a signal of strength.\n  Why am I voting against the Iranian nuclear deal? There are five \nprincipal reasons. No. 1 is the basis upon which I voted for the New \nSTART treaty 5 years ago. When I voted for that treaty, I was on the \nForeign Relations Committee as well, and the questions I asked at that \ntime are the same questions I am asking now about what is not a \ntreaty--what I think is a treaty but what the President calls an \nagreement: No. 1, is it enforceable; No. 2, do we have inspections; No. \n3, do we have credibility; No. 4, have I seen all the documents; and, \nNo. 5, is it best for my children and grandchildren and the future of \nmy country?\n  First, I haven't seen all the documents, and we now find out we will \nnever see all of them because the addendums to the IAEA will not be \navailable to us as Members of the Senate. That is No. 1. No. 2, can we \nhave inspections? Well, yes, you can have inspections, kind of or sort \nof. Yes, you get 24 hours' notice and then 24 days to approve and then \nthe Iranians have a say over who gets to inspect and we don't have a \npart. That is not a fair deal.\n  When I voted for the New START treaty, the principal reason I finally \ndid was this: Russians were allowed in the United States to inspect our \nnuclear warheads; we were allowed in Russia to inspect theirs. We had \nabsolute credibility in the inspection regime. We knew what we were \ngetting, and it was an enforceable treaty. This is not that. This is \none that can be cheated on too easily and far too easily for the \nAmerican people and the security of my children and grandchildren.\n  And what about my children and grandchildren--why are they of \ninterest to me in this vote? They are because they are our future. The \nfuture of all mankind is the young people today who will run these \ncountries in the years ahead, unless there is a rogue nation with \nnuclear weapons that could disrupt the world's balance of power, and \nthat is just what the Iranians are capable of doing. So I want to make \nsure I don't do anything that would facilitate the Iranian use of \nnuclear weapons in the future. I don't think this deal protects us from \nthat, and that is why I am going to vote against it.\n  Lastly, I want to comment about the issue of a cloture vote. I \nunderstand there will be a vote to filibuster the final vote on the \nresolution of disapproval rather than having a resolution of \ndisapproval. I think that is wrong. I think the American people deserve \nto know where each of us stand, and the people of Georgia deserve to \nknow where Johnny Isakson stands--what I am going to do and why I am \ngoing to do it.\n  A vote against cloture is to protract having a final vote on the \nresolution of disapproval and leaves open the whole issue. It is not \nfair to the American people, it is not right for the American people, \nand it is avoiding our responsibility. So I will vote for cloture so we \ncan go to a final vote on the resolution of disapproval, and I hope \nevery Member of the Senate will do the same. To do anything less is \nwrong for America, wrong for our heritage, and wrong for our future.\n  So I end where I began. I thank Senator Corker, Senator Menendez, and \nSenator Cardin for their forthright leadership. I have studied hard, I \nhave worked hard to try to find the best parts of this deal and the \nworst parts of this deal. I find it fails in those five tests I have \ngiven it and I will vote no. I will vote for the resolution of \ndisapproval and vote against the treaty with Iran on the Iran nuclear \ndeal.\n  With that said, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Colleagues, before the Senate is a resolution that \nwould disapprove of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action agreed to by \nthe United States, China, France, Germany, the Russian Federation, the \nUnited Kingdom, the European Union, and the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n  I have long said the Senate should assess this deal by employing a \nsimple standard: Will it further or will it harm the national security \ninterests of the United States and her allies? By that measure, I \nbelieve Senators must vote to disapprove of the deal.\n  I truly wish that wasn't the case, but it is a predictable outcome \nwhen one considers the mindset with which the administration appeared \nto approach these negotiations. The President's overall foreign policy \nhas long been guided by policies and desires to withdraw forward-\ndeployed conventional military power from operational theaters, to \nreduce America's commitments and capabilities, and to rely upon \ninternational organizations to uphold international order.\n  That is the type of mindset that guided the administration's \nnegotiators on this deal, and it has resulted in a flawed deal that a \nmajority of Congress and a broad swath of the American people now seem \npoised to reject--and that is a bipartisan majority.\n  The American people were led to believe that negotiations with Iran \nwould be about ending its nuclear program, but that is not what the \ndeal before us would do. Instead, the President's deal would bestow \ninternational recognition upon Iran's nuclear program by the most \npowerful nations on Earth. There is no question that Iran's nuclear \nprogram is designed to develop a nuclear weapon--no question. This is \nnot about peaceful nuclear energy.\n  Yet the President's deal would leave Iran as a nuclear threshold \nstate forever on the edge of developing a nuclear weapon. It would \nallow Iran to maintain thousands of centrifuges--1,044 IR-1 centrifuges \nin Fordow and 5,060 centrifuges at Natanz--as well as advanced research \nand development programs.\n  The President's deal with Iran will also give the regime access to \nliterally billions of dollars. The President himself has acknowledged \nthat at least some of that cash windfall is likely to be used to \nsupport terrorism.\n  It is already clear that Iran is meddling in Bahrain, in Yemen, in \nLebanon, and in Afghanistan, and the President's deal will only \nstrengthen terrorist proxies such as Hezbollah, the Houthi insurgents \nin Yemen, and the Assad regime in Syria.\n  Iran is working to prop up and protect Assad's regime in Damascus, \nand it is working with Shia militias in Iraq to expand its influence \neven further--just as Iran once supplied Iraq's Shia militias with the \nweapons to maim and kill our soldiers and marines.\n  Iran has a long history of employing terrorism as a tool for \ndefending the regime--not just against its neighbors, not just against \nIsrael, but also against America.\n  On September 20, 1984, with support and direction from Iran, the Shia \nmilitants of Hezbollah carried out a suicide car bombing against the \nAmerican embassy in Beirut, 31 years ago. Two dozen people died that \nday; among them, Chief Warrant Officer Kenneth Welch of the U.S. Army. \nHis son, Brian, has lived with that loss ever since. I want all of our \ncolleagues to know he is sitting with us in this Gallery this \nafternoon. He is right here with us listening to this debate.\n  So I ask my colleagues: How could we support a deal that would not \nonly\n\n[[Page S6492]]\n\nstrengthen terrorist groups like Hezbollah, but also would effectively \nsubsidize the activities of the Revolutionary Guard Corps, a group that \nhas been accused of helping Shiite militias attack and kill Americans \nin Iraq?\n  The $100 billion Iran is expected to reap from this deal is also \ncertain to be invested in Iran's war economy for defense of the regime \nand will undoubtedly strengthen the hand of the Revolutionary Guards.\n  The Council on Foreign Relations has referred to the group as the \nregime's ``money machine'' because of its varied business interests \nwith Iran. As the Council noted in a 2013 backgrounder, the Guards were \nestimated to have ties to more than 100 companies controlling about $12 \nbillion in construction and engineering capital, and one of its \nfellows, Ray Takeyh, has linked the group to ``university laboratories, \nweapons manufacturers, and companies connected to nuclear technology.''\n  Now, the administration has attempted to make light of the benefits \nto Iran's economy, military, and terrorist arms from the lifting of \nsanctions. Secretary Kerry observed that $100 billion is ``nothing''--\nnothing--``compared to what gets spent'' in the region.\n  ``Iran's military budget is $15 billion,'' he said, while ``the Gulf \nstates' military budget is $130 billion.''\n  But what is lost on Secretary Kerry is the fact that Iran and its \nproxies have pursued asymmetric capabilities against the United States, \nnot to mention Israel and our moderate Sunni allies.\n  Iran has carefully studied the tactics and capabilities brought to \nbear by our forces in Desert Storm, Operation Enduring Freedom, \nOperation Iraqi Freedom, and other campaigns. And because it has, the \nregime has decided to invest in anti-access and area-denial \ncapabilities, cyber warfare capabilities, espionage, and other means to \navoid fighting directly against our strengths.\n  The Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, in an assessment \nof the nuclear deal with Iran, expanded on that point. Here is what \nthey had to say:\n\n       Iran has acquired and developed various capabilities to \n     execute this asymmetric strategy, including anti access/area \n     denial . . . it possesses the region's largest arsenal of \n     short and medium ballistic missiles, as well as a growing \n     arsenal of cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles, to \n     target military and energy installations throughout the Gulf, \n     including U.S. ships. It also has a sizeable fleet of fast \n     attack craft, submarines and large numbers of torpedoes and \n     naval mines for choking off Hormuz and attacking \n     aforementioned targets. The S-300 air defense systems could \n     stymie U.S. air operations around the Gulf, in addition to \n     complicating any strike on Iran's nuclear facilities.\n\n  That is from the Jewish Institute of National Security Affairs.\n  Now, there is another worrying aspect of the cash windfall from this \ndeal as well. It will also serve to advance Tehran's efforts to divide \nthe United States from the very allies who helped us bring Iran to the \ntable in the first place. As Iranian trade expands with the other P5+1 \ncountries, they will grow even more reluctant to hold Iran accountable \nfor the inevitable violations of the deal.\n  We need not have ended up here. We didn't have to be in this place. \nThe President had the opportunity to declare a firm policy to end \nIran's nuclear program and to enact additional sanctions while Iran's \nwar economy was ailing. But, no, that is not what he did.\n  Instead, the administration attempted to rely on the ambiguity of its \nmilitary policy by claiming at every stage that it sought to keep ``all \noptions on the table.'' But that was never a policy. It was a talking \npoint--a talking point was not going to deter Iran.\n  As I alluded in a speech delivered at AIPAC a few years ago, the only \nway the administration is going to be able to persuade Iran to cease \nits pursuit of a nuclear weapon and to dismantle its enrichment \ncapability is if it was prepared to make the Supreme Leader of Iran \nbelieve--believe--that the survival of his regime was actually at \nstake.\n  In other words, the only way the Iranian regime could have been \nexpected to negotiate to preserve its own survival--rather than simply \ndelay as a means to pursue nuclear weapons--is if the administration \nhad imposed the strictest sanctions while concurrently enforcing a firm \ndeclaratory policy that reflected a commitment to a potential use of \nforce, if that became necessary. But, no. The administration chose to \npursue negotiations and sanctions consecutively rather than \nsimultaneously, as it also failed to articulate a clear consequence for \nthe crossing of red lines.\n  Thus, while the President had an opportunity to exercise political \nleadership and work with the Congress to craft a stronger policy toward \nIran that would have better served our national security, he chose the \npath of concessions instead. Indeed, the administration allowed for a \nseries of concessions throughout these lengthy negotiations.\n  Rather than anytime, anywhere inspections, the deal creates a process \nwithin which Iran can delay inspections for at least up to 24 days.\n  Rather than dismantle Iran's enrichment capability, some centrifuges \nwill be put in storage, enrichment will continue, and research and \ndevelopment will go on--all legitimatized by the President's deal. Now, \nat the end of the 10- and 15-year milestones, Iran's breakout time will \nbe reduced to nearly zero.\n  Concessions were made on the conventional weapons ban and ballistic \nmissile technology embargo too. Despite the fact that the International \nAtomic Energy Agency reported in 2011 that ``Iran has carried out \nactivities relevant to the development of a nuclear device,'' the \nadministration made further concessions regarding the possible military \ndimensions of Iran's program.\n  Assessing this deal strategically, it can only be understood as part \nof a broader strategy to concede a larger sphere of influence to the \nIranian regime while weakening our commitment to our moderate Sunni \nallies and Israel. Now, that is just fitting within the overall \nadministration's view of reducing America's overseas commitments, its \nreliance upon international organizations, and its seeming \ndetermination to withdraw our forward deployed presence. But in terms \nof our traditional strategy, it makes no sense at all, as Iran's \ncapability and power will be stronger in every single regard.\n  Writing in the Wall Street Journal in April, two former Secretaries \nof State noted that Iran's representatives remain committed to a \nrevolutionary, anti-western concept of the international order. They \nobserved that:\n\n       Absent any linkage between nuclear and political restraint, \n     America's traditional allies will conclude that the U.S. has \n     traded temporary nuclear cooperation for acquiescence to \n     Iranian hegemony. They will increasingly look to create their \n     own nuclear balances and, if necessary, call in other powers \n     to sustain their integrity.\n       Does America still hope to arrest the region's trend \n     towards sectarian upheaval, state collapse, and the \n     disequilibrium of power tilting toward Tehran, or do we now \n     accept this as an irremediable aspect of the regional \n     balance?\n\n  Regrettably, it appears that the administration has traded the \nappearance of nuclear cooperation for acquiescence to Iranian hegemony.\n  The President famously suggested that if countries like Iran were \nwilling to unclench their fist, they would find an extended hand. From \nthat hand the Iranians took concession after concession after \nconcession on enrichment, on U.N. Security Council resolutions, on \ncentrifuges, on missiles, on the conventional arms embargo, and on \nsanctions--concessions on every one of those issues.\n  Under the President's deal with Iran, nearly every aspect of Iran's \nnational power will be strengthened: economic power, diplomatic power, \nespionage power, conventional warfare power, and the power Iran derives \nfrom supporting proxies like Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen, \nand the Assad regime.\n  So when supporters of this flawed deal ask ``what is the \nalternative,'' there is a simple answer: political leadership. It is \nthe next President and the next Congress that will have to deal with \nthe consequences of this deal; and if we are united in ending Iran's \nnuclear program, we can make clear to the Iranians that their weapons \nprogram is simply unacceptable.\n  Remember: It was the sanctions enacted by Congress, over the \nobjections of President Obama--many people have forgotten that he \ndidn't want the sanctions they ended up getting--that\n\n[[Page S6493]]\n\ncaused sufficient concern within the regime to compel the Supreme \nLeader to allow the negotiations in the first place.\n  That is why, throughout the previous Congress and the beginning of \nthis Congress, I attempted to pass additional sanctions and made a \ncommitment to a strong declaratory policy against Iran--an idea some of \nour colleagues may now deem necessary to pursue through legislation \ngiven the terms of the nuclear deal with Iran.\n  But Congress alone cannot provide Presidential leadership. It can \nprovide for the defense capabilities required to contain and combat \nthreats like Iran. It can reassure regional allies, like Israel, that \nthis Executive deal is not a treaty and can be revisited. And when Iran \ncheats on this deal, we can resolve to use the tools available to us to \nstop its nuclear weapons program. In short, Congress can lay the \ngroundwork for the next President. But Congress needs real Presidential \nleadership, too.\n  Just this morning, we saw reports that Iran's Supreme Leader had \nruled out any real rapprochement with the U.S. after this nuclear deal. \nWe saw the Supreme Leader state his desire to see Israel cease to exist \nin the coming years. Against that backdrop, we now have the President's \ndeal with Iran before us.\n  Any objective net assessment of this deal must conclude that it will \nstrengthen the Supreme Leader's regime. No question about it. Any \nobjective assessment must also conclude that America and her allies \nwill be made less safe by the President's deal with Iran. Well, \ncertainly that is the conclusion I have reached as well. This is the \nconclusion many Democrats have reached. This seems to be the conclusion \nthe American people have reached as well.\n  I wish this was a deal I could support, but it isn't. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me and many others in voting for the resolution of \ndisapproval.\n  In fact, we know there is a bipartisan majority of the United States \nSenate in opposition to this deal. We know that already. We know there \nis a huge majority of Americans who oppose this deal. We know that \nevery single Democrat who has come out for the deal has immediately \nstarted making excuses about how we need to get tougher with Iran--\nevery single one of them.\n  So that is what is before us, and it will be before us until next \nweek.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to thank our leader \nand I wish to thank Senator Reid for allowing us to come to this vote \nwithout a motion to proceed so we can begin this debate in a sober and \nresponsible manner.\n  I thank the leader. I know many Members on the other side of the \naisle were concerned about maybe nefarious amendments being a part of \nthis debate on the front end. I thank you for the way you set up this \nprocedure so that we are focused only on the resolution of disapproval. \nThat is something I know the other side had wanted, and I appreciate \nyour setting it up in that manner.\n  I also thank Senator Cardin. I thank him for being such a tremendous \npartner on the committee. I thank him for his diligence in making what \nI know was a tough decision on the substance. I truly appreciate his \nability and the way he worked with us to ensure that we have this \ndebate and this opportunity to vote.\n  Let me step back and refresh people's memory. I know there has been a \nlot of discussion, and there are some who purposefully try to confuse \nwhat is happening here. But the fact is that the President decided long \nago that he was not going to pursue a treaty. He instead was going to \npursue what is called a nonbinding political commitment, and he was \ngoing to go directly to the U.N. Security Council for approval. As a \nmatter of fact, he has already done that.\n  In the course of discussions, we realized, just as the leader \nmentioned, it was actually we who brought Iran to the table. We had \nfour tranches of severe sanctions that, as was mentioned, in most cases \nwere objected to by the administration, but it was those sanctions and \nthen the international community agreeing with those sanctions that \nbrought Iran to the table in the first place. We had discussions. We \nrealized that we understand the President planned to do this with an \nExecutive agreement.\n  By the way, I think everyone understands that when the President does \nthat, it is only binding on his administration, it is not binding on \nfuture administrations, whereas a treaty, which goes through a whole \ndifferent process, is binding on future Presidents.\n  Because we had played such a role, we ended up with the Iran Nuclear \nAgreement Review Act, and this agreement has now put us in place to \ndebate this issue and to decide as a body whether we want to approve it \nor disapprove it. I thank Senator Cardin for his efforts in making that \nhappen.\n  I thank all the Senators in this body--98 of them; 1 was missing that \nday--who voted to put us in this place. As a matter of fact, I think \nall of us know that if it weren't for that, we would be having no \ndiscussion. This would have already been implemented. The President \nalready went to the U.N. Security Council, and it is this pause that \nhas allowed us to weigh in this way on behalf of the American people \nand to express whether we approve or disapprove of this agreement.\n  Let me say this: When the President began back in 2012 and he said \nthat he was going to negotiate with the P5+1 on this Iranian nuclear \ndeal to end their nuclear program, I thought, that is outstanding. As a \nmatter of fact, if the President can do that and if he had done that, I \nam sure we would have had 100 votes in favor of that. As a matter of \nfact, in other instances, he mentioned that he wanted to dismantle \ntheir nuclear program. Again, as the leader has mentioned, had he \nachieved that, none of us would be debating this issue. We would be \nthrilled with that outcome. But it was very evident that was not the \ncourse of action which was being pursued when we had the first \nagreement, the JOPA.\n  We had another round. We had additional concessions. Finally, we got \nto the point where we all realized that what was happening--instead of \na dismantling or instead of ending Iran's nuclear program, what this \nagreement does, if we were to approve it, it agrees to the \nindustrialization of their nuclear program. We have a state sponsor of \nterror, and this agreement is approving the industrialization of their \nprogram.\n  I think everyone knows that one of the great fallacies in this deal \nis that not only, with our approval, are they industrializing their \nprogram, but in 9 months all of the leverage shifts. Their country has \na $409 billion economy. In the next 9 months, this country is going to \nget about $100 billion. That has not been disputed. Think about it--25 \npercent of their economy is going to be given to them in 1 year. Think \nabout an $18 trillion country such as ours. If we were to get $4 to $5 \ntrillion, think what we would be able to do with those resources. Over \nthat 9-month period, regardless of what they do with PMD, regardless of \nwhat they do with other issues, the rest of the big economic sanctions \nare going to be relieved. Their economy is going to be growing. They \nare going to be cash-rich. They are going to be a much stronger \ncountry.\n  I think it is probably important to talk about whom we are dealing \nwith. I know Senator Cotton has alluded to this before, as have many \nothers, but when we went to Baghdad through the years, most of us sat \ndown with General Odierno. On his coffee table, he would have in front \nof him all of the devices Iran was using to kill and maim our soldiers. \nI think you will remember that there was actually a rush at one time to \nrush out humvees to try to protect our soldiers from having their limbs \nand body parts dismembered. Once we did that, the Iranians developed \nanother device. It was made of copper. When it exploded, it would go \nthrough any type of metal. It was used to kill Americans. It was used \nto dismember them. As a matter of fact, when you see people in \nTennessee, Wyoming, Kansas, or in other places walking up and down the \nstreet with prosthetics, that was Iran. Iran was responsible for the \ndismembering of so many Americans.\n  They are the same people, by the way, who are supporting Assad right \nnow. An amazing thing--the IRGC, which is the arm that directly reports \nto the Supreme Leader, is the shock\n\n[[Page S6494]]\n\nforce in Syria right now that is keeping Assad afloat.\n  The ranking member and I recently went to see a display by the \nHolocaust Museum. A gentleman named Caesar had documented what Assad, \nwith Iran's support, is doing to everyday Syrians in the country. As we \nsit here, what they are doing is torturing people. As a matter of fact, \nI wish you could see the pictures. They are actually amputating \npeople's genitals. As we are sitting here in this comfortable setting, \nIran is supporting Assad's ability to do that to his own people. We see \non the TV screens what is happening. People are flooding out from Syria \nand flooding out from Iraq to get away from what is happening right now \nin the Middle East.\n  We know that Hezbollah--another arm of Iran--through one of its \nproxies right now, is destabilizing Lebanon.\n  We know that Hamas is being supplied rockets--sophisticated rockets, \nI might add--from Iran to shoot into Israel.\n  We know that in Bahrain, where we have thousands of troops to keep \nthe Strait of Hormuz open, they are supplying terrorist organizations \nthere to disrupt that government and cause harm to the people who are \nserving us.\n  So this is whom we are dealing with--the greatest state sponsor of \nterror that we know. We only named three, by the way. We named Syria, \nwe named Sudan, and we named Iran.\n  Obviously, when we worked through the first agreements and in the \ninterim agreement where we agreed to enrich, that was quite a shock to \nmost of us. Then they went through the first big round to reach this \ncomprehensive agreement, and that agreement addressed a number of the \nissues the leader just laid out. But prior to going to Geneva, there \nwere still, in this final round, some issues that needed to be \naddressed.\n  I had one of those few calls with Secretary Kerry where I felt as \nthough he was listening. I talked to him at length. I told him: \nSecretary Kerry, a lot of people are going to have difficulty ever \napproving a deal that allows Iran to industrialize their program like \nthis.\n  But how you finish these last pieces is going to say a lot \nqualitatively about how we really plan to implement this deal. At that \ntime, of course, we still had the issues of previous military \ndimensions. Some people call it possible military dimensions. But we \nknow they were developing a nuclear weapon. You certainly heard the \npresentation regarding how we are dealing with Parchin. It is really \npretty amazing, after the AP report came out, how this has actually \nsurvived late-night comedy. We know that if the IAEA gives a report on \nIran's previous military dimensions--I think you know Iran is supposed \nto be supplying the IAEA information and access to scientists regarding \nwhat they were doing. But regardless of what the quality of this is--if \nit is a D-minus report or an A-plus report--the fact is that they still \nget the sanctions relief they are seeking over the next 9 months.\n  In addition to that, the inspections process--we have all had \nconcerns about the fact that we have to wait 24 days. By the way, there \nis a lot of misunderstanding about the 24 days. That is after the IAEA \nraises a concern. That is after Iran responds to that. Some people have \nwritten that it could take as many as 40 to 45 days for this to occur. \nBut then there is a 24-day period.\n  Our leader referred to the IR-1. Iran has done a masterful job \nbecause they have gotten the P5+1 to focus on their IR-1 centrifuges. \nThey have 19,000 of them. They are antiques. Truly, they are antiques. \nWhat they have going on right now is the development of IR-2s, IR-4s, \nIR-6s, IR-8s.\n  I would ask you to go down to the SCIF and let some of our \nintelligence people tell you the speed--the difference between the IR-8 \nand IR-1.\n  Let me say to you without giving any classified information that in a \nroom the size of where I am standing to this back wall and actually \nmuch closer this way, in a small room like that, Iran can actually do \nthe equivalent of 720 IR-1s. With a 24-day inspection process, our \nability to detect in very small areas of Iran--a very large country--\nthis type of thing is going to be very difficult.\n  So I talked to Secretary Kerry about those two things, and I am \nsorry, I feel as if we totally punted on those issues, and then for \ngood measure, as has been mentioned many times, we threw in the lifting \nof the conventional arms embargo. I mean, where did that come from? \nWhat did that have to do with the nuclear power? We threw in the \nlifting of ballistic testing in 8 years. Again, what was that about? \nThen, with some really special and peculiar language meant, I think, to \nconfuse, we lifted immediately their ability to test ballistic weapons.\n  So let me say again that all of this we know is being done with a \ncountry that has no practical need for enrichment. They have one \nnuclear reactor--one. They can buy enriched uranium so much cheaper on \nthe market. They have absolutely no need for 19,000 centrifuges. They \nhave no need for an underground facility to protect from bombing. They \nhave no need for the facility at Arak that produces plutonium.\n  Many people have said that Iran wants to have the ability to deal \nwith medical isotopes. They want to show to the rest of the Middle East \nthat they are sophisticated. Do you know how many centrifuges they \nwould need to do that? Five hundred.\n  So what has all this been about? They have put their people through \nsuch grief, such economic depravity. They have been isolated from the \nworld. They are a rogue community. And they have done all that to \ncreate a program that has, as we know, only one need, and that is so \nthey can develop a nuclear weapon.\n  I am very disappointed with where we have come up, and I am \ndisappointed to add this as another problem. We are doing all this \nwithout a strategy in the Middle East. I wrote an op-ed in the \nWashington Post--not that anybody reads them--to talk about my \ndisapproval of this deal. When you think about it, one of the great \ntragedies--again, we are seeing it play out on television. John McCain \nhas been so good at talking about this issue. But what we are seeing \nplay out right now is no strategy in the Middle East. It is the \ngreatest humanitarian disaster of my lifetime.\n  So what is going to happen without any strategy to push back against \nIran, to push back against what they are doing in Syria, what they have \nbeen doing in Lebanon, what they are doing in Yemen, what they are \ndoing in Bahrain, what they are doing certainly against Israel--Hamas--\nwithout a strategy, this is going to be the de facto strategy.\n  I will remind everyone again that in 9 months all the leverage goes \naway. Right now we have leverage over them. In 9 months, they have all \ntheir money and the sanctions have been relieved. Many of you have read \nstatements that have been issued by the Supreme Leader and others that \nif we try to put sanctions on them for their terrorist activities, \nviolations of human rights or other activities, you know what they are \ngoing to say. They are going to say: Hey, I am sorry. You are violating \nthe agreement.\n  Remember, this President has tried to obligate not just us from \nputting additional sanctions in place, but he has tried to keep State \nand local governments from putting sanctions in place. He is actually \nacting as a buffer against those people who in good conscience would \nwant to push back against the terrible human rights activities that are \ntaking place and the terrorism that is being exported.\n  Again, this is going to be our strategy. Think about it. In a year, \nbefore the next President takes office, let's say we want to put \nsanctions in place to push back because Iran is supplying additional \narms to Assad, as it appears Russia is doing right now, what is Iran \ngoing to say? Well, we are just going to begin development of our \nnuclear program.\n  What if we say that we know they are in violation of the nuclear \nprogram, and therefore we are going to put sanctions in place, what are \nthey going to say? Well, we are just going to resume the nuclear \nprogram.\n  So in 9 months, literally, the leverage shifts from us to them. We \nare going to be very reticent to challenge them on any violations of \nthis agreement. Candidly, we are going to be reticent to push back \nagainst the things they are doing to destabilize the region.\n\n[[Page S6495]]\n\n  I will close with this. I appreciate the leader setting up this \ndebate. I appreciate Senator Reid allowing us to do this. I appreciate \nthat 98 Senators have said: Look, this is probably the biggest foreign \npolicy issue we are going to deal with during our time here in the U.S. \nSenate. I hope what is going to happen over the course of the next \nseveral days is that we will continue to express our approval by some, \nour disapproval by others--a bipartisan majority--and the reasons as to \nwhy some approve this.\n  At the end of the day what I hope will happen is that--since all 98 \nSenators in this body said they wanted to debate this and wanted the \nopportunity to vote up or down on the substance of this deal--we will \nhave enough colleagues in this Chamber who will agree that because it \nis the biggest foreign policy issue of our day and because 98 Senators \nstood up and said: No, Mr. President, you cannot implement this deal \nuntil we express whether we approve or disapprove this deal, we will \nhave far more than 60 Senators who will agree to allow us to get to a \nfinal vote so everybody in this Senate can be accountable.\n  This is an important issue. I thank my colleagues for the time to be \nable to discuss it in this way.\n  With that, I will yield the floor. I thought Senator Cardin was next, \nbut it looks as if it will be Senator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Arizona, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, be \nrecognized and that I be recognized following his remarks.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Utah, the President pro tempore, \nadvise the Senate if we are operating under a unanimous consent \nagreement as to time allocations?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. At this time, the time is equally divided.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Between which hours?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time until 5 p.m. today is equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the President pro tempore be kind \nenough to tell me how much time has been used by the Republican side \nsince 2:15 p.m.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Approximately 45 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I do not object.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I am really glad that the distinguished \nleader of the Armed Services Committee is going to speak next. The \nSenator from Arizona probably has more knowledge of the Middle East \nthan almost anybody in this body, but it was my understanding that we \nwere going to rotate back and forth.\n  We actually have people who have asked to speak. Senator Reid had \nasked to speak, but he decided not to do so. Senator Cardin was going \nto speak. We were going to rotate between Republicans and Democrats.\n  Senators had signed up for time to speak, and that was the procedure \nwe were going to follow. It wasn't going to be just Republicans on the \nfloor and then Democrats, but it appears the majority whip wishes to \nalter that status.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we have Senators on the Democratic side \nprepared to speak when the Republicans are ready to yield.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Illinois that I \nwill be more than happy to yield to any speaker on the other side. I \nwas under the impression that we were going to be going back and forth, \nand I think that would contribute to the debate. If the Senator from \nIllinois or the Senator from Hawaii or anyone else wishes to speak, I \nwill be glad to yield.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be \nequally divided between both sides of the aisle and that following the \nrecognition of a speaker on our side, an opportunity be given to a \nspeaker on the Democratic side and that we alternate back and forth \nusing the time that is allotted for the debate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. The \nRepublican side has already used 45 minutes, so I hope the Senator from \nTexas is saying that between 2:15 p.m. and 5 p.m. the time will be \nequally divided, and we will rotate from one side to the other.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask consent to amend the request.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas has the floor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, am I recognized?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, again, I say to the Senator from Illinois \nthat the usual way I have seen around here for many years is one side \nwill speak, and then the other side will make their argument. If the \nSenator from Illinois wants to stack up all of his time on that side so \nthere is no back and forth, I don't think that is the intent of what we \nare trying to achieve here.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to my friend from Arizona, I have told you, we have \nDemocratic Senators prepared to speak. So when my friends are ready to \ngive up the floor, we will be glad to recognize our Democratic \nSenators.\n  Mr. McCAIN. We have been in since 2:15 p.m.\n  Mr. DURBIN. We have been waiting patiently.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I know their schedules are very crowded, but I would hope \nthat maybe one of them could wander over and speak. This is a fairly \nimportant issue.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to my friend from Arizona, we have a Democratic \nSenator prepared to speak at this moment.\n  Is the Senator prepared to yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Prepared to speak at this moment?\n  I yield to whichever Senator on the other side wishes to speak.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  A President of the United States once said of his Nation's enemy that \nwe cannot ``wish away the differences between our two societies and our \nphilosophies, but we should always remember that we do have common \ninterests and the foremost among them is to avoid war.'' In pursuing \nthat cause, he said:\n\n       We will be prepared to protect our interests and those of \n     our friends and allies, but we want more than deterrents. We \n     seek genuine cooperation. We seek progress for peace.\n\n  It was President Reagan who seized the opportunity during the Cold \nWar and President George H. W. Bush who carried it forward. Together \nthey achieved commitments from the United States and the Soviet Union, \nenemies through and through, to reduce their stockpiles of nuclear \nweapons, bringing us ever closer to a world free of the threat of \nnuclear annihilation. It ingrained in us a tradition of pragmatism--the \nidea that even with countries we deeply distrust and whose behavior we \nabhor, we cannot ignore the opportunity to prevent the proliferation of \nnuclear weapons.\n  The Joint Comprehension Plan of Action that the United States \nnegotiated with Iran and the other members of the P5+1 preserves that \ntradition, to ``seek progress for peace.''\n  This deal is not perfect, as the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee so ably explained. We had to make concessions, and that is \nbecause it was negotiated between sovereign countries pursuing \ndiplomacy and not unconditional surrender.\n  I hear complaints about one provision or another, and some of those \ncriticisms are valid, but we don't have the luxury of sending our \nnegotiators back to Vienna. If we do that, things will fall apart. \nEvery ambassador from the P5+1 has made clear that the multilateral \nsanctions that brought Iran to the table will be upended. We would be \nisolated diplomatically, Iran's nuclear program would be unconstrained, \nand Iran would get most of its money too.\n  Of course, we could levy harsh unilateral sanctions ourselves, and \nthat would be emotionally satisfying to many, but they won't bite. They \ndid not when Iran went from 300 centrifuges to more than 18,000, and \nthey won't now.\n  The question in this debate is whether to approve the deal or dump \nit. There is no door No. 3, but we don't\n\n[[Page S6496]]\n\nneed to feel resigned because, as a deal, it is quite a good one. \nExperts in the nonproliferation space almost unanimously affirm that it \nis a strong deal. It blocks each one of Iran's pathways to the bomb and \nplaces its nuclear program under strict international supervision. \nThere is no alternative to this agreement, and certainly no military \noption, that eliminates 98 percent of Iran's fissile material or two-\nthirds of its operating centrifuges.\n  Now, I will grant that critics make a few very persuasive arguments \nthat have more to with how we view Iran than how we view this deal. \nFirst they say that it places too much trust in Iran, but the opposite \nis true. This agreement is not based on trust or shared values, and we \nhave no reason to assume that Iran will comply with its terms in good \nfaith. That is why the agreement adopts a robust inspections and \nverification regime that will be in place for up to 25 years. We will \nbe monitoring Iran's entire nuclear supply chain--from uranium mining, \nmilling, and enrichment to the manufacturing and replacement of \ncentrifuges--so we will know if Iran is diverting uranium or \ncentrifuges to secret facilities.\n  If Iran does try to break out to acquire the bomb, all options remain \non the table to stop it, including the use of military force. And \nbecause the agreement provides us more information about Iran's nuclear \nprogram, our military options will be more effective and have the \nbacking of the international community because we will have exhausted \ndiplomacy first.\n  The other concern, and I think this is a valid one, is that this deal \nshould not be overstated in terms of its impact on our priorities and \nalliances in the region. It is important on the nuclear issue, but in \nOctober we will have many of the same challenges in the Middle East \nthat we have in September. Iran is still the world's leading state \nsponsor of terror and nothing in this deal will deter us from working \nto contain Iran's regional aspirations, including its support of Hamas \nand Hezbollah. But our efforts can now occur with a nuclear-armed Iran \noff the table.\n  I wish to personally offer some words to those Americans who love \nIsrael with a personal passion and commitment that I share. Your \nskepticism is well earned and based in faith and history--based in \nfamilial relationships and culture. It is core of who we are.\n  My colleagues rightly want to know what happens next. What is the \nUnited States prepared to do to protect loved ones in a dangerous \nneighborhood? Whether one supports this deal or not, we can all agree \nthat America's commitment to Israel remains unshakeable, and we will \ncontinue, Democrats and Republicans united, to stand with Israel. Even \nas we work to restrict Iran's nuclear ambitions, we will continue to \nthwart Hamas and Hezbollah. We are committed to cooperating with Israel \non intelligence and security at the highest levels ever and continuing \nto ensure that Israel's qualitative military edge is protected. When \nthis debate is over, we must find new ways to enhance our joint efforts \nto counter threats that endanger Israel every day.\n\n  We are debating what may be the most important foreign policy choice \nof the decade. Our decision will have consequences for the security and \nthe stability of the new Middle East. If Congress chooses to oppose \nthis agreement, we will witness an unraveling of the international \nsanctions that brought Iran to the negotiating table, with Iran moving \never faster toward the bomb and our country left with few choices \nbesides another war in the Middle East.\n  We have shown as a country that we have the will to protect \nourselves, our allies, and our interests--using military force when \ntruly necessary. We will continue to stand with Israel despite whatever \ntemporary disagreements our governments may have. We do not \nunderestimate or understate the challenges we have and the role of our \nmilitary in shaping events for the better, but in this instance, with \neyes wide open, we ought to pursue peace first.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the majority leader, the \nSenator from Kentucky, for conducting the debate on this agreement with \nthe seriousness and gravity it deserves. In doing so, he has acted in \nthe best traditions of the Senate, and I thank him for it.\n  I wish to also thank my colleague, the Senator from Tennessee, the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, who I believe just gave a \nvery eloquent presentation of the situation as we are debating today.\n  Today begins the culmination of a monumental debate that our Nation \nhas conducted for the past 3 months. This debate is not about whether \nwe support diplomatic solutions to international challenges or whether \nwe are willing to negotiate with the Iranian regime or whether we \nshould go to war with Iran. That is not what this debate is about, \ndespite the President's sad, partisan attempts to make it so.\n  It is always preferable to solve international problems without \nresorting to military force, but the ultimate test of any diplomacy is \nnot merely whether it avoids the use of force but whether it secures \nour national security interests. Put simply, I believe the Joint \nComprehensive Plan of Action fails this test and it fails by the very \ncriteria the administration itself once laid out as a good deal.\n  Three years ago, President Obama said the goal of negotiations with \nIran was to ``get Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear \nprogram and abide by U.N. resolutions that have been in place.'' This \nis what the President said:\n\n       The deal we'll accept is they end their nuclear program. \n     It's very straightforward.\n\n  In reality, the deal doesn't require Iran to end its program; it \nsimply suspends it for a period of years. As the President said in \nApril, ``Iran is not going to simply dismantle its program because we \ndemand it to do so.'' Let's contemplate that. ``Iran is not going to \nsimply dismantle its program because we demand it to do so.''\n  Unfortunately, the administration's concessions didn't stop there. On \nNovember 24, 2013, Secretary Kerry said:\n\n       There is no right to enrich. We do not recognize a right to \n     enrich.\n\n  However, in the final deal, the administration not only conceded the \nright to enrich, it also allowed Iran to maintain an industrial-scale \nenrichment capability that will only grow in size and sophistication.\n  On the issue of Fordow, the once covert nuclear facility that was \nbuilt deep into a mountain, President Obama said in December 2013 that \nIran had no need--no need--for such a facility if all it sought was \npeaceful nuclear energy. Yet the final deal allows Iran to maintain \nnearly 1,000 centrifuges at Fordow and conduct nuclear-related testing \nthere during the entire life of the agreement.\n  On the issue of Iran's breakout capacity, President Obama said in \nDecember of 2013 that in the deal he envisions, the Iranians ``as a \npractical matter, do not have a breakout capacity.'' Here, too, the \nadministration reversed itself, conceding to a breakout capacity in \nestablishing the arbitrary standard of 1 year.\n  Similarly, on the so-called possible military dimensions, or PMD, of \nIran's past nuclear activities, Secretary Kerry said this April:\n\n       They have to do it. It will be done. . . . It will be part \n     of a final agreement. It has to be.\n\n  Just 2 months later--2 months later--Secretary Kerry reversed \nhimself, saying:\n\n       We're not fixated on Iran specifically accounting for what \n     they did at one point in time or another. We know what they \n     did. We have no doubt. We have absolute knowledge.\n\n  My friends, this kind of hubris is astonishing. I know of no \nintelligence professional who would share that level of certainty. But \nperhaps Secretary Kerry's reversal is because the final deal does not \nrequire Iran to resolve the PMD issue prior to receiving sanctions \nrelief.\n  Furthermore, the chief of Iran's atomic energy agency has said \nsanctions relief will proceed regardless of the resolution of the PMD \nissue. That was the chief of Iran's atomic energy agency.\n  The mechanism to resolve longstanding international concerns about \nthe possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program is contained \nin a side agreement between Iran and the\n\n[[Page S6497]]\n\nIAEA which neither the administration nor the Congress has seen. Get \nthis: There is an agreement on inspection and verification that this \nCongress, before we vote, will never have seen and the American people \nwill never have seen. How in the world, on the most important aspect of \nany agreement--verification--the provisions for which are not known to \nthe Members of this body. That alone is a reason to demand--to demand--\nwhat are those side agreements? Maybe they are nothing. Maybe they are \nsomething we would approve of. We don't even know what in the world \nthey are.\n  The administration provided a classified briefing on what they know \nto be in the side agreement, and suffice it to say that I think most of \nus--even on both sides of the aisle--would agree that briefing is one \nof the more bizarre and disturbing aspects of this deal. They called it \nunconventional. That is generous.\n  What is more, inspections of Iran's facilities will be conducted by \nthe IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency. There will be no \nAmericans allowed on the ground, and the details of how these \nmonitoring activities will occur are contained in another side \nagreement between the IAEA and Iran.\n  Here is the problem: Verifying that Iran is not cheating on this deal \nrequires a full accounting of the possible military dimensions of \nIran's nuclear program. To verify that Iran has ceased its nuclear \nweapons-related activities necessarily requires that we know the full \nextent of these past activities--the personnel, facilities, equipment, \nand materials used and over what time period. We do not have that \ninformation.\n  President Obama has said this deal is based on verification, not \ntrust, but the means of verification are in many cases suspect. This \npresents a major problem. We will vote in the coming days on the Iran \ndeal, but we cannot even read certain foundational documents pertaining \nto how that verification will occur, and our own government is not even \na party to those agreements. I find that deeply troubling. It may \naccount for, as more Americans know more about it, the overwhelming \nmajority of Americans who do not approve of this deal.\n  Even more troubling, however, is that the administration also \nconceded its longstanding and repeated promises that its diplomacy was \nlimited exclusively to the nuclear fight. For nearly a decade, the \ninternational arms embargo has significantly hurt Iran's ability to \nbuild up and modernize its aging military.\n  Not long before the deal was announced, the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, before our committee--General Dempsey--told the \nCommittee on Armed Services that ``under no circumstances should we \nrelieve pressure on Iran relative to ballistic missile capabilities and \narms trafficking.'' Is there anything in this agreement that does that? \nIn fact, it is the opposite.\n  In 5 years, the international arms embargo against Iran will be \nlifted, freeing up the regime to acquire advanced conventional military \nmeans capabilities such as fighter aircraft, air defense systems, and \nanti-ship missiles. With billions of dollars in sanctions relief, Iran \nis sure to find plenty of states that are eager to sell those weapons, \nespecially Russia and China.\n  In 8 years, the agreement would legitimate and accelerate Iran's \ndevelopment of ballistic missiles, including ICBMs, whose only \nconceivable military purpose would be to deliver nuclear weapons. This \nconcession was made even as the Director of National Intelligence \nconcluded earlier this year that ``Iran's ballistic missiles are \ninherently capable of delivering WMD''--that is weapons of mass \ndestruction--``and Tehran already has the largest inventory of \nballistic missiles in the Middle East.''\n  In this way, the administration's Iran deal not only paves the \nIslamic Republic's path to a nuclear capability, it also furthers that \nregime's emergence as a dominant military power in the Middle East. \nThis has direct and dangerous implications for the United States--\nespecially our Armed Forces. After all, the ultimate guarantee that \nIran will not get a nuclear weapon is not a 109-page document; it is \nthe capability of the U.S. military to do what is necessary to prevent \nit if all else fails.\n  The administration says that the military option will remain on the \ntable if Iran violates the agreement, and that is true. Yet the \nagreement itself would enable Iran to construct the very kind of \nadvanced military arsenal that could raise the cost of employing our \nmilitary option should it become necessary. In short, if this agreement \nfails and U.S. servicemembers are called upon to take military action \nin Iran, their lives clearly would be at greater risk because of the \nterms of this deal.\n  As we debate the technical details of this agreement, this is the \nbigger picture we must stay focused on: the strategic implications of \nthis agreement on nuclear proliferation, regional security, and the \nbalance of power in an increasingly chaotic Middle East. This has been \nthe focus of our oversight on the Committee on Armed Services, and from \nthis perspective, this bad Iran deal only looks that much worse.\n  Iran is not just an arms control challenge; it is a geopolitical \nchallenge. For years, many of us have urged the administration to adopt \na regional strategy to counter Iran's malign activities in the Middle \nEast. The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee pointed out what \nhas been done by these IEDs that Qasem Soleimani sent into Iraq to kill \nand maim our men and women who are serving in the military. \nUnfortunately, if such a strategy exists, there is no evidence of it. \nInstead, we have watched with alarm as Iran's military and intelligence \noperatives have stepped up their destabilizing activities in Iraq, \nSyria, Yemen, Bahrain, Gaza, and elsewhere.\n  Iran did all of this under the full pressure of sanctions. Now Iran \nwill receive tens of billions of dollars in sanctions relief. To be \nsure, a good amount of that money will go to Iran's priorities, but \nmuch of it will also surely flow to Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps \nand Quds Force--groups that, as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff also mentioned, were responsible for the deaths of several \nhundred U.S. servicemembers. This will have enormous consequences for \nstability in the Middle East and for America's credibility.\n  For decades, Republican and Democratic administrations have sought to \ncontain the malign influence of the Islamic Republic of Iran and \nprevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons capability. Our allies and \npartners have entrusted much of their own security to the United States \nbecause they believed our commitments were credible. In this way, \nAmerica's role in the region has been to suppress security competition \nbetween states with long histories of mistrust and to prevent that \ncompetition from breaking down into conflict.\n  I fear this agreement will further undermine our ability and \nwillingness to play that vital stabilizing role. Our allies and \npartners in the Middle East have increasingly come to believe that \nAmerica is withdrawing from the region and doing so at a time when Iran \nis aggressively seeking to advance its geopolitical ambitions. Now we \nhave made a deal with Iran that will not only legitimize the Islamic \nRepublic as a threshold nuclear state with an industrial enrichment \ncapability but will also unshackle this regime in its long-held pursuit \nof conventional military power and may actually consolidate the Islamic \nRepublic's control in Iran for years to come. The dangerous result is \nthat our allies and partners will be increasingly likely to take \nmatters into their own hands--and, indeed, we already see evidence of \nthat.\n  These fateful decisions may well manifest themselves in a growing \nregional security competition, new arms races, nuclear proliferation, \nand possible conflict, all of which would demand more, not less, U.S. \nleadership and presence in the region.\n  Ultimately, this is what I find most troubling about the Iran deal. \nIt embodies and will likely exacerbate the collapse of America's global \ninfluence that is occurring under this administration and indeed has so \noften been catalyzed by its policies.\n  Just consider--just consider, my colleagues, how much more dangerous \nour world has become. A malign form of Russian influence is expanding \nin Europe and Eurasia. Vladimir Putin is using 21st century weapons to \nfurther his 19th century ambitions of the Russian Empire--most \ndramatically in\n\n[[Page S6498]]\n\nUkraine where Putin seeks to annex the territory of a sovereign \ncountry.\n  Our President goes to Estonia and days later Russia abducts an \nEstonian agent on Estonian territory. What message does that send? \nChina's leaders also appear to feel emboldened. Our President visits \nAsia, and the next week China escalates tensions with a U.S. partner in \nthe South China Sea. Our President visits Alaska and five--for the \nfirst time five Chinese warships show up in the Aleutians, violating \nthe 12-mile limit.\n  Meanwhile, China continues its military modernization while building \nand militarizing land features in international waters. Again, there is \nno deterrence. Cyber attacks against our Nation are increasing in \nregularity and severity. In just the past year, we have been attacked \nby North Korea, Iran, China, and Russia. The administration does what? \nNothing. There is no deterrence, so the attacks continue.\n  We have watched the hard-won gains of our men and women in uniform \nmelt away in Iraq following the President's decision to withdraw all of \nour troops in 2011 over the objections of his military leaders and \ncommanders on the ground. Of course, there is the conflict in Syria, \nwhich has claimed 220,000 lives and counting, spawned the largest and \nmost threatening terrorist army in the world, involved the repeated use \nof weapons of mass destruction, destabilized the entire Middle East, \nand led to the largest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.\n  There is no one who was not deeply moved by the picture of the 3-\nyear-old baby on the beach. My friends, that is a direct result of \nObama's foreign policy and have no doubt about it. Amidst all of these \ngrowing threats, for 4 years now the Budget Control Act and \nsequestration have cut our military by hundreds of billions of dollars \nfor no strategic rationale whatsoever. Congress has, unfortunately, \nbeen complicit in this disaster, but if the President showed as much \npersonal engagement and willingness to compromise with the Republicans \nas he did with the Iranians, we could repeal the Budget Control Act and \nsequestration and fund the government tomorrow.\n  Through it all, my colleagues, what have we heard from our President? \nWe have been told that America's influence is limited, as if that is \nnot always the case. We have been told there are no good options to the \nchallenges we face, as if there ever are in the real world. We have \nbeen told we cannot solve every problem in the world, as if that \nabsolves us from ever attempting to solve any problem. We have been \ntold the administration's worst failures are always someone else's \nfault and that no policy of theirs, after 6 years in power, is ever to \nblame.\n  We have been told the only alternative to our current mess of a \nforeign policy is war and that anyone who disagrees with this \nPresident--Republicans and Democrats; they make no distinction--is a \nwarmonger--is a warmonger. Again and again, where there should be \nleadership and statesmanship, there is only a parade of truisms and \ndefeatist rhetoric and straw man arguments and partisan attacks.\n  This has tainted and cheapened our national discourse, as evidenced \nby the fact that unlike past landmark diplomatic agreements, this one \nwill likely come into force on a party-line minority vote. Let me \nemphasize that. This Iranian deal will likely be rejected by a \nbipartisan majority of both Houses of Congress. If there is a precedent \nin American history for such a thing, I cannot think of it.\n  Indeed, a recent Pew poll found that only 21 percent of Americans \napprove of the Iranian deal. This has also diminished our standing in \nthe world. Our words ring hollow. Our reassurances fail to reassure. \nOur warnings are not heeded. Our redlines are crossed. Our moral \ninfluence is being discredited and tarnished. Americans sense this and \nso do our adversaries. They perceive it as weakness, and it is \nprovocative.\n  We need leadership, a strategy, and policies to address this crisis \nin our foreign policy, especially the broader threat posed by Iran. \nThis larger response should include, among other steps, increasing \nsanctions against Iran for its malign activities in the Middle East and \nits human rights abuses, new security assistance for our allies and \npartners in the region, and once and for all eliminating the specter of \nsequestration.\n  This Congress should take up this effort with new legislation. I look \nforward to working on it with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. \nThat time will come. However, the question now before this body is \nwhether to disapprove of the administration's deal with Iran. I will \nvote yes. I disapprove of this deal because it would not cut off Iran's \npath to a nuclear weapon, it would pave a new one. I disapprove of this \ndeal because it would legitimize the Islamic Republic as a threshold \nnuclear state with an industrial enrichment capability that will grow \nunfettered after the key terms of the deal end.\n  I disapprove of this deal because it unshackles Tehran's pursuit of \nconventional military power. I disapprove of this deal because it rests \non the assumption--the hope, really--that in a decade or so we may be \ndealing with a better Iranian regime. Yet the deal itself will likely \nstrengthen the current Iranian regime. This deal is not in our national \nsecurity interests. Congress and the American people should reject it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, as has been said, the time is equally \ndivided. Obviously, Republicans have spent a great deal of time on the \nfloor. The order, just for people on our side who are coming and going \non our side--we know the next speaker is Senator Feinstein, but it was \na preagreed order of Hatch, Cornyn, Barrasso, and Gardner. It is my \nunderstanding that we may only have about 15 to 20 minutes of time left \non our side until 5 o'clock. I just say that for the convenience of \nMembers.\n  Will the Presiding Officer tell us exactly how much time we have on \nour side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republicans have approximately 10\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. CORKER. I say that for the convenience of people on our side who \nmay come and go. That is the order. I know that obviously--how much \ntime does the Democratic side have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrats have approximately 1 hour 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CORKER. So just based on the process put forward by the minority \nwhip--obviously we will have one more speaker over here. I assume you \nwill have Democrats to fill the time on your side until 5. I want to \nmake that known to people. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nnuclear agreement with Iran. I do so because I believe this diplomatic \nachievement provides the only option that prevents Iran from obtaining \na nuclear weapon. I would like to take just a moment to say thank you \nto our negotiating team and commend them on a job that I believe was \nwell done and to thank them for their concerted effort to explain the \nagreement to the Congress over the past 2 months.\n  I have been in this body for a long time. There have been many \ndifferent agreements. I can never remember a time where the Senate has \nbeen briefed more assiduously than it has with this agreement. As the \nPresiding Officer knows, we sat this morning for 2 hours and listened \nto the top heads of our intelligence agencies discuss with us the \nparticulars of this agreement.\n  American negotiators have worked with negotiators from the world's \nmajor powers--the United Kingdom, France, Germany, China, Russia, and \nthe EU--and reached an agreement that will prevent Iran from developing \na nuclear weapon for at least the next 15 years and I believe longer.\n  I cannot emphasize this enough: the agreement represents the world \ncoming together to put an end to Iran's nuclear program. By contrast, \nif the Senate disapproves of this agreement, we are on our own.\n  As of last night, 42 Senators have announced their support for the \nagreement. In practical terms, that means the Senate will not \ndisapprove of this agreement. We have conducted a full review and the \nopponents of this deal have failed, but the opponents are still holding \nout the false hope that there can be a better deal.\n\n[[Page S6499]]\n\n  Let me be clear: there is no better deal. No one, no state, no leader \nhas proposed one. The only alternative to the agreement we now have is \nno agreement at all. Should the Congress reject this accord, the United \nStates, which led this effort, would be deserting our allies and \nnegotiating partners. That is because this is not just an agreement \nbetween the United States and Iran. It is an agreement between the \nworld's major powers, the largest most powerful Nations in the world, \nand Iran. It is one approved by the 15 members of the United Nations \nSecurity Council.\n  Brent Scowcroft, someone I know well, see annually, and the former \nNational Security Advisor to President George H.W. Bush, recently \nwrote:\n\n       There is no credible alternative were Congress to prevent \n     U.S. participation in the nuclear deal. If we walk away, we \n     walk away alone.\n\n  I think it may be helpful to remind my colleagues and the American \npeople how we got where we are today. First of all, preventing Iran \nfrom acquiring a nuclear weapon has been a longstanding and bipartisan \nnational security objective. In 2003, Europe led the first effort to \nhalt Iran's nuclear program. The next decade saw five separate major \nrounds of failed negotiations and an ever-advancing Iranian nuclear \nprogram. Iran went from having a few centrifuges spinning to being a \nthreshold nuclear power.\n  Following the revelations that Iran was installing centrifuges at \nNatanz last decade and disclosure in 2012 by our government and allies \nthat Iran was turning a mountain near Qom into a deeply buried \ncentrifuge chamber, Iran has seen sanctions escalate and felt \ninternational isolation, but its nuclear enrichment continued and \nadvanced.\n  The United States, with strong support from this Chamber, led an \neffort to install devastating multilateral sanctions with the goal of \nbringing Iran to the negotiating table. Those sanctions were effective \nbecause they were supported by the world's powers and importers of \nIranian oil. In fact, the United States does not do much business with \nIran. We do not import Iranian oil and U.S. banks don't process Iranian \nfinancial transactions. Unilateral U.S. sanctions are of little value \nby themselves, unless we are willing to sanction allies' banks.\n  Indeed, multiple U.N. resolutions, EU sanctions, and the cooperation \nof our partners and allies successfully pressured Iran over its nuclear \nactivities. Over time, the international sanctions that we helped build \nand continually enforced reduced Iranian oil exports from 2.5 million \nbarrels per day to less than 1 million, reduced the number of countries \nthat import Iranian oil from 23 to 6, prohibited Iran from repatriating \nmore than $100 billion in foreign currency, reduced Iran's GDP by \nnearly 6 percent in 1 year, caused major inflation, and basically ended \ninternational investment in Iran's economy.\n  The sanctions worked. Iran elected a reform government with a new \nPresident to negotiate an end to the sanctions and revive its economy. \nAnd despite its doubts, Iran sent a negotiating team to meet with the \ngovernments of the P5+1 nations.\n  In November 2013 we signed the interim agreement that froze and even \nreversed Iran's nuclear program. According to the IAEA, and verified by \nU.S. intelligence, Iran has abided by the interim agreement for more \nthan 1\\1/2\\ years. As we all know, in July 2015 the P5+1 signed the \nfinal agreement, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \nAction.\n  The agreement is the result of years of careful diplomacy among the \nworld's powers. It was only possible because other nations abided by \nour sanctions at their own economic sacrifice. They believe that these \nsanctions worked, have achieved their result, and now should be \nsuspended as Iran dismantles much of its nuclear infrastructure. These \ncountries, which were so critical to our ability to impose sanctions, \nhave told us directly they won't go back to the table to negotiate a \nnew deal.\n  To my colleagues who plan to vote in opposition to this agreement, I \nhope they have thought long and hard about what message this would send \nto the world. The consequences of rejecting this carefully negotiated \ndeal would reach far beyond Iran. It would signal that the United \nStates isn't willing or able to lead the world in confronting global \nchallenges.\n  Since the agreement was reached, I have spoken with many diplomats \nand statesmen. They are scratching their heads, wondering why the U.S. \nCongress is lining up with Iranian hard-liners in opposition to this \nagreement, instead of siding with the UK, France, Germany, Russia, and \nChina, along with all the other members of the U.N. Security Council.\n  Last week, Saudi Arabia announced its support for the agreement. \nForeign Minister Adel Al-Jubeir, who is known to many in this body, \nconcluded his country's support by saying this agreement ``will \ncontribute to security and stability in the region by preventing Iran \nfrom acquiring a nuclear capability.''\n  During the August recess, a former head of state from one of our \nclosest allies sat with me and said: ``You know, we are one of the \nnations you trust the most. We follow U.S. leadership and have agreed \nto the Iran deal, and now your Congress wants to back out. Why should \nwe ever follow you again?''\n  Many diplomats I have spoken with have echoed the former Prime \nMinister's statement. If Congress rejects the agreement, the world will \nbe unlikely to follow us on other important issues in the future and I \nbelieve the Executive foreign policy obligations and responsibilities \nof a President of our country are diminished. Our ability to lead \nagainst global threats, to be the indispensable nation, I believe, \nends.\n  I understand that many Members of the Senate don't support our \nPresident, but by disapproving of this agreement we also undermine the \nability of any future President to speak for the United States and \ncarry out his or her constitutional role in conducting foreign policy.\n  I have been involved in national security issues for many years, and \nI can't recall a time in recent memory when the world was united to \nthis degree on such a complex issue. Even Russia and China are with us. \nWe shouldn't squander the opportunity.\n  Many of my colleagues have already described the terms of the \nagreement and how it constrains and allows for intrusive monitoring of \nIran's nuclear program. For me, the arguments of Secretary of Energy \nErnest Moniz are particularly persuasive. As we all know, he is a \ndistinguished nuclear physicist from MIT, and he played a central role \nin the negotiations. He is a true expert of unimpeachable integrity, \nand he knows the nuclear world.\n  He has said over and over again--and I have heard it personally at \nleast five times--that every pathway to a bomb--plutonium, uranium, and \ncovert--is blocked by this deal. The deal blocks Iran's uranium pathway \nto a bomb at Natanz and Fordow by reducing Iran's installed centrifuges \nby two-thirds--from more than 19,000 to 6,000--for at least 10 years. \nIt reduces Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium by more than 97 \npercent, to no more than 300 kilograms of 3.67 percent enriched uranium \nfor 15 years, not enough nuclear material for a single weapon. It \nrequires intrusive IAEA inspections of Iran's centrifuge production--\ntheir careful labeling--and storage facilities for 20 years. And it \nrequires IAEA inspections for 25 years of Iran's entire nuclear supply \nchain.\n  The agreement blocks Iran's plutonium pathway to a bomb at Arak by \nmodifying Iran's only heavy water reactor so that it cannot produce \nweapons-grade plutonium and requires all spent fuel capable of being \nreprocessed for plutonium to be shipped out of the country.\n  The agreement blocks Iran's covert plutonium pathway to a bomb \nnationwide by requiring 24/7 IAEA access to all of Iran's declared \nnuclear sites for 15 years and by empowering the IAEA to use its most \nadvanced monitoring techniques and equipment to ensure Iran cannot \ntamper with its devices or evade nuclear monitoring, and it guarantees \nIAEA access to any suspected--suspected--nuclear site within 24 days, \nincluding military facilities, and providing access to all of Iran's \nnuclear sites under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty permanently.\n  Most notably, the agreement imposes a perpetual prohibition against \nIran ever seeking, developing or acquiring a nuclear weapon.\n\n[[Page S6500]]\n\n  The terms of this agreement are unparalleled. The IAEA has never had \nthis kind of access in any country. As the vice chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee, I can say we have looked at this issue very \ncarefully.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, as late as this morning, I can say \nthat if Iran doesn't comply with its obligations, we will know about \nit, and we will be able to snap-back the sanctions that are suspended \nunder this agreement.\n  The administration has provided Congress with documents detailing the \nverification measures in this agreement. At an unclassified level, the \nexecutive branch has written: ``The United States is confident that it \nwill be able to verify that Iran is complying with its commitments \nunder the JCPOA, including its commitment not to pursue a nuclear \nweapon.''\n  The Senate has also received a classified annex to the assessment \nfrom the intelligence community, which I think some of my colleagues \nhave reviewed, and I would hope everyone would. The Senate Intelligence \nCommittee has met with the heads of the U.S. intelligence agencies--as \nI just said--as recently as this morning to receive testimony and ask \nquestions on our ability to ensure that Iran is complying with the \nterms of the nuclear agreement. From the reports and those hearings, I \nam very comfortable saying that the covert path to a bomb is closed, \nperiod.\n  I recognize that this agreement doesn't address other problems the \nUnited States and the international community have with Iran. Iran \ncontinues to support terrorist groups, prop up Bashar al-Assad, and \nundermine stability across the Middle East. It is a serial abuser of \nhuman rights and is improperly detaining American citizens. These are, \nof course, reprehensible policies and, of course, we will continue to \noppose them. But a nuclear-armed Iran would dramatically compound these \nproblems.\n  In my view, this agreement presents us with an opportunity to begin a \nbroader discussion with Iran. As Iran, hopefully, will become more \nintegrated into the global community and give up some of its bad ways, \nwe can test whether Iran will move toward rejoining the community of \nnations. Rejecting this agreement only strengthens the hard-liners who \nlead the chants of ``Death to America.''\n  Eighty-eight percent of Iranians are under the age of 54, and 41 \npercent are under the age of 25. They defied predictions and elected a \nmoderate replacement to President Ahmadinejad in the hopes that Iran \nwill chart a new course. Clearly, this agreement won't change Iran's \nbehavior overnight, and it would be unrealistic to expect Iran's \ncooperation on every issue, but it would also be foolish to throw the \nopportunity away and to give the hard-liners another reason to turn \ntheir backs on reform.\n  More importantly, I am not willing to cede America's global \nleadership to reject this nuclear agreement or ignore the possibility \nof resolving the region's crises in favor of the myth of a better deal. \nThere is no better deal.\n  For these reasons, I join the large numbers of diplomats, scientists, \nretired U.S. flag officers, rabbis, arms controls advocates, national \nsecurity experts, and intelligence professionals in supporting this \nagreement with Iran.\n  I urge my colleagues, most sincerely, to oppose the resolution of \ndisapproval and support this historic agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the eloquent \nremarks of the distinguished Senator from California and all of the \ncountries around the world that embrace this deal, and I didn't hear \nmentioned once the nation of Israel, our most significant and important \nally in the Middle East. And it is because, in fact, they do not \napprove.\n  As we have heard from the Prime Minister several months ago, this \npaves the way to a nuclear weapon. It completely transforms American \npolicy, which had been to deny Iran a nuclear weapon, and it paves the \npath to a nuclear weapon.\n  But as I was contemplating this debate, I decided it was important \nfor me to visit with Rick Kupke of Arlington, TX. Rick was one of 53 \nAmericans who were held hostage and held for 14 months in Iran at the \ntime of the Iranian Revolution. In an interview with one of our \nnewspapers in Fort Worth, when asked about this deal with Iran, he \nsaid:\n\n       This is probably the worst agreement of this kind I've seen \n     in my lifetime.\n\n  This is an experienced, seasoned Foreign Service officer. He \ncontinued:\n\n       I don't know why they think the Iranians are going to abide \n     by any agreement. They never have.\n\n  So I approach this agreement between President Obama and the regime \nin Tehran with a tremendous amount of skepticism.\n  But this debate shouldn't be a partisan one, and I worry that it is \nquickly becoming partisan, based on the stated intention of the \nminority leader, Senator Reid, the Senator from Nevada, to actually \nfilibuster and prevent an up-or-down vote on this resolution of \ndisapproval. This is something that apparently is being actively \nencouraged by the President of the United States. Just a short time \nafter the President himself signed the bill--a bipartisan bill with 98 \nvotes in the Senate, which sets up the procedure by which this \nresolution will be voted on--the President, the minority leader, and, \napparently, many Democrats are tempted to filibuster this most \nimportant national security issue that I have confronted and seen since \nI have been in the Senate--and many would say during their lifetime.\n  The President has really taken the low road, I am sorry to say. He \nhas claimed that those chanting ``Death to America'' in Iran are \n``making common cause with the Republican caucus.'' That is the \nPresident of the United States. I would like to point out there are \nseveral influential leaders of the President's own party who are \nopposed to this deal and they include some of this Chamber's most \nexpert and respected Members in the field of foreign affairs.\n\n  First of all, the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nSenator Cardin, to whom I personally express my admiration and respect \nfor his courage--he pointed out in his remarks, when he announced he \nwould vote for the resolution of disapproval, that the deal \n``legitimizes Iran's nuclear program.'' He also said: ``Under this \nagreement, Iran is permitted to be able to enrich to a level that will \ntake them extremely close to breakout, legally.''\n  The junior Senator from Maryland has made clear he shares the \nconcerns many of us have expressed; that this deal leaves far too much \nof Iran's nuclear infrastructure intact and indeed legitimizes their \nnuclear program--something our stated national policy just a short time \nago was to oppose.\n  The senior Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer--perhaps one of the \nMembers on that side of the aisle whose vote was most anticipated \nbefore he announced it--announced he is for the resolution of \ndisapproval. He said: ``I believe Iran will not change, and under this \nagreement it will be able to achieve its dual goals of eliminating \nsanctions while ultimately retaining its nuclear and non-nuclear \npower.''\n  Senator Schumer makes the point that Iran has gotten everything it \nwants. It has a pathway to a nuclear weapon, it has retained its \nnuclear infrastructure, and it has gotten an elimination of sanctions.\n  The former chairman and ranking member of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Menendez, on August 18 announced his \ndecision to oppose this bad deal. He said the deal ``failed to achieve \nthe one thing it set out to achieve--it failed to stop Iran from \nbecoming a nuclear weapons state at a time of its choosing.'' In fact, \nhe said it ``authorizes and supports the very roadmap Iran will need to \narrive at its target.''\n  These are not members of the Republican caucus. These are respected \nmembers of the Democratic caucus.\n  There used to be a time--and I hope it returns quickly--where matters \nof this gravity and seriousness, threats to our national security, were \ntreated with bipartisan cooperation and consensus building, but \napparently the President didn't get that memo--encouraging folks on \nthat side of the aisle to prevent even an up-or-down vote on the \nresolution of disapproval and presumably cutting short the debate and \nhoping people across America aren't really paying attention to exactly \nhow bad this deal is and how\n\n[[Page S6501]]\n\nmuch it makes the world more dangerous rather than safer.\n  I hope our colleagues, even if they will vote for this deal or will \nvote against the resolution of disapproval--I hope they will allow us \nto have the sort of fulsome debate this serious issue deserves. Then \nthey will be held accountable, as we will, for their vote either for or \nagainst the resolution of disapproval.\n  I note that President Obama seems to want to arrogate to himself not \neven an authority that the Ayatollah Khamenei appears to have. \nAyatollah Khamenei said the Iranian Parliament will vote on this deal, \nbut apparently President Obama doesn't feel the United States Senate \nshould have the same opportunity the Iranian Parliament is going to \nhave--to vote on the merits or lack of merits on this deal.\n  I hope our colleagues across the aisle will rethink their partisan \nopposition to actually even having an up-or-down vote on the resolution \nof disapproval. This could well be, as many have said before me, one of \nthe most consequential foreign policy issues to come before us in a \nlong time, and we ought to treat it with that sort of seriousness.\n  The American people need to listen--and they are listening--and they \nwill hold all of us accountable for our decisions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I have been listening to my friend from \nTexas, and I couldn't agree with him more about the need for us to work \nin a bipartisan manner to strengthen America's foreign policy.\n  I believe in the independence of Congress, and I very much support, \nalong with Senator Corker, the review we are doing. I think this is \ncritically important to the American people. We are having our debate, \nas we should. I do think, though, that while we are an independent \nbranch, when this debate is over, we have to come together and work in \nthe best interests of America, and I look forward to broad support in \nCongress to do everything in our power to make sure Iran does not \nbecome a nuclear weapons state. I think we can, in a positive way, as \nwe move forward. I mentioned yesterday when I was on the floor about \nthings we can do.\n  Yes, there is disagreement on whether to vote for or against the \nresolution of disapproval, but I hope there is no disagreement that we \nneed to work together with a broad consensus of Congress to give this \ncountry its strongest possible position moving forward, whether this \nagreement is approved or not.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield to one of the important members of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the junior Senator from \nDelaware, who has spent a lot of time on this issue. He has been a very \nconstructive member of our committee, very instrumental in the passage \nof the Iran review act. Senator Coons.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss one of the greatest \nthreats we face today in America, a great threat to our vital ally \nIsrael and to global security--the nuclear weapons ambitions of Iran \nand the options that remain before us for blocking those ambitions.\n  On July 14, after years of negotiations between the United States, \nour international partners, and Iran, the administration reached a \ncomprehensive agreement to freeze and roll back aspects of Iran's \nnuclear program in exchange for relief from the sanctions that have \ncrippled Iran's economy. Our key partners in imposing and enforcing the \nsanctions that drove Iran to the negotiating table--the UK, Germany, \nFrance, the EU, China, and Russia--also joined in negotiating and \nultimately ratifying this deal.\n  Thanks to bipartisan legislation that passed this Chamber nearly \nunanimously, Congress is now fulfilling its duty to review this deal \nunder the authority of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. As a \npublic servant and Member of this body, I am grateful for the \nopportunity to join my colleagues to thoughtfully debate this vital and \nimportant issue. As a body, we owe that to the American people. As a \nSenator from Delaware, I owe that to Delawareans--to participate in a \nvigorous debate on an issue with profound and far-reaching \nconsequences, not just for our Nation but for the whole global \ncommunity.\n  In preparation for this vote, I have dedicated myself to studying and \nunderstanding the content and consequences of the deal, and I am \ngrateful to the bipartisan leadership of Chairman Corker and Ranking \nMember Cardin in convening more than a dozen hearings of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, as well as classified briefings; to the dozens of \nexperts who came before us, both against and in favor of the deal, to \nprovide us with analysis and insight; and to the thousands of \nDelawareans who have reached out to me by phone, by email, by text, and \nin person to express their strongly held views both against and for \nthis agreement.\n  As are many of my fellow Delawareans and Americans, I am deeply \nsuspicious of Iran, the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. I \nam also deeply suspicious of Iran's intentions for its nuclear program, \ngiven its long record of cheating on past deals and of consistently \nexpressing virulently anti-American, anti-Semitic, and anti-Israel \nviews.\n  Iran is a dangerous regime that is today dangerously close to having \nenough fissile material to build a nuclear bomb. A nuclear-armed Iran \nwould be a profound threat to our Nation's security and our interests \naround the world, as well as the security of our vital ally, Israel, \nand all of our partners in the Middle East.\n  In response to these undeniable realities, we have successfully built \na global coalition over the past decade united in their determination \nto prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. They, too, see clearly \nthe threat of a nuclear-armed Iran. Bipartisan actions by Congress and \nthe administration to enact and enforce sanctions have brought us to \nthis point where our major European allies, as well as Russia and \nChina--countries with which we often disagree--have all signed off on a \ncomprehensive agreement to roll back and restrain Iran's nuclear \nprogram. The challenge we are discussing on the floor today is whether \nto move ahead with our partners in this deal or to turn aside from it \nand attempt to seek a stronger deal.\n  From the day it was announced, this agreement has been sharply \ncriticized by many in Congress and by the leaders of our vital ally \nIsrael. After a close reading of this lengthy and complex agreement, I, \ntoo, have deep and persistent concerns about this deal.\n  If Iran simply complies with the plain language of this deal, it will \nfirst gain tens of billions of dollars in sanctions relief that it will \nlikely use to strengthen its support for terrorism and its proxies and \nrogue regimes and that will make it more resilient to future sanctions. \nMost importantly, the deal leaves in place key nuclear facilities and \nprograms that over 10 to 15 years or more will allow Iran to develop a \nlarge-scale uranium enrichment capability that could be used to quickly \nmake material for nuclear weapons if it decides to violate this \nagreement and the nonproliferation treaty.\n  To look at those realities and not recognize them as significant \nchallenges or flaws would be to miss the core content of this deal. On \nthe other hand, the agreement achieves several critical goals that \ncould not be easily achieved by any other means, that freeze or roll \nback Iran's nuclear ambitions. To get any sanctions relief, Iran must \ngive up 97 percent of its existing stockpile of 12 tons of enriched \nuranium. It must disable two-thirds of their 19,000 centrifuges and \npermanently restructure its heavy water reactor at Arak so it can no \nlonger produce weapons-grade plutonium.\n  I have heard no questions or challenges to the technical aspects of \nthese significant accomplishments in the deal.\n  Most importantly, in my mind, Iran has agreed to thorough, intrusive, \naround-the-clock inspections of all of its declared and known nuclear \nsites, its uranium mines, uranium mills, centrifuge production, and \nuranium enrichment facilities for 15 years and more. Iran pledges under \nthis agreement to abandon all efforts to develop or acquire a nuclear \nweapon, and the U.N. has ratified a unique arrangement under which the \nUnited States alone is able to reimpose U.N. sanctions on Iran for \ncheating on this deal at any point.\n\n[[Page S6502]]\n\n  Finally, our own military and intelligence community confirm that the \noption of military action against Iran remains available at all times \nand will only be strengthened by the significant additional \nintelligence we will likely gain through regular inspections of Iran's \nnuclear infrastructure.\n  While many Americans, including thousands in my home State, have \nexpressed strong opinions about this agreement, and while I, too, agree \nwith many criticisms of this deal, none of us knows with certainty what \nwill happen if instead Congress rejects this agreement. Will the \nstrength of the U.S. banking system and our unilateral sanctions \ngenuinely be strong enough to force our key allies and Iran back to the \nnegotiating table? Is it possible to negotiate a stronger deal than \nthis or will the nations that have dedicated years, along with us, to \nthese negotiations now abandon sanctions and proceed without us to \nimplement the deal with Iran, simply isolating us rather than Iran?\n  Meetings and discussions I have held with ambassadors of our key \npartners, as well as with leaders in financial policy and foreign \npolicy, have ultimately persuaded me we are unlikely to be able to \nreimpose effective multilateral sanctions and renegotiate our way to a \nbetter deal if we reject this one.\n  Don't just take my word for it. Former Secretary of the Treasury \nHenry Paulson and former Chairman of the Fed Board Paul Volcker have \nreached the same conclusion publicly and in a whole series of private \nconversations have reinforced my conclusion.\n  Last week I delivered an address at the University of Delaware in my \nhome State to explain in more detail why I have ultimately decided to \nsupport this deal. Today I am here to speak to my colleagues in the \nSenate because I believe strongly this floor must be a place of \nvigorous, spirited, and honest debate. Though nearly every one of my \ncolleagues--in fact, probably as of today all of my colleagues--have \nmade their arguments, announced their positions and decisions, and \ndiscussed their conclusions, as I have in my home State and as many \nothers have with the media, I still believe we cannot ignore this floor \nas an important place for debate and discussion. I think it is \nparticularly important on an issue that has always in the past garnered \nsuch strong and bipartisan support as our Nation's enduring support for \nIsrael.\n\n  So let me be clear about my position and where I stand. I will \nsupport this agreement and vote against measures to disapprove it in \nthis Congress. I will support this agreement because it puts us on a \nknown path of limiting Iran's nuclear program for 15 years with the \nfull support of the international community. The alternative, I fear, \nis a scenario of uncertainty and isolation.\n  Finally, I will support this agreement despite its significant flaws \nbecause it is the better strategy for the United States to lead a \ncoalesced global community in containing the spread of nuclear weapons. \nI support this deal aware of its flaws, and I am committed to working \ntirelessly with my colleagues to overcome the limitations of the \nagreement, to ensure the security of Israel, and to contain and deter \nIran's ambitions.\n  That is why I did not make my final decision to support this deal \nuntil I secured, to me, valuable additional commitments from the \nadministration--including a letter from the President offering specific \nreassurances across seven different areas, including that our allies \nand other members of the P5+1 will stick by us in strictly enforcing \nthis deal, even as their economic engagements with Iran grow, and that \nwe will continue to aggressively and by all means necessary address \nIran's support for terrorism and its proxies, and that our commitment \nto Israel's security will remain unshakeable.\n  Moving forward, I hope to work with colleagues to focus on \nstrengthening Israel's conventional military deterrent against Iran, \nvigorously interdicting and countering Iranian support for terrorism \nand its proxies, strengthening the nonproliferation treaty, so that in \n15 years Iran leaves one cage--the JCPOA--and enters another--the \nconstraints of an appropriately strengthened and bolstered NPT, and \ndeveloping a clear and thorough plan with our European allies for \nactive enforcement to enact a policy of zero tolerance of Iranian \ncheating on the agreement.\n  There are few votes in the Senate that will have as much consequence \nto the security of our Nation and Israel's as this one. I am voting to \nsupport this agreement not because I think it is perfect or because I \nbelieve it is a perfect mechanism to end nuclear proliferation. I am \nvoting for it because I believe it is our most credible opportunity in \nour current situation to lead a global community in containing a \nprofound nuclear threat while preserving America's ability in the \nfuture to use economic power and military might to successfully \ndismantle Iran's nuclear program should diplomacy fail.\n  My support for this agreement also represents a statement about U.S. \nleadership of an international system based on institutions that we \ndeveloped following the Second World War to help bring about a rules-\nbased international system of mutual security.\n  The United Nations and the IAEA were established following the great \nconflict of the Second World War to help prevent the spread and threat \nof nuclear war. We, the United States, helped lead the establishment of \nthese institutions just as we led the international community to reach \nthis deal to limit Iran's nuclear program.\n  While neither our current international system nor this deal with \nIran is perfect, they represent the collective will of our \ninternational partners and a vision for America's place in the world \nfor which I will fight. While we reserve the right to use force, if \nnecessary, to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, we should \nuphold the international system that we helped create, and to do so we \nshould support this deal.\n  The legitimacy of this order is yet another reason we must ensure \nadequate oversight and verification of this nuclear deal because its \nfailure will be a blow to the international system which gave it birth.\n  In closing, Scripture offers us many stories, from Genesis to \nDeuteronomy to Isaiah and the gospels, in which we are encouraged to \npursue diplomacy before resorting to conflict. My support of this \nagreement in no small part is an attempt to heed that advice.\n  We cannot trust Iran. But this deal, based on distrust, verification, \ndeterrence, and strong multilateral diplomacy, ultimately, I have \nconcluded, offers us our best opportunity to prevent a nuclear-armed \nIran.\n  I support this deal with my eyes wide open, aware of its flaws as \nwell as its potential, and I will remain committed to work with my \ncolleagues to minimize the negative consequences and ensure we reap the \nmaximum benefits of this agreement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Coons. I know he went \nthrough a very deliberative process in reaching his conclusions. I know \nof his commitment to preventing Iran from having a nuclear weapons \ncapacity, his strong support for regional security in the State of \nIsrael. I know the process he went through because we had many \nconversations during the August recess. I know his statement is \nheartfelt, and I know he did what he thought was best. I just want to \nunderscore that and thank him for his counsel and friendship.\n  I am going to yield to Senator Kaine. Before I do that, I think it is \nimportant to point out that we are here today in this review in a very \nopen and transparent way in large measure because of Senator Kaine.\n  Senator Corker filed a review statute--I guess it was now several \nmonths ago--and through conversations with Senator Kaine he was able to \nget a framework that ultimately led to the passage of the Iran Nuclear \nAgreement Review Act by a 98-to-1 vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate. \nI was proud to be part of that effort, working with Senator Corker, but \nit would not have been possible without Senator Kaine. He was the one \nwho recognized that we needed to find a common path--a nonpartisan \npath--for a transparent review that protected not just the role of the \nUnited States Congress, but the executive and legislative branch, and I \napplaud him for those efforts.\n  Senator Kaine is a very valuable member of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, one of our most\n\n[[Page S6503]]\n\ntrusted members in so many areas of foreign policy, and I am proud to \nhave him as my friend and colleague.\n  I yield the floor to Senator Kaine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I thank my ranking member and friend, the \nSenator from Maryland, for those kind words.\n  Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Iran deal currently being \ndebated in the Senate. We have not had a national security issue during \nmy time in the Senate that has received so much attention in committee \nand on the floor of this body as this, and that is appropriate. The \ndebate has been, and will continue to be, thorough and vigorous. That \nis appropriate, and I respect the views of my colleagues regardless of \nhow they will vote on this matter.\n  I wish to spend a few minutes recapping why I support the deal. I did \nspeak on the floor early in August about this. Since that time, a \nnumber of leaders have come out in support of the deal: former Senators \nJohn Warner, Richard Lugar, Sam Nunn, and Carl Levin; General Brent \nScowcroft, General Colin Powell; and today, former head of the IAEA \nCommission Uzi Eilam. After I briefly talk about my reasons for \nsupport, I want to address three final points: one, the Republican \nargument on the floor today that it is wrong to have a 60-vote \nthreshold for the vote on a resolution of disapproval; two, the \narguments that Vice President Cheney made against the deal yesterday; \nthree, finally, the place of vigorous diplomacy as a tool of American \nstrength.\n  So first, to quickly recap why I support the deal: I support it \nbecause it is better than the status quo for 15 to 25 years. I don't \ncompare it with a hypothetical alternative. We can create a \nhypothetical to justify a position. If we can, let's talk about the \nstatus quo.\n  Before diplomacy started, Iran had rocketed ahead to 19,000 \ncentrifuges and 12,000 kilograms of enriched uranium, a plutonium \nreprocessing facility under construction, and we had very few \ninspections. The system was very opaque. That was the status quo.\n  The best description of the Iranian status quo was the description \nthat Prime Minister Netanyahu made to the U.N. in September of 2012. \nThat was a speech known because he drew a bomb dialogue, and that sort \nof cartoon was known. But if we go into the guts of his speech, he gave \na description of where the Iranian program was, and then he concluded \nand he said this: I want to thank the international community because \nthe sanctions you have imposed together have hurt the Iranian economy, \nbut ``we have to face the truth.'' The sanctions have not stopped the \nIranian nuclear program. In fact, there is a pretty good argument that \nthe sanctions accelerated the program.\n  So if we go back to the status quo, it is an accelerated program, \nwith 19,000 centrifuges and enough enriched uranium for multiple \nweapons. What we get with this deal, for 15 years disabling two-thirds \nof the centrifuges, for 15 years rolling back enriched uranium to 300 \nkilograms--not even enough for one weapon--for permanently disabling \nthe plutonium facility, for 25 years enhanced inspections--more than \nany nation has to comply with--we get in this deal much better than we \nwould have with the status quo that existed before diplomacy, and that \nis why I support it.\n  The second point, the argument about the 60-vote threshold. I am \nsurprised to hear arguments on the floor that it is somehow wrong to \nuse a 60-vote threshold on this bill. When I was in my first 2 years in \nthe Senate and in the majority, the 60-vote threshold was used on \neverything--immigration, minimum wage, turning off the sequester. \nSometimes we exceeded the 60-vote threshold. Many times we exceeded 50 \nvotes, but we couldn't get to 60 on minimum wage. We couldn't get to 60 \non turning off the threshold, but there was an insistence: We need to \nget to 60 votes. I can't think of a single issue of importance in my \nfirst 2 years in the Senate where the 60-vote threshold wasn't invoked.\n  As my ranking member, Senator Cardin, mentioned, I was one of the \ncoauthors of the Review Act under which we are now proceeding. The act \nwas clear, and it was understood by all that action in the Senate to \npass either a motion of approval or a motion of disapproval, either \none, would be by a 60-vote threshold. We talked about this explicitly \nin committee, we talked about it before the vote on the floor, and we \nvoted in favor of the act by a 98-to-1 margin. I think the current \nmajority party understood that. As was indicated in the letter of 47 to \nthe leadership of Iran, it was stated very plainly we would understand \nthis would be a three-fifths, 60-vote threshold. That is what happens \nin the Senate, so we shouldn't change the rules now.\n  The debate has been full, vigorous, and fair. We have spent a lot of \ntime on this and we are going to spend more, and that is appropriate. \nThere is now a complete accountability because all 100 Senators have \ndeclared exactly where they are and their position. We should stick \nwith the agreement we made a few months ago, and treat this Resolution \nof Disapproval under a 60-vote rule.\n  Point No. 3, the Vice President's arguments yesterday. I respond to \nthem because I think Vice President Cheney basically made two \narguments, and they are the two arguments that have been repeated in \ndifferent ways on the floor. Let me address those two main arguments.\n  No. 1, we can't trust Iran. I agree. I think everyone on the \nDemocratic side agrees, and there is nothing about this deal that \ninvolves trust. That is why we have insisted that Iran subject itself \nto intrusive inspections by the IAEA for 25 years, and then, following \nthat, to the additional protocol inspections required of all NPT \nmembers. The IAEA inspections--130-plus inspectors in the country--will \nenable us to catch Iran cheating and give us the intel that will be \nincredibly helpful if we ever need to take military action against \nthem. It is that inspections intel that caused our two former \ncolleagues, Senators John Warner and Carl Levin--chairs of the Armed \nServices Committee--to write an article recently, ``Why Hawks Should \nAlso Back the Iran Deal.'' It is because inspections give us intel, \nwhich increases the credibility of our military threat.\n  Now, the Vice President's response to this, interestingly enough, is: \nWait. We can't trust IAEA inspections. They are going to do it wrong. \nThey have the wrong protocols, and we can't trust them.\n  Folks, that argument has been made in this body before by the Vice \nPresident and others. Vice President Cheney promoted that we go to war \nwith Iraq, and he repeatedly made the case in 2002 and 2003 that we had \nto do that to stop Iraq's nuclear weapons program. Two weeks before the \nwar began, in early March, the IAEA issued a report indicating, ``we \nhave to date found no evidence or plausible indication of the revival \nof a nuclear weapons program in Iraq.'' The Vice President then went to \nthe airwaves with others and led a campaign to trash the credibility of \nthe IAEA, to say that neither the integrity of their inspections nor \ntheir accuracy could be trusted. After that, we entered into war \nagainst Iraq saying that the IAEA was wrong. And what did we find? What \nwe found was the inspectors and investigators and engineers and \nscientists of the IAEA were right, and Vice President Cheney and others \nwere wrong. We have been down the path before of trying to trash the \nIAEA and said they couldn't be trusted, and it was a horrible \ndisservice to America and the world that we didn't give those \ninspections a chance. We shouldn't go down that path again.\n  The Vice President made a second argument yesterday--here is a \ndifferent and better strategy for dealing with Iran--the same strategy \nthat the previous administration followed: Heavy sanctions, threats of \nmilitary force, but no diplomacy.\n  But the Cheney doctrine didn't work with Iran. Under that strategy, \nthe Iranian nuclear program rocketed ahead, centrifuges, enriched \nuranium, growing by the day. The Prime Minister of Israel, Prime \nMinister Netenyahu, acknowledged this before the U.N. in September of \n2012. And when the Vice President was confronted with this by Chris \nWallace over the weekend on television, he had no answer for it. He \ncouldn't answer for it because the advance of the Iranian program under \nthe Cheney doctrine cannot be disputed.\n  I was interested in his speech yesterday when he tried to justify \nthat the strategy had worked when they tried it. Again, he ignored it.\n  So if we go back to the preferred doctrine of no diplomacy, \nsanctions, and\n\n[[Page S6504]]\n\nmilitary threat, we are likely to get what we just got before, and that \nis an acceleration of the Iranian nuclear program. We should not go \nback down that path.\n  Let me conclude with a story about my favorite President, Harry \nTruman. Truman was a bold and courageous wartime President. He fought \nin World War I as a captain. He made tough decisions to use the atomic \nweapons in Japan. He came back to a war-weary Congress and said: Give \nmilitary support to Greece against Soviet bloc expansion. He came to a \nwar-weary Congress and said: We have to put troops into North Korea. \nNobody would say Harry Truman was a softy. He had military bona fides. \nTruman also was the President who made sure that America was the first \nnation to recognize the State of Israel, and he always held that as one \nof his proudest accomplishments. It is one of the reasons that he is my \nfavorite President.\n  In October 1945, 70 years ago next month, President Truman did \nsomething that seems minor but was really important. He called \nreporters into his office at the White House and said: I have something \nto show you.\n  He unveiled that he had redesigned the seal of the Presidency of the \nUnited States. The seal is the eagle. The seal has the arrows of war in \none claw and the olive branches of diplomacy in the other claw. Truman \nhad redesigned the seal so that the eagle was now turned to face the \nolive branches of diplomacy before the arrows of war--this wartime \nPresident. He explained: Look, I am a wartime President and I will use \nmilitary force, but American values are such that we should always \nprefer diplomacy before the military.\n  We have the strongest military in the world. As a Virginian, I am so \nproud of it. We use it when needed. I have voted twice in 2\\1/2\\ years \nin the Senate as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to \nuse military force. When I cast that vote, it is a very personal one \nfor my State, for me, and my family. These votes are the hardest votes \nwe take. But Truman believed--and I believe--that it is fundamentally a \npart of our values that we prefer diplomacy first. Before we use \nmilitary action, we have to be engaged in vigorous diplomacy with \nallies and adversaries if we can see a path to possibly create a more \npeaceful world. Other Presidents have reached the same conclusion, not \nonly President Truman--President Kennedy, in negotiating the Nuclear \nTest Ban Treaty with the Soviet Union; President Nixon, in going to \nChina when China was supporting the North Vietnamese against us; \nPresident Reagan, in negotiating against the evil empire, the Soviet \nUnion, over their nuclear program; and now President Obama. Our great \nPresidents have realized that diplomacy isn't just for friends. \nDiplomacy is important, even and especially with adversaries if you can \nsee a path--a possibility--to a more peaceful world.\n  Here is something that is fascinating. Just as a strong military \nenhances diplomacy, strong diplomacy enhances our military might. That \nis true in this case. If we do a deal, we get an Iranian pledge that \nthey will never pursue, develop or acquire nuclear weapons, caps on \ntheir programs for 15 years, and inspections forever. These tools will \nincrease our intelligence. They will increase our legal justification \nto take military action if they break the pledge that is in paragraph 1 \nof the agreement.\n  It will also increase the likelihood that America will have global \nsupport if military action is necessary. But what if we walk away from \ndiplomacy now? We lose the military intelligence that inspections will \ngive us. We give up a clear legal justification for military action \nif--God forbid--we should need it. We weaken the likelihood that other \nnations will support military action if it is necessary.\n  In this case, diplomacy strengthens--not weakens--the American \ncredibility of our military threat. Trying diplomacy here will keep the \nworld's attention on Iranian behavior. Walking away from diplomacy here \nwill put the world's attention on American negotiating tactics and why \nwe decided that we would rather go it alone. I believe the article I \nbranch should send the message that we value diplomacy as a first \noption, just as President Truman did 70 years ago.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kaine for his leadership \non the review act. I know the statements and his position are heartfelt \nand ones that he comes to with full passion. I thank the Senator very \nmuch for his contribution.\n  I am now pleased to yield to Senator Sanders. The two of us came to \nthe Senate together. We served in the House of Representatives. He is \none of the most passionate voices in this country. It is an honor to \nhave him here on this issue.\n  I yield to Senator Sanders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank my friend from Maryland.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \nAction, the agreement that the United States negotiated with China, \nFrance, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and Iran. I support the \nagreement and will oppose the resolution of disapproval, as I believe \nthis approach is the best way forward if we are to accomplish what all \nof us want to accomplish; that is, making certain that Iran does not \nacquire a nuclear weapon, an occurrence which would destabilize the \nregion, lead to a nuclear arms race in the area, and would endanger the \nexistence of Israel.\n  It is my firm belief that the test of a great nation, with the most \npowerful military on Earth, is not how many wars we can engage in but \nhow we can use our strength and our capabilities to resolve \ninternational conflicts in a peaceful way. Those who have spoken out \nagainst this agreement, including many in this Chamber, and those who \nhave made every effort to thwart the diplomatic process are many of the \nsame people who spoke out forcefully and irresponsibly about the need \nto go to war with Iraq--one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the \nmodern history of our country. Sadly, people such as former Vice \nPresident Dick Cheney and many of the other neocons who pushed us into \nwar in Iraq were not only tragically wrong then; they are wrong now. \nUnfortunately, these individuals have learned nothing from the results \nof that disastrous policy and how it destabilized that entire region. I \nfear that many of my Republican colleagues do not understand that war \nmust be a last resort, not the first resort. It is easy to go to war. \nIt is not so easy to fully comprehend the unintended consequences of \nthat war.\n  As the former Chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I \nhave talked to veterans from World War II to Iraq, and I have learned a \nlittle bit about what the cost of war entails. In Iraq and Afghanistan, \nwe lost over 6,700 brave men and women, and many others have come home \nwithout legs, without arms, and without eyesight. Let us not forget \nthat 500,000 veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan came back to \ntheir families with post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain \ninjury--500,000 brave Americans. The suicide rate of young veterans is \nappallingly high. The divorce rate of those who served is appallingly \nhigh, and the impact on their children is appallingly high. God knows \nhow many families have been devastated by these wars.\n  We should also not forget that many hundreds of thousands of innocent \nIraqi men, women, and children who died in that war, and those whose \nlives who have been completely destabilized, hundreds of thousands of \npeople whose lives have been totally altered, including those who are \nfleeing that country today with only the clothes on their backs as \nrefugees. The cost of war is real. It is easy to give great speeches \nabout how tough we are, but let us not forget the cost of war on the \nmen and women who serve in our military and people in other countries.\n  Yes, the military option should always be on the table, but it should \nbe the last option. We have to do everything we can to reach an \nagreement to ensure that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon without \nhaving to go to war. I believe we have an obligation to pursue \ndiplomatic solutions before resorting to military engagement--\nespecially after nearly 14 years of ill-conceived and disastrous \nmilitary engagements in that region.\n  The agreement before us calls for cutting off Iran's pathways to the\n\n[[Page S6505]]\n\nfissile materials needed for a nuclear weapon by reducing its stockpile \nof uranium by 98 percent and restricting the level of enrichment of \nuranium to well below the level needed for weaponized uranium. The \nagreement requires Iran to decrease the number of installed centrifuges \nby two-thirds, dismantle the country's heavy water nuclear reactor so \nthat it cannot produce any weapons-grade plutonium, and commit to \nrigorous monitoring, inspection, and verification by the International \nAtomic Energy Agency.\n  Only after Iran has demonstrated to the international community its \ncompliance with the tenets of this agreement, the United States and \nEuropean Union will lift the sanctions that helped bring Iran to the \nnegotiating table in the first place. This agreement also contains a \nmechanism for the snapback of those sanctions if Iran does not comply \nwith its obligations.\n  Does this agreement achieve everything I would like? No, it does not. \nBut to my mind, it is far better than the path we were on with Iran \ndeveloping nuclear weapons capability and the potential for military \nintervention by the United States and Israel growing greater by the \nday.\n  Let us not forget that if Iran does not live up to this agreement, \nsanctions may be reimposed. If Iran moves toward a nuclear weapon, all \navailable options remain on the table. I think it is incumbent upon us, \nhowever, to give the negotiated agreement a chance to succeed. It is \nfor these reasons that I will support the agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on the \nDemocratic side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 16\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I don't know that we have faced a debate \nof this historic importance for 12 years, because it was about 12 years \nago that we voted on the floor of the Senate on whether to invade Iraq. \nSenators don't forget those debates. What is at stake is war. What is \nat stake is human lives--not only the enemy but the innocent and those \nwho are friends.\n  I remember that debate very well. There were 23 of us who voted \nagainst the invasion of Iraq--one Republican, Lincoln Chafee, and 22 \nDemocrats. At the time, we were told by Vice President Cheney, \nSecretary Rumsfeld, and others that Iraq had weapons of mass \ndestruction and we had to stop them for fear that they would use those \nweapons against our allies and our friends and even against the United \nStates. It turned out that there were no weapons of mass destruction--\nnone. After the invasion, they scoured the country and could find no \nevidence of those weapons.\n  The cost of that war is incalculable. The numbers only tell part of \nthe story. There were 4,844 Americans who lost their lives. Tens of \nthousands have come home with traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic \nstress disorder. The cost to our Treasury is in the trillions. That and \nthe war in Afghanistan--incidentally, the longest war in our history--\nwere efforts in the Middle East to try to bring some order to chaos. \nOnly limited success emerged from those efforts after all of the costs \nwere paid in human life and treasure.\n  Those who are quick to talk about a military option to deal with the \nIranians should be reminded, as the Senator from Vermont just said, of \nthe extraordinary cost of that alternative. I have always felt then and \nnow that diplomacy should be the first effort to try to avoid military \naction, to try to avoid a war. That is what this is about.\n  This President, Barack Obama, decided to make the sanctions regime \ntougher than ever. To do it, he had to engage countries from around the \nworld that depended on Iranian oil and were prepared to stop importing \nIranian oil to punish them until they would come to the negotiating \ntable. He gets absolutely no credit for that from the other side of the \naisle--none--but he should.\n\n  He then took our major leaders and allies in the world and brought \ntogether a P5+1 coalition. We met with the Ambassadors from these \ncountries. It was hard, just as an amateur student of history, to sit \nacross the table from the Ambassadors of China, Russia, the United \nKingdom, Germany, and France and imagine that coalition coming together \nfor any purpose that would serve the United States in the cause of \nworld peace, but they did. The P5+1 came together and entered into a \nserious negotiation in an effort to stop the Iranians from developing a \nnuclear weapon. That was the goal. That was the reason for the \nsanctions.\n  There are many aspects of Iranian foreign policy and conduct which \nare reprehensible to me even to this day that don't reach that level of \nnuclear weaponry, but we focused on nuclear weaponry because we knew \nthat was critical. If Iran developed a nuclear weapon, it would \nthreaten our greatest friend and ally in the Middle East, Israel, as \nwell as other countries that have worked closely with the United \nStates, and trigger an arms race on the Arabian Peninsula, which would \nhave been devastating. So we set out to stop that from happening.\n  Something happened during the course of that negotiation which was \nunprecedented in the history of the United States. On March 9, 2015, 47 \nRepublican Senators sent a signed a letter to the Ayatollah, the \nSupreme Leader in Iran. I have read the letter over and over again and \nstill cannot believe it. On March 9, 2015, 47 Republican Senators sent \nan open letter to the leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran which \nbasically said: We know you are in negotiation with the United States \nover stopping the development of a nuclear weapon, but understand--this \nletter makes it clear--that this President does not have the last word.\n  That has never happened before. I have asked those who studied the \nhistory of this country if there was ever a time when the United States \nof America was involved in delicate international negotiations and a \ngroup of Senators or Congressmen wrote to the other side--to the \nIranians--to tell them to think twice before negotiating with the \nUnited States of America. It has never happened. It is unprecedented.\n  So 47 Republican Senators who did not want to wait until the \nagreement was reached or written decided in advance to warn the \nAyatollah in Iran not to negotiate with the United States or to assume \nthat any agreement would be enforceable with Congress or future \nPresidents. What a contrast that 47 Republicans would decide in the \nmidst of negotiations to send that letter--what a contrast with the \nDemocratic side of the aisle.\n  For the last 6 weeks, I have been in touch with my colleagues over \nhere--they are probably tired of hearing from me--talking about this \nagreement and where they stood. I know, but for a few, what they went \nthrough. Many of them were trying to educate themselves on the terms of \nthis agreement because it is complicated. They were talking to experts \nin the field. One Senator came back and spent 5 hours with the \nintelligence agencies here in Washington trying to understand the \ncomplexities of this agreement and how they worked.\n  After all of that time, after all of that reflection, and after all \nof that study, these Senators announced their positions. Forty-two \nsupported the President's position, and four opposed the President's \nposition. Instead of prejudging the agreement or assuming the agreement \nwas bad, they took the time to read it and study it. They took the time \nto use their responsibilities as Senators to make sure they understood \nthis historic document, and 42 came out in favor of it.\n  I will tell the Presiding Officer that at this point in history, we \nhave a tough decision to make--whether we as a nation will pursue this \nagreement in an effort to stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon or \nthe alternative. I have yet to hear a critic of this agreement honestly \npresent the alternative. The alternative is obvious.\n  Today Iran owns enough fissile material to make 10 nuclear weapons. \nThe Prime Minister of Israel has warned the world that they are only \nmonths away from developing a nuclear weapon in Iran. Yet we hear from \nthe other side of the aisle that we should walk away from any \ninspections or agreement to stop a nuclear weapon. What is going to \nhappen the next day in Iran if that point of view prevails? What \nhappens if this agreement we have entered into should founder and fail? \nThe door is closed, no inspectors, no negotiations, and Iran is on its \nown. That is not the recipe for a safer world. That is not the recipe \nfor a safer Israel, as far\n\n[[Page S6506]]\n\nas I am concerned, and that is why I support this.\n  I am happy to be joined in my support with leaders such as GEN Colin \nPowell, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under a Republican \nPresident and former Secretary of State under a Republican President, \nwho has endorsed this agreement. He has told us: Don't trust Iran. \nMistrust Iran, if you will, and verify.\n  We are going to send in scores of inspectors to verify--inspectors \nwho have access to everything in Iran--and if there is a dispute over \naccess, it is one that can be resolved in a matter of days or weeks.\n  I might add that there are telltale pieces of evidence for the \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons that the Iranians could never destroy in \nthat of period of time. We will know if they have breached this \nagreement, and in knowing that, we have created the authority within \nthe United Nations for the United States alone to reimpose sanctions \nbased on a breach of this agreement by Iran.\n  It is an extraordinary agreement. Could it be stronger? Of course. \nBut when we look back throughout history at the skeptics who have \nattacked Presidents of both political parties who have tried to reach \nagreements to create a more peaceful world, this is no different. When \nPresident Ronald Reagan--literally a deity in the Republican Party--\ndecided to sit down and negotiate with Mikhail Gorbachev over nuclear \nweapons, the conservative wing of the Republican Party said he was \nsigning a suicide pact, wasting his time, and threatening the United \nStates--Ronald Reagan--in negotiating with Gorbachev. The same held \ntrue when Richard Nixon decided to open negotiations with China. The \ncritics on the right were quick to condemn him. Chinese were sponsoring \nNorth Vietnamese who were killing American soldiers. There were plenty \nof reasons not to do it. Richard Nixon did it with bipartisan support, \nand the world is a better place for the courage he showed.\n  At this point, as we bring this aspect of the debate to a close--and \nI see Senator Reed is here and will be recognized soon--we listened \ncarefully to those who are critical of this agreement. It turns out \nthat not a single Republican Member of the House or Senate is \nsupporting this agreement--not one. It is hard to think back in \ndiplomatic history when there has been such a partisan division within \nCongress on an issue of this historic importance and magnitude, but \nthat shouldn't deter us. We need to work with our allies so we can move \nforward with the inspections and the deadlines to make certain we do \neverything in our power to bring peace to the Middle East, short of \nwar. Those who want military action should speak up and say so. I \ndon't. I want to see this done through diplomatic means, and I believe \nthis effort is a good-faith effort to achieve that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the vote the Senate will soon take on a \nresolution to disapprove the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or \nJCPOA, is both momentous and historic. I, along with my colleagues, \nhave carefully and conscientiously reviewed this agreement. We have \neach applied our independent judgment as to whether or not it achieves \nthe primary objectives the President set out in the negotiations when \nthey began in November 2013--to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear \nweapon.\n  Since the conclusion of the negotiations, I have reviewed the text of \nthe agreement, attended and participated in hearings of the Armed \nServices Committee and Banking Committee with government witnesses and \nnongovernment witnesses, received a series of classified briefings, and \nreached out to Rhode Islanders for their views. These venues--all of \nthem--provided a full range of views and opinions and were critical in \nmy review and decision with respect to the JCPOA.\n  In my view, evaluating the JCPOA rests on three factors. The first is \nthe sufficiency of the provisions to cut off all Iranian pathways to a \nnuclear weapon. The second is the ability to conscientiously and \ncontinuously monitor and verify adherence to these provisions. Finally, \nwe have to evaluate whether this agreement will leave us in a better \nposition than a rejection of the agreement.\n  This last point of whether the agreement leaves us in a better \nposition than rejecting it touches on two alternatives suggested by \nopponents of this agreement. The first suggested alternative is that \nthere is a better agreement awaiting us if we simply reject the JCPOA \nand impose even more stringent sanctions. The second suggested \nalternative is that, without the JCPOA and with the possibility that an \nenhanced sanctions regime cannot be reconstituted, we can exercise a \nmilitary option which will be more effective and less costly than \nfollowing through with the JCPOA.\n  For reasons I will discuss in detail in the course of my remarks \ntoday, the JCPOA, in my view, does provide adequate measures to \ninterdict Iranian pathways to a nuclear weapon and an unprecedented \nmonitoring and verification regime moving forward. In addition, our \nnational intelligence means will provide further insights into Iranian \nactivities. In this regard, we will be aided by many international \npartners whose intelligence activities are acutely focused on Iran.\n  As such, I believe the JCPOA, if scrupulously implemented, will \naccomplish our objective of preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear \nweapon and is a better option than the alternative suggested in lieu of \nthe JCPOA. That is why I intend to support the agreement and will vote \nagainst the resolution of disapproval.\n  To begin this discussion, I think it is important to recognize where \nwe were when President Obama began his efforts to cut off all Iranian \npathways to a nuclear weapon. Perhaps the most revealing description \ncomes from Uzi Arad, who in 2009 was the National Security Advisor to \nnewly elected Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Arad described Iran's \nnuclear capacity in an interview with Ha'aretz, an Israeli newspaper. \nIn his words, ``The point of no-return was defined as the point at \nwhich Iran has the ability to complete the cycle of nuclear fuel \nproduction on its own; the point at which it has all the elements to \nproduce fissionable material without dependency on the outsiders. Iran \nis now there.'' That was in 2009.\n  This was the situation that confronted the President and the world in \n2009. To glibly suggest today, as some do, that the international \ncommunity could negotiate Iran back, after they pass the ``point of no \nreturn,'' to a position of ``no enrichment'' is to ignore the reality \nof Iranian efforts, particularly from the mid-2000s forward. For \nexample, in 2006 the Iranians possessed fewer than 400 centrifuges in a \nresearch facility. By 2009 they had well over 8,000 centrifuges, \ntogether with the essential elements of a nuclear program, taking them \nbeyond the ``point of no return,'' as indicated by Uzi Arad.\n  Former Secretary of State and National Security Advisor to President \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush, GEN Colin Powell, recently made this point \nas well. He said that Iran has ``been on a superhighway for the last \nten years to create a nuclear weapon or a nuclear weapons program, with \nno speed limit.''\n  In a similar vein, Amos Yadlin, former head of the Israeli Defense \nForces Military Intelligence Directorate and now director of the \nInstitute for National Security Studies, made the point that any \nanalysis or possible options regarding the Iranian nuclear program must \nbegin with the recognition that they have already passed the ``point of \nno return.'' In his words, ``[t]he starting point for comparing the \nvarious scenarios is not one in which Iran has zero nuclear \ncapabilities, but one in which Iran has been--however illegitimately--a \nnuclear threshold state since the beginning of the current decade.''\n  The Iranians advanced their nuclear program as the international \ncommunity insisted on no enrichment but failed either through \nsanctions, negotiations, or other actions to significantly interrupt \nIranian progress on its nuclear infrastructure or nuclear know-how. \nInstead, when the negotiations began under President Obama, Iran had \nalready acquired approximately 19,000 centrifuges and other essential \ncomponents of the nuclear program.\n  Indeed, the administration's diplomatic effort to build an \ninternational\n\n[[Page S6507]]\n\ncoalition to give effect to the sanctions, which ultimately forced the \nIranians to negotiate, was done with the P5+1's recognition that a ``no \nenrichment'' approach would not lead to negotiations. This was not a \nrealistic option.\n\n  With that prologue, let me now turn to the elements of the agreement \nthat were critical to my judgment. In the area of cutting off pathways \nto provide nuclear material for nuclear weapons and Iran's enrichment \ncapacity, this agreement accomplishes a key objective. It constrains \nand, through the interrelated verification measures, eliminates Iran's \nability to produce either plutonium or uranium for a nuclear weapon.\n  On the uranium pathway, the JCPOA requires Iran to cap its stockpile \nof low enriched uranium, LEU, to 300 kilograms over 15 years. Why is \nthis significant? First, before November 2013 and the initiation of the \ninterim agreement, Iran had more than 12,000 kilograms of LEU. If fully \nenriched, this is enough to make seven to eight nuclear weapons.\n  Second, with this cap Iran will not have sufficient LEU in country to \nenrich and achieve the quantity necessary to produce a single weapon, \neven with additional enrichment. In other words, it will have to break \na term of the agreement--the 300 kilogram cap of LEU--to have enough \nfeedstock to further enrich and to make the quantity needed for even a \nsingle weapon.\n  On the plutonium pathway, Iran has agreed to redesign and rebuild the \nheavy water research reactor in Arak. The redesigned and rebuilt \nreactor, the design of which must be approved by the P5+1, may only \nsupport nonmilitary nuclear research in radioisotope production. Why is \nthis significant? Arak has been one of the most concerning elements of \nIran's suspected nuclear weapons infrastructure, and this fundamental \nchange to the reactor ensures Iran's plutonium pathway for a nuclear \nweapon is shut off.\n  In an alternative scenario, if completed, the heavy water reactor at \nArak could have been a proliferation risk of unmatched proportion \nwithin their program. It could have allowed Iran to take easily \nacquired natural uranium from the ground and, over a period of time and \nthrough a series of reprocessing steps, make weapons-grade plutonium \nwithout the need for centrifuges for enrichment. The elimination of \nthis heavy water reactor, as the Iranians previously envisioned it, is \nenormously significant.\n  Further, under the agreement, Iran will be forced to use its first \ngeneration centrifuge technology, known as IR-1s. This is a significant \ncheck on the program because these are Iran's most inefficient \ncentrifuges. While Iran will be able to install more advanced \ncentrifuges in the future, it will be required to abide by the \nenrichment plan submitted to the IAEA and to be consistent with the \nlimitation inherent in the Additional Protocol. Also, it is significant \nthat the P5+1 will have 10 years of evaluating, measuring, and \nassessing Iran's intentions to determine whether its plans and programs \nare indeed exclusively peaceful, as stated by the preamble to the \nJCPOA.\n  More broadly, the agreement's research and development measures \nprovide the international community with insight into Iran's nuclear \nprogram. This is a significant opportunity to gauge Iran's intentions \nand willingness to abide by and comply with its commitments. The JCPOA \nestablishes limitations on advanced centrifuge research, development, \ntesting and deployment in the first 10 years. After that period of \ntime, the international community will continue to have a critical \n``distrust-and-verify'' mechanism built into the program. Iran must \nabide by its enrichment and research and development plan and submit it \nto the IAEA. This plan is subject to all of the IAEA's inspection and \nmonitoring tools.\n  Furthermore, the JCPOA includes a permanent prohibition on Iran \nconducting research and development activities that could contribute to \ndesign and development of a nuclear explosive device. This significant \nprohibition goes well beyond the limitations of the non-nuclear weapons \nstatement in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n  Taken together, closing off the pathways to a weapon and the \nconstraints on enrichment and R, Iran's breakout time for a single \nnuclear weapon will remain at least 1 year for each of the first 10 \nyears of this agreement and, critically, Iran's breakout time will \nremain longer than the two to three months it was in November of 2013.\n  Before I move on to the next area of discussion, I acknowledge that \nlegitimate concerns have been raised about Iranian activities after the \nfirst 10 years of the agreement, sometimes referred to as the ``out \nyears.'' During this time, Iran's breakout time could shrink \nsubstantially. However, the initial 10 years of the JCPOA will be \ncritical for the international community to measure and assess Iran's \nintentions.\n  A recent analysis of the JCPOA by Robert Einhorn, a noted expert in \nnonproliferation and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is \ninstructive in this area. In his words:\n\n       If Iranian leaders . . . believed their national interests \n     were best served by having nuclear weapons, they would run \n     major risks in going forward, with no guarantee of success. \n     Even in the `out years,' the JCPOA's rigorous monitoring \n     arrangements will remain in force. The world will have gained \n     intimate knowledge of Iran's nuclear program, which would \n     give the United States prompt warning of any Iranian effort \n     to make a dash for the bomb.\n\n  In any case, the P5+1 must begin now to communicate its insistence \nthat Iran operate consistent with a peaceful nuclear program after the \ninitial 10-year period. The international community must convey in \nstark terms to the Iranians that a rapid buildup of enrichment capacity \nafter 10 years, beyond what they need for their existing nuclear fuel \ncycle, will be considered an abandonment of the principles embodied in \nJCPOA, and that the P5+1 will need to evaluate alternative options.\n  Now, if my colleagues will allow me to discuss the area of \ninspection, monitoring, and verification. For me, the agreement must be \nbuilt on a principle of ``distrust and verify.'' Former Secretary of \nState Colin Powell put it nicely. He said: ``It's don't trust, never \ntrust, and always verify.'' And the architecture our negotiators \ndesigned to verify compliance with this agreement took this approach \nand set new precedents in key areas: access, modern technological \nmonitoring, and the requirement for affirmative approval for certain \nactions. Thus, this is a custom-built, rigorously ``red teamed'' \nverification regime that is more stringent than any other previously \ncreated.\n  Specifically, the JCPOA does the following: Inspectors from the IAEA \nwill have regular access to all of Iran's nuclear-related facilities. \nThis includes Iran's two primary sites at Natanz and Fordow.\n  Inspectors will have cradle-to-grave access to Iran's nuclear supply \nchain, including uranium mines, mills, and centrifuge production and \nstorage facilities that support Iran's nuclear program for at least 10 \nyears and in many cases longer.\n  The verification regime established by this agreement has the effect \nof making the entire Iranian nuclear program auditable. This is a \npowerful tool that will make it possible for IAEA inspectors to know \nwhether Iran is diverting material to a possible covert program.\n  Iran has agreed to apply provisionally the IAEA's Additional \nProtocol. This Additional Protocol to the IAEA comprehensive safeguards \nagreement further augments the agency's ability to investigate \nsuspected clandestine facilities and activities. Of great importance, \nthis is an enduring requirement for Iran beyond the JCPOA's terms.\n  A dedicated and exclusive procurement channel for Iran's nuclear \nprogram will be established to manage all purchases of the nuclear \nsupplier group's ``trigger list'' and dual-use items. This additional \nstep provides an intrusive authorization and transparency mechanism \nthrough which the IAEA can control what is coming into the country and \ngauge whether the requirement is consistent with the needs of the \nprogram and Iran's intentions. Any such procurement outside that \nchannel would be a violation of the JCPOA.\n  This agreement is often casually compared to the 1994 Agreed \nFramework with North Korea. Not only are there significant differences \nbetween the two, but provisions of the JCPOA were specifically written \nto provide\n\n[[Page S6508]]\n\nmore stringent verification based on the lessons from the 1994 \nagreement. One of the most significant differences was pointed out \nagain by Robert Einhorn. As he indicated, a key weakness of the 1994 \nAgreed Framework was that ``it only provided for IAEA monitoring at the \nnuclear facility at Yongbyon. It did not provide for monitoring in the \nrest of the country because that was the only declared site.''\n  Under the JCPOA, Iran must implement and abide by the Additional \nProtocol to its Safeguards Agreement under the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty, an addendum that the IAEA designed to address the \nability of a nation to covertly develop a nuclear weapons program, as \nIraq did after the first Gulf War. The Additional Protocol applies to \nall facilities that take part in any element of the nuclear fuel cycle \nof a state. The JCPOA is significantly more stringent in this regard \nthan the 1994 framework.\n  More specifically, the Additional Protocol will allow IAEA inspectors \naccess to suspected undeclared nuclear sites anywhere in the country so \nas to prevent Iran from conducting clandestine nuclear activity. If \nIran does not provide access, it is in violation of the agreement and \nsanctions will be reimposed.\n  Iran's compliance with the Additional Protocol in the years after the \nterm of the JCPOA will continue to provide the IAEA with a powerful \ntool to conduct inspections of Iran's nuclear infrastructure. Again, \nthe creation of the Additional Protocol was in direct response to \nprevious efforts to circumvent the IAEA's monitoring efforts in Iraq \nand North Korea.\n  An additional element of the monitoring and compliance regime is the \nindependent and unilateral role that the U.S. Intelligence Community \nand its intelligence liaison services will play in validating Iran's \ncompliance or noncompliance. While we can never be certain that these \nintelligence efforts will provide a complete picture of all Iranian \nnuclear activities, they provide a critical assessment of Iran's \ncompliance with the agreement, Iran's perceptions of the cost and \nbenefits of compliance with the agreement, and key insights into the \nIranian leadership's priorities for the program. As a member of both \nthe Armed Services Committee and the Select Committee on Intelligence, \nthese activities and insights will also serve as a critical tool for my \ncolleagues and me to gauge the success or failure of this agreement.\n  Over the course of the Armed Services Committee hearings, there was \ndetailed questioning on several topics but one in particular: the 24-\nday period of time that Iran has available to it under the agreement to \npotentially delay access for IAEA inspectors to a facility suspected of \nprohibited activity. Secretary Moniz offered a helpful insight into \nthis area. He said:\n\n       The 24-day period is itself new in the sense there has \n     never been any time limit in terms of access to undeclared \n     sites. Again, to repeat, on nuclear materials we have very, \n     very sensitive capabilities and historically those have been \n     proved.\n\n  But Secretary Moniz went on to speak candidly as he said:\n\n       With regard to nonnuclear materials, it gets more \n     difficult. However, when one has nuclear weapons specialized \n     activity, such as explosively driven neutron initiators, we \n     would not be without tools to detect activities in that kind \n     of a time period. But clearly, as one gets farther and \n     farther away into let's say, just conventional explosive \n     testing, which is something militaries do normally, then it's \n     a question of intelligence putting together the context for \n     suspicious activities. But nuclear material, in the end, you \n     need to do nuclear materials to get to the weapon and that's \n     where we have extraordinary techniques.\n\n  Now, critics of the agreement have said that this 24-day period of \ntime is too long and offers Iran too much time to cover up its \nactivities. As Secretary Moniz stated clearly, this is a possibility as \nit relates to certain non-nuclear activities. However, if Iran \nintroduces fissile materials into these activities, Iran's ability to \ncover its tracks in 24 days is extremely unlikely.\n  I also believe this part of the agreement is an area where Iran's \nintentions need to be subjected to constant questioning and evaluation. \nIf Iran is challenging the IAEA inspectors at every turn, it should be \ninterpreted as an indication of its intent with respect to the \npermanent commitment it made on the third page of the agreement: ``Iran \nreaffirms that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop, or \nacquire nuclear weapons.''\n  This is a strong restatement of its basic obligations as a non-\nnuclear weapons state under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. A \npattern of frustrating IAEA inspectors should be seen as a clear \nwarning of possible reneging on this central commitment.\n\n  Let me at this juncture discuss the duration of the agreement. \nCritics have made a variety of comments in this area of duration. Some \nargue that Iran can begin enriching beyond the low-enriched limit of \n3.67 percent fissile uranium at year 16. That is true, but Iran could \ndo that tomorrow without this agreement. Nevertheless, some argue that \nthis agreement simply suspends Iran's program in place for a decade. In \nmy view, this is not an accurate characterization as many of the access \nand verification elements of the agreement go well past 10 years or 15 \nyears. Indeed, some are permanent. Iran's commitment under the Nuclear \nNon-proliferation Treaty and its Additional Protocol remain in place, \nand their compliance with it will be a key metric for the P5+1. \nFurther, the international community's ability to impose sanctions \nalways remains available.\n  Now I want to address the area of possible military dimensions or \nPMD. Iran has agreed to address all the past and present outstanding \nPMD issues in a comprehensive and time-limited manner. This requirement \nis laid out clearly in paragraph 66 of Annex I of the JCPOA. It is \nfurther articulated in more detail in the IAEA's July 14, 2015, ``Road-\nmap for the Clarification of Past & Present Outstanding Issues \nregarding Iran's Nuclear Program.''\n  Resolving the issue of PMD is critical for a number of reasons. It is \ncritical that the IAEA is able to complete its investigation of PMD and \nissue an independent assessment of any nuclear weapons-related work \nIran has conducted in the past. The IAEA made clear in the Director \nGeneral's November 2011 report on PMD that unanswered questions remain. \nThe U.N. Security Council has endorsed and reinforced the requirement \nthat Iran address these questions.\n  Under the agreement, if Iran complies, the IAEA will again gain \naccess to Parchin, and the IAEA will be provided the additional \naccesses to people, places, and other items it has requested. However, \nIran gets nothing in the way of sanctions relief if it does not address \nthese unanswered questions to the satisfaction of the IAEA.\n  Some critics of the agreement have also suggested that IAEA has \noutsourced to Iran its inspection of Parchin, the most infamous of \nIran's suspected facilities. I have been briefed extensively on this \nmatter in a classified setting. Those briefings are consistent with the \nconclusion of IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano. He has stated the \nagreement with the Iranians is, in his words, ``technically sound'' and \ndoes not--again in his words--``compromise [the IAEA's] safeguards \nstandards in any way.''\n  Secretary Moniz has further assured me of this fact. We know the \nIranians have repeatedly attempted to eradicate any sign of their \nactivities at the Parchin site. Thus, it is unlikely that any \nsignificant PMD-related activities have occurred there in the last 4 \nyears. We do not know what signs of past activities will remain at the \nsite. Importantly, the IAEA will be able to confirm whether there is \nany ongoing nuclear-related activity at that location.\n  Critics of the arrangement to inspect Parchin have also suggested \nthat the IAEA has entered into a secret side deal with Iran. In fact, \nthe United States and all the other NPT member countries--Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty countries--have confidential agreements with the \nIAEA which cannot be shared.\n  These agreements vary by country, but they are designed to protect \nthe integrity of the IAEA inspection process and the sensitive \ntechnical and design information about peaceful national nuclear \nprograms. The IAEA and the Obama administration have taken \nextraordinary steps to brief Congress on this agreement in a classified \nsetting. These briefings have been informative and helpful to \nunderstand more fully what we can expect in the months and years ahead.\n  Now, I would like to discuss at this point the topic of the arms \nembargo\n\n[[Page S6509]]\n\nand missile sanctions, which is part of this arrangement. Like many of \nmy colleagues, I remain concerned about the elements of this agreement \nthat relate to these issues. The inclusion of these provisions in the \nJCPOA is directly related to the fact that the United States secured \nthese measures in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929 to pressure \nIran to address the international community's concerns with respect to \nits nuclear program. Since these sanctions were deemed by the P5+1 to \nbe related to the nuclear program through the U.N. Resolution, they \nwere within the ambit of sanctions relief.\n  Nevertheless, moving forward, this is an area where the United States \nneeds to leverage the available sanctions and additional tools under \nother U.N. Security Council resolutions to keep pressure on Iran. For \nexample, other U.N. Security Council resolutions prohibit Iranian \ntransfers of arms to groups such as the Houthis in Yemen, nonstate \nactors in Lebanon, which includes Hezbollah, the Taliban in \nAfghanistan, and Shi'a militias in Iraq, as well as North Korea, Libya, \nand several sub-Saharan states in Africa.\n  This will mean the Treasury Department, the State Department, and the \nIntelligence Community must double their efforts to identify prohibited \nactivities and build the international architecture necessary to \ncounter it and deter them.\n  It also means working with our partners on the Missile Technology \nControl Regime, or MTCR, to prevent the spread of critical missile \ntechnologies, and with our more than 100 partners under the Bush \nadministration's Proliferation Security Initiative, or PSI, to help \nlimit Iranian missile-related imports or exports.\n  It may also mean what former Under Secretary of State for Political \nAffairs Nick Burns recently suggested to the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, which is that we will need to, in his words, ``reconstitute \na coalition of sanctions countries against Iran five years from now on \nconventional weapons, eight years from now on ballistic missiles.'' I \nbelieve the next 5 years will provide the international community a \ncritical measuring stick for Iranian intentions, and we must be \nprepared to lead efforts to preclude Iran from obtaining enhanced \nmilitary technologies.\n  Now, a bulk of the work that will be done and will be so central to \nour efforts will be done by the IAEA. The IAEA will be responsible for \ncarrying on the ground the implementation of this agreement on behalf \nof the P5+1. While critics of the agreement are quick to call into \nquestion the technical expertise and skills of the IAEA, it is \ncomprised of individuals with extensive training and experience and a \ndeep commitment to the importance of nonproliferation work.\n  A recent study by Tom Shea, a noted safeguards expert with experience \nat the IAEA and in the laboratory community, concludes:\n\n       The IAEA's capabilities have been extended, strengthened \n     and refined over the years in response to real-world \n     proliferation cases in Iraq and North Korea. Its current \n     capacity reflects the international community's decades-long \n     investment in the organization, and the continuing commitment \n     of states around the world to its mission.\n\n  I would also note that upwards of 200 IAEA technical experts will be \ndevoted to implementing this agreement. This number far exceeds any \nnumber of experts and inspectors devoted to any one country by the \nIAEA.\n  Allow me now to focus on the area of sanctions and our ability to \nreapply them. First, it is critical that we remember Iran will receive \nno new sanctions relief if it does not complete its nuclear commitments \nand the IAEA's inspectors verify those steps. Let me be specific here. \nPrior to granting any further sanctions relief, Iran must, as verified \nby the IAEA, demonstrate that it has implemented the necessary steps \nwith respect to, No. 1, the Arak heavy water research reactor; No. 2, \nits overall enrichment capacity; No. 3, its centrifuge research and \ndevelopment; No. 4, the Fordow fuel enrichment plant; No. 5, its \nuranium stocks and fuel; No. 6, its centrifuge manufacturing; No. 7, \ncompleting the modalities and facilities-specific arrangements to allow \nthe IAEA to implement all transparency measures and the Additional \nProtocol and Modified Code 3.1; No. 8, its centrifuge component \nmanufacturing transparency; and, No. 9, addressing the past and present \nissues of concern relating to PMD.\n  This means that Iran must take significant steps to roll back and \nfreeze its nuclear program before it gets anything in the way of \nsanctions relief. In testimony before the Senate banking committee, \nAdam Szubin, the acting Under Secretary of Treasury said:\n\n       We expect that [process] to take at least six to nine \n     months. Until Iran completes those steps, we are simply \n     extending the limited relief that has been in place the last \n     year and a half under the Joint Plan of Action. There will \n     not be a cent of new sanctions relief.\n\n  Moreover, while the President will waive the application of the \nnuclear-related sanctions under the terms of the JCPOA, the U.S. \nsanctions, which include the Central Bank and other financial \nsanctions, will remain available until Congress acts to terminate them. \nThis will allow Congress to monitor an extended period of Iran's \ncompliance before taking any such action. This also gives the President \na strong hand because the ability to quickly snap back nuclear-related \nsanctions means that we can again shut off, to a substantial degree, \nIran's access to the international financial system, to international \nmarkets, and to international financing that relies on access to the \nU.S. banking system.\n  It is important to note that this agreement does not take away the \ntools available to the President to target sanctions against Iran's \nviolation of human rights or to damage Iran's ability to finance \nterrorism. U.S. secondary sanctions remain in place.\n  As Richard Nephew, a fellow at the Center on Global Energy Policy at \nColumbia University, recently told the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nunder the agreement:\n\n       [The] United States will still be able to pressure banks \n     and companies into not doing business with the IRGC, the Quds \n     Force, Qasem Soleimani, and Iran's military and missile \n     forces. This is both due to direct risk of U.S. secondary \n     sanctions, which remain in place, and an improvement in \n     international banking practices since 9/11.\n\n  These secondary sanctions are not insignificant tools, and our use of \nthem in response to human rights violators and terrorism are not a \nviolation of the agreement. As Under Secretary Szubin recently told the \nSenate banking committee on the matter of terrorism sanctions:\n\n       [O]ne of the most powerful [tools] . . . is that when we \n     sanction Iranian terrorist supporters, our designation is \n     amplified internationally. What I mean by that is, when we \n     name a Hezbollah financier, a Hezbollah money launderer, any \n     bank worldwide, not just American banks, any bank worldwide \n     that facilitates transactions for that designated entity \n     faces very severe sanctions from the U.S., sanctions that no \n     bank wants to face.\n\n  Under Secretary Szubin has also indicated that the United States will \ndo more in the area of terrorism-related sanctions. Should Iran decide \nto continue its destabilizing actions in the region, increasing the \ncost in this area will be critical, so it is important to note the \nadministration's willingness to ramp up pressure in the face of such \nconduct by the Iranians.\n  Particular attention has rightly been paid to the amount of sanctions \nrelief Iran will receive and Iran's likely use of that sanctions \nrelief. This is an important issue. While we do not know what Iran will \ndo with it, we do know a couple of things. First, the amount of \nsanction relief is not $100 or $150 billion as some critics of the deal \nhave suggested. According to the Treasury Department, the number is \nbetween $50 and $60 billion. While this number is significant, it is \none-third of what many critics have asserted.\n  Second, it is likely that Iran will invest a portion of this money \ninto its economy to address the concerns of its people and to begin to \nrecover from the international sanctions regime, but it may also invest \nin its financing of terrorism across the region. General Dempsey has \nrightly suggested, ``[t]he answer is probably a little bit of both.'' \nWhat we will need to do is monitor closely, particularly via our \nIntelligence Community, where Iran is making its investments and \nactively counter those maligned activities.\n  Now, I believe the JCPOA is the best option available to us right \nnow. Critics recommend rejecting the JCPOA and advocating a regime of \nnew and increasingly crippling sanctions that are\n\n[[Page S6510]]\n\nmore effective to ensuring Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon. It \nis my view that this alternative is not feasible at this time and may, \nindeed, be counterproductive.\n  Moreover, the options for enhanced sanctions and even military \noperations remain available to the United States and our P5+1 partners \nshould Iran at any time fail to comply with the JCPOA. Indeed, \nnoncompliance would be more likely to find an international commitment \nfor aggressive action than a rejection of the JCPOA. Such a rejection \ncould give the Iranians the opening to argue that it can resume all of \nits existing activities prior to the interim agreement and insist that \ninternational sanctions have been nullified by our rejection of the \nJCPOA.\n  If the United States were now to say ``this deal is not good \nenough,'' it would likely have the immediate effect of alienating us \nfrom our partners and, therefore, empowering Iran. Iran would seize \nthis opening to drive a wedge between us and our European allies, as \nwell as Russia and China. Such an action by the United States would \nplay right into the hands of Iran, both in terms of the viability of \nthe multilateral sanctions regime and in terms of the obligations it \nhas already agreed to take under this agreement.\n  It is difficult to imagine a scenario in which the United States can \nbreak, at this juncture, with its most critical economic partners on \nthe Iran nuclear program and then secure more stringent sanctions.\n  Another complicating factor in this scenario is the outcome for the \nhardliners in Iran. Undoubtedly, their narrative can gain additional \ntraction in Tehran and they may be able to seize an even greater amount \nof power and influence. This makes the ``more sanctions'' approach more \nconcerning because it could produce the unintended consequence of \nempowering the most strident elements in Iran.\n  The second most common option discussed by critics of this agreement \nis the military option. In this regard, it is critical that we \nunderstand some points up front. Unless we are prepared to invade and \noccupy Iran, executing a military option to destroy the nuclear \ninfrastructure will only delay Iran's nuclear program. It will not bomb \naway Iran's knowledge, and it will empower significantly the hardliners \nin Iran who are committed to developing a nuclear weapon. They will \nlikely disperse and disguise their activities so that military strikes \nare increasingly ineffective and produce significant collateral damage, \nwhich will be exploited by the Iranians for propaganda purposes.\n  On this issue of delay, General Dempsey provided two important \ninsights. First, in response to a question asking for his military \nassessment on what is more effective in delaying or stopping the \nIranian nuclear program at this time or in the near future, a military \nstrike or this P5+1 agreement, he said:\n\n       First . . . I would like to point out that the military \n     options remain. Secondly, I think a negotiated settlement \n     provides a more durable--and reduces near term risk, which \n     buys time to work with regional partners to address the other \n     malign activities.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       Our government's policy has been they will not get a \n     nuclear weapon and nothing we're talking about here today \n     should change that policy.\n\n  This agreement does not change that longstanding and clearly \narticulated U.S. policy.\n  I also agree with the assessment of former Senators John Warner and \nCarl Levin--both of whom served terms as the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee--that a vote against this deal is a vote to \nundermine the deterrent value and credibility of our military option.\n  Closer examination of the military option raises the critical \nquestion of our objective if we were to use force--to delay the nuclear \nprogram or to overthrow the regime so as to eliminate the nuclear \nthreat? In either case, a daunting scenario emerges. As previously \ndiscussed, if our focus is limited only to Iran's nuclear program, the \nUnited States--likely alone or nearly alone--will need to conduct a \nsimilar option every few years, as the Iranians will undoubtedly make \ntheir nuclear program an operation that is conducted in smaller and \nmore numerous locations in areas that are increasingly difficult to \nlocate and deeper in the ground or masked by civilian activities in \npopulated areas.\n  If we conduct such targeted strikes, analysts suggest that the \nIranians will respond. Such responses could include attacks against \nU.S. forces in the gulf region and Afghanistan; attacks against Israel \nby Iran's most capable proxy, Hezbollah; attacks against our partners \nin the GCC; attacks against the region's energy infrastructure; or a \ncombination of all of the above. Along with the significant economic \nconsequences, the loss of personnel and resource drain on our Nation's \nmilitary could be severe. Ironically, an additional consequence would \nbe a shift in resources away from the campaign against the Islamic \nState in the Levant--or ISIL--particularly in Iraq, and our ongoing \nefforts to consolidate the international community's gains in \nAfghanistan.\n  On the other hand, if our military objective was regime change, I \nwould first remind my colleagues of the Iraq war and all of the \nimplications that exercising that military option had on the region.\n  In 2012, Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution wrote:\n\n       An occupation of Iran would require up to one million U.S. \n     and other foreign troops over an extended time and, hence, \n     would indeed be implausible. But an invasion, with the single \n     goal of deposing the government, could be considered a \n     possibility under extreme circumstances--if for example there \n     were unmistakable evidence that Iran's current government was \n     preparing a major attack on Israel, or if it responded to any \n     U.S. ``surgical'' air campaign with an all-out global \n     terrorist response, using Hezbollah and various elements of \n     its security apparatus.\n\n  Although Michael O'Hanlon makes a distinction between an \n``occupation'' and an ``invasion,'' our experience in both Iraq and \nAfghanistan should demonstrate that the deployment of ground forces to \neffect regime change is unlikely to produce a quick exit, so we must be \nprepared for his ``implausible''--an expensive occupation with a \nmillion military personnel on the ground.\n  Thus, as some observers continue to discuss the military option \nregardless of the scope and intent of it, I would urge them to ensure \nthat their analysis goes beyond the first day, first month, or first 6 \nmonths of conflict and rather considers the first year, first 5 years, \nand first decade of conflict. Our Nation has seen the great cost of war \nover the past 15 years.\n  This agreement retains the military options for the Commander in \nChief and at the same time establishes an arrangement with the Iranians \nthat allows us to test vigorously and monitor invasively the intentions \nof the Iranian regime's nuclear program. This is one major reason at \nthis point that the JCPOA is the most compelling option.\n  A number of noted national security experts and a number of my \ncolleagues and Americans have discussed the importance of ensuring Iran \nis not only constrained with respect to its nuclear program but also \nwith respect to its regional hegemonic aspirations and its support \ndirectly and indirectly of terrorism. These negotiations did not cover \nother hostile, objectionable actions by Iran--namely, its support of \nterrorism, its destabilizing activities across the region, its abuse of \nits own people, and ongoing detention of American citizens. We cannot \ncondone or ignore these critical issues, and they all must be \naddressed. But absent implementation of this agreement, the threats \nposed by Iran would likely be amplified as it returns to deliberate and \nfocused efforts to build a nuclear infrastructure.\n  The choice before us under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act is \nexclusively on the nuclear dimension. But without the JCPOA, I suspect \nthe Iranian nuclear challenge will grow quickly, adding further menace \nto their regional aspirations and their support of terrorism. \nCritically, any of these other objectionable Iranian behaviors would be \nfar more dangerous if Iran acquired nuclear weapons.\n  As I said earlier, I evaluate this agreement with great skepticism. \nIran is a major sponsor of terrorism and a leader in other \ndestabilizing activities across the Middle East. As I mentioned \npreviously, though, the negotiations to secure this agreement were not \nfocused on Iran's support of terrorism. This matter remains \noutstanding, and charting a pragmatic and implemen-\n\n[[Page S6511]]\n\n table strategy to counter it is critical to U.S. national security \ninterests.\n  More broadly, however, these negotiations are not without precedent. \nDuring the Cold War, we negotiated with the Soviets despite their \npersistent destabilizing activities in many parts of the world. In \nfact, President Nixon was still in negotiation with the Soviets even \nwhile they still supported the North Vietnamese.\n  Graham Allison, a noted nonproliferation expert at Harvard's Belfer \nCenter, noted in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee recently that ``claims that the U.S. cannot reach \nadvantageous agreements to constrain nuclear arms with states we are \nseeking to contain, or subvert, or even overthrow . . . are . . . \nwrong. [The Reagan] administration's core national security strategy \nfor competition with the Soviet Union . . . states that `U.S. policy \ntowards the Soviet Union will consist of three elements: external \nresistance to Soviet imperialism; internal pressure on the USSR to \nweaken the sources of Soviet imperialism;' and `engaging the Soviet \nUnion in negotiations to attempt to reach agreements which protect and \nenhance U.S. interests and which are consistent with the principle of \nstrict reciprocity and mutual interest.' ''\n  Even with the JCPOA, I do not suspect that the Iranian support for \ntheir proxies will automatically abate under this agreement, and I do \nnot think this agreement is a forcing mechanism for modifying Iranian \nbehavior in the region. I do, however, think this agreement takes the \nnear-term scenario of a nuclear-armed Iran bent on supporting its \nproxies in the Middle East off the table. And I believe it is for the \ntime being sensible for the United States and our partners to take \nstock of Iran's willingness to comply with this agreement; monitor its \nactivities closely in the region to see if they increase, decrease, or \nremain the same; and, in parallel, work with our regional partners to \ncounter Iran's asymmetric threats.\n  On the matter of our regional partners in the Middle East, I see two \ncritical matters that must be addressed.\n  First, our partners in Israel rightly see Iran as a significant and \nongoing threat to their national security. It is incumbent upon the \nUnited States to better understand the concerns of the Israelis with \nrespect to their gaps in addressing the Iranian problem set and to \nidentify areas of cooperation on military and intelligence matters that \naddress these gaps and maintain their qualitative military edge at all \ntimes.\n  Second, it is also critical that our partners and allies know that \nthe United States will not abandon the region in the wake of this \nagreement. This message is critical for all of our partners to hear and \nunderstand.\n  The May 2015 joint statement following the United States and Gulf \nCooperation Council meeting at Camp David provided a roadmap for how \nthe administration intends to proceed. The joint statement indicates \nthat the United States will be increasing training and exercise \nengagements with GCC special operation forces elements so as to better \nenable our partners to confront Iran's asymmetric capabilities, as well \nas enhancing the ballistic missile defense capabilities of the GCC and \nimproving their interoperability to increase collective defense in \norder to counter Iran's support of terrorist proxies. These are \nimportant and essential efforts that will consume significant time and \neffort in the Middle East, and it will be critical that we ensure that \nthey are resourced appropriately. The added benefit of these activities \nis that they will provide the U.S. military with additional access and \ncapabilities in the region to ensure that the military option remains \ncredible to the Iranians and available to the President.\n  Mr. President, I approached this vote with deep suspicion regarding \nIran, and I see the agreement for what it is--a combination of \nopportunities and risks. I believe these negotiations were necessarily \nfocused on denying Iran a pathway to a nuclear weapon. A nuclear-armed \nIran would be a formidable force in the Middle East and, as it has \nrepeatedly demonstrated, not a force for peace and stability. Moreover, \na nuclear-armed Iran would likely prompt a nuclear arms race in the \nregion that through accident or design could lead to catastrophe. This \nagreement provides a framework to close off Iran's pathways to a \nnuclear weapon.\n  Rejecting the resolution of disapproval is vitally important, but \neffective, unrelenting implementation of the JCPOA will be the real \ntest. As such, it is critical that both the President and the Congress \nexert every effort to ensure that there are unstinting efforts to \nmonitor and sustain the provisions of the agreement. This effort \ndemands constant attention and ample--more than ample funding for the \nindefinite future.\n  As Gen. Brent Scowcroft, former National Security Advisor to \nPresident George Herbert Walker Bush, recently stated in a Washington \nPost op-ed supporting the agreement:\n\n       Implementation and verification will be the key to success, \n     and Congress has an important role. It should ensure that the \n     [IAEA], other relevant bodies and U.S. intelligence agencies \n     have all the resources necessary to facilitate inspection and \n     monitor compliance.\n\n  I believe General Scowcroft is correct. Iranian compliance and the \nimplementation phase of this agreement is critical no matter how you \nvote on the resolution of disapproval.\n  It is also important that we ensure that the administration is able \nto follow through on the commitments they have made to our allies and \npartners in the Middle East, especially to the State of Israel. Again, \nGeneral Scowcroft makes an excellent point. The United States must \nwork, in his words, ``closely with the GCC and other allies to moderate \nIranian behavior in the region, countering it where necessary.'' Absent \nsupport and resourcing for the implementation phase of this agreement, \nthese efforts may not happen and our efforts to reassure our partners \nin the region may fail.\n  Soon, this debate will be over. I believe sustaining the JCPOA will \nleave us in a strong position to counter potential Iranian \nproliferation. But regardless of the outcome of this debate, we must \nnot relax our efforts in countering Iranian nuclear aspirations, \nregional aggression, and the sponsorship of terrorism. I believe the \nJCPOA will give us valuable tools to monitor and interdict their \npathways to a nuclear weapon, but it will require day-to-day \nsurveillance and, where necessary, intervention to increase our chances \nof success.\n  In many respects, we are at a moment that recalls the emotional words \nof Winston Churchill:\n\n       Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of \n     the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.\n\n  We have concluded an agreement that dramatically constrains Iran's \nnuclear ambitions. Now the hard work begins each day to ensure that our \naspirations become real.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am honored to follow my friend and \ncolleague from Rhode Island in his very eloquent and powerful remarks, \nand I wish to add my own on the same topic. The question of whether the \nSenate should accept the agreement between the P5+1 and Iran to end \ntheir illicit and treacherous nuclear program is one of the most \ndifficult and critical matters of national security that I have \nconfronted since my election to the Senate.\n  I am deeply grateful to many in my State of Connecticut, here in \nWashington, DC, and around the country who have offered me their \ninsight, interest, and involvement--most especially the people of \nConnecticut who have given me their thoughts in letters, in emails, \nphone calls, and in one-on-one conversations across our State in a vast \nvariety of settings, whether at parades or fairs or in one-on-one \nmeetings or meetings in groups. I have made my decision based on \nconscience and conviction. I will vote to accept the proposed agreement \nconcerning Iran's nuclear program and against the resolution of \ndisapproval before the Senate.\n  My two paramount goals have been consistently and constantly to \nprevent a nuclear-armed Iran and to do so by peaceful means. I believe \nthis agreement, using diplomacy, not military force, is the most viable \nremaining path now available--now available--to prevent a nuclear-armed \nIran.\n  This agreement is not the one I would have negotiated or accepted, \nbut\n\n[[Page S6512]]\n\nit is better than no deal. This agreement is an opportunity for us to \npush back and deter Iran, and it brings on us a special obligation of \nvigilance and vigorous enforcement. It can be made better. It can be \nimproved and strengthened through unilateral action by the United \nStates and through consultation and collaboration with our allies, not \nresuming or reopening the negotiations but acting in collaboration with \nour allies, as well as through actions we can take as a nation alone \nand working closely with our ally, our friend, our critical partner in \nthe Middle East, the State of Israel.\n  The administration set forth a case that the current agreement \nimmediately reduces Iran's nuclear program and places it under a series \nof overlapping safeguards. Together these measures push a threshold \nnuclear power back from the brink. The agreement imposes an intrusive \ninspection and surveillance regime relying on international \ncertification and verification by the International Atomic Energy \nAgency. Future U.S. Presidents have the authority immediately and \nthrough Executive order to reimpose our sanctions if Iranian actions \nare inconsistent with our national security.\n  Rejecting this agreement is fraught with unacceptable risk. Our \nformal negotiation partners and allies have signaled clearly they are \nsimply not coming back to the table--a point confirmed in my direct \nconversations and meetings. There is no better deal available now. The \npresent sanctions will soon become unenforceable, producing an economic \nwindfall for Iran whether or not the United States accepts this \nagreement. The United States, instead of Iran, would be isolated, and \nIran's nuclear program would be unconstrained. Rejection would fracture \nour unified efforts with our allies and greatly weaken international \npressure on Iran and undermine American leadership on this issue and \nothers, especially if economic sanctions are needed in the event of a \nviolation.\n  This agreement has shortcomings, no doubt, and they are serious. I \nhave listened to my colleagues, including Chairman Corker, whom I \ndeeply respect, and others here today, enumerate a number of them. Yet \nI remain convinced the most constructive and clear-eyed role for \nCongress is to support specific steps to make implementation and \nenforcement of this agreement stronger and more effective. In fact, in \nmy view, the day after this agreement is approved and accepted is as \nimportant as the agreement itself--the day after, the months after, and \nthe years after because that is when this agreement must be enforced \nvigorously and strenuously and unyieldingly.\n  I have taken additional time to look beyond this agreement to create \na blueprint for diplomatic steps to strengthen it. Specifically, I am \nworking with the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland, to craft new legislation. \nCongress must act to encourage and enable diplomacy with Iran, which is \nnot only possible but critically important. Now we must begin the \nprocess of addressing those shortfalls and shortcomings, unwanted \nimpacts and consequences revealed during congressional review of the \nagreement.\n  No. 1, countering Iranian terror with dollar-for-dollar sanctions. To \ncounter Iran's role as a leading state sponsor of terrorism, Congress \nmust sustain and expand existing sanctions that crack down on terror \nfinancing and demand their full enforcement by both the United States \nand the European Union.\n  I will continue--indeed, I will increase--pressing Secretary of State \nJohn Kerry to take long overdue, aggressive steps to interdict arms to \nHezbollah, and I will work to block Hezbollah's financing and \nlogistical support from Iran, applying tools and techniques available \nthrough our banking and financial system.\n  No. 2, empowering our allies to counter Iran and terror proxies. We \nmust renew and reinvigorate our efforts to protect our allies, \nespecially Israel--our major strategic partner in the Middle East--from \nthe threat of Iran and its terror proxies. We need a new framework of \ndefense cooperation that takes into account how this agreement will \naffect the changing threat from Iran.\n  Congress must work to expand Israel's qualitative military edge and \nbolster intelligence cooperation. The Pentagon must establish new joint \ntraining exercises that involve strategic air assets and invite Israeli \npilots to train flying long-range bombers. Now is the time to aid \nIsrael with extra F-35 Joint Strike Fighter squadrons and the tankers \nthey need to cut off any threat to Israel--well before it reaches their \nborders. No equipment should be precluded if needed for Israel's self-\ndefense.\n  As a member of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, I will work to \nestablish such a parallel agreement with Israel to cover threats, both \nnuclear and conventional, along with an ongoing joint review forum, \nbringing together the United States, Israel, and NATO members to \nenhance our deterrent capabilities.\n  No. 3, preventing a nuclear-armed Iran. The United States must \nreaffirm unequivocally that Iran will never be allowed to obtain a \nnuclear weapon and that all available options will be used to stop it \nfrom ever accumulating enough highly enriched uranium or weapons-grade \nplutonium to produce one. Such a policy is consistent with this \nagreement.\n  Congress must articulate in statute that that policy is \nunchallengeable and that Iranian violations both during this agreement \nand afterward will be met with strong, unquestionable action. It must \nbe clear we will defend our vital interests in the Persian Gulf region, \nand those vital interests include preventing a nuclear-armed Iran. It \nis a fundamental tenet of our foreign policy.\n  As a member of the agreement, the United States is in a stronger \nposition to deter and remedy violations, whether through economic \nsanctions or military action as a last resort. If the agreement is \nrejected and economic sanctions or military actions are ever necessary, \nwe would act alone. That is a simple fact about our rejection. If the \nagreement is accepted, we act with a coalition of allies and partners \nwith the legitimacy and credibility of diplomacy having run its course \nand with the intelligence produced by inspections that will help to \nguide any military action necessary as a last resort. There will be \npopular support at home, which is absolutely necessary for such action. \nThat support is essential because acting without it will make it \ndifficult, if not impossible, for the President to in effect seek to \nenforce the very terms of an agreement this Nation has rejected, if \nthat is the result.\n  Most importantly, this agreement cannot be based on hope or trust. \nHistory belies both in our experience with Iran. This deal is not an \nagreement I have long sought, it is not the agreement I would have \npreferred, but it makes the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran less \nimminent. It requires the United States and the international community \nto sustain their commitment to verify and enforce its provisions over \nmany years, and I am ready to join in the hard work of preventing a \nnuclear-armed Iran on this difficult diplomatic path.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I come to the floor to discuss what I \nbelieve is probably the most important foreign policy issue I have \nworked on in my time in the Senate. It is one of great consequence to \nour Nation and also to our allies.\n  I don't come to this decision lightly, but there are many reasons I \nwould urge this body to disapprove the agreement that has been entered \ninto between the Obama administration, the Iranian Government, and the \nP5+1 nations.\n  First of all, we need to understand the country we are dealing with. \nJust today the Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said: I am \nsaying to Israel that they won't live to see the end of these 25 years. \nWith Allah's help, there will be no such thing as a Zionist regime in \n25 years.\n  Of course, this is not the first time we have heard this from the \nSupreme Leader or the leaders of Iran. We are in this position even \nafter having entered this agreement and having had the President go to \nthe U.N. to seek approval of this agreement prior to coming to the \nCongress. We know that while this agreement was being negotiated, the \nIranian Foreign Minister\n\n[[Page S6513]]\n\nwas smiling for the cameras and negotiating the agreement, while the \nPresident of Iran was actually at rallies in Iran where they were \nshouting ``Down with America'' and ``Death to Israel.''\n  Iran itself has a history that is important for us to understand. \nThat history is a history of noncompliance. Iran has time and time \nagain failed to comply with U.N. resolutions and failed to meet its \nobligations. Iran has violated U.N. Security Council resolutions. Iran \nhas violated the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in the past. Iran has \nconsistently been unresponsive to the International Atomic Energy \nAgency in the past--the IAEA--and Iran has failed to answer questions \nabout its past nuclear weapons activities. If there is no covert, \nundeclared nuclear facility in Iran today, Olli Heinonen, a former IAEA \nDeputy Director, has said it would be the first time in 20 years.\n\n  So one of the important issues, I believe, for any of us in reviewing \nthis agreement is: What is the inspection regime that would be put in \nplace to assure not only that we are doing a full inspection at the \ndeclared facilities of Iran but also the undeclared facilities? The \nreality is that under this agreement, the process for seeking \ninspection by the IAEA for undeclared facilities is a process that only \na lawyer could love--and I happen to be one--because if we look at the \nlanguage of the actual agreement, we will see in paragraph 75 that ``if \nthe IAEA has concerns regarding undeclared nuclear materials or \nactivities, or activities inconsistent with the JCPOA, at locations \nthat have not been declared under the comprehensive safeguards \nagreement'' the IAEA first has to ``provide Iran [with] the basis for \nsuch concerns and request clarification.''\n  So that is the first step. Then, ``if Iran's explanations do not \nresolve the IAEA's concerns, the Agency may request access to such \nlocations for the sole reason to verify the absence of undeclared \nnuclear materials and activities'' and the IAEA also has to ``provide \nIran the reasons for access in writing and will make available all \nrelevant information.''\n  Then, Iran may come back and ``propose to the IAEA alternative means \nof resolving the IAEA's concerns that enable the IAEA to verify the \nabsence of undeclared nuclear materials and activities . . . . ''\n  So if those alternatives aren't accepted from Iran, then, ``if the \ntwo sides are unable to reach satisfactory agreements to verify the \nabsence of'' an undeclared nuclear facility, then at that point there \nis a process that goes into place, and that process--which has been \ndescribed on this Senate floor--can take up to 24 days.\n  But we need to understand there is a whole litigation process that \noccurs even before those days, and this can be a much longer process.\n  Then, how does this get resolved? This gets resolved essentially by a \ncommittee process. So then we have a committee resolve all of this. \nThat is why I say this is a lawyer's dream in terms of an inspection \nregime here.\n  Then, if we look at paragraph 78 of the agreement, ``The members of \nthe Joint Commission, by consensus or by a vote of 5 or more of its 8 \nmembers, would advise on the necessary means to resolve the IAEA's \nconcerns.''\n  This process, if we add up all the days, is a lengthy process. Again, \nit certainly is so far away from the anytime, anywhere inspection \nregime. We have to understand that Iran has a history of using every \nmeans possible to delay inspections, especially to areas that are \nundeclared or they are trying to hide their nuclear facilities. That is \nwhy I describe it as an inspection regime that only a lawyer could love \nbecause this will allow Iran to litigate access to their undeclared \nsites, and we already know they have a history of doing that.\n  One of the issues I have taken a keen interest in since I have been \nin the Senate is Iran's missile program. We have heard all along from \nthe administration that they were not going to address Iran's support \nof terrorism, that they were going to keep that issue separate--that \nthey were going to keep separate issues of Iran's support for terrorism \naround the world--we have heard about that in this debate today--their \nsupport for groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, their support for the Houthis \nin Yemen, their support for the Taliban in Afghanistan, their support \nfor terrorism around the world. Yet at the last minute in this \nagreement, the administration conceded two incredibly important points: \nNo. 1, allowing Iran to have the resolutions lifted on having arms \nsales and transactions within 5 years, and then, No. 2, within 8 years, \nlifting the U.N. resolutions on missiles or ICBMs.\n  As our own Secretary of Defense has described, the significance of \ncourse in ICBMs is the ``I,'' which means intercontinental, meaning \nmissiles that can hit the United States of America. Yet that was lifted \nat the last minute, and that was lifted over the objections, over the \nrecommendations of our highest military officer, the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, Chairman Martin Dempsey.\n  This has been a focus of mine in the Senate because I have been \nconcerned that we have heard in the Armed Services Committee from many \nof our top defense and intelligence officials that the preferred method \nfor Iran to deliver a nuclear weapon to the United States of America \nwould be an ICBM and that this certainly represents a threat to America \nand to our allies.\n  In fact, I was so concerned about this that last summer I wrote the \nPresident of the United States, and 26 Senators joined me in the letter \nthat I wrote to the President. In that letter, I expressed the belief \nthat the Iranian deal should address Iran's ICBM missile program. The \nreason I wrote and led this effort is because we had been hearing for \nyears before the Senate Armed Services Committee from people such as \nthe Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, who testified \nbefore the committee in February of 2014, that ``we judge that Iran \nwould choose a ballistic missile as its preferred method of delivering \nnuclear weapons.''\n  In 2013, we also heard from Director Clapper that the Iranians are \ndeveloping two systems that could have intercontinental capability as \nearly as 2015. Here we are in 2015. Some have estimated it may take a \nfew more years. Regardless, according to public testimony from our \nintelligence community, Iran could have ICBM capability in the next few \nyears, and here we have, in conjunction with this agreement, our \nblessing because we agreed that the U.N. resolution against their \nmissile program that said, no, Iran, you cannot have ICBM capability, \nnow it is OK. It will be legitimate for them to have ICBM capability.\n\n  Why do they need ICBM capability if they don't have any interest in \ndelivering the most destructive weapons to the world--to countries on \nthe other side of the world, including our own?\n  So as I said, this issue was against the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff's advice. When I heard public reports--there were reports \nbubbling up about the agreement before it was signed that Iran was \npressuring, with support from other countries like Russia, to lift the \narms embargo, to lift the missile embargo. I was so worried about it \nthat a week before the agreement I asked Chairman Dempsey in the Armed \nServices Committee, on July 7, about the reports that these resolutions \nmay be lifted on arms and missiles. He told me that under no \ncircumstances should we relieve pressure on Iran relative to ballistic \nmissile capability and arms trafficking. Yet that is exactly what \nhappens in this agreement.\n  The Chairman came back to our committee after the agreement was \nsigned to testify about the agreement, and I asked him again about \nincluding this in the agreement. He told me it was against his military \nadvice to lift the arms resolution and to lift the missile resolution.\n  So as I look at the grave concerns we should have for our national \nsecurity, this is one of the top concerns--an insufficient inspection \nregime legitimizing their ability to have ICBM capability, allowing \nthem in 5 years to legitimately have more arms. We already know they \nare supplying arms and cash around the world to their terrorist \nproxies. This agreement of course gives them, within a 9-month period, \nbillions of dollars more cash to support terrorism.\n  One of the things I have heard on the floor today from my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle who are supporting this agreement is \nthat somehow this leaves on the table all of the\n\n[[Page S6514]]\n\ntools we need to deal with Iran's support for terrorism--which, of \ncourse, destabilizes the region. Except the problem is that nobody has \ntold the Iranians this point because they have a very different \nviewpoint on this agreement. Iran has taken the position that if any of \nthe sanctions are reimposed, they can walk away from the agreement.\n  If we look at paragraph 26 of this agreement, I would argue the \nlanguage in the agreement actually allows them to make that argument, \nunfortunately.\n  Tehran has specifically stated that it will treat the imposition of \nany sanctions that are similar to those that were in place before this \ndeal as a reason to walk away.\n  So why is this important? It is important because we know they \nsupport terrorism around the world. My colleagues have said we have to \ndeal with their support for terrorism, and we still have the tools in \nour toolbox to issue tough sanctions to deal with their terrorism, even \nwhile being part of this agreement. The problem is that the language \ndoesn't necessarily bear that out in the agreement.\n  In a July 20 letter, Iran told the U.N. Security Council that it \nwould ``reconsider its commitments under the JCPOA if the effects of \nthe termination of the Security Council, European Union, or United \nStates nuclear-related sanctions or restrictive measures are impaired \nby continued application or the imposition of new sanctions with a \nnature and scope identical or similar to those that were in place prior \nto the implementation date, irrespective of whether such new sanctions \nare introduced on nuclear-related or other grounds, unless the issues \nare remedied within a reasonably short time.''\n  In other words, Iran is taking the viewpoint, under the language of \nthis agreement, that if we reimpose any of the sanctions that are \nlifted as part of this agreement--which, by the way, these are the \ntoughest sanctions, right? These are the tools in our toolbox--even if \nthey commit acts of terrorism, they can walk away from this agreement.\n  So let's put this all together. Iran, within 9 months, gets more cash \nfor this agreement. They get to keep their infrastructure for their \nnuclear program because they get to keep their centrifuges. They are \nnow in a position where people are doing business with them--because we \nknow that many countries around the world want to be able to do \nbusiness with Iran, so an infusion of cash and relationships there. And \nthen they are continuing to support terrorism. They commit through \ntheir proxies a major terrorist event that triggers something that we \nwant to do here--we want to take tough sanctions against them because \nthey have supported a terrorist attack against us or our allies. Yet \nthey are going to take the position that we can't reimpose any of their \nsanctions no matter what they do because of the language of the \nagreement in paragraph 26. They are interpreting it that way.\n  So if you are Iran, right now, this is a pretty good deal for you. \nYou can get the cash. You can get the legitimatization. People are \ndoing business with you again. You can continue to support terrorism, \nand our hands apparently, in their view, are tied on sanctions.\n  So when I hear from those supporting the agreement that somehow we \nstill have all the tools in our toolbox to deal with terrorism, it \nseems to me that if we look at the language of this agreement and how \nthe Iranians are supporting it, we have tied our hands, and we will be \nin a weaker position to deal with their support for terrorism around \nthe world no matter how egregious their behavior is.\n  This is a real issue when I think about our national security, when \nthey have the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world and they \nwill now have legitimate access to developing their ICBM program with \nthe lifting of sanctions in the U.N. and the legitimate purchasing of \narms. We know there are countries like Russia that are lining up to \nsell these arms to them, and then we are going to weaken our ability to \nimpose terrorism-related sanctions in the future.\n  I heard many of my colleagues talking earlier about the 60-vote \nthreshold in the United States Senate. When we voted on the Iran \nNuclear Agreement Review Act, we voted on it, I believe, 98 to 1. We \nwould think at that point we wouldn't be worried at all about actually \ngetting to the debate on the actual bill. So I hope my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle, when they voted for the Iran Nuclear \nAgreement Review Act, were serious about having a substantive vote, \ngiven that this was a vote of 98 to 1 on this agreement. I believe the \nAmerican people deserve nothing less than a substantive vote on the \nmerits of this agreement as provided for by the Iran Nuclear Agreement \nReview Act.\n  I know that many of my colleagues are here to speak, but I want to \nraise one final issue that we have heard about on this floor; that is, \nactually being able to see the full text of this agreement. We all know \nthat when you have an agreement, especially with a country that has a \nhistory of cheating, language matters. We know that because the \nIranians are already taking all kinds of different positions on what \nthe language means in this agreement to their benefit. Yet we have not \nbeen given access to the two-side agreements between the IAEA and Iran. \nBy the way, that is in direct violation of the express language of the \nIran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, which says Congress should have \naccess to side agreements. But what we do know about these side \nagreements that has been reported in the press is truly disturbing; \nthat is, as to the side agreements themselves, information has been \nleaked that indicates Tehran could declare some areas as suspected \nnuclear sites, including the Parchin military complex, off-limits to \ninspectors and that Iran could even be permitted to self-inspect there.\n  Can you imagine allowing a country with a history of cheating the \nability to self-inspect or collect their own samples in terms of how \ninspections would be done? Yet those who are supporting the agreement \nare saying this is a robust inspection method.\n  I would ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are \nsupporting this agreement, does it not trouble you that you have not \nbeen given access to the language of these side agreements given that \nwhat has been leaked about them is that they pertain to the actual \ninspection process at important sites such as Parchin? I would hope \nthat our constituents would expect us to review every word of the \nlanguage of something so important to our national security. That, in \nand of itself, I would say, is a reason to be highly skeptical of this \nagreement, along with the other issues I have raised.\n  Finally, we have a long history in this body of debating important \ninternational agreements, including agreements that deal with very \nfundamental issues involving our foreign policy--issues that involve \nnuclear nonproliferation, issues that involve many sensitive treaty \nissues. We have a long history of actually debating these in a \nbipartisan manner and working in a bipartisan manner to approve \nagreements. Yet on this agreement, we are left in a position where a \nmajority of the Senate on a bipartisan basis has said that we have \nserious reservations about this agreement and have declared that we are \ngoing to vote against this agreement. Yet the administration is \ncontinuing to push forward to get this done, to make sure that this \nagreement is fully implemented without reaching out in a bipartisan \nfashion to ensure that the strength of the Congress in a bipartisan \nfashion is behind something so important to our national security.\n  That should say something about the merits of this agreement. This \nagreement is deeply flawed. This is an agreement that I believe does \nnot protect our national security. In fact, in the long run it will \nundermine our security in this country by giving Iran more cash, \nlegitimizing their nuclear weapons program in terms of keeping their \ninfrastructure for that program, legitimizing their ICBM program, and \nhurting our ability to impose further sanctions if they conduct acts of \nterrorism, which they certainly have a history of doing through their \nproxies.\n  I hope as we continue this debate, we will disapprove this agreement, \nwhich I do not believe protects our national security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The Senator from Indiana.\n\n[[Page S6515]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I intend to speak at much greater length on \nthis issue perhaps tomorrow. I am pleased to have the opportunity to \nparticipate in this colloquy. I will be brief. I know my colleagues are \nwaiting to speak also.\n  First, I want to commend Senator Corker, the chairman of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee. Together with his work with Senator \nCardin, we have a bipartisan agreement supported by some of the most \nknowledgeable foreign policy experts on the Democratic side and on the \nRepublican side before us. Had Senator Corker not been able to make \nthat arrangement, it would have been a done deal before the Congress \neven saw what was agreed to in this negotiation with Iran.\n  I think my colleagues here have been amazed at the difference between \nwhat we were told the agreement did and didn't do and what we actually \nlearned it does and doesn't do as we pored over it, word by word, annex \nthrough annex, looking at every piece of information here that is \nrelevant to our decision. I am thankful for the work of Senator Corker, \nwho has taken some heat for not doing more. He saved us and saved the \nAmerican people from not having the ability for us to examine this in \ndetail. That is what this debate here is all about. The American people \ndeserve to know what is in this agreement. The consequences of this for \nthe future of America, for the future of the world are significant and \nalmost mind-boggling. We have to get it right. To get it right, we need \nto read every word.\n  Here I am, shortly after the delivery of the 157 pages, together with \nthe annexes, over a weekend poring through each sentence, trying to \nunderstand exactly what we have here and what we are dealing with, and \nI am amazed at what I have come up with. Instead of going through the \nvarious items--I will talk about more about this tomorrow, and it has \nbeen well presented by my colleague from New Hampshire and others this \nafternoon, including the majority leader--I would like to discuss \nsomething that I don't think has been raised yet. That something is the \nambiguity that exists throughout this agreement and particularly in the \nannexes to the agreement. We know that there are two secret agreements \nwhich we don't have access to. How anyone can go forward and support an \narrangement when you have side secret agreements and you are not \nallowed to know what they are--that in and of itself should be reason \nnot to support an agreement. But having said that, let me spend a \nlittle bit of time regarding these ambiguities and the vagueness of \nsome of the language here that I think have major implications.\n  The annex uses familiar forms of mushy language. I am going to quote \nhere: ``as determined,'' ``where appropriate,'' ``among others,'' ``as \nmutually determined,'' and ``when beneficial.'' What are the actual \nobligations that we are undertaking if we vote for this agreement that \nis full of words like that? This is not clear to me, nor would I think \nit is clear to anyone in the administration.\n  We questioned the administration on this issue. They have essentially \nsaid: Well, this is to be determined at a later date or if this issue \ncomes up, we will try to get some consensus on how to go forward. My \nown conclusion is that this language is not a mistake. These people who \nnegotiated on our benefit have had a lifetime of negotiating \nengagement. I assume many of them were attorneys, lawyers that know and \nunderstand that a definition of a word or a phrase is everything. You \nhave to understand exactly what it is or you are going to end up with \nconfusion.\n  These ambiguous obligations, I think, were purposefully designed to \nplacate the Iranians, offering them a vision of a robust military \nnuclear infrastructure, developed not only with the acquiescence of the \nWest but with our material assistance. Further, if we examine the \nagreement text--let alone the annex text--this same pattern with \nmisleading ambiguity holds. In many of the detailed commitments that \nare specified in the agreement and the annexes available to us, these \nconditional ambiguous terms dominate.\n  I couldn't help but notice that this wasn't an occasional occurrence. \nI asked my staff to go through and look at some of these ambiguous \ndefinitions and count the number of them. The phrase ``as appropriate'' \nor ``where appropriate''--``achieving this as appropriate'' or \n``obligated to this as appropriate'' or ``where appropriate''--was \nsprinkled throughout the text 34 times. ``As mutually determined'' or \n``by consensus to be concluded'' occurred 28 times, implying that \nfuture agreements or conditional commitments are there as against \ncurrent commitments. At the same time, the phrase ``Iran intends to'' \noccurs more frequently than it should in place of affirmative \nobligations.\n  To any lawyer representing a client, whether you are buying a house, \nleasing a car, leasing an apartment or entering into a business \ncontract, you can go to that lawyer and basically say: Look, I want an \nout. Or if you are on the other end of the negotiating process, you can \nsay: Put some ambiguous vague language in there--``to be determined,'' \n``as appropriate,'' ``by consensus''--so that if something goes wrong \nhere, I have an excuse to opt out.\n  I think that is exactly what Iran was trying to do. If we come up \nwith what we think is a breach of the agreement, it is easy for Iran to \nsay: That needs to be by consensus; and without consensus, we see that \nas saying such and such, and you see it wrong. If we press the case \nwith Iran, that, of course, gives them the option of withdrawing from \nthe agreement. At an important time, now having over $100 billion in \ntheir hands, now having signed up contracts with many nations around \nthe world--long-term contracts for delivery of oil, minerals or \nwhatever--now having put themselves in a much different position with \nthe sanctions lifted, they may use that exact language as a means of \nescaping. Or if you turn it on its head and turn it the other way \naround, Iran says: Well, wait a minute; our intentions are such and \nsuch. You didn't understand what we were trying to say to you.\n  Then how are we going to respond? This puts us in a very tenuous \nposition.\n  I can recall a number of times when I told my wife: I thought you \nwere going to stop and pick up milk on the way home.\n  Well, I intended to do that, but I got a phone call.\n  Wait a minute. I thought you were going to clean the garage on \nSaturday.\n  I intended to do that, but Joe called and said: Let's go play golf.\n  I intended. It was a good intention. That is fine in any kind of a \nmarital relationship or any other kind of relationship. Many of those \nare just meaningless things. But when you are talking about an \nagreement that binds the United States on the basis of how its \nnegotiating adversary interprets and uses these words, it can put you \nin real trouble.\n  I don't think anybody has talked about that yet. I wanted to bring \nthat up. As I said, I am going to be talking about my position and how \nI came to the decision not to support this tomorrow. This is a sloppily \nwritten agreement that can bind the United States to obligations that \nwe are not even yet aware of and that can give Iran an out if it so \nchooses. It comes to that point in time when, with a 3-month or so \nbreakout toward having nuclear weapon capability, they simply say: \nSanctions are gone, we have our money, we have done the research, even \nsome with assistance of U.S. scientists and the members of the \nnegotiating team, we are in a great position to go forward, and we are \njust going to do it. We can use this language to opt-out of the \nagreement. That is just one more reason why each of us should carefully \ntry to understand what is and what isn't in this agreement and weigh \nthis as we try to make a judgment in terms of whether we should go \nforward or whether we have signed on to a very bad deal here and should \nvote against it.\n\n  With that, I yield to my colleagues who have been patiently waiting \nto speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment and recap \nthe day and some of the issues I heard on the floor. I have been on the \nfloor quite a bit today and heard a lot of the debate. As I processed \nthrough some of the debate, I heard--and we will see if some of my \ncolleagues agree with this--a lot of conversation on the details of the \nagreement in trying to\n\n[[Page S6516]]\n\nwalk through the actual process. What does the text say? There seem to \nbe two very different opinions about this. I will share what I am \nhearing.\n  There are key things that Iran needs to be able to complete a nuclear \nweapon, and it doesn't seem that this agreement stops them in the \nprocess, and it seems that the goal of this agreement was to stop them \nfrom acquiring a nuclear weapon.\n  What does Iran need? Well, they need time. This agreement gives them \ntime. It lays out a schedule, backs up and slows down the process of \ninspections. It allows them time to be able to finish their research.\n  It allows them money. That is a key aspect that they need not only \nfor their funding of terrorism but to actually be able to complete the \ntechnological research they have to have in those facilities. Billions \nof dollars are released to Iran almost immediately in this agreement \nfor them to be able to complete their research.\n  It allows them ballistic missile capability, which is shocking to a \nlot of people I talked to in my State. They assume this deal actually \nslows down their ballistic missile research and capability. It actually \ndoesn't. It actually paves the path for them and gives them permission \nto continue their ballistic missile research.\n  It allows them to be able to continue toward highly enriched uranium. \nAgain, a lot of people I talked to have been surprised at that because \nthe assumption was, after hearing about it from the President so many \ntimes, they shouldn't be allowed to have uranium and shouldn't be \nallowed to do that. That was the conversation 5 years ago, but now the \nconversation is, how much uranium can they enrich and what does that \nlook like?\n  There have been some conversations today by individuals who have said \nthat this will decrease the number of centrifuges they have. That is \nentirely correct. It does decrease the number of centrifuges, but let \nme give an illustration. If your company had 20 computers that were \nbuilt in 1995 and you were told you could replace those 20 computers \nfrom 1995 with 3 computers from this year, would you take that deal? I \nbet you would. That is the deal we are giving to Iran. We are telling \nthem they will have to get rid of two-thirds of their oldest \ncentrifuges--their oldest, originally built--but they can still keep \n5,000 of even their oldest centrifuges and they can install 1,000 of \ntheir newest technology centrifuges and keep those going. I would \ncertainly think that is a deal they would take--and by the way, they \nare taking it, and they are asking us to take it as well.\n  They have time, they have money, they have ballistic missile \nresearch, they have highly enriched uranium and the permission to be \nable to continue their work on their most advanced centrifuges, and \nthey have additional defensive capabilities. They are allowed to \ncontinue to stockpile conventional weapons under this agreement and to \neven add things such as surface-to-air defense capabilities to be able \nto defend their military sites.\n  So you tell me, does Iran have what it needs to be able to complete a \nnuclear weapon under this deal--time, money, ballistic missiles, \nability to be able to complete their research, advanced centrifuges, \nand defensive weaponry to be able to put around their facilities? Yes.\n  Here are some of the things which we don't know, which we really \ncan't discuss, and which we would appreciate being able to discuss \ntoday--the side deals. We have the documents that have come in. In \nfact, I have posted them on my Web site, and many others have done the \nsame. We want Americans to be able to read those things because most \nAmericans, when they read them, are stunned with what this agreement \nsays. But what we can't get is the side deal.\n  Again, I have heard over and over from the President that we are not \ngoing to trust Iran, we are going to verify. We don't trust, we are \ngoing to verify. Literally, with the side agreements--people keep \nhearing ``What is the side agreement?'' Here is what the side agreement \nis. The main agreement gives broad parameters. For instance, it says we \nwill have inspections. Well, that is great. How are the inspections to \nbe done? Well, that is in the side agreement. So we are agreeing that, \nyes, there will be inspections. When we asked the question about how \nthe inspections were to be done, we were told that we can't read that \ndocument, that it is a separate agreement between the U.N. and Iran. \nLiterally I cannot verify how we are going to verify. I have been told \nto trust and verify. I can't verify how we are verifying. That seems \nabsurd to me, and it is hard for me to imagine anyone in this body \nwould say: Yes, I would sign off on something I have never read and \nhave never seen. In fact, the people in the administration have said \nthey have never read or seen it. Yet we are being asked to sign off on \nit and to give our authorization to say: Yes, we will support that. I \nhave a problem with that, and it is one of many reasons why I cannot \nsupport this deal.\n\n  What I have heard over and over again by individuals who do support \nthis deal today is that this is the deal, it is in front of us, the \nPresident has agreed to it, and it will look bad if we don't agree to \nit. My problem is not looking bad; my problem is a nuclear-armed Iran. \nThat is the problem. At the end of the day, this is not about saving \nface as America, this is about protecting U.S. interests and U.S. \ncitizens and those of our friends in the gulf. This is not about saving \nface for the President.\n  I have heard over and over again: It would be too hard to get the \ncoalition back together to be able to renegotiate this. May I remind \neveryone that the reason we have this coalition together is because the \ncrippling sanctions are one thing--you cannot do business with America \nand with Iran. That is the deal. If we continue the sanctions in place, \nit is not about getting the band back together, it is about leaving \nthose sanctions in place, and if you want to do business with the \nUnited States, you will also have to agree to not do business with \nIran. It is not about getting everyone back together. Leave them in \nplace and let's finish renegotiating it.\n  I have heard over and over again: It is either war or it is this. \nQuite frankly, I think this deal in its place takes us closer to a \nconventional war. Why? Because it allows Iran to begin to almost \nimmediately begin stockpiling conventional weapons. Those in the gulf \nregion are so concerned about that that we are promising them they can \nget more weapons and buy more advanced weapons from us. How does a \nconventional arms race in the Middle East take us further from war? \nUnder this agreement, it destabilizes.\n  I have heard over and over again today: What is our message to the \nworld when the rest of the world has signed off on this and yet we say \nno? Well, here is our message to the world: Iran is screaming ``Death \nto America,'' not death to other countries, except for Israel. They are \nchanting ``Death to Israel.'' Israel is also standing up and saying: \nThis is a terrible deal for our nation and the stability of the world.\n  It is not about our message to the world; it is about standing up and \nbeing the world's superpower. That is who we are. Let's take \nresponsibility for our position in the world and be able to finish well \nwhile we are doing it.\n  I have also heard multiple times today: Well, let's sign off on this \ndeal and then we will have tougher diplomacy in the future. I have to \nsay that every time I heard that, I smiled and thought, are you kidding \nme? What do you mean, we will sign off on this deal and then we will do \ntougher diplomacy in the future? With what leverage? This is our \nleverage. The sanctions are the leverage. We are not going to get \ntougher in the future. This is the toughest moment. It gets softer from \nhere.\n  Iran is still the single largest sponsor of terrorism in the world. \nThey made no change in their actions against Yemen and leading the coup \nin Yemen. They made no change in their actions propping up Assad in \nSyria.\n  We are giving this away if we sign on to this agreement. This deal is \nbuilt on hope, not on facts and trust, and I know everyone in this body \nhopes to get a diplomatic solution. We cannot base an agreement with \nIran on hope. If we cannot verify it, if we cannot see the documents, \nif there has been no change in behavior, I think we should assume we \nstill have status quo Iran.\n  Let's push back. Let's get the better deal. Let's not allow advanced \ncentrifuges to stay in place. Let's not\n\n[[Page S6517]]\n\nallow them to continue their ballistic missile testing. These are not \nhard issues to be able to finish. The deal is half-cooked. Let's get it \nfully baked, and let's finish a diplomatic solution but not just hope \nthat this works out in the days ahead.\n  With that, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I rise tonight to speak about a very \ntroubled time in my life and in this body. I didn't think this moment \nwould arise in my tenure here in the U.S. Senate, but tonight I am very \ntroubled about being a Member of this body.\n  Just a few short months ago, we told the American people, in our \nForeign Relations Committee, that we could work together. We \nunanimously passed a bill that gave this body, the U.S. Congress, a \nright that the President and his administration had denied us by not \nallowing this to be treated as a treaty. Yet we stand here tonight--\neven though a unanimous bill came out of the committee and 98 Senators \nvoted for us to get a look and a vote on this deal--without the ability \nto tell the people back home that we will, in fact, have a vote on this \ndeal. I find that terribly troubling. As a matter of fact, I am \nembarrassed. The people back home deserve better than this body is \nproviding.\n  There is bipartisan opposition to this deal. There are good Democrats \nwho in their deep conscience are going to oppose the President, and I \nrespect that, but there is not bipartisan support for this deal. There \nis a huge difference. Only one group in this body is supporting this \nPresident's deal with Iran. I am troubled by that.\n  I applaud Senator Cardin, the ranking member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. I applaud Senator Corker as the chairman of that committee. \nUnder their leadership, we got to this point. Without this deal, \nwithout a vote, we wouldn't even be sitting here tonight. We would \nalready be implementing this deal, and we would have told the American \npeople: Yes, we don't have the constitutional balance between the \nUnited States and the House of Representatives and the legislative \nbranch that the Constitution calls for. We gave up.\n  Well, here we are. I would like for every Member of this body who is \ngoing to vote for this deal to answer to the people back home: How does \nthis make the world safer for their children and their children's \nchildren?\n  In the Presiding Officer's business career and in my business career, \nwe have seen a lot of deals and we have negotiated a lot of deals. The \nway I look at deals is to try to evaluate what both sides get in a \ndeal. So let's look at this from that perspective.\n  First of all, Iran gets a windfall for bad behavior. They have 30 \nyears of noncompliance with NPT requirements, and the first thing we \nare going to do is give them a windfall--somewhere between $60 and $150 \nbillion.\n  We know by the administration's own admission that we can depend on \nsome of that money--last year $6 billion went to terrorist support \naround the Middle East and other parts of the world from Iran. Last \nyear Iran spent $17 billion supporting their own military. That puts \nthis windfall into perspective. One of the first things Iran did when \nthe administration announced this deal is they sent representatives to \nMoscow. Does it take much imagination to see that their behavior is not \ngoing to change in this deal just because we give them a windfall? As a \nmatter of fact, we are encouraging bad behavior.\n  Second, I would like to know where our four American hostages are. \nThey get to keep them.\n  Third, Iran gets to enrich. This is my biggest problem, and I have \nsaid it many times. My biggest problem with this deal is that we gave \nup the ability right off the bat to stop Iran from enriching. To me, \nthat is the fundamental problem in this deal. Breakout without \nenriching capabilities is 2 to 3 years, not 2 to 3 months like this \ndeal provides. As a matter of fact, the President himself said this \ndeal, after 13 years, allows Iran to have a breakout period that is \nbasically zero. Who are we kidding here? And after 15 years, all bets \nare off. What we have done is provided a pathway to enriched uranium, \nand I find that very troubling.\n  Unlike many other countries that have similar nuclear programs that \nare peaceful and are not allowed to enrich, we allowed this bad actor \nto step up and be treated the same as countries such as Germany, Japan, \nHolland, Brazil, and Argentina. I find that very troubling.\n  Fourth, they get access to the world's arms market in just 5 short \nyears. Why is that important? It is important because of their support \nof terrorism, but also, more importantly, it gives them access to a \nnuclear weapons capability through technology available only through \nthe arms market.\n  Fifth, after 8 short years, they get access to the intercontinental \nballistic missiles technology. Why in the world does a rogue nation \nlike Iran that says they only want a civil nuclear program for power \ngeneration--why in the world in the eleventh hour do this \nadministration and our negotiators give up and give them the right to \nhave access, after 8 short years, to ballistic missile technology? They \ncurrently have a missile that has a 1,200-mile range. That very easily \nbrings Israel and Eastern Europe into range. If they have access in 8 \nyears to ballistic missile technology, their only intent can be to have \na missile that can deliver a missile armed with a nuclear warhead to \nWashington, DC, and points beyond. I find that very troubling.\n\n  Sixth, Iran gets access to technology for centrifuges. This is almost \nthe most unbelievable thing. Not only do they get to keep every \ncentrifuge, they are not destroying every centrifuge; they don't have \nto destroy any one. But I agree with what Senator Lankford just said, \nand that is this: They have antiques right now. What we are allowing \nthem to do is to trade up to modern technology, and IR-6 and IR-8 \ncentrifuges. There is only one reason for that. It shortens the time \nfor them to develop enough fissile material to have a nuclear weapon.\n  Seventh, Iran gets to limit and delay inspectors. This is only \nimportant because we allow them to enrich; don't miss that. But what we \nhave done is allow them to dictate the inspection protocol. I have \nnever seen a deal where that was allowed, honest to goodness. This to \nme is unconscionable. The fact that we have secret deals, yes, this is \nimportant, but the fact that we are allowing them--with no U.S. \nparticipation, by the way, on the ground in Iran with the IAEA--we are \nallowing Iran to actually take samples under the protocol of \ninspection.\n  The side deals are unconscionable. I would never in business sign a \ndeal where every legal document was not exposed. How in the world--I \nunderstand these side agreements are normal operating procedure within \nthe IAEA and their countries that they are inspecting. This is \ndifferent. This is a public global deal, dealing with a rogue country \nsuch as Iran, and we need to see that. I can't imagine how we would \napprove a deal--anybody would approve a deal and go home and explain to \ntheir constituents how this makes sense for the safety of their \nchildren and grandchildren when we don't know what is in every legal \ndocument.\n  Now, what did we get? I would argue that basically, from what I hear, \nthe No. 1 goal of this administration is a legacy for this failed \nPresident. I am sorry, but that is the only real benefit I can see. We \nget Iran, the world's largest sponsor of terrorism and proven violator \nof past nuclear agreements to promise to be a good actor. Really? That \nis what we get? Yet, the Ayatollah just today--just today--said that \nIsrael will not exist in 25 years. This does not sound to me like a \ngood actor who is going to change their behavior because we have \nbrought them into the community of nations.\n  Why do we believe the word of a nation that has been a revolutionary \npariah since 1979? Have we forgotten that 52 United States American \ncitizens, members of our embassy, for 444 days were held hostage in \nTehran just 35 short years ago? This is the same regime, these are the \nsame clerics, the same mentality, that created that situation. We just \nnow have entered into the most devastating foreign policy agreement in \nmy lifetime and maybe in the history of the United States. No deal that \nI can read in history puts the United States in more jeopardy going \nforward than this nuclear deal with Iran.\n  Under this deal, we get an Iran that will continue its bad behavior. \nI think that is easy to predict. Their sponsorship of terror continues. \nTheir human\n\n[[Page S6518]]\n\nrights violations have worsened. Even during the negotiations, they \ncontinued to back Assad's murderous regime in Syria, which is the \nsource of one of the most devastating humanitarian crises of the 21st \ncentury that is just now coming to light.\n  The Presiding Officer and I made a trip, along with the leader, just \na few months ago. We sat in Jordan and we listened to the plea of those \npeople over there who are receiving refugees. They are telling us how \nserious this plight is. Now the media has picked up on it, and we see \nthe devastating impact of what is going on in the Middle East. This \ndeal is a manifestation of a much bigger problem.\n  This President has failed in this foreign policy requirement that the \nexecutive branch is given in our Constitution. This is just a \nmanifestation of a bigger failure, but it is devastating to the future \nsecurity of our kids. Today, Iran has a national holiday called Death \nto America Day. As a matter of fact, one of the hostages, one of the \nfour hostages just this year, earlier this year, was moved from the \nsecond worst prison in Iran to the worst prison in Iran, and guess what \nday he was moved on? Death to America Day. I find that insulting.\n  As we just heard, there are three things--I have a little different \nview of what a country needs to have a nuclear weapon. First of all, I \nam an engineer, so this will be very pedantic, and I will move very \nquickly with this. But, quickly, a country needs three things. First of \nall, they have to have fissile material. We allow this in this deal. \nThere is a pathway for them to get there legally. They don't have to \nviolate this agreement. They will eventually get there in a very short \nperiod of time.\n  The second thing is they have to have a device for a warhead. In five \nshort years they have access to the military arms community where that \nis totally accessible today.\n  Third, they have to have a delivery mechanism. In eight short years, \nas we just said, they will have access to intercontinental ballistic \nmissile technology. Basically, in eight years, if they want to break \nout, they will have missile technology that can bring a missile warhead \nright down on our heads here in this chamber.\n  Without domestic enrichment, Iran's breakout period is really 2 to 3 \nyears, again, not 2 to 3 months. President Obama has claimed that we \ncould not get a deal without giving them the right to enrich. I don't \nunderstand that. This brought them to the table in the first place. We \ngave up on that too early. The President gave us a false choice, and I \nam insulted by that, and people back home are too. It is either this \ndeal--and everybody agrees this is a bad deal; even the Democrats today \nare telling us how flawed this deal is. I didn't hear one person today \nstand up and tell us how great this deal was. Basically, I heard this \nis the best deal we can get. Let's give it a try. We can't be any worse \noff in 10 years. I would argue yes, we can, and yes, we will be worse \noff in 10 years.\n\n  It is absolutely possible to have a better deal. We don't need P5+1 \nif, in fact, we have the determination to make our own sanctions stick. \nThis $18 trillion economy is big enough to bring them back to the table \nand absolutely get the kind of deal that would protect our kids and \ngrandkids.\n  In previous deals with South Africa and Libya, just as two examples, \nthey gave up their enriching capabilities in order to be accepted into \nthe NPT fraternity of countries that are good actors regarding \nproliferation of nuclear technology. This deal not only allows Iran to \nenrich but it gives their illicit nuclear enrichment program the \nblessing of the international community. The President and the \nnegotiators even threw in technical assistance for Iran's enrichment \nprogram. I just don't understand that. As a dumb business guy, I just \ndon't understand how they, in good conscience and without smirking, can \nstand in front of the American people and say this is a good deal. In \nfact, I don't hear many people saying that. Even Secretary Kerry \nbasically said this is the best deal we can get, we can't get a better \ndeal, and the only alternative is war. I am insulted by that.\n  The second thing, they need to design for a warhead. We talked about \nhow getting into the arms community allows them to do that. We don't \nknow whether they have it or not today. Iran would need many things, \nbut one thing they need is access to capital and access to global \nmarkets to drive their economy. But let's remember one thing: Why do \nthey need all of this in the first place? Why did this get negotiated? \nBecause they want a nuclear weapon.\n  The goal in this agreement, according to the administration, was \nnever to allow Iran to become a nuclear weapons State. Yet, we see \nnothing but pathways that allow them to do that, even legally. I just \ndon't understand how the administration and a few Democrats are \nstanding up today and saying this is a good deal, and we need to vote \nfor it because it won't preclude Iran from ever becoming a nuclear \nweapons State. It just doesn't do that.\n  As a matter of fact, in 1994, we signed a similar deal with North \nKorea. The President at that time, President Clinton, told the American \npeople that if we voted on that deal, that deal would guarantee we \nwould never have a nuclear weapon on the peninsula of Korea. How did \nthat work out for us? I would argue today that we are facing a similar \nsituation that is just as predictable. Looking at the facts, we can see \nthis deal all but guarantees a nuclear Iran. I can't support this in \ngood conscience.\n  This is one of the worst deals I have seen in my lifetime. I am \nembarrassed that we sit here in front of the American people and \nactually have to discuss this. This is so bad, it is so threatening to \nour children and our children's children that we have to stand up and \nwe have to fight this all the way through to get a vote on it, first of \nall, and to defeat this.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me tonight and this week in opposing \nthis deal.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

For the information of all colleagues, this cloture \nmotion would ripen on Friday, but I am optimistic that we will be able \nto get consent to have the vote tomorrow afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Georgia, and I certainly associate myself with them.\n  This debate is vital. Despite President Obama's initial objections to \ncongressional oversight, the American\n\n[[Page S6519]]\n\npeople deserve a vote in this critical national security matter, which \nI would note has been negotiated behind closed doors.\n  The bill that we passed in May accomplished that. Now the Senate \nDemocrats are talking about taking that away by filibustering this \ndebate.\n  How we went from passing Senator Corker's bill by a vote of 98 to 1 \njust a few months ago to a potential filibuster is baffling to the \nAmerican people. Our constituents want this debate. They have a number \nof concerns about this deal. We are their voice. We are here to \nrepresent them, not to protect the President from a difficult veto.\n  When these discussions began, President Obama claimed we would be \nable to diplomatically dismantle Iran's nuclear program. The final \nagreement suggests this is far from the case. It is apparent that the \nPresident and his negotiating partners were willing--eager, even--to \ngive in to every demand made by the world's largest State sponsor of \nterrorism. The goalposts were moved from dismantling Iran's clandestine \nnuclear weapons program to blindly hoping we can contain it.\n  The deal President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry have \norchestrated has several key faults. For starters, under the deal, Iran \nis not required to destroy a single centrifuge, not one. That means \nwell over 1,000 centrifuges will remain in place at Fordow, one of \nIran's most infamous nuclear sites. Many will continue to operate. This \nis no ordinary facility; it is a fortified, underground military bunker \nbuilt into the side of a mountain. It was constructed in secret, and it \nhas served only one purpose: to covertly produce weapons-grade, highly \nenriched uranium.\n  When the talks began, the President was adamant that Fordow must be \nclosed as part of the final agreement. However, over the course of the \nnegotiations, the President caved. The Iranians will be able to \nmaintain the capacity to continue enrichment activities at Fordow.\n  The President claims that verification will ensure Iran's compliance. \nVerification appears to be exactly where this deal is lacking any \npunch. There is nothing in this deal that lets us confidently say we \nknow what is truly going on at any of the nuclear sites in Iran.\n  There are no anytime, anywhere inspections, including at Fordow. Even \nworse, international inspectors will not even be the ones handling the \ninspections at the country's military complex in Parchin. The Iranians \nthemselves will be. How this is acceptable to anyone is astonishing. \nThere is absolutely no reason, given the regime's history, to believe \nthat the Iranian inspectors will be honest about what is going on in \nParchin.\n  A lack of verification is far from the only troubling aspect of this \nagreement. The Iranian regime believes that the agreement gives them \nfull, permanent relief from sanctions.\n  Lifting sanctions will provide Iran with approximately $100 billion \nin previously frozen assets which the administration has ultimately \nadmitted will go, at least in part, to the Iranian military and its \nterrorist offshoots. It was hard enough to get the international \ncommunity to commit to sanctions in the first place. With a reprieve of \nthis nature, we will never be able to reestablish them should Iran not \nlive up to its end of the agreement, which is a strong possibility \ngiven the Iranian regime's actions in the past.\n\n  Along with sanctions relief, the international arms embargo and ban \non ballistic missile research will also be lifted. Within the next 8 \nyears, Iran will have access to modern offensive weapons. This does not \nbode well for peace in the region. It puts our security and that of our \nallies at great risk. Remember, we are talking about the world's \nleading state sponsor of terror.\n  What we are giving up as a result of this deal, the sanctions relief, \nthe arms embargo, the ongoing enrichment, makes the world a more \ndangerous place. We have a responsibility to ensure that Iran never \nachieves its goal of becoming a nuclear power. If Iran goes nuclear, \nSaudi Arabia and other nations in the region surely will follow. The \ndeal gives us little confidence that we will be successful in this \nregard.\n  A nuclear Iran could be devastating for America and our allies. This \nis about saving our children and grandchildren from the prospects of \nnuclear war. I cannot confidently say this agreement will accomplish \nthis goal. In fact, I fear it moves us in the wrong direction. For that \nreason, I oppose the deal and intend to support the resolution of \ndisapproval.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, as we come together and debate President \nObama's agreement on Iran, I believe it is one of the most \nconsequential national security decisions we may ever face. I have \nheard my peers talk many times about the things that trouble them, the \nthings they fear, the ``things that keep us up at night.'' I will tell \nyou that this nuclear agreement is one of those things that keeps me up \nat night, as a mother, as a grandmother, and as a soldier.\n  Having proudly worn our Nation's uniform for over 20 years and having \ndeployed to the region, I can tell you that protecting and defending \nthis country is something I take very seriously and very personally. I \nhad hoped our President would approach the American people with a deal \nthat reflected the high ground our Nation has stood on against Iran for \ndecades.\n  Unfortunately, now that I have seen the available details, I believe \nthe President has not negotiated a good deal with Iran. The agreement \nbefore us fails to dismantle Iran's nuclear program and does not end \nIran's support of terrorism. The President has squandered his \nopportunity to enhance our national security and the security of our \nIsraeli and Arab allies by failing to live up to his own goal of ending \nIran's capability to build a nuclear weapon.\n  The administration is asking the American people to accept a deal \nwhich will, at best, freeze Iran's nuclear program for 8 years--that \nis, if the Iranians actually live up to their end of the bargain. One \nof the major failures in this deal is the lack of anytime, anywhere \ninspections to ensure that they do. In April, the President's own \nSecretary of Energy, Dr. Moniz, a nuclear physicist whom the President \noften refers to as a leading authority on nuclear programs. He said: \n``We expect to have anywhere, anytime access'' when referring to what \nour country needed to ensure Iran was abiding by a nuclear agreement.\n  How can we ever be certain of compliance if Iran decides to cheat and \nwe have a weak inspection regime as part of this deal? I would argue \nthat we can't. Another part of this debate that has been very troubling \nto me is that the President continues to tell the American people there \nare only two options: his agreement or war. During one of his major \nspeeches on this deal, he actually mentioned the word ``war'' 50 times \nin an attempt to hammer this false choice home.\n  Despite this misinformation campaign designed to pressure the \nAmerican people into agreeing to a bad deal, our military leaders and \ndistinguished former administration officials clearly denied that our \nchoice is either support the deal or go to war with Iran. In testimony \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee, Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff GEN Martin Dempsey disagreed with the President's \nassessment that the American people face a choice of supporting the \nagreement or going to war with Iran.\n  Later that same week, the President's pick to lead the U.S. Navy said \nwar was not the only alternative and that we need to use the full set \nof capabilities that the joint force and the Navy can deliver to deter \nthat. The military contribution is also just a subset of a whole-of-\ngovernment approach, along with our allies in the region. It is not \njust leaders within our military saying this.\n  Gen. Michael Hayden, former Director of the CIA and NSA, said:\n\n       There is no necessity to go to war if we don't sign this \n     agreement. There are actions in between those two extremes.\n\n  Dr. Richard Haas, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, \nsaid: ``I would echo that'' during the same hearing. Ambassador \nEdelman, a former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy and Ambassador \nto Turkey, said: ``I agree with you, I don't think those are the only \nalternatives.'' Ambassador Nicholas Burns, a former top U.S. negotiator \nwith Iran on its nuclear programs and former Under Secretary of State \nfor Political Affairs, said: ``I don't believe that war would be \ninevitable. . . .''\n\n[[Page S6520]]\n\n  Rather than misrepresenting the facts and our country's options, I \nchallenge the supporters of the agreement to explain to the American \npeople why they are supporting a flawed and bad deal today, when we \nshould be putting our citizens' interests and their security first. I \nwould also note that this administration was willing to leave the \nnegotiating table without securing an end to Iran's support of \nterrorism.\n  Iran is the world's leading sponsor of terror. We are giving them a \nfree pass in this deal to continue those efforts. In addition to the \nbillions of dollars in sanctions relief, which leaves Iran poised to \ndouble down on its support of terrorism, the President also agreed to \nlift the U.N. arms embargo for advanced conventional weapons and \nballistic missiles.\n  As a veteran of Kuwait and Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom, I am beside myself, as are many other Americans who served in \nIraq, regarding the President's support for sanctions relief for one \nterrorist in particular: the leader of Iran's elite covert force, the \nQuds Force, General Qassem Soleimani.\n  General Soleimani is directly responsible for the deaths of several \nhundred Americans and the wounding of thousands more during the Iraq \nwar. Throughout the Iraq war, we lost many Americans, killed in action, \nand many more wounded by Iraq Shia militia who were supported or \ncontrolled by General Soleimani. In 2010, Ambassador James Jeffrey, \nthen-U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, said: ``Up to a quarter of the American \ncasualties and some of the more horrific incidents in which Americans \nwere kidnapped . . . can be traced without doubt to these Iranian \ngroups.''\n  One of the significant tolls to attack American servicemembers was an \nimprovised explosive device, IED, known as an explosively formed \npenetrator or EFP. These EFPs were provided by Iran exclusively to \ngroups they controlled in order to kill Americans.\n  If you ask American servicemembers who served in Iraq during the war, \nthey will tell you these types of IEDs used by Iranian-supported Shia \nmilitias were some of the most deadly and devastating types emplaced by \nany of the Iraqi insurgency groups, including Al Qaeda in Iraq. While \nmany of my colleagues share the concern regarding General Soleimani and \nIran's targeting of Americans during the Iraq war, we seldom hear from \nAmericans who have firsthand experience in fighting these Iranian-\nsupported Iraqi Shia militias.\n  My staff recently spoke to a currently serving U.S. Army officer, \noriginally from Waterloo, IA, who deployed with the 1st Calvary \nDivision on a 15-month deployment to Iraq during the surge. This Iowan \ndescribed to us the impact Iran's effort in Iraq had on him and his \ntank platoon in Baghdad saying:\n\n       The threat of EFPs was quite real during our deployment to \n     Iraq. Understanding the pipeline from Iran into Iraq, the \n     abundance of the munitions and the lethality on US Forces, \n     the sense of peril never left our psyche. While I was never \n     fearful of losing a limb, I knew if I was struck, I would \n     follow certain death, one that I welcomed ten months into a \n     fifteen month deployment.\n\n  Removing sanctions on Soleimani is an embarrassment for this \nadministration and in the words of some of our Iraq veterans, ``a slap \nin the face.'' Then there is Luke, a retired Army servicemember with \nthe storied 101st Airborne Division. While on patrol during the \ndivision's second tour to Iraq, Luke lost his leg in combat, after his \nvehicle was hit with an Iranian-made EFP.\n  He told us that ``we come home blown up and try to put our lives back \ntogether only to hear that our country is going to be lifting sanctions \nthat will free up billions for Iran to kill more innocents. We may not \nbe at war with them, but they're at war with us. I'm a wounded veteran \nand I spend a great deal of time helping other guys like me. I can \nassure you that this deal directly affects us. It is a slap in the face \nto all veterans. All those who served. . . .''\n  We owe it to veterans and our current servicemembers who have \nsacrificed to stop Iran's support of terror. I urge the President and \nmy colleagues to consider Iran's true intent and not to underestimate \nIran's will to enhance its capability to destabilize the Middle East, \nthreaten American security, and the security of our allies in the \nregion and around the globe.\n  In closing, the decision we make on this agreement will have lasting \nresults for our Nation, the world, and future generations of Americans.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to reject the President's bad deal and \nput the security of the American people, our allies, and the global \ncommunity first.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, we are here today to engage in an honest and \nopen debate about the nuclear agreement that the administration has \nbrokered with Iran.\n  Let me at this point commend Chairman Corker for the way he and his \ncommittee have handled a very difficult process that has not been \ncoordinated with the administration, where their consideration was for \nCongress to be cut out. I think Chairman Corker has done a wonderful \njob and inserted the Senate of the United States where it should be, as \npart of this agreement.\n  I am here to tell you that this deal is not based on absolute value, \nabsolute knowledge of Iran's activities or its intentions--including \nits nuclear ambitions--but it is naively and dangerously based on faith \nand hope. Our national security should not be based on faith and hope. \nOur Nation's security is too precious to be based on faith and hope \nalone--faith that we will detect any Iranian efforts to cheat and hope \nthat the Iranians will not cheat.\n  Secretary of State John Kerry told the American people in June that \n``we know what they did,'' ``we have no doubt,'' and ``we have absolute \nknowledge of the possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear \nprogram.'' Let me say that again: ``We have absolute knowledge of the \npossible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program.''\n  As chairman of the Intelligence Committee, I can tell you we don't \nhave absolute knowledge of anything. Our intelligence is good, but it \nis not perfect, and it is disingenuous for Secretary Kerry to suggest \notherwise.\n  We must accept the self-evident fact that Iran has a horrific record \nof complying with nonproliferation commitments. When our best tools are \nfaith and hope, we are putting our own national security, as well as \nour allies', at risk.\n  I respectfully ask my colleagues, as you consider your vote on this \nagreement, to think about the following questions:\n  Do you know where every potential nuclear facility is located?\n  Do you know the location or activity of every nuclear-related \nlaboratory, whether it is in a military facility or a university \ncampus?\n  Do we know whether Iran intends to purchase sensitive nuclear \nmaterials from a rogue nation or whether we will detect the sale or the \ntransfer of that nuclear material?\n  Do we know the intentions of the Supreme Leader or what he and his \nsuccessor may be thinking in 10 years?\n  Do we know everything about Iran's past culpability, its future \nintent or ability to conceal illicit, nuclear activities?\n  Have we assumed too much about Iran's willingness to abide by the \nagreement?\n  Unlike Secretary Kerry, I do not believe that we know everything \nabout Iran's past nuclear efforts. I do not have faith that we know, \nwith any degree of certainty, this regime's intentions, as he suggests.\n  Our intelligence community does amazing things, and I am continually \nimpressed with the dedication, drive, and the capability of its people. \nOur intelligence community regularly provides our civilian and military \nleadership insights and assessments on the toughest national security \nproblems, but they never--they never--claim--and I wouldn't believe \nthem if they did--to have absolute knowledge of any issue. Again, \nintelligence is imperfect.\n  Secretary Kerry told the American people and the Members of this \nbody:\n\n       No part of this agreement relies on trust. It is all based \n     on thorough and extensive transparency and verification \n     measures.\n\n  With all due respect, the Secretary is oversimplifying the very \ncomplex and difficult world of treaty compliance and verification. The \nSecretary should come clean and truthfully state that this agreement \ndoes not rely on trust; it relies on hope and faith--faith that we will \ndetect any Iranian efforts to\n\n[[Page S6521]]\n\ncheat and hope that Iran will not cheat.\n  My colleagues should be mindful before casting their votes. Your eyes \nshould be wide open to the uncertainty we as a nation are accepting \nwith this agreement. If the IAEA and our intelligence community are not \n100 percent certain and our collective assumptions respect wrong and we \nget caught unaware or we are surprised, the consequences will be \nsignificant. They could be disastrous and we will, without a doubt, \nregret entering into this agreement.\n  The agreement the administration has negotiated with Iran is based on \nfaith that we know everything about the nuclear program today and hope \nthat the Iranian regime will abide by the terms of this agreement.\n  The administration is displaying misguided faith that Iran will not \nuse the billions of dollars soon to be available to continue its \nefforts to fund terrorist proxies worldwide. I call my colleagues' \nattention to recent comments by National Security Advisor Susan Rice, \nwho said: ``we should expect'' that some of the money Iran gets under \nsanctions relief as a result of the nuclear deal ``would go to the \nIranian military and could potentially be used for the kinds of bad \nbehavior that we have seen in the region.''\n  Again, this deal ignores the facts and instead hopes that it will \nwork out. Iran is the world's central bank of terrorism, and this \nadditional income is not likely to be solely dedicated to streamlining \ntheir postal delivery routes in Iran.\n  Secretary Kerry testified in July that ``they [Iran] are committed to \ncertain things that we interpret as terrorism.''\n  The administration is relying on faith that the IAEA and our \nintelligence community will be able to detect any trace of nuclear \nmaterial and any prohibited activity and has hope that the IAEA will \ncontinue to have ``access'' to Iranian nuclear sites--``access'' that \nin some cases is being defined as ``the ability to deliver things to \nIranians at the gate of a facility, so they can conduct their own \nsurveillance''--anytime, anywhere to deliver the equipment to the \nIranians and ask them to do self-inspections inside the gate.\n  If the IAEA is prevented from gaining the necessary access to \ndeclared or suspected facilities in a timely manner, we will be at a \nsignificant--significant--disadvantage, and the sanctions pressures we \nhave obtained over years of efforts cannot be remade overnight.\n  Our reliance on the IAEA is now also tied to two side agreements with \nIran that Members of this body have not yet been provided. I will \nremind my colleagues that when the President signed the Iran Nuclear \nAgreement Review Act, the law required him to provide to Congress the \nagreement and ``all related materials and annexes,'' and that has not \nhappened. Yet the administration asked that we have faith that these \nwill not have a material effect on the agreement and our ability to \nensure Iranian compliance with its terms.\n  It raises additional questions. Do we have absolute certainty that we \nknow what those agreements include? Do we understand how they may \naffect Iran's activities, assumptions or willingness to abide by the \nterms of its agreements with the United States? Do we know without a \ndoubt where every potential nuclear facility is located?\n  The President argued:\n\n       Although it may take 24 days to finally get access to [a] \n     site . . . high school physics will remind us that that \n     [nuclear materials] leaves a trace. And so we'll know that, \n     in fact, there was a violation of the agreement.\n\n  I don't have absolute certainty that this is true and question the \nadministration's willingness to give up a requirement for anywhere, \nanytime access. If Iran isn't hiding anything, why wouldn't they offer \nthat access?\n  Do we trust Iran's claim that they don't have a covert facility? Do \nwe have faith that they do not? Are we hoping that they do not build \none? Do we or can we have absolute certainty on this issue?\n  A former IAEA deputy director stated in 2013 that ``if there is no \nundeclared [nuclear] installation today . . . it will be the first time \nin 20 years that Iran doesn't have one.''\n  Ultimately, I believe this deal is built on a foundation that is far \nmore unstable than the administration would have us believe.\n  While I realize that all the parties involved in this deal have been \ntrying to spin the narrative to their benefit, I cannot believe that a \ndeal as tough as the administration would have us believe would be \nreferred to by the Iranian President as a ``legal, political, and \ntechnical victory for Iran.''\n  The administration has chosen to trade all of our economic leverage--\nleverage that was working--for a near-term possible delay in Iran's \nbreakout timeline. No doubt we will still have leverage, but it will be \nlimited, perversely, given the President's statements about opponents \nof this deal to military action, something we have tried to avoid for \nmany years as it relates to Iran. The administration hopes that it will \nnot have to use military action.\n  Can you tell me with absolute certainty what the Supreme Leader's \nintentions are? Can you tell me what he is thinking or what he will be \nthinking in 10 years when Iran will have rebuilt its struggling economy \nand will be nearing the end of what limited restraints may remain on \nits nuclear research and development activities? Did we just enable a \nregime based on a false choice that we didn't fully understand?\n  One of the President's chief criticisms, typical of his straw-man \napproach to debate, has been to suggest that opponents of the deal only \nwant a military action. Oddly enough, it is the President's own \nagreement with the Iranians that has stripped us of all leverage except \nmilitary action if the agreement is not adhered to. The strategic \ndecision to engage Iran in the resulting deal cannot be based on \nabsolute certainty of Iran's nuclear programs or its intentions. The \nagreement is based on questionable assumptions, allows far too much \nmaneuvering by Iran, and naively trusts the regime that has a history \nof evasive activities and false declarations to the very body, the \nIAEA, entrusted with enforcing the agreement.\n  Do we know without a doubt what is going on in every laboratory in \nIran, whether it is on a military facility or a university campus?\n  I applaud the efforts of our negotiators, our intelligence community, \nand our diplomats, but I am sorry to say that they were sent on a \nfool's errand by the President. They were provided a false choice \nbetween this agreement and war. The narrative just doesn't add up.\n  I have spent the better part of 15 years as a member of the House or \nSenate Intelligence Committee. I understand the nature and the nuance \nof intelligence work, and I know that there are no absolute certainties \nin this business.\n  This deal is based not on an absolute knowledge of Iran's activities \nand its intentions, as the administration would have us believe, but as \nyou can see, it is naively based on faith and hope.\n  I, for one, will not vote to enable a regime that supports terrorism, \nevades international inspections, disregards U.N. Security Council \nresolutions, and is opposed to the very existence of another nation in \nthe region. The United States has effectively led the international \ncommunity and enacted sanctions that have restrained the hostile \nregime, and it now looks as though this administration will undo those \nyears of efforts and enable the same regime by filling its coffers with \nbadly needed resources.\n  I don't know with absolute certainty where this agreement will lead, \nbut I do understand that there are too many unanswered questions to \nmove forward.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it has been a long day. We have heard \nabout everything that can be heard from a lot of different people, and \nI have come to some conclusions that there are some things that are \nincontrovertible after hearing both sides of the debate all day long. \nThere are six things we should be looking at. I will quickly summarize \nthese. I think it is kind of a good wrapup.\n  There are six things. First of all, this deal rewards and legitimizes \nIran for violating international laws and treaties and United Nations \nSecurity Council resolutions. I say it rewards and legitimizes.\n\n[[Page S6522]]\n\n  The second thing it does is it rewards Iran with $100 billion \ndollars. You heard it today. That could be a floating figure. We are \nnot sure just how much it is, but we do know this: what they do with \ntheir money is to expand their influence with terrorist organizations.\n  The third thing is it places the Middle East on the brink of a new \narms race. This is something we have heard from others for quite some \ntime, and now we already have some countries coming forward with what \ntheir intentions are.\n  The fourth thing is it fails to dismantle Iran's enrichment \ninfrastructure. That has been stated by a lot of people. No one really \nis denying that.\n  And fifth, it places no restrictions on Iran's ballistic missile \nprogram. You have to keep in mind we have been talking about bombs all \nday, but you have to deliver the bombs to make them effective. That is \nwhen the missile program comes into play.\n  And sixth--and I think it is most important--there is, in my opinion, \nno verification at all.\n  I would like to summarize all of that real quickly. In speaking about \nthe fact that the agreement rewards and legitimizes Iran's violations, \nkeep in mind they have violated almost every international law or \ntreaty or United Nations Security Council resolution. The Treaty on the \nNonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, for developing nuclear weapons--\nthey have violated that. The International Covenant on Civil and \nPolitical Rights, which has to do with the freedom of expression, the \nfreedom of religion, freedom from discrimination, and freedom from \ntorture--they have violated that. The International Convention against \nthe Taking of Hostages--several people have mentioned today--I think \nthe junior Senator from Georgia asked: What about the four hostages who \nare over there?\n  I would carry that one step further. One of the hostages is an FBI \nagent named Robert Levinson. Robert Levinson now holds the record of \nhaving been held hostage longer than anyone else in history, and he is \nstill there. He is still there at a time we are in this process.\n  The U.N. security resolutions on access to nuclear facilities--they \nhave violated that. I think everyone knows that.\n  Iran has shown from time to time they can't be trusted. The Director \nGeneral of the IAEA has said Iran has consistently failed to provide \ninformation or access needed to allay the IAEA's concerns about the \nweapons potential.\n  So that is the first thing. The second thing is rewarding the world's \nleading sponsor of terrorism. The United States does not normally \nnegotiate with terrorists. This is something I have heard for many, \nmany years, as long as I have been here, until now. Iran remains the \nworld's leading state sponsor of terrorism, as we have heard all day \ntoday.\n  According to the State Department's ``2009 Country Reports on \nTerrorism,'' they have provided training and weapons to the Taliban \nfighting our forces in Afghanistan. Iranian IEDs have killed U.S. \ntroops in Iraq. They have paid the Taliban in Afghanistan to kill U.S. \ntroops. Iran supports Hamas in Palestine, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and \nAssad in Syria.\n  I had occasion to be in the Persian Gulf on the USS Carl Vinson just \na few weeks ago. It was during the negotiations. There I was in the \nPersian Gulf at the same time an Iranian ship was taking weapons down \nto Yemen to kill Americans. That was while we were negotiating.\n  Iran is bankrolling the slaughter of tens of thousands of Syrians and \nhas publicly committed to the annihilation of the State of Israel and \nhas called for ``Death to America'' while we are in the middle of \nnegotiations.\n  General Austin, the commander of the U.S. Central Command, made the \nstatement--and I was there when he made this statement--that ``Iran \nrepresents the most significant threat to the central region . . . Iran \ncontinues to pursue policies that threaten U.S. strategic interests and \ngoals throughout the Middle East.''\n  As was stated by my good friend before me, even Susan Rice, who would \ndo almost anything the President asks, has said we can expect some of \nthis money--this $100 billion dollars or whatever the amount ends up \nbeing--is going to be used to fortify their terrorist friends. So we \ncan only conclude the financial windfall estimated to be over $100 \nbillion will be used to fortify more terrorism.\n  The third point I think was made today is--and these are the six I \nthink have become incontrovertible--this agreement places the Middle \nEast on the brink of a new arms race.\n  Dr. Kissinger, who testified before our committee--the Armed Services \nCommittee just the other day--when testifying regarding the ongoing \nnuclear negotiations with Iran, said, ``The impact of this approach \nwill be to move from preventing proliferation to managing it.''\n  We all recall last month, when Prime Minister Netanyahu warned us and \nsaid, ``The deal that was supposed to end nuclear proliferation will \nactually trigger nuclear proliferation. It will trigger a nuclear arms \nrace in the Middle East.''\n  Saudi Arabia has been talking recently about possibly being the first \nto jump in there on this new program, so we can expect that to happen. \nWe know it is going to happen.\n  The fourth thing is, the agreement fails to dismantle Iran's \nenrichment infrastructure. I think that has been driven home by many \npeople here. And it permits Iran to retain its enrichment \ninfrastructure, including advanced centrifuges and continued \ndevelopment of its enrichment technology. That is something that is now \npretty much agreed to.\n  Fifth, and next to last, is it places no restrictions on Iran's \nballistic missile development. People have not talked much on the floor \nabout this fact. They have talked about the bomb, but there has to be a \ndelivery system before the bomb can be effective.\n  I can remember in 2007 that our unclassified intelligence report said \nthat by 2015 Iran would have the bomb and a delivery system. Well, here \nit is 2015, and they weren't that far off. So we know what the \ncapability is out there, what they are planning on doing, and the U.S. \nintelligence assesses--this is the quote and this is very significant--\n``that Iran's ballistic missiles are inherently capable of delivering \nweapons of mass destruction and that Iran's program on space launch \nvehicles improves Tehran's ability to develop longer range missiles, \nincluding an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).''\n  What no one has mentioned on this thing is we made an arrangement in \nthe previous administration knowing that Iran was going to have this \ncapability. We have some 30 ground-based interceptors, but they are all \non the West Coast, because we thought that was where it was going to \nhave to come from. But guess what. All of a sudden Iran is going to be \ncoming from the other direction. Well, the first thing this President \ndid when he took office was to do away with our commitment.\n  We had an arrangement with the Czech Republic to have a ground-based \ninterceptor there. I remember so well that one of the best friends we \nhave over there made the statement: Are you sure if we enrage Russia by \nhaving this system that you are not going to pull the rug out from \nunder us?\n  I said: Absolutely.\n  That was Vaclav Klaus, one of our best friends over there.\n  I said: Absolutely.\n  Of course, that is what the President did. Now we have that same \nproblem with the delivery system.\n  The last thing I think is most important--and I may be the only \nMember of the Senate who believes this, but I look at this and I go \nback home. A lot of times you don't find the wisdom here in Washington; \nyou have to go back home. Certainly over this past month, being around \nmy State of Oklahoma, people have asked the question: Well, wait a \nminute, if they have all this time once accused of something or if the \nIAEA should say ``We believe they are making a bomb in a certain \nlocation''--once they do that, if they have the ability under this deal \nto delay that not just 24 hours, not just 24 days, but they can go on \nand delay it for two additional periods by applying to the joint \ncommission for 15 days and then the Minister of Foreign Affairs for 15 \ndays--that is 54 days. I suggest we stop and think about that. If we \nknow somebody has something, but they have 54 days to either destroy it \nor hide it or put it someplace else, they are going to do it.\n\n[[Page S6523]]\n\n  So my people in Oklahoma say there just isn't any kind of \nverification. And we all remember what Ronald Reagan said: ``Trust, but \nverify.''\n  These pages are too young to remember what happened with the Soviet \nUnion and all those problems, but clearly that was the major concern at \nthat time. So this is the situation that was pointed out way back \nduring the joint presentation of the House and the Senate by Netanyahu. \nIf he would just change his registration, I would love it if he would \nrun for President of the United States. He is the kind of guy we need. \nHe made the statement at that time that no deal is going to be better \nthan the bad deal that is on the table. I believe that is true.\n  I had occasion to publish an op-ed last week in the Wall Street \nJournal urging States to hold fast to their sanctions on Iran. Even if \nthey consider strengthening and expanding those sanctions, here is the \nthing people don't understand. The reason the President gets by with \nnot calling this a treaty that would have to be confirmed and verified \nby this body is that it is dealing with the States and not the Federal \nGovernment. So my hope is that many other States will be doing what we \nare doing in the State of Oklahoma and holding on to our sanctions and \nnot releasing any of them. I think that could certainly be, if this \nthing becomes a reality, one of the few things we can do.\n  I will end with a quote from then President Bill Clinton in 1994. I \nremember this because I was there, and I heard him make this statement. \nAfter the deal with North Korea, this is what he said:\n\n       This is a good deal for the United States. North Korea will \n     freeze and then dismantle its nuclear program. South Korea \n     and our allies will be better protected. The entire world \n     will be safer as we slow the spread of nuclear weapons. The \n     United States and international inspectors will carefully \n     monitor North Korea to make sure it keeps its commitments.\n\n  Two decades later, the Defense Intelligence Agency announced that it \nhad ``moderate confidence'' that North Korea has a nuclear weapon small \nenough to be placed on a ballistic missile.\n  So that is what is going on. In today's New York Times--I don't know \nhow anyone can take them seriously when we have the guy who is the real \nboss over there--the Ayatollah Khamenei, talking about Israel, said: \nI'm telling you first, you will not be around in 25 years. We will \nannihilate you in that period of time. Then he talked about the United \nStates. He said: Iranians must not forget the United States is the \nGreat Satan. Ayatollah Khamenei warned, criticizing those calling for \nbetter relations, wanting to show this Satan as an angel, but the \nIranian nation has pushed this Satan out. We should not allow it to \nsneak back in through the window.\n  These are the guys we are negotiating with. With that, I would say \nthis is not a treaty, it is not a deal, it is surrender.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Planned Parenthood\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, last month, before the August recess, the \nSenate took up legislation introduced by my friend Senator Joni Ernst \nthat would have ended Federal funding for Planned Parenthood, \ntransferring subsidies to other women's community health clinics. \nUnfortunately, the bill failed on its first vote, but the questions \nraised by the Planned Parenthood scandal and the challenges it presents \nto Congress and to the American people have only grown since then.\n  At issue are undercover videos released over the last few months that \nprovide an unprecedented behind-the-scenes glimpse inside America's \nleading abortion provider. These undercover videos were captured by a \npro-life organization called the Center for Medical Progress. They \ncontain images and conversations unlike anything ever before submitted \nfor public scrutiny. So far, CMP has released 16 hours of footage \ndepicting what appears to be the routine mutilation of American \nchildren, born and unborn; the harvesting and sale of those children's \nbody parts for profit; the means by which Planned Parenthood avoids \npublic detection of and perhaps criminal prosecution for their actions; \nand, finally, in many ways the most terrifying of all, the nonchalant, \nblood-chilling amusement Planned Parenthood personnel seem to derive \nfrom all of the above.\n  To date, no one has rebutted the evidence contained in these videos. \nPlanned Parenthood's friends and political clients gamely try to change \nthe subject. They take umbrage and they shoot the messenger. They \ndeflect and distract as best they can--the political equivalent of a \ncheckmated lawyer banging his shoe angrily on the table. Even the \nguilty deserve a defense, after all. But they are guilty. We all know \nit. You only have to watch the videos for 5 minutes and you know it is \ntrue.\n  The subjects of these videos are sincere and candid--casually sharing \nthe secrets of their grisly business with people they think are their \nco-conspirators. The evidence points to only one conclusion: Planned \nParenthood really does these horrifying things. Planned Parenthood \nmakes money at it and laughs about it over lunch. But aside from the \nprimary evidence, do you know how else we know it is true? Because if \nit were false, we would know for sure that it was false. The mainstream \nmedia--Big Abortion's loudest shoe banger of them all--would be \nthundering Planned Parenthood's vindication from every headline, every \nhomepage, every network satellite. If these videos were false--if a \npro-life group somehow fabricated this narrative of Planned \nParenthood's greed, barbarism, and cruelty--it would be a story.\n  Who are we kidding? It would be the story, a career-making scoop, \nwith fame, Pulitzer Prizes, lucrative book deals, and speaking tours \nawaiting the journalist who broke the story. Yet if you open a \nnewspaper, click on the legacy media sites, and turn on the news--\nnothing. You see nothing. The major networks have gone dark on the \nvideos over the last month, and major newspapers have scrubbed the \nscandal from their front pages.\n  Why the silence? Simple. They know it is true too. The media looked \nfor the facts, they found them, and then they turned away. In the case \nof the Planned Parenthood undercover videos in the court of public \nopinion, as they taught me in law school: Qui tacit consentire \nvidetur--the media's silence indicates the media's consent.\n  Everyone who has watched these individual videos knows they have the \npower to change minds and in only one direction. So the pro-abortion \nnews media is doing everything they can to suppress the videos' \nexposure.\n  So tightly have the wagons been circled that the media can't even \nattack the Center for Medical Progress as much as they would surely \nlike to because doing so would require context. That context would be \nexceedingly painful here.\n  Even describing these videos--even mentioning them to a wider \naudience--can only lead to curious Google searches, then tweets, then \nFacebook shares, YouTube views, and inevitably to public horror at what \npeople would see and the organization responsible for that horror. \nThis, Planned Parenthood's friends in the media cannot allow, and so \nthey ignore the undercover videos, just like they tried to ignore the \nharrowing case of Dr. Kermit Gosnell in 2013, the perennial scandal of \ndangerous clinic conditions and the horror of partial-birth abortion in \nyears past.\n  Every pro-choice activist, including those with press credentials, \nknows that the greatest threat to abortion-on-demand is the truth about \nwhat it entails. As Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn put it in his Nobel lecture: \n``[Violence] is necessarily interwoven with falsehood.''\n  The media hides the truth about Planned Parenthood and about Big \nAbortion--even at the expense of their own credibility, even to the \nendangerment of vulnerable women and the enrichment of monsters.\n  Like Tolkien's Gollum, they must protect the ``precious.'' I am not a \nreporter, nor am I an editor or a producer. I am certainly not a \nnetwork\n\n[[Page S6524]]\n\nnews anchor, a job for which I lack the skills, the experience and, \nalas, the hairline necessary for that position. I am a lawyer by \ntraining and now a Senator. Therefore, I cannot make leading \nnewspapers, news sites, and television networks tell this story, but it \noccurs to me I can try to tell it myself on the Senate floor. More than \njust tell that story, I can make the case to our colleagues and to our \nfellow Americans. For the next several weeks, for as long as it takes, \nI will come to the floor of the Senate--the American people's great \ndeliberative Chamber--and make that case. The public deserves to know \nthe truth about Planned Parenthood, the inhumanity it practices, the \nlaws it may be breaking, and the lies it tells. Taxpayers deserve to \nknow what their money--more than a half billion dollars last year \nalone--is paying for and how their taxes might be more conscionably \nspent.\n  Americans deserve to know what evil is abroad in their land and what \ngood can be done to overcome it. In the struggle between Planned \nParenthood and its victims, President Obama and his party have sided a \nrich and violent special interest group over the innocent women they \nexploit, the tiny children they mutilate, and the vulnerable \ncommunities they poison.\n  I harbor no illusions about softening such weaponized extremism with \na few floor speeches, nor do I believe that the 45 Senators who voted \nin August to reaffirm Planned Parenthood's eligibility for hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in Federal funding will change their minds--at \nleast not yet.\n  The history of our Nation is the story of a good and loving people \nwho stubbornly, if sometimes slowly, overcome narrow, prejudicial \nlegacies. When presented with the truth, Americans have always come to \nsee and defend the innate dignity of our once overlooked brothers and \nsisters and welcome them out of the shadows and into our hearts and our \nsociety.\n  Indeed, the gradual embrace of our youngest Americans is well \nunderway. In fact, it is gaining momentum all the time. With every \nInstagrammed ultrasound image, every overjoyed Facebook post, and every \nadvance in embryology and obstetrics, Americans move closer and closer \nto the truth about the unborn. At the same time, every new undercover \nvideo released by the Center for Medical Progress is bringing us all a \nlittle closer to the truth about Planned Parenthood.\n  In coming weeks, I hope these speeches might help my colleagues and \nanyone who might be listening to come a little closer to the truth \nabout both. As I make the case against using taxpayer funds to \nfacilitate, protect, and promote Planned Parenthood's deceptions and \nviolence, I hope my colleagues on the other side of these questions \nwill join me from time to time. A good debate is always more fruitful \nthan a monologue. But as long as Planned Parenthood's friends remain \nmute, I will endeavor to improve upon the silence and, hopefully in \ntime, improve upon our inadequate legal protections for the dignity of \nhuman life.\n  As I said, even the guilty deserve a defense, but so do the innocent. \nHowever vulnerable they may be--both children in the womb and mothers \nin the waiting room--however forsaken, however afraid, the innocent are \nnever defenseless. Their defense is the truth, and I am going to do \nwhat I can to tell it.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise this evening to discuss the \nrecent nuclear deal with Iran. I join my colleagues in opposition to \nthis deal, and I agree with many of the arguments that have been put \nforward. Like so many Nebraskans who have contacted me to express their \nopposition, I have a number of concerns regarding this deal.\n  One of the difficulties when it comes to explaining opposition to the \ndeal is the sheer volume of the problems with it. There is no simple \nand succinct way to package all of the deal's weaknesses, which range \nfrom highly technical questions about access to suspicious sites to \nbroad overreaching problems.\n  Overall, I believe that, while the administration claims this deal \npermanently prohibits Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, the plain \nlanguage of this agreement simply does not support that claim. I am \nvery worried that inspectors do not have the access they need to verify \nIran's compliance. Moreover, there is no effective mechanism for \npunishing the low-level violations that Iran is sure to attempt. \nHowever, even if you put aside the technical questions and assume the \nagreement will function exactly as it is intended, the fact of the \nmatter is that all meaningful restrictions on Iran's nuclear program \nexpire in 15 years. At that point, Iran's program is legitimatized, and \nit is free to build an industrial-scale enrichment program if it \nchooses. This means the 1-year breakout time the administration has \nplaced so much emphasis on is only temporary.\n  In their analysis of the agreement, the nonproliferation experts at \nthe Institute for Science and International Security concluded that \nafter year 15 of the agreement, ``Iran could have in place a nuclear \ninfrastructure that could produce significant quantities of weapon-\ngrade uranium rapidly and turn that material into nuclear weapons in a \nmatter of months.'' Some may contend that even if it is not a permanent \nprohibition, as the administration claims, it is still better than the \nstatus quo. Even if we are right back where we started in 10 or 15 \nyears, buying time isn't a bad thing, they insist. But, colleagues, we \nwon't be right back where we started. We will be in a far worse \nposition.\n  Iran's current program was built in violation of its Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty obligations and U.N. Security Council resolutions. \nThe illegality of its program served as the basis for international \nsanctions, and it relegated Iran to a pariah status in the community of \nnations. Now, with this deal, Iran's program is legitimatized. It is \nwelcomed as a member in good standing with the NPT, and the sanctions \nregime is repealed, not temporarily waived. Thus, if the United States \nsought to limit Iran's program after year 15, we would be attempting to \nrebuild a sanctions regime from scratch and to target a program that, \nunder this agreement, is deemed to be acceptable.\n  Supporters of this agreement, many of whom argue that the sanctions \nregime is already on the brink of collapse, need to ask themselves \nthis: How likely is it that sanctions could ever be imposed if Iran \nrapidly expands its program after year 15 of this agreement? I think \nthe answer is that it would be incredibly unlikely. Is permanently \ngiving up our ability to sanction Iran in exchange for a temporary \ndelay of its nuclear aspirations a fair trade? Of course not. Is buying \n10 to 15 years' time worth agreeing to the perpetual instability of an \nunrestrained nuclear Iran after that point? No.\n  There are many other reasons to conclude that we will be in a worse \nposition in 15 years despite the administration's claims to the \ncontrary. Not only will Iran's nuclear program be able to proceed \nwithout limitations, but it will be far richer with this agreement. \nThere is some debate about how much Iran will receive when the \nagreement comes into effect. But whether it is $50 billion or $100 \nbillion or $150 billion, there is no disagreement that Iran stands to \nprofit massively from this deal. Moreover, as sanctions are repealed \nand trade resumes, Iran's economy will grow, bringing further profit to \nthat regime. Although the administration argues that alternative \nrestrictions can be used to hinder Iran's support for terrorist groups, \nit is difficult to believe that relieving sanctions pressure and \ninfusing Iran with cash will do anything other than improve the \npositions of Iran's proxies and the terror groups that it funds.\n  The additional resources will also allow Iran to increase its \nmilitary capabilities, which will further be enhanced by the \nnegotiators' decision to end the U.N. conventional weapons and \nballistic missile technology embargoes on Iran. I find this decision to \nlift the embargoes--particularly on the transfer of ballistic missile \ntechnology to Iran--highly concerning and a compelling example of just \nhow this deal fails to advance our interests.\n\n[[Page S6525]]\n\n  Rolling back Iran's ballistic missile program has been a key \nobjective of the United States for some time because, as Director of \nNational Intelligence Clapper put it in his statement assessing \nworldwide threats before the Armed Services Committee this year, \n``Tehran would choose ballistic missiles as its preferred method of \ndelivering nuclear weapons.''\n  Secretary Carter, in his confirmation hearing, built on this and \nunequivocally stated that Iran's ballistic missile development was ``a \nthreat not only to the United States, but friends and allies in the \nregion.''\n  Last year I joined a number of my colleagues in sending a letter to \nthe President urging him to use the negotiations process to achieve \nfurther restrictions on Iran's ballistic missile program. The \nadministration's response to our letter stated that Iran's ballistic \nmissile program ``will need to be addressed in the context of a \ncomprehensive solution.'' This position was repeated by the U.S. \nnegotiators. Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman also stated on \nmultiple occasions that Iran's ballistic missile program ``has to be \naddressed as part of a comprehensive agreement.''\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dempsey, weighed \nin at a July 7 hearing before our Senate Armed Services Committee, \ntestifying that ``under no circumstances should we relieve pressure on \nIran relative to ballistic missile capabilities and arms trafficking.'' \nThen, a week later, news reports surfaced that negotiators had agreed \nto an eleventh hour Iranian demand that the embargoes be lifted.\n  Indeed, when the deal was announced on July 14, the President \nrevealed that after 5 years, the conventional weapons embargo will be \nremoved, and after 8 years, restrictions related to ballistic missile \ntechnology would also expire. I will repeat that point. Instead of \nexchanging sanctions relief for further limitations on Iran's ballistic \nmissile development, as many of us in this body had urged, U.S. \nnegotiators agreed at the last minute to relax those restrictions. \nThese are the weapons that our intelligence community tells us will be \nIran's preferred way to deliver a nuclear weapon, and our most senior \nmilitary officer testified that we should ``under no circumstances'' \nrelieve that pressure. When the administration said Iran's ballistic \nmissile programs would have to be addressed, few would have guessed \nthat this is what they meant.\n  Now, Secretary Kerry has argued this concession won't have an impact \nbecause many other tools, such as the Missile Technology Control Regime \nand the Proliferation Security Initiative, are available to prevent \nIran from acquiring ballistic missile technology. But the United \nNations restrictions were imposed in order to bolster those measures \nwhich were on the books long before the U.N. measures were passed. \nRemoving them will give our counter-proliferation efforts one less tool \nto limit Iran's military development and, in particular, its ability to \nbuild an ICBM that is capable of hitting the United States.\n  The administration has also argued that keeping the embargo on \nconventional weapons in effect for 5 years and 8 years with respect to \nthose ballistic missile restrictions is a victory. After all, they \nclaim, Iran, Russia, and China wanted to have those restrictions \nremoved immediately. Watering down last-minute demands of a minority of \nnegotiators is not a victory for the United States. Any attempt to \nargue that we were lucky to avoid complete capitulation to the demands \nof Iran and Russia and China admits a negotiating atmosphere so \ndysfunctional that no positive agreement could have emerged.\n\n  I believe the repeal of the U.N. embargoes will foster Iran's \nconventional weapons and ballistic missile development. Thus, under \nthis agreement, in 15 years we are likely to see an Iran that has \nemerged as a threshold nuclear state with an advanced enrichment \nprogram, has a more advanced conventional army, and commands a larger, \nbetter trained, and better equipped proxy force. It may even have an \nICBM with which it can threaten to retaliate against any U.S. attack. \nAll of this will be achieved without violating the agreement that is \nbefore us today, which reflects how far short it falls of advancing \nU.S. interests.\n  Worst of all, legitimizing Iran's nuclear program diminishes the \nchance that sanctions could ever be imposed on Iran in the future, and \nfostering its military development undermines the threat of force \nshould Iran ever attempt to develop a nuclear weapon.\n  I believe this vote will be one of the most important I will make as \na U.S. Senator, and it is worthy of a robust debate. I am disappointed \nthat more of my colleagues--in particular those on the other side of \nthe aisle--have not come to the floor to share their opinion, their \nposition. I find their silence deafening.\n  As I have looked around this Chamber today, I have been wondering, \nwhere are the supporters of this agreement? Why are they not on the \nfloor to defend the substance of this deal? Forget the politics. Forget \nthe false choices, the straw men, and the bluster. We should be here to \ndebate substance.\n  In conclusion, I cannot support an agreement that attempts to trade \ninadequate short-term limits for dangerous long-term concessions.\n  Nebraskans and all Americans and their families are depending on us \nto ensure that our Nation's security is protected. This deal should not \nbe approved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

She leaves behind a legacy of \ntransformation that will benefit the health care of our soldiers and \ntheir families for years to come.\n  Lieutenant General Horoho was commissioned as a second lieutenant in \nthe U.S. Army Nurse Corps in 1982 upon her graduation from the \nUniversity of North Carolina. Over the course of her service, she \ncommanded medical units to include the U.S. Army Medical Command, the \nWalter Reed Health Care System, the Western Regional Medical Command, \nand the Madigan Army Medical Center. She also deployed in support of \nthe International Security Assistance Force Joint Command in \nAfghanistan in 2011.\n  During her tenure as the 43rd U.S. Army Surgeon General, Lieutenant \nGeneral Horoho demonstrated her resolve to transform Army Medicine from \na health care system to a system of health. Her strong leadership \nefforts resulted in the Army and the Department of Defense adopting \nmany initiatives to improve the quality of care for military members, \nfamilies, and retirees--validating the Army Medical Department's \nprofessionalism as a High Reliability Organization. She is a national \nleader and innovator in health care who provided vision and direction \nthat positively transformed Army Medicine.\n  Lieutenant General Horoho is a true patriot who has dedicated her \nlife to the security, health, and welfare of our Nation. Her loyalty \nand commitment to the soldiers and their families have never wavered. \nShe is leaving the U.S. Army Medical Department in a high state of \nreadiness, capable of accomplishing its important missions.

Mr. Casey has served \nSEPTA in this position for the last 7 years and will officially retire \non September 30, 2015.\n  For those who do not know, SEPTA is the largest transit system in the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania and the sixth largest in the Nation. \nServices including bus, subway, commuter rail, light rail, and electric \ntrolleybus are provided to over 3.9 million people in and around \nPhiladelphia, PA, including parts of Delaware and New Jersey. A \nlifelong resident of the Philadelphia area, Mr. Casey's first memories \nof SEPTA were riding the trolley to visit his grandmother in the city \nand to attend games at Connie Mack Stadium.\n  Mr. Casey began his career at SEPTA in 1982. Before becoming general \nmanager in 2008, he served for 6 years as chief financial officer and \ntreasurer. In senior leadership positions at the Internal Audit and \nFinance departments, he received praise for his efforts to implement \nfiscal responsibility at the authority.\n  As general manager of SEPTA, Mr. Casey oversaw 9,000 employees and \ninstituted several necessary programs for the authority. He shifted \nSEPTA's customer relations focus to reflect the ``Four Cs''--\nCleanliness, Convenience, Courtesy and Communication--and implemented \ninitiatives to reduce energy consumption on vehicles and at facilities. \nAs a result, SEPTA received the 2012 American Public Transportation \nAssociation, APTA, Outstanding Public Transportation System Award.\n  Throughout his tenure, Mr. Casey has focused on community engagement \nand policy reforms with the aim of helping riders and the overall \ntransit infrastructure system. I applaud Mr. Casey for his work with \nSEPTA over the past 34 years and his service to the residents of \nsoutheast Pennsylvania.

Mr. President, today I wish to commend all foster \ngrandparents on the program's 50th anniversary this year. The Foster \nGrandparents Program provides ways for volunteers age 55 and older to \nstay active by serving children and youth in their communities. These \nvolunteers give their time and talents as role models, mentors, and \nfriends to children in need.\n  More than 25,000 foster grandparents volunteer through over 300 \nprograms throughout the United States. Last year, foster grandparent \nvolunteers provided 23 million hours of service to their local \ncommunities, serving more than 189,000 children facing academic, \nsocial, and financial challenges. These volunteers serve at thousands \nof locations, helping children build reading skills, providing one-on-\none tutoring, mentoring troubled teenagers and young mothers, caring \nfor premature infants or children with disabilities, and assisting \nchildren who have been abused or neglected.\n  I am particularly proud to honor the more than 500 seniors in Kansas \nwho contribute their time and talents serving children in my State. \nFoster grandparent programs operate across Kansas out of Augusta, Hays, \nKansas City, Manhattan, Paola, Topeka, and Wichita. Volunteers serve in \nan array of locations throughout the State, including schools, \nhospitals, juvenile correctional institutions, and early childhood \neducation and childcare centers. These compassionate individuals have \nreached more than 5,000 Kansas students over the last 50 years. The \nfollowing are just a few examples of their inspiring service:\n  Alice Reid has been part of the Foster Grandparent Program since \n2004. At the age of 92, she has consistently given an average of 33 \nhours per week and 11,341 lifetime volunteer hours. She primarily works \non reading with children younger than 5 years of age, but Grandma Alice \nis happy to help any student. She often spends her lunch hour in the \ncafeteria eating with the children. Grandma Alice is so valued that the \nschool had a big celebration for her 90th birthday. There were more \nthan 400 children involved in this birthday celebration for their \nfriend. The students made birthday cards and sang to her. A \nkindergarten teacher remarked, ``We love Grandma Alice and we \nappreciate all that she does for us. She has been a wonderful part of \nour school.''\n  In WaKeeney, Grandma Deb Fabrizius serves in kindergarten classrooms \nat Trego Grade School and has formed trusting friendships with many of \nthe children she serves. She shared a story about a child, ``a sweet \nlittle guy who is quiet, very particular about his work and has a great \nsmile. This little boy does not hug a lot, but when he does it, it is \nspecial--he's very sincere about it.'' The child told Grandma Deb that \nhe wanted to share a secret with her. She followed him to his locker, \nwhere he took out a folder from his backpack with papers in it. The \npapers detailed what he wanted to be when he grew up. Grandma Deb was \ntouched that he trusted her enough to keep his secret, and she told him \nthat his parents would be proud of him and encouraged him to share his \ndreams with them. Foster grandparents such as Grandma Deb are sometimes \nthe only adults with whom children have consistent, loving, \nnonjudgmental relationships. Grandma Deb and other foster grandparents \ndo their best to encourage students and inspire them to have self-\nconfidence and reach for the stars.\n  Carol Sheffield, Udena McKee, Naomi Graves, and Margaret Hill work as \nfoster grandparents in the Manhattan area. These women note the work \nthey do for the kids is very fulfilling, and they plan to continue to \nserve in the classroom for years. By giving positive attention to kids, \nthe volunteers and teachers have been able to see a real turnaround in \nstudents' lives. Carmen Flaz, principal of Oakdale Elementary School in \nSalina, said that foster grandparents have a large effect in the \nclassroom.\n  Grandma Linda Downs is the only foster grandparent in Waterville, a \ntown of around 700 people in northeast Kansas. Grandma Linda serves \nstudents in her local preschool as well the afterschool and summer \nelementary programs. She volunteers at least 30 hours each week for her \ncommunity.\n  Grandma Melinda serves as a foster grandparent at Lucas-Luray \nElementary School in Luray. When she was younger, she lost her right \nthumb in an accident. While most people do not notice her missing \nthumb, Grandma Melinda says, ``Leave it to a kid! They look you over \nfrom head to toe. They spy my missing thumb right away. They watch me \nholding a crayon or glue stick. They are always watching my hand to see \nwhat I can do.'' When children at school ask her about her missing \nthumb, Grandma Melinda lets them look closer and touch her hand if they \nwant. She uses this opportunity to teach the children a life lesson \nabout each person being special in their own way and about accepting \neveryone.\n  Grandpa Hubert Brown serves in a Head Start classroom in Great Bend, \nwhere he gives special attention to three particular students. A set of \ntwo boys have formed a close bond with him. Another child, a little \ngirl who is very shy and did not talk much with other students, always \nfinds a place near Grandpa Hubert during circle time. Through her \nfriendship with Grandpa Hubert, she has increased her involvement in \nclass and developed friendships with her classmates.\n  The special way of life we live in Kansas and across this great \ncountry would not be possible without individuals committed to giving \nback to improve their own communities, and foster grandparents change \nthe world for the better one soul at a time. Their acts of kindness and \nselflessness are inspiring to us all. I honor foster grandparents for \ntheir shining examples of service to others. This commitment to service \nenriches our own homes and strengthens our Nation.\n  Thank you, congratulations on your 50th anniversary, and all the best \nfor many more years of helping others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/09/senate-section/article/S6526-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6526-S6527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REMEMBERING LIEUTENANT CHARLES GLINIEWICZ\n\n Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, on September 1, 2015, Lieutenant \nCharles Joseph Gliniewicz of the Fox Lake Police Department made the \nultimate sacrifice. Lieutenant Gliniewicz, who\n\n[[Page S6527]]\n\nserved his community as a police officer for over 30 years, was nearing \nretirement when he was shot and killed while in pursuit of suspects \nduring his morning patrol.\n  Lieutenant Gliniewicz, known has ``G.I. Joe,'' was a pillar of his \ncommunity, committed to his job, his family, and the children he \ntrained at the Fox Lake Police Explorer Post 300. As founder of Post \n300 and leader since 1987, Lieutenant Gliniewicz trained young people \nages 14 to 21 for a career in law enforcement. Hundreds of these \n``Explorers'' entered into law enforcement and military careers \nfollowing Lieutenant Gliniewicz's training and mentorship. Prior to his \ncareer in Fox Lake, Lieutenant Gliniewicz was a member of the U.S. Army \nand proudly served his country from 1981 to 2007, receiving numerous \nservice awards during that time.\n  While Lieutenant Gliniewicz dedicated much of his time to his \ncommunity, he was also a loving family man. He was married to his wife \nMel for 26 years and the couple have four children.\n  I wish to express my deepest condolences to the family and friends of \nLieutenant Charles Joseph Gliniewicz and the entire Fox Lake community. \nOn behalf of the people of Illinois, I thank Lieutenant Gliniewicz for \nhis dedication and service to his community and his country. I \nencourage all law enforcement personnel to honor his memory by \ncontinuing his mission to foster positive relationships between police \nofficers and the people they serve and to inspire the next generation \nof law enforcement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/09/senate-section/article/S6527-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CUSTER STATE PARK BUFFALO ROUNDUP 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the Custer State \nPark Buffalo Roundup. The Buffalo Roundup will be celebrating its 50th \nanniversary on September 25, 2015. The exciting and historical event is \naccompanied by an arts festival, a buffalo wallow chili cook-off, \nconcerts, and more.\n  Taking place in the beautiful Custer State Park, located in the Black \nHills, the Buffalo Roundup is a spectacular event. Each year, thousands \nof visitors watch as a herd of approximately 1,300 bison is driven into \ncorrals by cowboys on horses, all-terrain vehicles, and pickup trucks. \nFollowing the roundup, the bison are sorted for sale and medical \nevaluations.\n  Millions of bison roamed the Great Plains hundreds of years ago, but \nin the 1800s the bison population dwindled to less than 1,000. Custer \nState Park purchased 36 bison in 1914 as part of an effort to conserve \nthe bison population, and the herd was often gathered for culling and \ninspection. It was not until 1965 that the roundup became an annual \nevent.\n  The Buffalo Roundup is integral to maintaining a healthy bison herd \nin Custer State Park. At its largest, the herd included 2,500 bison. \nOnce the bison are in the corrals, they are vaccinated, branded, and \nsorted for sale. Several hundred bison are sold each year in order to \nprevent overgrazing and preserve the grasslands.\n  I offer my congratulations to the Custer State Park Buffalo Roundup \non its 50th anniversary and wish them prosperity in the years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/09/senate-section/article/S6527-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MARTIN GUTIERREZ\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I honor Martin Gutierrez, \ndivision director for Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New Orleans and \nthe recipient of the 2015 Excelencia Award as a Community Leader by the \nHispanic Chamber of Commerce of Louisiana.\n  Martin grew up in the New Orleans area, graduating from Chalmette \nHigh School and going on to receive a degree in business administration \nand management from the University of New Orleans. While still in high \nschool, Martin took a job at a local bank where he continued to work \nfor the next 14 years.\n  Following his banking career, he became the executive director of the \nHispanic Apostolate of New Orleans. While there he supported the work \nof 16 church parishes that offered a ministry targeted to the Hispanic \ncommunity. In 2007, he became the director of Immigration/Refugee \nServices and Hispanic Outreach for Catholic Charities in New Orleans. \nSince then, he has served as the executive director for Neighborhood \nCommunity Services and as vice president for Community Services \nMinistries. He was named division director last year and in that role \nhe manages a number of programs that include a staff of around 100 \npeople and a budget of approximately $7 million.\n  In addition to his work with Catholic Charities, Martin is also \ninvolved in a number of other community organizations. He serves on the \nboard for the New Orleans Family Justice Center, UNITY for the \nHomeless, Puentes New Orleans, and ASI Federal Credit Union. He has \nalso participated in training with the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's \nOffice Citizens Academy, New Orleans Police Department Citizens \nAcademy, and the FBI Citizens Academy.\n  In 2006, he received the Galvez Cut from the New Orleans Hispanic \nHeritage Foundation in recognition of his work in the Hispanic \ncommunity and in 2010, he was presented with the Role Model Award by \nthe Young Leadership Council.

Their \nexemplary hands-on approach to support members of the community is \nevident through programs such as ``Leads for Lunch'' and ``Breakfast on \nthe Run,'' events designed to allow members to promote their businesses \nand encourage referrals for other chamber members.\n  One of the most distinctive aspects of the Livingston Parish Chamber \nof Commerce is its commitment to supporting and training local students \nand educators. Through scholarship opportunities, Student of the Month \nawards, and other educational programs, it is clear the chamber of \ncommerce recognizes the importance of training the business leaders of \ntomorrow. Additionally, all members of the chamber can feel confident \nknowing they will have ample opportunities to learn from their peers, \nconnect with members of the community, and network with local \nofficials.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nenter into certain leases at the Department of Veterans Affairs West \nLos Angeles Campus in Los Angeles, California, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto facilitate additional housing and services for Southern California's \nveterans. It would allow the Department of Veterans Affairs to leverage \nthe resources of local governments and non-profits to build supportive \nhousing for veterans at the West Los Angeles VA Medical Center Campus. \nMy colleague Senator Barbara Boxer is a cosponsor of this bill. \nCongressman Ted Lieu is introducing companion legislation in the House \nof Representatives.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs, Mayor of Los Angeles and Los \nAngeles County Board of Supervisors all support this legislation.\n  Los Angeles has the largest concentration of homeless veterans in the \nUnited States, currently estimated to be 4,300. These are brave men and \nwomen who served our nation with honor, and I believe it is our duty to \nensure they have access to housing and the clinical services of the \nGreater Los Angeles VA Health System.\n  This legislation would provide two authorities to the department. \nFirst, it would allow the West Los Angeles VA to use enhanced-use \nleases to engage in public-private partnerships to provide supportive \nhousing for veterans. Enhanced-use leases allow the department to \nleverage private or local funding and partners to construct new housing \non the campus. For example, California passed a bond measure in 2014 \nthat provides $600 million in funding for the construction of \nsupportive veteran housing. I want to note that this enhanced-use \nleasing authority is the same authority that the department has for \nevery other VA campus in the nation.\n  Second, my bill would allow the West Los Angeles campus to enter into \nout-leases to provide critical services to veterans housed on the \ncampus, ranging from education to recreation. Services must be provided \nto create a healthy and sustainable community for veterans. Veterans \nhoused on the campus will need access to mental health care options, \njob training, and physical recreation. These services can be provided \nby community partners leasing property on the campus, such as the \nUniversity of California--Los Angeles.\n  I would like to make you aware of the long history of the West Los \nAngeles VA campus. This campus is approximately 400 acres and is \nlocated at the intersection of Wilshire Boulevard and Interstate 405. \nThe land was deeded to the Federal government by former Senator John P. \nJones, for use exclusively as a ``soldier's home.'' The beautiful \ncampus has numerous historic buildings, including a church.\n  In 2007, I included language in an appropriations bill to prohibit \nthe ability of the Department of Veterans Affairs to lease or sale any \nproperty on the West Los Angeles Campus, due to reports of \nmismanagement and inappropriate leasing of VA property to commercial \nentities. In several cases, these commercial entities had nothing to do \nwith serving veterans.\n  After the ban was signed into law, questionable practices continued \nthrough land-sharing agreements. This led to the American Civil \nLiberties Union, ACLU, of Southern California filing a lawsuit against \nthe department in 2011 over its mismanagement of the campus.\n  In a large part due to our new Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Robert \nA. McDonald, the department reached a settlement with the ACLU earlier \nthis year to return the campus to its original purpose to serve \nveterans. The ACLU and the department are working to create a new \nMaster Plan for the campus that includes community input, which I \nexpect will include a focus on ending veteran homelessness in Los \nAngeles. My legislation will provide the department with the tools it \nneeds to get veterans off the streets and ensure the West Los Angeles \ncampus truly serves the veterans of Los Angeles.\n  This legislation contains important oversight provisions to ensure \nthe management mistakes of the past are not repeated.\n  First, it maintains a restriction put in place in 2007 that prohibits \nany part of the West Los Angeles campus from being sold, transferred, \nor otherwise disposed of.\n  Second, it requires the VA to report to Congress 45 days before \nentering into any lease, and to provide an annual evaluation of all \nland-use and leases on the campus.\n  Third, it requires regular audits by the Office of the Inspector \nGeneral, OIG, and restricts the VA from entering into any new leases if \nthe OIG finds any violation of Federal law or policy, or gross \nmismanagement of the campus. The VA would have to certify to Congress \nthat it addressed any issues found by the OIG before entering into new \nleases on the campus.\n  Finally, the legislation requires all land-use, including leases, to \nbe consistent with the new Master Plan that is agreed upon for the \ncampus. It also requires all leases to principally benefit veterans.\n\n[[Page S6536]]\n\n  I believe these oversight provisions will ensure that the historic \nmismanagement of the West Los Angeles campus will not recur.\n  Let me conclude by saying that Congress must meet its responsibility \nto care for the veterans who have fought for our Nation's freedom and \nsecurity. It would be a shame to leave private resources untapped in a \ncity where 4,300 veterans are currently homeless. I hope all of my \ncolleagues will support enacting this legislation as quickly as \npossible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 2017. A bill to amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act to \nrecognize Alexander Creek, Alaska, as a Native village, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation, already \npending in the House of Representatives, where it was first introduced \nin 2009, 2011, and 2013 by Alaska Congressman Don Young to finally \nsettle a long-standing injustice to the Native residents of Alexander \nCreek, a Native village built along the creek that runs into the \nSusitna River near its entrance to Cook Inlet, north of Anchorage and \nsouthwest of Wasilla, AK.\n  The story of Alexander Creek's Alaska Natives is a sad story, in that \nit is a story of Natives whose village happened to be located at the \nsite of one of the State's prime salmon fishing locations, a site that \nmay have prompted efforts by some to deliberately prevent the village \nfrom rightfully gaining the lands it was entitled to receive under the \nAlaska Native Claims Settlement Act, ANCSA, passed by this Congress in \n1971.\n  It is especially sad since the villagers succeeded in the Federal \ncourts in winning confirmation of their status as a village under ANCSA \nnearly four decades ago but because of decades of mistakes and \nmisunderstandings, still have received only about 10 percent of the \nland village residents are entitled to receive.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would give the Secretary of \nthe Interior the authority to enter into negotiations to settle \naboriginal land claims with Alexander Creek, after conferring village \ninstead of group status on the community. It gives the Secretary wide \nlatitude to find a just, environmentally acceptable, and economically \nreasonable means to bring Alexander Creek to ``approximate parity'' to \nthe other more than 210 villages that were established by the 1971 law \nthat settled all aboriginal lands claims in Alaska.\n  Alexander Creek, whose Native name is Tuqentnu, traditionally was a \nhealthy Native village with abundant resources, whose residents lived \noff fish traps located near the mouth of the Susitna River year round. \nWhile its population suffered as a result of whooping cough, measles, \nand influenza epidemics in the early 1900s caused by the influx of the \nnon-Native population into upper Cook Inlet--the village being \nliterally decimated by the 1918 epidemic--by 1939 the village had been \nreoccupied by Native families. When the Alaska Native Claims Settlement \nAct passed in December 1971, there were 37 residents of the village, 12 \nmore than the 25 needed to be entitled to form a village corporation \nunder the act and to be entitled to receive 69,120 acres around the \ncore townships of the village.\n  The Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1971 made that determination. But the \nvillage had the misfortunate of being located in a prime salmon fishing \narea that was sought by the State of Alaska at the time of statehood in \n1959 and that was later conveyed by the State to the then new \nMatanuska-Susitna Borough at the time of its creation in the early \n1960s. Thus there was opposition to Alexander Creek being allowed to \nclaim its lands. The State, in fact, protested its eligibility for land \nunder ANCSA. A hearing was held before an administrative law judge on \nJuly 11, 1974, but oddly the hearing was not widely noticed and a \nnumber of village residents were specifically not told of the hearing, \nso they were not in attendance. When the appeals board released its \ndecision on November 1, 1974, the board ruled that the village only \ncontained 22 residents--3 short of the required number for creation--\nsimply because 5 other families and their children had not appeared at \nor testified at the hearing.\n  The board's decision was appealed to U.S. district court that \nreversed the appeals board's decision on November 14, 1975, ordering \nthe reinstatement of Alexander Creek's ANCSA eligibility. While that \ndecision was appealed by the State of Alaska, the lower court decision \nwas upheld by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals on August 29, 1976, which \nordered that the case be remanded back to the Secretary of the Interior \nfor further proceedings. But since all of the land around Alexander \nCreek had already been conveyed to the State and to the Mat-Su Borough, \nthe village was required to join other Cook Inlet region villages in \nselecting ``deficiency lands'' near Lake Clark to the southwest of the \nregion. But the creation of the Lake Clark National Monument in 1978, \nprior to passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act \nin 1980, further complicated the land selection issue for the village.\n  Alexander Creek villagers, who could not afford independent legal \ncounsel following the 1976 district court and court of appeals rulings, \ndid not immediately pursue their claims to full village status and \napparently did not understand the complexities of the Lake Clark land \nconveyance decisions. Somehow, they instead were convinced to sign an \nagreement with Cook Inlet Region, Inc., the regional corporation for \nthe area, and the Interior Department in December 1979, where the \nvillage dropped its claim to be a village in exchange for receiving \n``group'' status under the ANCSA, and also in return for being \nguaranteed 7,680 acres of land, some of which was to come from the \nState of Alaska and or the borough. While the State did provide the \nvillage with 1,686 acres, no borough or Federal land was conveyed to \ncomplete the 7,680-acre ``group'' agreement reached in 1979 until just \nrecently.\n  It wasn't until the next generation of Native leaders arrived in the \nvillage that they realized that Alexander Creek never received the \nlands it should have received.\n  Over the past decade residents of the village have been seeking to \nhave the original court of appeals decision affirmed and implemented. \nOver the years they have been gaining support for their efforts. First, \nBIA Alaska Region Field Representative Charles F. Bunch concluded after \n``a thorough assessment'' that the BIA's original determination was \ncorrect and that Alexander Creek ``met the requirement'' for village \neligibility and that the land conveyances should have been implemented. \nRecently the Alexander Creek village leaders have received support from \nthe Alaska Federation of Natives, Cook Inlet Region, Inc., CIRI, the \nState of Alaska and the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, all agreeing that \nthe village should receive its full lands promised under ANCSA--plus \nfrom a host of other groups.\n  So this legislation will reinstate Alexander Creek's eligibility, \noverriding the 1979 ``group'' agreement, reached under section 1432(d) \nof ANCSA, and giving the village the right to negotiate a fair \nsettlement with the Interior Department. Under the act the Secretary is \nfree, at his sole discretion, to propose what assets are to be provided \nAlexander Creek to capitalize the corporation, not setting any \npredetermined amount of land, cash, surplus Federal property or other \nassistance. The bill does hold the regional corporation for the area, \nCook Inlet Region, Inc. harmless from any impacts of the village \ncorporation's creation.\n  The Alexander Creek case represents a sad chapter in the story of the \nsettlement of Native aboriginal land claims in Alaska. It is a story of \nNative land owners being actively discouraged from selecting their \ntraditional lands, of being deliberatively misinformed about land \nselection processes so they would not qualify for their lands, of being \npressured to accept inferior compromises so they would gain less land, \nand of then being ignored for far too long when it came time to \nconsummate the inferior deal they were encouraged to accept. It clearly \nis time this Congress rewrites that chapter and allows it to have a \nhappier ending.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 2018.

Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to aid an \nAlaska higher educational institution obtain title to property it no \nlonger needs, and that the Federal Government clearly no longer wants. \nI rise to introduce legislation to clear the title to a 210-acre parcel \nin Glennallen, AK, so that the land can be put to more productive uses \nin the future.\n  Back in 1926 the Central Alaska Mission began operations in \nGlennallen. In 1954 it received a Federal land grant from Congress, \nmodified in 1959, and received 210 acres in ``downtown'' Glennallen--\nthe current site of the hospital and radio station and former site of \nthe Alaska Bible College. In 1961 it actually opened the Bible College \non 80 acres of the tract, the site apparently having about 64 separate \nbuildings erected on it. The 1959 land grant, like many in first the \nTerritory of Alaska and later the State of Alaska, had a clause that \nshould the property no longer be used for religious/public purposes \nthat it would revert to the federal government. The Bible College, \nbecause of a lack of students in Glennallen, moved into the Matanuska-\nSusitna Borough, to Palmer, AK, last decade. Now it wishes to be able \nto sell the property to be rid of the maintenance costs on the \nfacilities.\n  The problem is that there apparently are no non-profits or few \nbusinesses in Glennallen that can afford to pay the officially \nappraised value for the properties. The parent of the Bible College 3 \nyears ago asked the Federal Bureau of Land Management, BLM, \nadministratively to start a process where it would decide the value of \nthe properties and what it would have to pay the government to buy out \nthe value of the ``reversionary clause'' so it could obtain clear title \nto sell the properties for whatever amount it could get. That appraisal \nwas conducted mutually and came back late last year that the 210-acres, \nminus a sewage lagoon on the property that has no sales value, is worth \n$210,000. The college says the college can't afford that amount to buy \nout the value of the reversionary clause--because regardless of the \nappraisal, there is no entity in Glennallen that can afford to pay \nanywhere near that amount for the properties given the level of \neconomic activity at present in the upper Copper River Valley in \nAlaska.\n  The college is arguing, correctly, that the Federal Government is \nwrong in setting the value of the reversionary clause as the full \nappraised value of the property for tax purposes. If willing sellers \ncan't be found who can afford to pay the ``appraised'' value of the \nproperty, then obviously the appraisal process is faulty. Secondly, the \ncollege is arguing that it has fully met the goal of Congress in 1959 \nthat the land be used for the public purpose of operating an \neducational institution. For more than 40 years the property was used \nby Alaska Bible College, the college only moving into a more urban part \nof Alaska when student levels proved insufficient to support the \nschool. Clearly it makes no sense for the reversionary clause to remain \nin effect in perpetuity when land use patterns have changed. Third, the \nFederal Government does not need the land for any federal purpose. The \nland, not located in an urban setting in the small town of Glennallen, \npopulation, 491, is not suited for a park. The land is not needed for \nany Federal facility given its location in sparsely populated east \ncentral Alaska. Being inside the Glennallen city limits, the land can \nnot be allowed to revert to a natural vegetative state under the town's \nordinances. It simply makes good sense for the land to be sold for \neconomic purposes so it can generate more revenues for the town's tax \nrolls. Given the real estate market in Glennallen, the Federal \nGovernment will lose far more money than it will make if it has to tear \ndown the unwanted buildings in order to sell the property, or maintain \nthem until another purpose for the structures can be found, at the \ncurrent appraised tax values of the properties.\n  In each case, reversion of the lands to the Federal Government would \nresult in Federal ownership of tracts unneeded for Federal purposes, \nbut lands that would produce greater conveyance and management costs to \nthe Federal treasury than are likely to be recovered through fair \nmarket sales. There is just no public policy purpose in the 21st \ncentury not to permit these very limited Federal reversion \nextinguishments, especially since the land did meet the purpose of the \nreversionary clause for more than four decades.\n  Passage of this act would cost the Federal Government nothing, but \nwould aid the citizens of Glennallen by allowing the lands to be put to \na better use, hopefully adding to the city's economy and perhaps \nincreasing its future tax revenues. I hope this bill will be able to \nadvance and become law within the 114th Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/09/senate-section/article/S6537-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 249--HONORING THE RED LAND LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM OF \n LEWISBERRY, PENNSYLVANIA FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE TEAM IN THE 2015 \n                       LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES\n\n  Mr. CASEY (for himself and Mr. Toomey) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.
