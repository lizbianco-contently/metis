Mr. President, as the Senate convenes today, the world \nfaces yet another horrific terrorist act, this time against America's \noldest ally, France. Across our great Nation, Americans have displayed \nthe French flag across buildings, monuments, and Facebook pages in \nsolidarity with France, a country with which we have long shared \ndemocratic values.\n  We, too, have felt the searing shock and pain of terrorism on our own \nsoil, and just as France stood with us after the 9/11 attacks, we stand \nwith France today. I personally express my condolences for those in \nFrance who lost a loved one. To the mothers, fathers, grandparents, \nchildren, friends, and relatives, we mourn with you. To all those in \nthe midst of caring for loved ones, those injured in these evil \nattacks--as hundreds were--our hearts and our thoughts are with you.\n  There are no words to adequately describe the barbarism of ISIS, the \norganization that carried out this attack and mowed down innocent \ncivilians enjoying the freedom and beauty of a Paris night, but as we \nknow, the attacks in Paris do not stand alone. ISIS has viciously \nattacked innocent people in Beirut, Syria, Iraq, Libya, and other \nplaces. They have beheaded Americans, beheaded others, instituted a \npolicy of rape and violence against women, and are attempting to take \ncivilization back to the Dark Ages. ISIS does not worship Islam. ISIS \nworships death. ISIS doesn't practice compassion and mercy. ISIS \npractices killing, torture, and violence. Instead of guiding its \nfollowers on the straight and narrow path, ISIS guides them to hate.\n  As Pope Francis said yesterday:\n\n       The road of violence and hate does not resolve the problems \n     of humanity. Using God's name to justify this path is \n     blasphemy.\n\n  The Pope is right.\n  Law-abiding Muslims--many of whom have also been innocent victims of \nterror--must not allow these radicals to be the face of their religion. \nWe cannot allow it. They cannot allow it. I know I speak for the Senate \nin saying we are all committed to stopping ISIS. We are united in \nsupporting France in every possible way, as the people of France move \nforward after these attacks.\n  I repeat, as the Pope said yesterday:\n\n       The road of violence and hate does not resolve the problems \n     of humanity. Using God's name to justify this path is \n     blasphemy.\n\n  Will the Chair announce today's business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/senate-section/article/S7959-6", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today I received an announcement of a \nlifetime. At 4 p.m. today, the President of the United States informed \nme that I will receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom. I want to \nthank him for this honor and to say that I am deeply, deeply touched to \njoin this group on November 14 of 17 Americans to receive this award.\n  The Presidential Medal of Freedom is the Nation's highest civilian \nhonor. It\n\n[[Page S7960]]\n\nis presented to individuals who have especially made contributions to \nthe security and national interests of the United States, to people who \nhave worked for world peace, who have found cures for incredible \ndiseases, and who have done cultural and other significant things of \npublic or private endeavors. To join that group I am, indeed, so \nhonored. For the President to do this has been something that I could \nnever have anticipated.\n  I have been very deeply honored to serve the people of Maryland and \nof this Nation. To the people of Maryland, I thank you. I could never \nhave had the opportunity to serve in the public sphere in such a way \nhad they not honored me with their confidence and trust by voting for \nme. I am so thankful for the opportunity that they have given me to \nactually serve my State and my country.\n  Yes, I am the longest serving woman in the Senate. But for me, it is \nnot how long I have served but how well I have tried to serve. To me, \nservice is about being connected to my constituents, staying close to \nthem, making sure they don't fall between the cracks, and looking out \nfor their day-to-day needs--whether a Social Security check, helping a \nveteran or working on issues such as college affordability.\n  For me, service has been rooted in the values I learned in my home \nand in my community. I think today of my father and mother, who worked \nso hard so that my sisters and I would get an education. They owned a \nsmall neighborhood grocery store. Every day at 6 in the morning, my \nfather would walk across the street from our row house home and open up \nthe door of his grocery store and say: Good morning. Can I help you?\n  That is the way I was raised, and that is what I have carried with me \nevery single day; that is: Good morning. Can I help you? But they also \nsaw that my sisters and I had a fantastic education. I had the \nopportunity to go to Catholic schools, and there the sisters taught us \nabout leadership and service. But actually they focused on the values \nof our faith: Love your neighbor, care for the sick, worry about the \npoor, always insist that neighbors should help neighbors, and it is \nbetter to light one little candle than to curse the darkness.\n  We were also raised to believe in the American dream. My great-\ngrandmother came to this country from Poland. She had little money in \nher pocket. Women didn't even have the right to vote when she arrived. \nShe had a big dream in her heart. If you worked hard and played by the \nrules, life would be better for you. She never thought, coming as she \ndid, that her own great-granddaughter would one day be a U.S. Senator. \nBut then that is only in America, where my story has been possible.\n  Only in America do we have this incredible right to speak our mind. I \ngot into politics as a protester. They wanted to put a highway through \nthe neighborhood in which I grew up and some other neighborhoods in the \ncity. I organized the ``Hell no, we won't go'' committee and took on \ncity hall.\n  Do you know what is so great about this country? In others, they put \nyou in jail and beat you. In this country, they sent me to the city \ncouncil, and I beat the political bosses.\n  This is an amazing country. Our Constitution, the freedoms guaranteed \nin it--the freedom of assembly, the freedom to speak, and most of all, \nthe freedom to serve and to be all that you can be--has been a \nmarvelous gift.\n  In a few days, I will be honored by the President of the United \nStates, but the real honor has always been to be here. I never dreamed \nsuch an honor would come my way, nor did I seek it. I am so deeply \nhonored to be touched by this, and I am honored to be among the people \nwho will get this award. Among those who will be honored is the dearly \nbeloved Shirley Chisholm, whom I served with in the House. She was \nalways unbought and unbossed. Willie Mays will be honored. He always \nbrought it home and knew where home plate was. Barbra Streisand, who \nalways hit the high notes, and, of course, even Yogi Berra, who shared \nmy love of language, are going to be honored. Young, distinguished \nAmericans like Katherine Johnson, who was one of the first African \nAmericans in space, and Lee Hamilton, who worked both in Congress and \nin the private sector to bring about world peace, will be honored. What \na distinguished group of Americans, and I will be glad to stand with \nthem.\n  I wish to thank President Obama for this tremendous honor. I thank \nthe people of Maryland for this tremendous opportunity to serve, and I \nthank the United States of America for enabling someone like me to \nfollow her dream. I hope, in getting this award, that I will continue \nto make my pledge to be of service.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes of debate prior to a vote on the Hall nomination.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for about 6 or 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n          Terrorist Attacks Against France And Syrian Refugees\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to express my deepest sympathies \nto the people of Paris and all those affected by the terrorist attacks \nof Islamic extremists. As we all know, hundreds of people were killed \nor injured in the attacks, including at least one American citizen. No \none should be faced with horrific violence when attending a soccer game \nor concert or simply carrying out their daily lives. On behalf of \nIowans, I stand with the people of France. I offer our support in \nrecovering from and responding to those attacks.\n  Unfortunately, there is fear that similar attacks could soon take \nplace on U.S. soil. There is even a video that ISIS released earlier \ntoday threatening to attack America. Moreover, if we follow the \nadministration's announced plans to bring in thousands of new Syrian \nrefugees, we could very well be letting in similar extremists who want \nto harm Americans. That is because it appears that at least one of the \nISIS terrorists in Paris had recently registered as a Syrian refugee in \nthe country of Greece. Until last Friday, he appeared to all the world \nto be no different from any of the other thousands of people fleeing \nthe chaos in Syria. This could happen here too.\n  The No. 1 responsibility under the Constitution of our Federal \nGovernment is to protect the homeland and to secure the country against \nall threats. We must do all we can to prevent a terrorist style attack \nfrom happening here, but under the administration's proposed plan, we \nmay not be able to stop such an attack. We cannot tell who among the \nthousands of Syrian refugees the administration wishes to resettle here \nare terrorists. One particularly alarming statement to this effect came \nfrom the Director of the FBI, James Comey. He was in a hearing before \nthe Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs just \non October 8 of this year. Director Comey said ``there are certain gaps \n. . . in the data available to us'' in screening Syrian refugees. This \ndata, which includes fingerprints, background and biographic \ninformation, is crucial for an adequate screening of potential refugees \nentering the United\n\n[[Page S7961]]\n\nStates. Director Comey continued in that hearing saying, ``There is \nrisk associated with bringing anybody in from the outside, but \nespecially from a conflict zone like that.''\n  Director Comey has also previously acknowledged that despite a large \npool of data on Iraqi refugees, our past program for admitting refugees \nfrom Iraq inadvertently allowed into our country ``a number of people \nwho were of serious concern, including two that were charged when we \nfound their fingerprints on improvised explosive devices from Iraq.''\n  Our ability to screen individuals from war-torn Syria is extremely \nlimited by comparison. Several States' Governors have recognized this \ndifficulty and have accordingly moved to suspend cooperation with the \nadministration in settling Syrian refugees in their States until those \nsecurity concerns are addressed. I share such concerns for protecting \nour country against terrorists who have clearly infiltrated the Syrian \nrefugee population. I recently wrote a letter to the leaders of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee. In that letter I asked that taxpayers' \nfunds be used effectively to properly and securely screen refugees \nentering the United States. I also requested in the letter that as part \nof the appropriations legislation before the committee, it require a \ncomprehensive plan on how security will be achieved. I requested this \nbe a condition for any funding for refugee resettlement for Syrian \nrefugees. I said then and I emphasize now that not one dollar should be \nexpended until stringent parameters for vetting these refugees are \nestablished.\n  I would also suggest to President Obama that he reconsider his plan \nto admit Syrian refugees until the dust settles and we get to the \nbottom of the Paris attacks. We need to analyze what happened. We need \nto figure out how we can better screen these refugees and ensure that \nterrorists among them are not evading proper screenings. We need a \ntimeout before we press forward.\n  I stress that the United States remains an extremely generous country \nwhen it comes to refugees. This year alone we will allow 75,000 \nrefugees fleeing persecution around the world to enter our country, but \nwe have to set our own citizens' security as a top priority. I call on \nCongress to act to ensure that this administration certifies that the \nmost stringent security standards are in place before allowing any more \nof the Syrian refugees into our country. It is our responsibility to do \neverything we can to prevent Friday's attacks from happening here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to vote \nto confirm this qualified judge, LaShann DeArcy Hall, to the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New York.\n  Ms. Hall is an outstanding choice to fill this position. After \ndecades of service in both the public sector and the private sector, \nMs. Hall's breadth of knowledge and depth of experience will guide her \nfor any case that happens to come before her. In her current role at a \nmajor international law firm, Ms. Hall specializes in high-stakes, \ncomplex commercial litigation. During her years of public service, \nincluding her time serving as a commissioner with the New York State \nJoint Commission on Public Ethics, Ms. Hall has worked tirelessly to \nhelp make her community a more fair and just place.\n  Ms. Hall's credentials are absolutely worthy of this position on the \nFederal bench, and we will be a stronger nation with more women like \nMs. Hall serving as judges in our Federal court system.\n  Ms. Hall is a graduate of Howard University School of Law and she \nserved in the U.S. Air Force. She is a highly accomplished lawyer, and \nshe has devoted her entire career to various forms of public service. \nShe is dedicated to her community, and she cares deeply about this \ncountry. LaShann DeArcy Hall would make an excellent Federal judge and \nwould add much needed diversity to the Federal bench.\n  Mr. President, I urge all my colleagues to vote to confirm her.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time \nremaining on this nomination be yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Wheeler\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the Presiding Officer, Senator Lankford, \nand I want to recognize and pay tribute to Army MSG Joshua Wheeler. \nJoshua was born in Roland, OK. He was deployed to Kirkuk Province, \nIraq, in support of Operation Inherent Resolve. I didn't remember him \nat the time, but I was there during that time. He was deployed to \nKirkuk to support Operation Inherent Resolve. That was his 14th \ndeployment in combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Joshua's unit, \nalong with Iraqi and Kurdish forces, raided a compound near the city of \nKirkuk, freeing 70 prisoners from captivity. Josh died of injuries \nsustained in that firefight. He would have turned 40 this month.\n  Josh attended and graduated from Muldrow High School in 1994, and a\n\n[[Page S7962]]\n\nclassmate of his, Ms. Tra Moreland, said this about Josh and his \ncharacter:\n\n       If you would have asked me 20 years ago, would he be the \n     man--the kind of man to do this, to give his life for \n     everyone else? I'd say most definitely! I wish everybody \n     could have known him!\n\n  Josh enlisted in the Army straight out of high school. During his \nmilitary career, he served in the 24th Infantry Regiment, 75th Ranger \nRegiment, and from 2004 until the events that bring us here today, he \nwas assigned to the U.S. Army Special Operations Command, where he \nserved with the Delta Force.\n  I think we all understand what the Delta Force is all about. It is a \nunit of the elite, the very best of the best. That was Josh--the best \nof the best. Josh was the epitome of a selfless and patriotic soldier.\n  Mr. Lance Hunter, Sergeant Wheeler's friend of 30 years, said that \nJosh was the kind of person who would stop and help a stranger change a \ntire on the side of the road and always dedicated himself to \nchallenges.\n\n       When he enlisted, I knew he would go as far as he could go. \n     He was made to be a soldier.\n\n  A soldier he was. During his career, Master Sergeant Wheeler had \nearned 11 Bronze Stars, including 4 with Valor Device, and countless \nother medals. He was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart for his \nactions during the raid on the ISIS prison. He is a true American hero.\n  Secretary of Defense Ash Carter expressed how selfless Sergeant \nWheeler's actions were, stating that ``they weren't part of the \noriginal rescue mission plan, but were critical to the mission's \nsuccess.'' In other words, he did something he didn't have to do. \nStill, the Secretary is one of thousands who know what a hero Josh \nreally is.\n  I was honored to hear that his hometown honored him by engraving his \nname in a stone monument and releasing hundreds of balloons in his \nmemory. On top of being a highly decorated soldier, he was a consummate \nfamily man and father of four. Joshua's grandfather, Mr. Jack Shamblin \nof Roland, OK, said his grandson loved fishing and hunting and was a \nfamily man and was always taking care of everyone else, including his \nfour half sisters.\n  His brother Zack said:\n\n       He was a soldier, but I didn't realize he had all of these \n     accomplishments, all these achievements--it just blows my \n     mind. He's an American hero, he just wanted to take care of \n     people.\n\n  Ms. April Isa, a classmate of Josh's and an English teacher now at \nthe old high school said:\n\n       He was always funny, even mischievous, but always the guy \n     who seemed like he had your back. Most of our class was \n     cliques, but he wasn't with just one group. He was friends \n     with everyone.\n\n  Josh lived a life for his family and friends. I had occasion to talk \nto Ashley, and I found out that he was a real Jesus guy. He loved \neveryone, and he knew what was going to happen to him, and we know \nwhere he is today. He will be remembered for his commitment to and \nbelief in the greatness of our Nation, and his memory and legacy will \ncontinue forever in the love of his wife Ashley and his four sons, \nZachariah, Matthew, Joshua Junior, and the youngest, David, just 3 \nmonths old.\n  The fight that took Josh's life is tragic. But make no mistake; his \nsacrifice made a difference and will continue to make a difference, not \njust in Iraq but in the security of our great Nation. We are safe in \nour country, and it is secure because of Josh and our service men and \nwomen. We must continue our unwavering support of them.\n  I extend our deepest gratitude and condolences to Josh's family. \nSenator Lankford and I are honored to pay tribute to this true American \nhero who volunteered to go into the fight and to make the ultimate \nsacrifice of his life for our freedom. It is my sincere hope that his \nfamily takes solace in knowing that their husband, father, brother, \ngrandson, and friend is a true American hero and will not be forgotten. \nWe say God bless you, Josh. We will see you again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate today \nto talk about the sacrifice of one of Oklahoma's own, MSG Joshua \nWheeler of Roland, OK, Sequoyah County, America. The current Presiding \nOfficer today is Senator Inhofe, and the two of us together recognize \nand celebrate the life of someone who laid down his life for the \nNation.\n  Roland and Muldrow are proud towns in eastern Oklahoma. It is \nCherokee country, where families take care of other families and small-\ntown American patriotism still thrives. It is the land of tall trees \nand very strong churches.\n  Josh was killed in action on October 22 while liberating captives \nheld by ISIL in northern Iraq. Josh was part of a team assisting \nKurdish commandos to rescue 70 hostages who were about to be executed \nby Islamic State militants. There was aerial reconnaissance that had \nshown a newly dug mass grave at the prison where these 70 prisoners \nwere being held.\n  When the Kurdish attack on the prison where the hostages were being \nheld stalled, Master Sergeant Wheeler responded. He could not watch the \nKurdish forces face the attack without help. He would not allow those \nmen inside the facility to face execution when he could help them \nescape. Master Sergeant Wheeler breached the wall. He engaged the \nenemy. The full force of the attack came directly at him, and he saved \nthe day and six dozen men.\n  You need to know that Master Sergeant Wheeler was the best of the \nbest, the most highly trained warrior in the entire Department of \nDefense. Josh deployed three times as a Ranger in support of combat \noperations in Afghanistan and Iraq, then Master Sergeant Wheeler was \nassigned to the U.S. Army Special Operations Command in 2004 and was \ndeployed 11 additional times in support of combat operations in Iraq \nand Afghanistan.\n  Master Sergeant Wheeler was highly decorated. We can see this from \nhis uniform. Let me tell you a little bit about his awards. They \nincluded four Bronze Star Medals with Valor Device; seven Bronze Star \nMedals; the Defense Meritorious Service Medal; the Meritorious Service \nMedal; the Air Medal; the Joint Service Commendation Medal with Valor \nDevice; the Joint Service Commendation Medal; seven Army Commendation \nMedals; the Joint Service Achievement Medal; eight Army Achievement \nMedals; the Good Conduct Medal, sixth award; the National Defense \nService Medal with Bronze Service Star; the Afghanistan Campaign Medal \nwith three Bronze Service Stars; the Iraq Campaign Medal with six \nBronze Service Stars; the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal; \nthe Global War on Terrorism Service Medal; the Noncommissioned Officer \nProfessional Development Ribbon, third award; the Army Service Ribbon; \nthe Presidential Unit Citation; the Valorous Unit Award, second award; \nthe Ranger Tab; the Combat Infantryman Badge; the Expert Infantryman \nBadge; the Master Parachutist Badge; three Overseas Service Bars; and \nfinally, posthumously, the Purple Heart.\n  He did everything his country asked him to do and more. Master \nSergeant Wheeler was the first American serviceman killed in combat in \nIraq since 2011. Americans, Kurds, and Iraqis alike owe Master Sergeant \nWheeler and his family our deepest gratitude and respect for a life of \nselfless service. John 15:13 tells us that no greater love is this, \nthan one who lays down his life for his friends. Josh did exactly that. \nMaster Sergeant Wheeler's sacrifice exemplifies the highest virtue in \ndefense of his family, friends, and Nation.\n  Speaking of his friends, they called him a cutup. He was someone who \nmade everyone laugh. He was a friend to everyone.\n  I spoke to his wife Ashley last week, and she recounted his faith, \ntoughness, and passion for his boys--all four of them. He was able to \ncome home a few months ago for the birth of his fourth son. It was a \npeaceful and joyous respite from the brutal realities of war that Josh \nfaced for years.\n  Josh spent his life defending the weak and standing up for those who \nneeded help. He spent much of his childhood caring for his siblings. He \nvalued life, freedom, and duty.\n\n[[Page S7963]]\n\n  In contrast to Master Sergeant Wheeler's heroism and selflessness, \nlet me remind you whom he was fighting against. In the days following \nthe Paris attack, we understand that the barbarians of ISIL had no \nproblem randomly killing people at a restaurant, soccer stadium, or \nconcert. They kill for intimidation and pleasure. They do not even \nvalue their own lives, much less the lives of the people around them. \nThe Islamic State has committed some of the most horrific acts of death \nthe modern world has ever seen. Their fight is against all modern \nsociety, and their goal is to return the world to a medieval state \nruled by fear. They have abducted girls and women, called them subhuman \nfor practicing the wrong religion according to them, and sold them as \nsex slaves. In the world of ISIL, women can't get an education, drive a \ncar, or even have their own rights. They kill and torture anyone who \ndoesn't agree with them. Their reach extends to our own citizens. No \none can forget the horrific deaths of James Foley, Stephen Sotloff, and \nKayla Mueller, a 26-year-old woman who wanted to do good for the people \nof Syria but met pure evil when she got there.\n  Recently, FBI Director James Comey spoke about ISIL's attempts to \ninspire Americans to turn on each other with blind brutality. Go out \nand kill, they say. It doesn't matter who, just act. Good men stand up \nto such evil. They don't allow it to grow and multiply.\n  We honor Master Sergeant Wheeler's sacrifice and tenacious commitment \nto confront evil. We humbly thank his family for the sacrifice they \nmade so that we may all live in a more peaceful world. Our Nation \ncannot say thank you loud enough or long enough to his family.\n  When I spoke to Ashley, Josh's wife, she recounted when the doorbell \nrang early that morning. It didn't even cross her mind that it was \nabout Josh. He was so tough and so dedicated. Who would have ever \nthought he would be gone? The painful and long process of grieving over \na lost hero has just begun. Master Sergeant Wheeler was killed in \naction defending our freedom on October 22. His final service will be \nthis week--just a few days before his birthday. The long days of \nThanksgiving and Christmas are still ahead.\n  Please join me in praying for the family of Master Sergeant Wheeler \nas our Nation grieves the loss of a husband, father, grandson, and \nfriend to those who knew him. He is a hero to the Nation and the many \nlives he saved a month ago this week. May God bless Josh's family. May \nhis boys grow up to be men who remember their dad's love for them and \nour Nation.\n  With that, I yield back.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to express what I know each of \nmy colleagues feels today. We, the 100 men and women of the U.S. \nSenate, send our sincere condolences to the people of France. From \nacross the Atlantic, Americans send condolences to the victims, to the \nfamilies, and to the first responders.\n  We understand the pain and the loss that accompany a terrorist \nattack. Some feel it in the most personal way. Some never come home. \nBut everyone shares in the loss. In our case, many shared in the \nresponse and the recovery as well.\n  In a dark hour we were reminded of the things that bound us together. \nI hope you will feel something similar take hold in your terrible hour \nas well.\n  We have already seen rays of light begin to shine through the \ndarkness. We saw it even last Friday. Then, as Paris reeled, a soft hum \nemanated from a tunnel. ``March,'' came the echo in French. ``March \non.'' Enemies in history and rivals on the soccer pitch had united \naround a common humanity. Dazed, disoriented but alive, French and \nGerman fans marched through the tunnels together. Some put defiance to \nverse. ``Against us,'' they sang, ``tyranny has unfurled its bloody \nbanner.'' And indeed, that night it had. A song sung so many times \nbefore came alive with new meaning that horrible night. Many knew it as \nthe French national anthem, but that night it became an aria for their \nsorrow and an ode to their fraternity. We heard it here, from an ocean \naway.\n  We add our voices to the harmony now. We know that the attacks were \nnot just directed at the victims we mourn today but also at modernity \nand the free world.\n  President Obama has called ISIL the face of evil. It clearly presents \na challenge to NATO, to our moderate Sunni allies, and to the United \nStates. It has also shown that it can attack innocent victims in the \nWest, too--right where they live. These terrorists have declared their \nintention to do so again and again.\n  We know that trying to contain ISIL's conventional advance as an \noperational concept has proven insufficient in the face of determined \nterrorist attacks, but we also know something else. With resolve and \ndetermination, ISIL can be defeated. It won't be easy. It won't come \nquickly or without cost, but we also have no other option.\n  I look forward to engaging with President Obama to determine his \nstrategy and the tools that will be necessary to achieve it. We are \nlooking forward to hearing the President's proposed strategy when \nSenators are briefed by the White House later this week. Whatever he \ndoes, though, I would encourage him to work cooperatively with both \nparties on the way forward. This is a challenge that is going to \nrequire all of our efforts to confront, and it is a discussion that \nwill be ongoing.\n  But today is a time to remember and to reflect. We have the people of \nFrance in our thoughts today. That is true here in the Senate, and it \nis certainly true out across our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/senate-section/article/S7963-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7963-S7964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we will vote on the nomination of \nLaShann Hall to be a Federal district judge in the Eastern District of \nNew York. She was nominated over a year\n\n[[Page S7964]]\n\nago, and her nomination was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by \nunanimous voice vote more than 5 months ago. Ms. Hall is an outstanding \nAfrican-American attorney who will fill a judicial emergency vacancy. \nThere is no reason Senate Republicans should have delayed her \nconfirmation for this long.\n  The Senate this week should also vote on the next nominee on the \ncalendar, who was nominated on the same day over a year ago as Ms. \nHall. Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo will be the first ever Hispanic judge \nfrom Pennsylvania on the third circuit. Judge Restrepo has strong \nbipartisan support from his home State Senators, Senator Toomey and \nSenator Casey, and there is an urgent need to fill the emergency \nvacancy on the third circuit to which he has been nominated. I have \nheard no objection to his nomination, and Senator Toomey has said he \nnot only strongly supports Judge Restrepo's confirmation, but he also \nrecommended him to the President. I hope the majority leader will \nfinally schedule his vote this week.\n  In the 11 months that the Senate has been under Republican control \nthis year, the Senate has only voted to confirm nine judges. This \nobstruction has resulted in needless delays for hard-working Americans \nwho seek justice in our Federal courts. Currently pending on the Senate \nfloor are nominees who would fill judicial emergency vacancies in \nPennsylvania, Tennessee, Minnesota, New Jersey, Iowa, New York, and \nCalifornia. Senate Republicans have refused to alleviate the urgent \nneeds in those States. It does not have to be this way. When Senate \nDemocrats were in the majority during the last 2 years of the Bush \nPresidency, we had already confirmed 36 judges by this same time. We \nmade sure that we fulfilled our constitutional duty to provide advice \nand consent to ensure that the American people had a fully functioning \nFederal judiciary.\n  Senate Republicans' obstruction has caused judicial vacancies to pile \nup across the country. Since Senate Republicans took over the majority \nat the beginning of the year, judicial vacancies have increased by more \nthan 50 percent. The number of ``judicial emergency'' vacancies since \nSenate Republicans took the majority has risen by a stunning 158 \npercent. The American people deserve better.\n  We should follow well-established Senate precedent by confirming all \nconsensus nominees before the end of the year. Each of the judicial \nnominees pending on the Executive Calendar was reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote. And each has the backing \nof their home State Senators, including Republican Senators. In fact, \nthe next nominee after Ms. Hall and Judge Restrepo is Travis McDonough \nwho has been nominated to fill a judicial vacancy on the Eastern \nDistrict of Tennessee. Next week will mark the 1-year anniversary since \nMr. McDonough was nominated, but it appears there is no relief in sight \nas his nomination continues to be held up by Senate Republicans, \ndespite the strong support he has from his home State Senators, Senator \nAlexander and Senator Corker. I see no reason why he and the rest of \nthe nominees pending should not be confirmed before we recess at the \nend of the year. As the New York Times put it in an editorial last \nFriday urging confirmation votes on all pending judicial nominees, \n``With each day that passes without a vote on Judge Restrepo and other \nnominees, Republicans undermine the justice system, and the biggest \nvictims are ordinary Americans who cannot count on fully functioning \ncourts.'' I ask unanimous consent that this editorial be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Shortly we will begin voting on LaShann Hall to fill a judicial \nemergency vacancy in the Federal District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of New York. She is currently a partner at the law firm of \nMorrison & Foerster, LLP, in New York, where she has practiced since \n2010. She was previously in private practice at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher \nLLP and at Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP. She has the support of her two \nhome State Senators, Senator Schumer and Senator Gillibrand. She was \nvoted out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote on June 4, \n2015. I urge my fellow Senators to support her confirmation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 13, 2015]\n\n                    Confirm President Obama's Judges\n\n                        (By the Editorial Board)\n\n       On Nov. 12, 2014, President Obama nominated Luis Felipe \n     Restrepo to a judgeship on the federal Court of Appeals for \n     the Third Circuit. Judge Restrepo, who already sits on the \n     United States District Court in Philadelphia, seemed to \n     secure the support of both Pennsylvania senators--Bob Casey, \n     a Democrat, and Pat Toomey, a Republican.\n       But that does not mean that Judge Restrepo, whom Mr. Toomey \n     called ``a very well-qualified candidate'' who would ``make a \n     superb addition'' to the appeals court, will actually get \n     through the confirmation roadblock led by Senate Republicans. \n     Mr. Toomey, despite his professed support, is responsible for \n     a big part of it, refusing for six months to sign off on the \n     nomination by exploiting a pointless tradition that allows \n     home-state senators to block a nomination with no explanation \n     needed. He claimed that he was waiting for a background \n     check, even though Judge Restrepo passed a check two years \n     ago for his current job. The Senate Judiciary Committee \n     approved Judge Restrepo for the appeals court seat in July. \n     There has been no explanation for the holdup since then.\n       As a Hispanic and a former public defender, Judge Restrepo \n     would bring a needed measure of ethnic and professional \n     diversity to the court. But he is just one of many judicial \n     nominees awaiting action. Thirteen have not received a \n     hearing by the Judiciary Committee, and 16 others, including \n     Judge Restrepo, have been approved by the committee, all \n     unanimously, but are still waiting for a full vote on the \n     Senate floor.\n       Since Republicans took over in January, the Senate has \n     confirmed only nine of President Obama's nominees, the \n     slowest pace in more than half a century. Meanwhile, the seat \n     Judge Restrepo would fill is one of 30 long-vacant federal \n     judgeships the court system deems ``judicial emergencies,'' \n     meaning they have a backlog of hundreds of cases.\n       Republicans say that Mr. Obama has seen more of his \n     judicial nominees confirmed than President George W. Bush had \n     by this time in his tenure in 2007. But that is mainly \n     because Senate Democrats in 2013 stopped Republicans from \n     repeatedly using the filibuster to block qualified nominees. \n     After that, the Democratic-led Senate confirmed 96 of Mr. \n     Obama's picks. The more relevant fact is there are 67 \n     judicial vacancies today, far more than the number of \n     vacancies Mr. Bush faced in 2007.\n       The larger problem here, of course, is that Republicans are \n     blocking votes on highly qualified and noncontroversial \n     nominees to vent their anger with the president, who \n     infuriated them with his now-stalled immigration action, \n     among other things.\n       Judges are not the only casualties of this interbranch \n     crossfire. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, another \n     unquestionably qualified candidate, waited almost six months \n     before finally getting a vote.\n       Senate Democrats should make these inexcusable delays a \n     national issue. Mr. Obama, meanwhile, could start selecting \n     judges himself in states like Texas, Alabama, Wisconsin and \n     Indiana, where senators refuse to give him any names at all.\n       With each day that passes without a vote on Judge Restrepo \n     and other nominees, Republicans undermine the justice system, \n     and the biggest victims are ordinary Americans who cannot \n     count on fully functioning courts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/senate-section/article/S7964-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7964-S7965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING NATIONAL REVIEW\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I wish to honor and congratulate National \nReview for 60 years of valuable contributions to American political \ndiscourse.\n  When a 29-year-old William F. Buckley, Jr., published National \nReview's first edition on November 19, 1955, it marked not just the \nbirth of a magazine, but also the birth of the modern conservative \nmovement. Under 45 years of Mr. Buckley's leadership, National Review \nserved as the standard bearer of conservative thought in America, where \nreaders could expect to find leading thinkers such as Ronald Reagan, \nMargaret Thatcher, and Milton Freidman to name a few. It influenced \ngenerations of conservatives, including this conservative, with its \nfrequently humorous and always intelligent writing, and it consistently \npublished valuable commentaries on public events and figures, foreign \nand domestic affairs, culture, politics, and the economy.\n  During Mr. Buckley's tenure, National Review did more than just \nobserve and comment on the course of human events; it helped shape \nthem. It played a central role in the ``Reagan Revolution.'' Its \nsteadfast defense of liberty, free markets, and personal responsibility \nprovided much of the intellectual underpinnings of America's triumph \nover communist tyranny in Europe and around the world.\n\n[[Page S7965]]\n\n  Mr. Buckley's successors have ably carried on this proud tradition at \nNational Review. It remains tremendously influential. With over 150,000 \nsubscribers, it is the most read opinion magazine in America. Millions \nmore visit National Review Online every month.\n  More importantly, Mr. Buckley's successors have carried on as \nchampions of the conservative movement. Every 2 weeks National Review \narrives on my desk and serves as a reminder that conservative thought \nis alive and well in America.\n  Over the past 60 years, National Review has lived up to its founding \nstatement so eloquently expressed by Mr. Buckley. To paraphrase, \nNational Review continues to stand athwart history, yelling ``stop,'' \nwhen no other is inclined to do so, or to have much patience with those \nwho so urge it.\n  Congratulations to all those who have made National Review a success \nover these last 60 years. Your contributions to American political \ndiscourse will serve as an inspiration and as a challenge to future \ngenerations of conservative thinkers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/senate-section/article/S7965-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DISCHARGE PETITION--S.J.

Mr. President, today, I wish to congratulate Ivan \nBell Woodford on being selected to serve as grand marshal for the city \nof Reno's Veterans Day Parade. As Nevada's oldest living World War II \nveteran, there is no doubt Mr. Woodford deserves this honor. It gives \nme great pleasure to recognize his years of service to both the United \nStates of America and our great State.\n  Mr. Woodford grew up at Lake Elsinore, working on the family ranch. \nHe later enlisted in the United States Navy in 1942 as a Seabee. \nThroughout World War II, he served at Pearl Harbor and Midway Island, \noperating heavy equipment and cranes to clear debris from the \ndestruction of the war. His unit was later stationed in the \nPhilippines.\n  In 1946, Mr. Woodford established his residency in Reno, working for \nlocal excavating companies as a heavy machinery operator. He worked for \nmore than 30 years in this industry, helping complete various projects \nthroughout Reno and Lake Tahoe. He aided in laying the foundation of \nhousing pads across Reno, leveling the ground for construction projects \nnear Lake Tahoe, drudging what is now Virginia Lake, and cleaning \nirrigation ditches to develop Spanish Springs Valley. He also worked \nheavy machinery during the development of Interstate 80 and many other \nroads throughout Washoe Valley, leaving his mark in northern Nevada for \ngenerations to come. No doubt, he witnessed and contributed to some of \nthe largest growth and expansion throughout the area.\n  His many contributions to making our State the best it can be, as \nwell as his service to this country, demonstrates his generous \ncharacter. His actions represent only the greatest of Nevada's values \nand place him among the outstanding men and women who have valiantly \ndefended our nation. Our State is fortunate to have someone like Mr. \nWoodford to serve as a role model.\n  As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I recognize \nthat Congress has a responsibility not only to honor the brave \nindividuals who serve our Nation, but also to ensure they are cared for \nwhen they return home. I remain committed to upholding this promise for \nveterans, like Mr. Woodford, in Nevada and throughout the Nation.\n  Mr. Woodford has demonstrated professionalism, commitment to \nexcellence, and dedication to the highest standards of the United \nStates Navy. His work throughout Nevada is invaluable. I am both \nhumbled and honored by his service and am proud to call him a fellow \nNevadan. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Mr. \nWoodford for all of his accomplishments, as well as his participation \nin the city of Reno's Veterans Day Parade.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/senate-section/article/S7965-4", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7965-S7966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BRIAN BURTON\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Brian \nBurton, president and chief executive officer of Three Square, for his \ntireless efforts in enhancing the lives of many across southern Nevada. \nMr. Burton brings more than 20 years of nonprofit experience to Three \nSquare, helping feed thousands of southern Nevadans who would otherwise \ngo hungry. Mr. Burton has contributed greatly to his community by \nworking to make Three Square the best it can be.\n  Largely due to Mr. Burton's many years of hard work, Three Square is \nable to offer a variety of programs to help those who would normally go \nwithout a wholesome meal. The organization works to source food, raise \nmoney, and grow its volunteer base to provide food to outside partners \nthat distribute meals directly to those in need. Three Square services \nClark, Nye, Lincoln, and Esmeralda Counties, feeding over 300,000 \nNevadans. Our State is fortunate to have someone such as Mr. Burton \nrunning this organization, which is critical to many across southern \nNevada.\n  Previously, Mr. Burton served as executive director for Wilkinson \nCenter in Dallas, TX, a nonprofit organization serving low-income \nfamilies with food assistance, education, and case management. In his \ncurrent position, Mr. Burton works to further develop and grow the \norganization, increase program sustainability and community engagement, \ndiversify and increase fundraising, and offer public policy work. His \ncontributions to this incredible organization are immense, and his \nefforts have not gone unnoticed.\n  I extend my deepest gratitude to Mr. Burton for his noble \ncontributions to communities across southern Nevada and to the many \nindividuals who have benefited from his work. He is a shining example \nof someone who strives for the betterment of his community and displays \ntrue selflessness in his work. I am thankful to have Mr. Burton serving \nas an ally to Nevadans in need.\n  Today I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in recognizing \nMr. Burton and his work for Three Square, a program whose mission is \nboth honorable and necessary. I wish Mr. Burton the best of luck in all \nof his future endeavors.\n\n[[Page S7966]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/senate-section/article/S7966-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO BETTY VANDIVER\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, it is an honor for me to pay \ntribute today to Betty Russell Vandiver, the former first lady of the \nState of Georgia from 1959 to 1963.\n  Sybil Elizabeth ``Betty'' Russell Vandiver is the wonderful wife of \nthe late Georgia Governor, Earnest Vandiver. She also is the niece of \nRichard B. Russell, Jr., the former Georgia Senator and Governor after \nwhom one of our U.S. Senate office buildings was named and where my \noffice in Washington, DC, is located. But Betty Vandiver is more than \nthat.\n  At the time, Mrs. Vandiver became first lady in 1959, Central State \nHospital in Milledgeville, GA, served as the State's only State \nhospital for the mentally ill and developmentally disabled. In the late \n1950s, Central State Hospital was home to more than 12,000 patients, \nmany of whom had been abandoned by their families at an early age.\n  After visiting the hospital, Mrs. Vandiver became concerned about \nthese patients, and she determined that she would devote much of her \ntime and energy as first lady to raising public awareness of the needs \nof Georgia's mentally ill and developmentally disabled.\n  One of Mrs. Vandiver's initiatives included working with the Georgia \nMunicipal Association to create a statewide Christmas gift collection \ndrive known as the Mayors' Motorcade. This special event was \nestablished in 1959 and expanded years later to support the inhabitants \nof the State's regional hospitals. Since then, caring Georgians support \nthe Mayors' Motorcade each year by donating gifts to cities \nparticipating in the program.\n  Through Mrs. Vandiver's efforts, thousands and thousands of patients \nresiding at Georgia's State hospitals have received Christmas gifts and \nvisits from city officials at special motorcade events.\n  On December 1, 2015, we will celebrate Betty Vandiver Day in Georgia. \nToday it is my pleasure to honor Mrs. Vandiver for having the vision to \ncreate the Mayors' Motorcade program as a way of providing not only \ngifts, but also critical public awareness about the needs of Georgia's \nmentally ill and developmentally disabled.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/senate-section/article/S7966-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                100TH ANNIVERSARY OF BOY SCOUT TROOP 283\n\n Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, today I celebrate the 100th \nanniversary of Boy Scout Troop 283 of Wayzata, MN, which occurred on \nNovember 15, 2015. Troop 283 is the oldest continually chartered troop \nin the State and has counted thousands of Scouts as its members since \nits inception.\n  The development of character, physical fitness, and civic engagement \nhave always been central tenants of the Boy Scouts. The Scouts of Troop \n283 epitomize these values and continue to learn the skills necessary \nto be compassionate, tolerant, and dynamic leaders. In fact, to date, \n151 of Troop 283's Scouts have earned the rank of Eagle Scout, the \nhighest rank attainable within the Boy Scouts. Each aspiring Eagle \nScout must complete a demanding Eagle project that showcases their \nability and willingness to serve their community. These Eagle projects, \nalong with a myriad of other service projects completed by the Scouts \nof Troop 283, have demonstrated their positive impact to Wayzata and \nthe surrounding community. I am confident that Troop 283 will continue \nto be a positive influence well into the future.\n  I recognize Troop 283 for its 100 years of service to Wayzata and the \ngreat State of Minnesota. To the Scouts of Troop 283 and the family and \nfriends that support them, thank you and congratulations on your 100th \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/senate-section/article/S7966-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/senate-section/article/S7966-4", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  In executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/senate-section/article/S7966-5", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 6:53 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the amendment of the Senate to the resolution (H.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize \nthe C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program and the National Cord \nBlood Inventory, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Stem Cell \nTherapeutic and Research Reauthorization Act of 2015. I am glad to have \nSenators Reed, Burr, and Franken joining me as sponsors of this \nbipartisan bill that will reauthorize critical, innovative, and life-\nsaving programs.\n  We have been working on this legislation throughout the year and have \nmet with stakeholders in blood cell transplantation to receive their \ninput. We also included members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor \nand Pension Committee who are deeply committed to passing this \nlegislation.\n  In drafting this legislation, we also collaborated with our \ncounterparts in the House of Representatives. I am grateful for the \nleadership of Congressman Chris Smith and Congresswoman Doris Matsui, \nwho did so much to get this legislation through the House. I commend my \ncolleagues and their staffs for their hard work.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to provide some history and background \nthat will explain why this reauthorization bill is so important. This \nlegislation will reauthorize for another five years both the C.W. Bill \nYoung Cell Transplantation Program and the National Cord Blood \nInventory, which are administered by the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration. These vital programs provide access to life-saving \ntreatments for serious conditions and disease.\n  Bone marrow contains blood-forming stem cells that develop into the \nthree blood cell types that keep the body healthy. The body uses those \nred blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets as building blocks \nfor blood, tissue, and organs. These blood cells die naturally, and the \nbody must continuously make new ones. Serious health problems can \ndevelop in people whose bone marrow cannot make enough new blood cells \nto replace the cells that die.\n  Cord blood is a newborn baby's blood that remains in the placenta or \nafterbirth. This blood can be collected after delivery at no risk to \nthe mother and baby. Like bone marrow, cord blood is also rich with \nstem cells, and doctors can use it as an alternative to bone marrow \ntransplant. In fact, research in the mid-1980s highlighted the promise \nof cord blood, demonstrating that it is more highly enriched with \nblood-forming stem cells than bone marrow.\n  Cord blood transplantation has been used successfully to treat \nleukemia, lymphoma, immunodeficiency diseases, sickle cell anemia, and \ncertain metabolic diseases. In addition to treating cancer and other \nblood diseases, researchers are currently testing stem cells for a host \nof disorders, including autoimmune and genetic disorders.\n  Cord blood research is also showing potential for use in the \ninnovative fields of cellular therapy and regenerative medicine. \nVaccines derived from cord blood to use against viruses and certain \ntypes of cancers are currently in early trials. Research has also \nindicated that cord blood could be used to treat conditions for which \nfew treatments are available, such as stroke, cerebral palsy, hearing \nloss, autism, and traumatic brain injury.\n  Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg of the Carolinas Blood Bank is one of the \nworld's leading stem cell researchers at Duke University in Durham, \nNorth Carolina. At the time of that groundbreaking scientific research \nin the 1980s, Dr. Kurtzberg was caring for a 5 year old boy named \nMatthew who had a rare, inherited blood disorder called Fanconi \nanemia--a disease that leads to bone marrow failure. In light of the \nnew scientific findings, doctors planned a cord blood transplant for \nMatthew at a hospital in Paris, France, using fully matched cord blood \nthat had been collected during the birth of his newly born baby sister. \nMatthew's transplant in 1988 was a success, laying the groundwork for \ncord blood transplantation.\n  Matthew is now in his 30s. He is married, working, and living a \nhealthy and productive life. He is living proof that cord blood \ncontains stem cells that can replenish the bone marrow and immune \nsystem throughout a patient's life.\n  In 1993, with the assistance of Dr. Pablo Rubenstein of the New York \nBlood Center, Dr. Kurtzberg performed the world's first unrelated donor \ncord blood transplant at Duke University. Over the following years, \nthese amazing research doctors discovered more about the use of cord \nblood transplantation in patients who cannot find a fully matched \ndonor.\n  Dr. Kurtzberg is also the president of the Cord Blood Association, \nCBA. I am thankful for Dr. Kurtzberg and the CBA's support in helping \nus develop meaningful legislation that will help cord blood banks do \ntheir jobs. I also owe gratitude for the input and guidance on this \nreauthorization bill that my staff and I received from Mike Boo and Dr. \nJeffrey Chell with the National Marrow Donor Program, NMDP.\n  I am proud to have a long history of working on this issue. In early \n2003, I met with Joanne Kurtzberg, Pablo Rubenstein, and Phil Coelho of \nThermogenesis Corporation to discuss umbilical cord blood therapies as \na promising alternative to bone marrow transplantation and how the \nFederal Government could help to increase collection efforts.\n  That night, I called Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy \nThompson to talk to him about this new science, and he agreed to meet \nwith Joanne, Pablo, and Phil the very next day. Staff from the Health \nResources and Services Administration, the Food and Drug \nAdministration, and the National Institutes of Health joined us for \nthat discussion. Secretary Thompson stressed that cord blood banks \nwould need to be managed through HRSA and promised to support my \nlegislation.\n  In October 2003, I introduced a bill to amend the Public Health \nService Act to establish a National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network \nto prepare, store, and distribute human umbilical cord blood stems \ncells for the treatment of patients and to support peer-reviewed \nresearch using those cells. That bill, the Cord Blood Stem Cell Act of \n2003, S. 1717, gained strong bipartisan support over the last few \nmonths of the 108th Congress.\n  Although it did not pass the Senate, my 2003 bill helped to generate \nmore interest in and support for blood stem cell transplantation. I \nkept working on legislation to help increase access to these life-\nsaving transplants in the following Congress. In April 2005, the \nInstitute of Medicine, IOM, issued recommendations to create a national \ncord blood network. Those of us in Congress who had been working on \ncord blood and bone marrow realized that combining our bipartisan, \nbicameral efforts would benefit patients by increasing treatment \noptions and encouraging future research. We reviewed the IOM report and \nincorporated those important recommendations into one comprehensive \nbill.\n  That legislation, the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005, \nP.L. 109-129, that was signed into law on December 20, 2005, created \nthe National Cord Blood Inventory and established an inventory goal of \nat least 150,000 new and diverse cord blood stem cell units.\n\n[[Page S7969]]\n\n  The 2005 law also combined the NCBI with the bone marrow donor \nprogram that had been created in 1986 by the late Congressman Bill \nYoung to create a single point of access for blood stem cell \ntransplants and research. This single point of access allows physicians \nthe ability to search for any potential adult volunteer bone marrow \ndonor or umbilical cord blood unit anywhere across the globe.\n  Finally, our 2005 law also named the program the C.W. Bill Young Cell \nTransplantation Program, in honor of Bill's tireless efforts to promote \nbone marrow donation and transplantation.\n  Five years later, I was the lead sponsor of the Stem Cell Therapeutic \nand Research Reauthorization Act of 2010, P.L. 111-264, which was \nsigned into law on October 8, 2010, and reauthorized the Program and \nthe NCBI for another 5 years. The 2010 law also placed new emphasis on \nexploring innovations in cord blood collection and increasing the \nnumber of collection sites across the nation.\n  Great progress has been made toward achieving the NCBI's goal of at \nleast 150,000 diverse cord blood units; however, data suggest that the \nnumber of available cord blood units in the United States is still \ninsufficient to meet the estimated need for unrelated transplant, which \nhas increased by 25 percent since 2005. The number of transplants for \npatients in minority populations has increased from 253 in 2000 to 990 \nin 2014. Much of this increase can be attributed to the increased \npotential for bone marrow or cord blood transplant. This is exciting, \npromising science.\n  There are still challenges to the success of bone marrow and cord \nblood transplantation. Not all cord blood units contain enough cells to \ntransplant into all patients. In many cases, more than one unit is \npreferred or necessary for larger children or adults. New science \nindicates the possibility that using larger, higher quality cord blood \nunits will reduce the incidence of graft-versus-host disease, GVHD, a \nserious complication of blood cell transplantation in which the donor \ncells attack the recipient. GVHD is the biggest barrier to successful \ntransplantation.\n  I am glad to know that the Advisory Council and HRSA have been \nworking with public cord blood banks to discuss ways to increase CBU \nquality and diversity. As the inventory continues to grow, the diverse \nunits within the NCBI will serve an increasing number of patients that \nhave difficulty obtaining cells from well-matched adult donors.\n  Cell dose and degree of match between patient and CBU are both \nstrongly associated with transplant outcomes. A larger inventory of \npublicly available CBUs also will contribute to improved patient \nsurvival after transplant because a growing inventory of high cell \ncount CBUs will allow better tissue matches.\n  Cord blood banks have told us that they cannot do this on their own. \nWithout continued support from HRSA, this life-saving science would be \nfinancially unsustainable. We must reauthorize this important program.\n  Today, I am introducing the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research \nReauthorization Act of 2015 to further advance the important work of \nthe bone marrow and cord blood programs.\n  Passage of this legislation will preserve the commitment that the \nCongress made three decades ago to help patients with blood cancers and \nother life-threatening diseases by helping to increase access to life-\nsaving transplants. It will also open the doors to new discoveries \nwithin the fields of cellular therapy and regenerative medicine. I am \nproud to introduce the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research \nReauthorization Act of 2015, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Stem \nCell Therapeutic and Research Reauthorization Act of 2015 with Senators \nHatch, Franken, and Burr. This bill offers promise to the tens of \nthousands of individuals diagnosed with leukemia and lymphomas, sickle \ncell anemia, and rare genetic blood disorders.\n  It will reauthorize the C.W. Bill Young National Marrow Donor \nProgram, which has been helping to connect individuals in need of a \nbone marrow transplant with donors since 1986, and the National Cord \nBlood Inventory, which has been helping to connect individuals in need \nof an umbilical cord blood transplant with donors since 1999.\n  The public registries, made up of donors from all over the country, \nhave been a true lifeline for the Americans who have found an unrelated \nmatch. By strengthening and enhancing the important programs operating \nthese registries, many more Americans will be afforded the opportunity \nto find a match if they are ever in need.\n  I look forward to swift consideration of this legislation in the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and working toward \npassage in the full Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DAINES (for himself and Mr. Risch):\n  S. 2283. A bill to ensure that small business providers of broadband \nInternet access service can devote resources to broadband deployment \nrather than compliance with cumbersome regulatory requirements; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, small businesses are the backbone of \nAmerica. They generate more than half of the country's private GDP and \nsupport millions of families. In Montana, thanks to technology, \ngeography is no longer a constraint and entrepreneurs have been able to \nbuild world-class companies without leaving the state.\n  Access to the global marketplace is largely dependent on access to \nthe Internet. Large incumbent carriers often do not have enough of an \nincentive to serve rural America so States like Montana really depend \non small businesses to fill in the gaps and connect our communities. \nWithout small broadband providers, many Montanans would remain \nunserved. This is why it is so important to support our small \nbusinesses and allow them to continue to provide jobs and economic \ngrowth in their communities.\n  Burdensome regulations like the FCC's net neutrality rules are \nstrangling our small businesses and preventing growth and investment. \nThe enhanced transparency requirements in particular require small \nbusinesses to disclose an excess amount of information including \nnetwork packet loss, network performance by geographic area, network \nperformance during peak usage, network practices concerning a \nparticular group of users, triggers that activate network practices, \nand the list goes on. Small companies like Grizzly Internet in West \nYellowstone, MO, operate with only three employees and do not have a \nteam of attorneys dedicated to regulatory compliance. Small businesses \nsimply do not have the bandwidth to take on additional regulatory \nburdens.\n  That is why I am proud to introduce the Small Business Broadband \nDeployment Act of 2015 with my colleague Senator Risch. The bill makes \npermanent the FCC's temporary small business exception to the net \nneutrality enhanced transparency requirements. There is broad support \nin the record for a small business exception, including support from \nthe American Cable Association, Rural Wireless Association, Competitive \nCarriers Association, Wireless Internet Service Providers Association, \nCTIA--The Wireless Association, Rural Broadband Provider Coalition, \nWTA--Advocates for Rural Broadband. Additionally, the Small Business \nAdministration's Office of Advocacy filed comments with the FCC \nstating, ``Advocacy has concerns that compliance with the enhanced \ntransparency requirements under the 2015 Open Internet Order is not \nfeasible for small broadband providers, particularly small rural \nproviders, and may ultimately degrade the quality of service that \nconsumers receive from small providers.'' Providing relief from over \n300 pages of net neutrality rules will allow small businesses to focus \non deploying infrastructure and serving their customers rather than \nspending time on regulatory compliance.

Res. 313\n\n       Whereas, on November 13, 2015, at least eight armed gunmen \n     and suicide bombers conducted six separate attacks across the \n     city of Paris, France, killing at least 129 civilians and \n     wounding over 350 innocent men, women, and children;\n       Whereas these horrific attacks mark the deadliest violence \n     to strike the Republic of France since World War II, the \n     worst act of terrorism to strike Europe since the 2004 \n     attacks in Madrid, Spain, that killed 191 and wounded \n     approximately 1,800 others, and one of the worst terrorist \n     acts carried out on Western soil since the catastrophic \n     attacks of September 11, 2001;\n       Whereas Paris is still grieving from the January 7, 2015, \n     terrorist attack on the offices of the French newspaper \n     Charlie Hebdo that brutally murdered 12 people and injured at \n     least 11 others;\n       Whereas President of the Republic of France Francois \n     Hollande has declared a national state of emergency and \n     deployed approximately 1,500 military members across the city \n     of Paris;\n       Whereas President Hollande condemned these events as ``an \n     act of war that was committed by a terrorist army, a jihadist \n     army, Daesh'';\n       Whereas President Hollande further declared that ``when \n     terrorists are capable of committing such atrocities they \n     must be certain that they are facing a determined France, a \n     united France, a France that is together and does not let \n     itself be moved, even if today we express infinite sorrow'';\n       Whereas President Barack Obama called these heinous actions \n     not just an attack on Paris and the people of France, but an \n     attack on all of humanity and the universal values that we \n     share;\n       Whereas the Republic of France is America's oldest ally, \n     dating back to Marquis de Lafayette, and the people of the \n     United States and France mutually share a debt of gratitude \n     that dates from the formation of our republics through two \n     world wars;\n       Whereas the people of the Republic of France have expressed \n     solidarity with the people of the United States, including \n     following the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, which \n     claimed the lives of thousands of innocent civilians in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the French people have made manifest their \n     commitment to the United States by partnering with United \n     States forces in Afghanistan and Iraq and as an important \n     partner in the fight against extremist terrorism in Mali and \n     around the world;\n       Whereas at least one United States citizen was murdered in \n     these heinous attacks and at least four others were injured; \n     and\n       Whereas these attacks represent both an assault on freedom \n     and democracy and an unmitigated evil that the United States \n     and United States allies must stand united to defeat: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the brutal attacks on the people of Paris that \n     resulted in the death of at least 129 people, including one \n     United States citizen, through shootings, hostage-taking, and \n     suicide bombings of innocent, civilian targets;\n       (2) expresses its heartfelt condolences and deepest \n     sympathies for the victims and family members of those \n     attacked;\n       (3) renews the solidarity of the people and Government of \n     the United States with the people and Government of the \n     Republic of France; and\n       (4) pledges support for the Government of France to pursue \n     justice against those involved in these heinous attacks and \n     to prevent future attacks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/senate-section/article/S7970-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                     Committee on Foreign Relations\n\n  Mr. MORAN.
