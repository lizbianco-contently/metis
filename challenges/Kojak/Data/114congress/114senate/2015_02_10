Mr. President, I move to proceed to H.R. 240.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 5, H.R. 240, a bill \n     making appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security \n     for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, many Americans have already started the \nprocess of filling out their tax returns. It is a stressful time of \nyear, but thanks to ObamaCare many are sure to find it even more \nstressful. Part of this is because of ObamaCare's $1 trillion-plus in \ntax increases.\n  If you have health insurance ObamaCare has a tax for that. If you \ndon't have health insurance, ObamaCare has a tax for that too. Whether \ngovernment bureaucrats deem your coverage generous or not generous \nenough, ObamaCare has a tax for you.\n  Some of these taxes are paid by consumers directly. Others are passed \nalong in the form of higher premiums, increased costs, and lost \nopportunities, but many fall on the shoulders of the middle class.\n  There is more to the issue, too, because ObamaCare has done what many \nthought impossible, it has made a mind-numbingly complex Tax Code even \nmore so.\n  For the first time, the government will be asking on our tax returns \nif we had health insurance for every month of last year. If someone \ndidn't--well, you guessed it--ObamaCare has a tax for that, too, but \nthis is only a portion of the cost and complexity ObamaCare threatens \nto impose on millions this tax season.\n  This is how one health law expert put it:\n\n       It will be very easy to find people who are unhappy with \n     [ObamaCare's] . . . new tax obligations--people who have to \n     pay a penalty, who have to wait forever to get through to \n     somebody at the I.R.S. or have to pay back a lot of money \n     because of overpayments of premium tax credits.\n\n  This is from an expert who supports ObamaCare.\n  The truth is ObamaCare is a law that just keeps on giving, giving \nheadaches to the middle class. It meant millions of cancellation \nnotices, it meant higher costs for many, and now this.\n  Remember, too, the IRS, the same agency charged with processing our \ntax returns, is now in charge of implementing vast sections of \nObamaCare. The same agency that spent so much time trying to silence \nfree speech--the same agency that awarded bonuses to employees who owed \nback taxes--is an agency charged with enforcing ObamaCare's web of \ncomplexity.\n  Americans are right to question the IRS's competence to handle so \nmuch sensitive information. We just received another reminder of that \nrecently.\n  One of the Obama administration's own inspectors general released a \ndamning report of this troubled agency. The report found that the IRS \nrecently rehired hundreds of individuals who had left the agency under \nclouds of misconduct.\n  It took back individuals who had engaged in sexual harassment, \ncriminal misconduct, and fraud and on at least one occasion ignored \ncase file notes that warned ``Do not rehire.''\n  The tax collector for America even rehired people who willfully \nfailed to file their tax returns.\n  I know the chairman of the Finance Committee plans to dig into issues \nsuch as these. He wants answers. We all do. The American people deserve \nthem. They are tired of seeing a government that has lost focus on \nthem, and they are tired of enduring ObamaCare's growing list of failed \npromises.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n\n\n                           Necessary Absence\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am not going to be able to be here the \nrest of the week. More than likely I have a personal matter I have to \ndeal with.\n\n[[Page S874]]\n\n                       Tribute to Kathie Alvarez\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to take a minute to talk about somebody whom I \nhave worked with for 30 years in the Senate, and that is Kathie \nAlvarez, who has done such a great job of calculating our votes, \ntabulating our votes, and just being somebody who is always here.\n  We have had a great relationship. I know nothing about her politics. \nI just know something about her personality, which is warm. She has a \ngreat sense of humor, and I am going to miss her a great deal.\n  I wish her the very best. She has now worked in the Senate for some \n30 years. For everyone who has had any dealings with her, which is \neveryone serving in the Senate, I am sure their experiences have been \njust like mine, a very pleasant experience.\n  Again, I wish her the very best in the future, whatever that might \nbe, and someday if she needs a letter of recommendation or something, I \nwould be happy to give her one.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. President, during the past 6 years of the Obama administration \nthere have been 12 million jobs created. Remember when President Obama \ntook office--because of the Bush administration and their activities--\nwe were losing 800,000 jobs a month. So I think it speaks well of what \nhas taken place over the past 6 years to be able to talk about creating \n12 million private sector jobs. Not everyone has benefited from these \njobs, but a lot of people have.\n  We in Nevada wish we were doing much better, but we are doing much \nbetter than we were. In fact, in Nevada the unemployment rate fell to \nits lowest level since 2008 last month, but these are private sector \njobs. If we had just a little bit of help with public sector jobs, we \nwould be back to the Clinton years. The economy would be on fire.\n  The Environment and Public Works Committee is the ``Environment and \nPublic Works'' Committee. The senior Senator from Oklahoma has been one \nof the leaders on that committee for a long time. He and I disagree \ngreatly with what he does and what he believes dealing with the \nenvironment part of that committee.\n  But we have significant agreement on the other part of that \ncommittee, the public sector--environment and public works. He has been \nout front talking about the need to do something with the highway bill, \nto create these jobs which are good for the economy.\n  I know he and Senator Boxer are working to do something with a new \nhighway bill, and I am behind them. I hope they can work something out. \nIt would be so important if we could do something to help the public \nsector, and no place is better to go than to do something with \ninfrastructure.\n  We have a $3 trillion deficit with infrastructure in this country: \nbridges collapsing, bridges in a state of disrepair, and of course \nhighways. Most highways in America get a C-minus grade at best. So \nthere are a lot of things we can do to help the economy and do \nsomething to take all of the pressure off the private sector.\n  Unemployment is down 5.7 percent. The stock market, all three of \nthem, are at alltime highs. Manufacturing is doing quite well.\n  The automobile industry--we struggled when the great General Motors \nwas going bankrupt, Chrysler was going bankrupt, and Ford was hanging \non. We stepped forward and said we have to do something about saving \none of America's great industries; and we did that.\n  Quite frankly, we received so much criticism from the Republicans. \nThey were willing to let the automobile sector go bankrupt. We started \nCash for Clunkers, we did all kinds of things, and now these companies \nare thriving and rightfully so.\n  The automobile industry has rebounded, and that is an understatement. \nA number of economies are on the right track. I state, for the second \ntime this morning, does that mean everyone has benefited? The answer is \nno, but a lot of us have benefited.\n  But throughout all of this, in America--this great country of ours--\nthe rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer, the middle \nclass is being squeezed, and that we have to recognize.\n  Let's talk about the economy, 12 million private sector jobs. Could \nwe do better? The answer is yes. It would have been great had we not \nbeen thwarted, stopped because of a number of filibusters. We would \nhave a minimum wage for the entire country. We weren't able to get that \ndone. That would be great for the middle class.\n  It would be good if we could do something about the largest debt \nAmerica has. It is not credit cards, it is student loan debt. I have \nadmiration for the senior Senator from Illinois as to what he has done \nabout student debt. He has spoken out that some of the things going on \nin our country dealing with education are absolutely wrong. But one \nthing that is wrong is we are placing a burden on these young men and \nwomen who are going to college and their families.\n  There are many things we should have done that we didn't do to help \nthe middle class, including equal pay for equal work, but that didn't \nhappen. We need to look at what has happened with the Republicans \ndealing with the economy. They are doing things that are not helping.\n  Look at the Politico paper today. They talk about what the \nRepublicans are doing with these riders on the money to fund Homeland \nSecurity. At a bare minimum that would increase the debt some $30 \nbillion.\n  We can say that for each DREAMer--there is about 600,000 of them--the \nRepublicans want to deport every one of these DREAMers. The average \ncost of deporting these people is $10,000 each. Do the math--$10,000 \ntimes 600,000, that would all go toward increasing the debt.\n  So shutting down the Department of Homeland Security is where we are \nheaded, and it is such a shame--or having a continuing resolution. Each \nof these would be a disaster for our economy. If Republicans refuse to \nfund Homeland Security, tens of thousands of employees that Secretary \nJohnson is in charge of would have to be furloughed. He says up to \n30,000. Others would be ordered to come to work and not be paid.\n  The Republicans are saying, well, we may not close down. We may fund \nit, but we may do it at last year's levels, which would be a disaster \nfor the States. There are programs Secretary Johnson funds that are so \nimportant to States: Terrorism centers; there is a great big one in \nArizona that is waiting to be funded. If we have a CR, a continuing \nresolution, it will not be funded. We have programs relating to K9 \nunits within police departments that are so important to local \ngovernments, State governments, and they would not be funded.\n  Secretary Johnson laid out on all the TV shows this past weekend \nabout what would happen if we didn't fund the Department of Homeland \nSecurity or what would happen if we had to go with a continuing \nresolution.\n  SAFER grants, even with firefighters, are so tremendously important \nfor States such as Nevada and around the rest of the country.\n  So, my Republican colleagues, who now have a huge majority here in \nCongress, why don't you work to improve the economy, not hurt the \neconomy? Let's pass a clean bill and send it to the President. America \ndeserves a safe homeland. Even conservative newspapers such as the Wall \nStreet Journal criticized the Republicans yesterday about what they are \ndoing with homeland security and what they failed to do with \nimmigration. They have been so critical of the Republicans. The \nRepublicans have a huge majority, and as the Wall Street Journal said \nyesterday, why don't they use it to the advantage of the American \npeople, which they haven't done.\n  Would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n\n                       Reservation Of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is only 17 days until the Department of \nHomeland Security of the United States of America runs out of funding--\nthe Department of Homeland Security.\n  This is the Department we created after 9/11. We said: America needs \nto be safer. We have to put in place safeguards to make sure 9/11 never \nhappens again. We created a new department, and it was done on a \nbipartisan basis. Joe Lieberman, a Democrat from Connecticut serving in \nthe Senate, joined with Susan Collins, the Republican from Maine, on \nour side of the rotunda with like-minded people on the other side, and \nthey crafted this new Department. They brought together 22 different \nagencies. They tried their best to achieve efficiency, to eliminate \nduplication, to save money but have a mission that would be \naccomplished in keeping America safe.\n  If you think about the departments of government, of course the \nDepartment of Defense comes to mind immediately when it comes to our \nsafety, but not far behind is the Department of Homeland Security. So \nit was December when the Republicans of the House of Representatives, \ngiven a choice of funding the government for this year, decided they \nwould pick out one department and not fund it on a regular basis. They \ndecided that one department would be funded on what they call a \ncontinuing resolution, which means kind of grabbing last year's budget \nand trying to make it work this year. Now, what was that one department \nthe Republicans decided needed to be handled differently and not \nproperly funded? The Department of Homeland Security. That Department, \nin 17 days, will run out of money again.\n  What are they thinking? What is happening in those closed-door \nmeetings when Speaker Boehner and the House Republicans or Majority \nLeader McConnell and the Senate Republicans sit down and plot their \nstrategy? Is there anyone in that room who says: You know, I think we \nmay have picked the wrong department not to fund.\n  The Department of Homeland Security is one we think about instantly \nwhen we see the terrible things done by ISIS, these terrorists of \nextremism, and pray to God they are never visited on the United States \nand that this awful group comes to an untimely ending as quickly as \npossible. Yet this Department, Homeland Security, has been the target \nof the Republicans to really execute a political ploy, a political \nstrategy. Here is what they said: The way to get the President's \nattention on immigration is to refuse to fund the Department of \nHomeland Security. Well, they not only have the President's attention, \nbut they have the attention of the United States of America. People are \nasking: What are the congressional Republicans thinking?\n  In fact, the latest inquiry, just referred to by the Democratic \nleader, was an editorial yesterday in--of all things--the Wall Street \nJournal. The article is entitled: ``Can the GOP Change?'' It basically \nchallenges the whole strategy of jeopardizing the funding for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security in order to make the point that they \ndisagree with the President on immigration.\n  What we have offered, what the Wall Street Journal suggests is to \nhave a debate on immigration but not at the expense of funding the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. That is what they have called for.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the February 9, 2015, \nWall Street Journal article be printed in the Record at the conclusion \nof these remarks.\n  So what are these immigration provisions that have the Republicans in \nsuch a rage that they are willing to jeopardize the funding of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security? One of them relates to a bill I \nintroduced 14 years ago--the DREAM Act. Over the span of 14 years, \nthough, this has not become the law of the land. It has become \nshorthand for a challenge we have with our broken immigration system. \nHere is the challenge: There were infants, toddlers, and small children \nbrought to the United States by their parents many years ago. They were \nnot documented. They grew up in this country, and they went to school \nin this country. They speak English. They have dreams about what they \nwill do with their future, but being undocumented they are unable to \nrealize those dreams.\n  The DREAM Act said if they have a clean criminal record, have \ngraduated from high school, are willing to serve in our military or go \non to college, we will give them a path to legalization in America. \nThese are young people who know no other country. These are young \npeople raised in America, educated in our educational system--at the \nexpense of our taxpayers, I might add. They have been successful in \nlife and want to continue to be a part of America. They only know one \nflag--the one they pledge allegiance to every morning in their \nclassroom, which is the same one we on the Senate Floor. They only know \none national anthem. Yet they are being told by the Republicans they \nshould leave.\n  How many are there? We estimate 2 million across our country. There \nare 600,000 who have signed up for President Obama's protection \nprogram, called DACA, which says that on a 2-year basis they will not \nbe deported. What the Republicans have said is: We want to deport these \nDREAMers--2 million of them--and let's start with the 600,000 who have \nstepped up for protection from deportation. So they are risking funding \nthe Department of Homeland Security in order to make their point that \nDREAMers have to go.\n  Well, let's at least take a look at one of these DREAMers and \nunderstand the kind of people we are talking about. This is Johana \nMejias. Johana was brought to the United States from Venezuela when she \nwas a child. She grew up in Boulder, CO. She played on her high school \nsoftball team. She played viola in the orchestra and dreamed of \nbecoming a doctor. Here is what Johana said about her childhood:\n\n       I've become a Boulderite in all aspects of that word. That \n     town, with those beautiful mountains, is truly my home.\n\n  In 2011 Johana graduated from the University of Colorado at Boulder \nwith a double major. I am going to try to describe her major, but as a \nliberal arts lawyer I may get lost in some of these scientific terms. \nHere was Johana's major at the University of Colorado: molecular, \ncellular, and developmental biology, and psychology-neuroscience.\n  Johana finished at the University of Colorado without any government \nassistance because she is undocumented. She made it through these \nchallenging majors, graduating with this double major. Her dream? To \nbecome a doctor. It was a dream she thought might never come to be \nbecause she is undocumented. She literally has no country. Then \nsomething happened. In 2012 President Barack Obama signed an Executive \norder called DACA, and Johana heard there was actually a medical school \nthat was willing to admit students who qualified under this DACA \nprotection--Loyola University Stritch College of Medicine in the city \nof Chicago. She couldn't believe it, and she applied quickly. Johana \nwas accepted because she is an extraordinarily bright and promising \nyoung medical student.\n  Like many States across the country, my home State of Illinois faces \na shortage of physicians in some communities. Loyola University decided \nif a DACA-protected young graduate is willing to come here and \nqualifies in the competitive field of admissions to medical school, \nthey can come to Loyola medical school if they promise to give 1 year \nof service after they are doctors for every year of medical school, and \nif they promise to go to an underserved area in the inner city or rural \nareas where there are not enough doctors. Johana signed up for that. \nShe said it was worth it. She would give 1 year of her life for each \nyear of medical school if she was just given a chance to become a \ndoctor.\n  This DACA loan program we have created is one that allows these \nstudents to receive the loans they need to finish at Loyola medical \nschool. Last fall Johana began medical school at Loyola. I was there on \none of her first days, and I met her. She is even more impressive than \nanything I could say in this speech. After she graduates, she has \nagreed to stay in my State of Illinois to help people who need a \ndoctor.\n  Here is what she wrote to me in a letter about her life experience:\n\n       When the year 2012 came along, my life changed. My dreams \n     of becoming a doctor became a possibility again because of \n     DACA.\n\n[[Page S876]]\n\n     I was now able to apply to medical internship programs, take \n     the medical school intern exam, and apply to medical school, \n     all because of my DACA status. DACA has defined my path. DACA \n     has relit a fire within to succeed and continue to pursue my \n     dreams.\n\n  Isn't that an amazing story--that a young girl would come here, \nrealize she was undocumented, fight her way through for a bachelor's \ndegree in these challenging subjects, continuing to keep alive the \ndream that maybe, just maybe something would happen to give her a \nchance to become a doctor? Then the President signs this Executive \norder, and now she is in medical school.\n  Because this medical school is in Chicago, my State is going to \nbenefit when she becomes a doctor because she will go to one of my \ndown-State communities that is begging for a doctor. She will go to one \nof the inner-city neighborhoods in Chicago and serve people who are \nstruggling to get basic medical care.\n  What an amazing story--an amazing story that will come to a bitter \nend if the Republicans have their way on this bill.\n  The Republican answer to Johana is: After all of your life's work, \nafter all of your dreams are fulfilled, leave--leave America. They are \nprepared to deport her and 600,000 others just like her. They think \nAmerica will be a better nation if we get rid of someone like Johana. \nWhat are they thinking?\n  They are challenging the very funding of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity with this strategy of deporting the DREAMers. It doesn't make \nany sense. Whether you are conservative or liberal, this makes no \nsense--to spend $9,000 to deport her instead of finding $9,000 to help \nher finish medical school and be part of America's future.\n  We are a nation of immigrants. My mother was an immigrant to this \ncountry, and I stand on the floor of the Senate proudly representing \nthe State of Illinois. That is my story. That is my family's story. \nThat is America's story.\n  Those who have devised a strategy--what I consider to be a divisive, \nnegative, hateful strategy--toward young people such as her are not \nthinking clearly about who we are as Americans. We are a nation of \nimmigrants. People from all across this world have had the courage to \npick up and come to America, to work some of the toughest, dirtiest, \nhardest jobs so their kids, such as Johana, would have a chance for a \nbetter future. That story has been repeated over and over millions of \ntimes. Republicans, with their strategy, their anti-immigration \nstrategy, would kill that dream, kill that story.\n  I hope we have the good sense to fund the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. If there is going to be a debate about the DREAMers and their \nfuture, count me in. I want to be part of it. I want to come to the \nfloor and tell these stories about real lives affected by these \npolitical decisions, and I trust in the outcome in the Senate. But \ndon't stop the funding for the Department of Homeland Security in the \nmeantime. Let us make sure we are committed to our heritage as a nation \nof immigrants and to our future where young people like Johana can be a \nbright part of tomorrow for so many needy people across America.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 9, 2015]\n\n                          Can the GOP Change?\n\n       Republicans in Congress are off to a less than flying start \n     after a month in power, dividing their own conference more \n     than Democrats. Take the response to President Obama's \n     immigration order, which seems headed for failure if not a \n     more spectacular crack-up.\n       That decree last November awarded work permits and de facto \n     legal status to millions of undocumented aliens and dismayed \n     members of both parties, whatever their immigration views. A \n     Congressional resolution to vindicate the rule of law and the \n     Constitution's limits on executive power was defensible, and \n     even necessary, but this message has long ago been lost in \n     translation.\n       The Republican leadership funded the rest of the government \n     in December's budget deal but isolated the Department of \n     Homeland Security that enforces immigration law. DHS funding \n     runs out this month, and the GOP has now marched itself into \n     another box canyon.\n       The specific White House abuse was claiming prosecutorial \n     discretion to exempt whole classes of aliens from \n     deportation, dumping the historical norm of case-by-case \n     scrutiny. A GOP sniper shot at this legal overreach would \n     have forced Democrats to go on record, picked up a few \n     supporters, and perhaps even imposed some accountability on \n     Mr. Obama.\n       But that wasn't enough for immigration restrictionists, who \n     wanted a larger brawl, and they browbeat GOP leaders into \n     adding needless policy amendments. The House reached back to \n     rescind Mr. Obama's enforcement memos from 2011 that \n     instructed Homeland Security to prioritize deportations of \n     illegals with criminal backgrounds. That is legitimate \n     prosecutorial discretion, and in opposing it Republicans are \n     undermining their crime-fighting credentials.\n       The House even adopted a provision to roll back Mr. Obama's \n     2012 order deferring deportation for young adults brought to \n     the U.S. illegally as children by their parents--the so-\n     called dreamers. The GOP lost 26 of its own Members on that \n     one, passing it with only 218 votes.\n       The overall $40 billion DHS spending bill passed with these \n     riders, 236-191, but with 10 Republicans joining all but two \n     Democrats in opposition. This lack of GOP unity reduced the \n     chances that Senate Democrats would feel any political \n     pressure to go along.\n       And, lo, on Thursday the House bill failed for the third \n     time to gain the 60 votes needed to overcome the third \n     Democratic filibuster in three days. Swing-state Democrats \n     like Indiana's Joe Donnelly and North Dakota's Heidi Heitkamp \n     aren't worried because they have more than enough material to \n     portray Republicans as the immigration extremists.\n       Whatever their view of Mr. Obama's order, why would \n     Democrats vote to deport people who were brought here as kids \n     through no fault of their own? Mr. Obama issued a veto threat \n     to legislation that will never get to his desk, and he must \n     be delighted that Republicans are fighting with each other \n     rather than with him.\n       Restrictionists like Sens. Ted Cruz and Jeff Sessions are \n     offering their familiar advice to fight harder and hold firm \n     against ``executive amnesty,'' but as usual their strategy \n     for victory is nowhere to be found. So Republicans are now \n     heading toward the same cul de sac that they did on the \n     ObamaCare government shutdown.\n       If Homeland Security funding lapses on Feb. 27, the agency \n     will be pushed into a partial shutdown even as the terrorist \n     threat is at the forefront of public attention with the \n     Charlie Hebdo and Islamic State murders. Imagine if the \n     Transportation Security Administration, a unit of DHS, fails \n     to intercept an Islamic State agent en route to Detroit.\n       So Republicans are facing what is likely to be another \n     embarrassing political retreat and more intra-party \n     recriminations. The GOP's restrictionist wing will blame the \n     leadership for a failure they share responsibility for, and \n     the rest of America will wonder anew about the gang that \n     couldn't shoot straight.\n       The restrictionist caucus can protest all it wants, but it \n     can't change 54 Senate votes into 60 without persuading some \n     Democrats. It's time to find another strategy. Our advice on \n     immigration is to promote discrete bills that solve specific \n     problems such as green cards for math-science-tech graduates, \n     more H-1B visas, a guest-worker program for agriculture, \n     targeted enforcement and legal status for the dreamers. \n     Democrats would be hard-pressed to oppose them and it would \n     put the onus back on Mr. Obama. But if that's too much for \n     the GOP, then move on from immigration to something else.\n       It's not too soon to say that the fate of the GOP majority \n     is on the line. Precious weeks are wasting, and the \n     combination of weak House leadership and a rump minority \n     unwilling to compromise is playing into Democratic hands. \n     This is no way to run a Congressional majority, and the only \n     winners of GOP dysfunction will be Mr. Obama, Nancy Pelosi \n     and Hillary Clinton.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/10/senate-section/article/S876-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S876-S877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we continue to debate the Affordable Care \nAct. The Affordable Care Act, of course, is the effort we passed in the \nSenate to try to make America a better place for those who need health \ninsurance.\n  Our goal was accessibility, to make sure more and more people would \nhave access to affordable health care. Our goals tried to transform \nhealth care into something that was more preventive, something that \nreduced the likelihood that someone would be hospitalized or have a \nserious disease. Our goal was to try to make certain we created \nincentives within the practice of medicine--for quality care, not the \nmost expensive care. And we have achieved many of those goals in the \nfirst year.\n  Some 10 million Americans now have access to health insurance through \nthe Affordable Care Program, and yet the Republicans in the House, as \nlate as last week, for the 56th time voted to repeal the Affordable \nCare Act.\n  Now we might ask ourselves: What do they want to replace it with? \nThey surely wouldn't just walk away from it. And the answer is: They \ndon't have a replacement. They are so determined to kill this program. \nI will say to their credit that two Republican Senators have stepped up \nand said: Here is what\n\n[[Page S877]]\n\nwe would suggest as an alternative. I will acknowledge they are the \nfirst, I believe, after all these years, to actually step up with a \nproposal. But it is important for us to take a close look at this \nproposal.\n  This new plan which the Republicans offered does not offer the same \nprotection when it comes to insuring people with preexisting \nconditions. Does anyone know a person in their family or a friend with \na preexisting medical condition? Everybody's hand ought to go up \nbecause we all do. Everybody has somebody in their family with some \nhistory--a history that, in the old days, would disqualify them from \nhealth insurance or end up with premiums they couldn't afford. The new \nRepublican approach to replace the current protection of people with \npreexisting conditions doesn't give the same opportunity for health \ninsurance for those people. That, to me, is a fatal flaw.\n  Secondly, we decided we would make prescription drugs under Medicare \nfor seniors more affordable. We used to have something called the \ndoughnut hole. It cost seniors over $1,000 a year to pay for their \nprescription drugs. We started closing that doughnut hole, and it saves \non average in Illinois, for every senior citizen, $780 a year. So that \nis $780 for these seniors to have in their savings, in their checkbook. \nThe new Republican approach, the Hatch-Burr program, eliminates that \nand we go back to the doughnut hole. We go back to this debt.\n  Sadly, it doesn't provide the Medicaid coverage which people in low-\nincome categories need. Take a close look at Medicaid. The vast \nmajority of people receiving Medicaid benefits in America are children \nand pregnant moms. When we cut back on Medicaid, as this Hatch-Burr \nproposal does, we do it at their expense. But the largest number in \nterms of dollars spent who receive these benefits are those in nursing \nhomes who are broke.\n  Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, keep them alive. When we cut \nback on Medicaid, cut back on reimbursements to the nursing home, the \nobvious question is: What is going to happen to grandma? What is going \nto happen to mom?\n  So when they start cutting back on Medicaid, look long and hard. The \npeople whom we are protecting on Medicaid Programs are some of the most \nvulnerable in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was listening to what the Senator from \nIllinois was saying. I could not say it as well as he did, but I agree \nwith every single word he said and I suspect that Vermonters, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike, agree with what he said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/10/senate-section/article/S877-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LYNCH NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, almost 2 weeks ago the Attorney General \nnominee, Loretta Lynch, came before the Senate Judiciary Committee and \ntestified for nearly 8 hours. As one who has heard Attorneys General \nnominees testify for the past 40 years, I cannot think of anybody who \ndid a better job. She was clear and concise. She is a prosecutor's \nprosecutor. She has also responded to more than 600 written questions. \nMany of them have absolutely nothing to do with whether she is \nqualified for the job or not. But people felt they had to send in these \nquestions for whatever reason--and she responded to them all, whether \nthey were relevant or not. And when she is confirmed, she will be the \nfirst African-American woman to serve as the Attorney General of the \nUnited States in our Nation's history. A majority of members of the \ncommittee, both Republican and Democratic, have said they intend to \nsupport her confirmation. I am confident she has the votes to be \nconfirmed by the full Senate.\n  But as of today it has been 94 days since the President announced the \nnomination of Ms. Lynch. Her nomination has been pending longer than \nany modern Attorney General nominee. We should all be able to agree \nthat confirming the top law enforcement position should be an urgent \npriority of the Senate. At a time when we face all kinds of threats \nfrom terrorists--both outside our borders and within our borders--we \nshould all be united in confirming an Attorney General nominee like \nLoretta Lynch. She has the experience of successfully prosecuting \nnumerous terrorists, people who others said we should be afraid to \nprosecute and that we should lock them up in Guantanamo in case they \nare not convicted. Ms. Lynch has obtained those convictions and those \nterrorist are locked away in Federal prisons right now.\n  This Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee has the opportunity to \nvote on her nomination. I have heard that even though she has already \nwaited longer than any other modern Attorney General nominee to be \nconfirmed, some Republicans are considering delaying the important vote \nfor her for two more weeks. Under our committee rule, they have the \nright to do so. But I urge them not to do so.\n  Loretta Lynch's qualifications are beyond reproach. She has been \nconfirmed by the Senate twice before to serve as the top federal \nprosecutor based in Brooklyn, NY, one of the most significant \nprosecutors' offices in this country. Incidentally, she was confirmed \nboth times unanimously. Under her leadership, the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice for the Eastern District of New York has brought terrorists to \njustice, obtained convictions against both Republicans and Democrats in \npublic corruption cases, and fought tirelessly against violent crime \nand financial fraud. It would be hard to find any prosecutor in this \ncountry in any administration who has a better record than she does, \nand her record shows that as Attorney General, Ms. Lynch will \neffectively, fairly, and independently enforce the law.\n  Now, thinking back to 2007 when Michael Mukasey was nominated by \nPresident Bush to serve as Attorney General. Now, President Bush was in \nthe end of his term as President. The Democrats had taken over the \nmajority in the Senate that year. I served as chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. President Bush talked to me and said: we need, of \ncourse, an Attorney General. I agreed. And I knew that like Ms. Lynch, \nMr. Mukasey had been confirmed before by the Senate, and I also knew \nthat this was coming toward the end of the Bush Presidency. Now, \nultimately I voted against Mr. Mukasey because of his responses \nrelating to questions on torture. But even though I was going to vote \nagainst him, I proceeded with his nomination in a very prompt manner.\n  It took just 53 days from the announcement of Mr. Mukasey's \nnomination to his confirmation. It has been 94 days for Ms. Lynch. Her \nnomination is needlessly on track to take more than twice the amount of \ntime it took a Democratic-led Senate to confirm President Bush's \nnominee. After Mr. Mukasey's hearing, Senate Democrats could have held \nhis nomination over in committee, but we did not. In fact, I had to \nhold a special markup to report his nomination out of committee as soon \nas possible. And he was confirmed 2 days later. Republicans should \nextend the same courtesy to expedite Ms. Lynch's nomination, as we did \nto Mr. Mukasey's.\n  Last week the Secretary of Defense nominee testified before the \nSenate Armed Services Committee--last week--and his nomination will be \nreported to the floor today. His nomination is expected to be confirmed \nby the end of the week. Now, I agree the Defense Secretary is a \ncritically important position to fill, and I will vote for him. But so \nis the Nation's top law enforcement officer. I urge Senate Republicans \nto allow a vote on Ms. Lynch's nomination before we adjourn for a week-\nlong recess. Please, don't treat her differently than we treated Mr. \nMukasey. We were able to give him an expedited procedure. She has \nalready waited much longer than he did. Don't make her wait even \nlonger.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/10/senate-section/article/S877-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S877-S878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING DARN TOUGH SOCKS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in Vermont, small businesses are the \nfoundation of our State's economy.\n\n[[Page S878]]\n\nThey spur economic growth and create jobs. One such place is Darn Tough \nSocks--which sounds like a very small place, but it is not. They \ndecided we should have upscale brand quality socks with a lifetime \nguarantee, produced in America, and not--like so many other things--\nhave to be exported from other companies. They have done a huge amount \nof charity work in our State. But they are also one who shows that jobs \ncan be created in America and can thrive in America.\n  As I said, in Vermont, small businesses are the foundation of our \nState's economy, and are incubators of innovation that spur economic \ngrowth, create jobs, and promote the quality that is known as the \nVermont Brand. I am proud of the many Vermont success stories that \noften start out as a family business--sometimes located in an old farm \nhouse or tool shed--and mature into world-class operations that support \nand benefit the communities in which they operate. Our Nation's economy \nis growing, but in today's fast-changing business environments, the \nstatus quo is no longer enough. Darn Tough Vermont in Northfield, VT, \nis one such business that is not just surviving, but is thriving, in \npart because of its evolution in today's global marketplace, but most \nimportantly, because of the dedicated workers that help the business \ngrow. Darn Tough, a brand launched from its parent company, Cabot \nHosiery Mills, exemplifies Vermonters' spirit of entrepreneurship, \ncreativity, perseverance, and old fashioned hard work.\n  Darn Tough's President and CEO Ric Cabot grew up thinking about \nsocks. After all, Ric's grandfather and father succeeded in partnering \ntheir Vermont private-label sock company with national outlet stores. \nFor a while, Cabot Hosiery Mills enjoyed growing sales, but 10 years \nago, the mill saw their sales take a considerable hit, as their \ncustomers shifted business overseas. Ric stepped in to help his family \nnavigate the uncertainty that lay ahead. The solution to their problem \nwas a long process that led to the establishment of Darn Tough, an \nupscale brand of quality socks with a lifetime guarantee. Like so many \nother businesses, the Cabots did not move jobs offshore; they \nmaintained the Cabot promise of quality while ensuring future \nemployment to over 150 Vermonters. It is because of their belief in \ntheir product, and a nimble business approach, that a 36-year-old \ncompany has kept its doors open and continues to create jobs for \nVermonters. Their most recent announcement that they intend to expand \ntheir Northfield, VT, mill by 100,000 square feet will result in an \nadditional 50 jobs to the Northfield area.\n  Darn Tough, its leadership and its employees, are part of the fabric \nof the community. Most recently, the company donated complimentary \nsocks for participants in the 20th anniversary of the Penguin Plunge, a \nfundraiser for the Special Olympics Vermont athletes who will compete \nin this year's winter games, for participants who raise $520 or more. \nThis is just another example of how Vermont businesses give back, even \nin the toughest of times.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the \nVermont Digger, dated February 8, 2015, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Vermont Digger, Feb. 8, 2015]\n\n     Darn Tough Sock Factory Expansion Will Add 250 to 300 Jobs in \n                               Northfield\n\n                             (By C.B. Hall)\n\n       For Northfield, the news couldn't be better. Cabot Hosiery \n     Mills, which has been making its Darn Tough wool socks since \n     2003, announced this month it is embarking on an expansion \n     that will add 100,000 square feet--more than two acres--to \n     its plant by the end of 2016.\n       CEO and president Ric Cabot expects the new facility will \n     add 250 to 300 new jobs to the mill's payroll over the next \n     five years. One new manufacturing position typically creates \n     1.6 additional local jobs in the service sector, according to \n     the federal Advanced Manufacturing National Program Office, \n     meaning that those new positions will translate into as many \n     as 780 new jobs for the community as a whole. The expansion \n     will make Cabot the town's second-largest employer, after \n     Norwich University.\n       Cabot Hosiery sales have increased by 60 percent in each of \n     the past five years.\n       The addition to the plant, which will nearly triple the \n     current square footage of the factory, will ``meet and get \n     out ahead of customer demand,'' Cabot says.\n       The new space will be attached to the present facility, and \n     will be designed so that more space can be added in the \n     future. ``Right now we're looking out five to six years,'' he \n     says.\n       While other companies have outsourced manufacturing \n     overseas, Cabot Hosiery kept its operations in Vermont and \n     went after the high end sock market.\n       ``There isn't one thing that makes us successful,'' Cabot \n     says. ``I'm the third generation in my family in the sock \n     business. There's socks in the blood.''\n       Ric Cabot's father, Marc Cabot, launched the firm in 1978, \n     vowing that ``knitting is going to come back to New \n     England,'' according to a trade press article still hanging \n     on the plant lobby's wall.\n       ``Up until 2003 we were making socks for other people, like \n     Gap and Banana Republic,'' Ric Cabot continues the story.\n       When the big retailers began to buy socks from offshore \n     companies demand plummeted. Cabot says in the early 2000s the \n     hosiery mill almost went out of business. The company reduced \n     the workforce and cut health insurance and 401(k) plans for \n     workers. The plant operated four days a week.\n       ``I took it upon myself to come up with something unique, \n     something different, something that we could sell [and] I \n     came up with Darn Tough. I gave away 3,500 pairs at the \n     Vermont City Marathon and people liked them.''\n       A dozen years later, Cabot hails Northfield as ``the sock \n     capital of the world.'' The brand name for a new line of \n     socks he developed--Darn Tough Vermont--not only refers to \n     the quality of the Merino wool used in the socks, but also \n     ``to coming through the hardships [of the early 2000s]--to \n     having to climb out of the hole we were in. The deck was \n     beginning to be stacked against the domestic manufacturer.''\n       In his view, the company has thrived on adversity. ``The \n     harder it is, the tougher it is, the better it is. If it's \n     easy, what's the point?'' Today he estimates Chinese socks \n     are worn by 60 to 75 percent of the nation's population, \n     while the rest of the hosiery sold in the U.S. comes from \n     Mexico, Honduras, Vietnam, or Canada. Domestic production \n     accounts for less than 10 percent of the trade, and U.S. sock \n     manufacturers number fewer than 50, he says. Cabot operates \n     the only sock mill in New England.\n       ``The ones that are left have focused on quality, a premium \n     product, with price not the driving factor in the sale.'' \n     That puts Cabot Hosiery in a narrow market niche of the sort \n     that has also sustained Vermont enterprises like Wall \n     Goldfinger, or Morrisville stove manufacturer Hearthstone, or \n     even the state's craft brewers.\n       ``Nobody ever outsourced anything for the quality,'' he \n     says.\n       Sheep in Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. Southwest \n     supply 100 percent of Cabot's wool, while the socks are sold \n     in national and international markets. In this global \n     business environment, the Darn Tough brand projects a clear \n     pride of place in its advertising slogan ``still Made In \n     Vermont, USA.''\n       Cabot's expansion is especially welcome news in the town of \n     Northfield, which is reeling from job losses.\n       Jeff Schulz, Northfield's town manager, says ``the town's \n     had some challenges.''\n       Wall Goldfinger, the high-end furniture company that \n     employed 45 workers in Northfield, moved to Randolph in 2012 \n     rather than cope with the possibility of flooding out again. \n     Wall Goldfinger's plant floor was damaged by floodwaters from \n     the Dog River during Tropical Storm Irene in August 2011.\n       The local economy will lose another 55 to 60 jobs when \n     Northfield Savings Bank, a local fixture since the 19th \n     century, moves its corporate headquarters to Berlin in four \n     months.\n       Jane Kolodinsky, who chairs the Department of Community \n     Development and Applied Economics at the University of \n     Vermont, is optimistic about Northfield's prospects.\n       ``The fact that they do have a university there, that is \n     definitely going to be a help,'' she says. ``Then, with Cabot \n     Hosiery, you're going to have two stable employers. You've \n     got enough to support some sort of economic base for the \n     community.''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, for the past week Democrats in the Senate \nhave been filibustering a bill to fund the Department of Homeland \nSecurity for the remainder of the fiscal year. They object to the bill \nbecause it does not fund President Obama's Executive overreach on \nimmigration--despite the fact that the President spent years declaring \nhe didn't have the constitutional authority to grant amnesty.\n\n[[Page S879]]\n\n  Quoting what the President told an audience on July 25, 2011:\n\n       Believe me, the idea of doing things on my own is very \n     tempting, I promise you. Not just on immigration reform. But \n     that's not how our system works. That's not how our democracy \n     functions. That is not how our Constitution is written.\n\n  On January 30, 2013, the President stated, ``I am not a king. . . . I \nam required to follow the law.''\n  That same day he said:\n\n       If this was an issue I could do unilaterally, I would have \n     done it a long time ago. . . . The way our system works is \n     Congress has to pass legislation. I then get an opportunity \n     to sign it and implement it.\n\n  Well, President Obama was right. The Constitution does not give the \nPresident authority to make laws. It is Congress's job to make laws, \nand it is the President's job to execute them. Clearly, based on these \nstatements, the President knows that. He has reiterated that sentiment \nmore than 20 times over the past few years. Yet a few months ago he \ndecided to ignore the law and the Constitution in an attempt to make \nimmigration law by Executive fiat. How can he possibly justify that?\n  Members of his own party were troubled by that decision.\n  ``I have to be honest, how this is coming about makes me \nuncomfortable,'' said a colleague from the State of Missouri back in \nNovember.\n  The junior Senator from Indiana said that ``the President shouldn't \nmake such significant policy changes on his own.''\n  The junior Senator from Minnesota admitted, ``I have concerns about \nexecutive action.''\n  ``I also frankly am concerned about the constitutional separation of \npowers,'' said the Independent Senator from the State of Maine.\n  Many Democrats here in the Senate Chamber, as well as an Independent, \nhave expressed their reservations and their concerns about how the \nPresident has proceeded. Democrats are right to be concerned, which \nmakes it particularly troubling that Democrats are now trying to shut \ndown the Department of Homeland Security to protect the President's \noverreach because, make no mistake, Democrats are refusing to fund the \nDepartment of Homeland Security unless funding is provided for the \nPresident's unconstitutional attempt to make his own immigration laws.\n  If Democrats don't like this bill, they should vote to debate the \nmeasure and offer amendments to fix the parts they don't like. \nRepublicans are ready and willing to entertain Democrats' amendments. \nIn fact, the Republican leader has offered to let Democrats alternate \namendments with Republicans on a one-to-one basis. An open debate is \nwhat the Senate is known for on a big issue. If Democrats want to fund \nactions that even they have admitted are troubling, they are welcome to \noffer an amendment to provide that funding. They have that opportunity.\n  What we are talking about is the Republican leader, Senator \nMcConnell, offering an open process--something that we have talked \nabout since we became the majority, something that we were denied in \nthe last session of Congress when we were in the minority. We have the \nopportunity to have an open debate, offer amendments, and vote on those \namendments. That is precisely what majority leader Senator McConnell \nhas put forward. He has given Democrats that option.\n  Let's put the bill on the floor. We will have a chance to offer \namendments. If Democrats don't like what is in the bill, they will have \nan opportunity to offer amendments, have that debate, and vote.\n  Democrats need to stop their obstruction and move forward on this \nbill. Blocking all funding to the Department of Homeland Security is \nnot a responsible solution, especially when the Democrats are blocking \nthe bill solely to protect Presidential actions that the President \nhimself has admitted are unconstitutional and outside the scope of his \nauthority.\n  We can end all this gridlock that is existing right now on the Senate \nfloor simply by the Democrats allowing us to get on this bill and end \nthe filibuster. Give us an opportunity to debate and offer amendments. \nLet's have that debate--a debate that is clearly important to a lot of \npeople across this country and certainly a lot of people here in the \nChamber of the Senate. We are going to be denied that opportunity if \nthe current filibuster and current blocking of even getting on that \nlegislation continues by the Democrats.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/10/senate-section/article/S879-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FOREIGN POLICY\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I would also like to take a few minutes \ntoday to discuss the President's foreign policy or lack thereof. ``Lack \nthereof'' seems to be the most accurate description of the President's \nlead-from-behind foreign policy. Whether it is a Russian proxy war in \nUkraine or the use of chemical weapons in Syria, the President is slow \nto respond and unclear about American goals even when he does.\n  Months after the ascension of ISIS--a terrorist organization so \nradical that even Al Qaeda considers it to be too extreme--the \nPresident still hasn't laid out a strategy for combating this threat. \nISIS represents a horrifying new nadir in the annals of terrorism. \nThere is apparently no act of brutality this organization rejects. Yet \na clear plan for defeating ISIS has yet to be articulated.\n  This week the President is finally supposed to send Congress an \nauthorization for the use of military force against ISIS. I look \nforward to examining that authorization. Since ISIS first emerged, the \nPresident has had the authority he needs to go after this terrorist \ngroup, but I think seeking additional authorization from Congress is \nwise, and I hope it will help define his strategy for combating this \nenemy and supporting our partners in this fight.\n  America clearly cannot fix all the world's problems, but we can help. \nWe can build a coalition, and we can lead. We can give our commanders \nin the field the tools they need to meet our clear and growing threats.\n  Six years of indecision, mistakes, and Presidential irresolution has \ndiminished America's image with our allies. The triumph of the \nPresident's political calculus over clear military and diplomatic \nobjectives has made the world less safe, not more. Now more than ever \nwe need a clearly articulated foreign policy from the President and the \ncommitment to back it up.\n  Later this week we will consider the nomination of Ash Carter to be \nSecretary of Defense. Dr. Carter seems to be a very capable individual, \nand I believe he will serve our country well. But changing personnel \nalone won't fix the President's foreign policy problems. Even a very \ncapable Secretary of Defense cannot succeed if his hands are tied by \nthe lack of a coherent strategy from the President.\n  As crises multiply around the world, the President needs to provide \nthe leadership that is required from our Commander in Chief. Whether it \nis defeating ISIS, standing up to Russia, or confronting Iran's nuclear \nambition, it is high time we saw the leadership from our President that \nour country needs and deserves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/10/senate-section/article/S879-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S879-S882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING\n\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, funding for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity runs out in 17 days. Rather than working with Democrats to \npass a clean Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill, many \nRepublicans are prioritizing politics over our national security.\n  With threats emerging every day both at home and abroad, casting \ndoubt on future funding for the Department of Homeland Security is a \nterrible idea. Shutting down DHS has real consequences, especially in \nborder States such as New Mexico. A DHS shutdown would threaten public \nsafety, hinder interstate commerce, hurt our economy, and jeopardize \ncritical funding for State, local, and tribal government activities.\n  Some of my Republican colleagues are willing to let these \nconsequences happen because they have an immigration policy \ndisagreement with the\n\n[[Page S880]]\n\nPresident. That is no way to govern, and it is not real leadership.\n  As a border State, New Mexico plays a critical role in protecting our \nhomeland. DHS Customs and Border Protection agents and officers at New \nMexico's two ports of entry at Columbus and Santa Teresa are \nresponsible for maintaining our security and for screening vehicles and \nwould-be crossers. These public servants put in long hours in order to \nkeep all of us safe. They apprehend drug smugglers, human traffickers, \nand gang members. They also play a direct role in facilitating critical \ntrade and interstate commerce between the United States and Mexico. \nThat impacts our economy in New Mexico, particularly in Hidalgo, Luna, \nand Dona Ana Counties.\n  New Mexico is a growing international trade center and the Columbus \nand Santa Teresa ports of entry are key to growing the diversity of my \nState's economy.\n  Recently, a House Republican said that if we run out of DHS funding, \n``it's not the end of the world.'' I disagree, and so do many of my \nconstituents.\n  Let me be clear about what a DHS shutdown would mean for New Mexico. \nIt would impact our Southeast Federal Law Enforcement Training Center \nin Artesia. This facility trains our Customs and Border Protection \nagents and officers. It would also compromise sheriff and city police \ndepartments across the State who use DHS funding to increase personnel \nand purchase equipment. Moreover, DHS helps fund some of our most \nimportant security programs such as the New Mexico All Source \nIntelligence Center, a public safety partnership based out of Santa Fe \nthat is designed to collect, analyze, and disseminate intelligence.\n  A shutdown would also risk important DHS grant funding for New Mexico \nat the Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. This \nagency works closely with DHS to aid communities after natural \ndisasters. In times of crisis, DHS works hand-in-glove with the State \nof New Mexico.\n  For example, last year severe thunderstorms and floods caused \ndisruption of oil and gas development, agricultural losses, and \nextensive damage to critical infrastructure across New Mexico, hitting \ncounties such as Colfax, Eddy, Lea, Lincoln, Otero, San Miguel, Santa \nFe, and Sierra.\n  FEMA, an agency under DHS, worked collaboratively to help these \ncommunities rebuild and recover. In fact, since 2002, New Mexico has \nreceived more than $238 million in DHS grant funds. These resources \nprovide statewide hazard mitigation assistance and help repair damaged \nroads, bridges, and low-water crossings after these disasters.\n  As current cabinet secretary-designate for the New Mexico Department \nof Homeland Security and Emergency Management Mitchell Jay puts it, a \nDHS shutdown would:\n\n     . . . have a very negative effect. We'll lose our grant \n     funding for local and State emergency managers. We fund a \n     portion of their salaries through DHS grants, and we can't, \n     nor can the counties and municipalities, afford to absorb \n     those costs at this time. . . . We can't afford to lose our \n     emergency managers, they're key representatives in our \n     communities who help develop mitigation plans for all types \n     of emergencies. They're our first line of defense should any \n     emergencies occur at the local level.\n\n  These examples are just a glimpse at the security, economic, and \nemergency risks of allowing DHS funding to expire.\n  Former Department of Homeland Security Secretaries Tom Ridge, Michael \nChertoff, and Janet Napolitano joined in a bipartisan call for Congress \nto act swiftly and remove uncertainty from an agency in charge of \nkeeping us safe.\n  A Department of Homeland Security shutdown would also either furlough \nDHS employees or require many of them to work without a paycheck. That \nmeans men and women who work tirelessly to keep our Nation safe would \nhave to live with the uncertainty of whether they are able to support \ntheir families.\n  DHS workers don't deserve that. They shouldn't be collateral damage \nin an ongoing ideological battle here in Washington, DC. I would like \nto believe a debate such as this would be about the merits of DHS \nfunding and the DHS funding bill, but unfortunately that is not the \ncase. This debate is about Republicans picking a political fight with \nthe President over an immigration system we all recognize is broken. As \na way to vent their frustrations, Republicans are unfairly targeting \nundocumented students known as DREAMers. At times such as this, one is \nforced to wonder if some on the far right fear DREAMers more than ISIL. \nBut we are not a country that kicks out our best and brightest \nstudents. We are not a nation that separates families.\n  I have met many DREAMers over the past 10 years in New Mexico. They \nare smart, they are hardworking, and most of them don't know how to be \nanything but an American. They grew up here, and they want to give \nback. I have heard their stories. I have read their letters.\n  For example, there is a bright young New Mexican named Yuri. Her \nfamily emigrated from Mexico to the United States when she was 2 years \nold. As a student at Highland High School in my neighborhood in \nAlbuquerque, Yuri volunteered in our community. She served as student \nbody president. She graduated in the top 10 percent of her class, and \nshe received the 2013 Sandia National Laboratories scholarship.\n  In 2013, she was approved for Deferred Action for Childhood \nArrivals--known as DACA--and is currently studying chemical engineering \nat the University of New Mexico. She wants to use her degree to enter \nthe medical field.\n  Less than 2 years ago, after much debate and compromise, the Senate \npassed a bipartisan immigration reform bill. That bill would have \nmodernized our immigration system to meet the needs of our economy. It \nwould have provided an accountable pathway to earn citizenship for the \nundocumented workers currently living in the shadows in our country. It \nwould have dramatically strengthened security at our borders.\n  Accountable immigration reform received 68 votes in this body and \ndemonstrated the kind of legislation and the kind of leadership that is \npossible when we work together. The American people are frustrated with \nthe gridlock here in Washington, DC. Frankly, I don't blame them. We \nneed pragmatic solutions to fix our immigration system, but withholding \nDHS funding and jeopardizing our national security is not a solution. \nIn fact, I would say it is emblematic of what is broken. Instead of \nfocusing on deporting some of our country's brightest students, I would \nurge my Republican colleagues in the House and in the Senate to direct \ntheir attention to the real threats our country faces--the gang \nmembers, the drug traffickers, the cyber hackers, and the terrorists. \nLet's work together to make sure the Department of Homeland Security is \nadequately funded.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to urge the Senate to take up a \nclean Homeland Security appropriations bill and pass it without further \ndelay. I know we have had several votes on the floor on proceeding to \nthe bill, but I would urge the leadership to make it clear that we \nstand on record for a clean Homeland Security appropriations bill.\n  We have an obligation to protect the American people. Given the \nterrorist threat we face both at home and abroad, it is irresponsible \nto continue to fund the Department of Homeland Security with short-term \nbudgets and bring them to the edge of an agency shutdown. We also \nshould not force hard-working Federal workers to stand in the crossfire \nbetween Congress and the President.\n  Providing the resources our Federal, State, and local law enforcement \nofficers need to carry out their vital around-the-clock mission should \nnot be caught up in partisan political disagreements. We need a clean \nappropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security.\n  We face a dangerous world today in light of recent terrorist attacks \nthroughout Europe, Asia, and North America, and the ongoing threat of \nISIS. I know I express the views of all Members of the Senate in \nexpressing our deep condolences and prayers for\n\n[[Page S881]]\n\nthe Kayla Mueller family as we learn today of her fate at the hands of \nISIS. ISIS is actively recruiting foreign fighters, who are being \nradicalized and then returned to their home countries, including \ncountries in Europe and North America.\n  We need to fully fund without further delay, uncertainty, or another \nshort-term budget the critical homeland security, law enforcement, and \nintelligence activities and programs of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  Mr. President, we are now 4 months into the fiscal year. One-third of \nthe fiscal year is already over for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. We should not keep funding DHS on short-term budgets. No \nagency or private business, for that matter, can effectively implement \na budget and carry out its mission under this type of financial \ntightrope. How would you like to run a business not knowing whether \nyour budget is going to be there starting March 1? How do you plan? How \ndo you make commitments for the year to carry out your mission when you \ndon't know whether you are going to have the budget support starting \nMarch 1 or whether it is going to be continued on a continuing \nresolution, whether you are going to have to go through a government \nshutdown or whether you are going to have a budget? You can't run an \nagency that way.\n  DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson has stated that if Congress continues to \nfund his agency on short-term budgets, it will harm its mission and \nprograms at the agency. We created the Department of Homeland Security \nin response to the devastating attacks on our country on September 11.\n  For example, short-term funding may limit more aggressive \ncounterterrorism efforts, weaken our cyber security protections against \nhackers trying to corrupt or steal our data, delay enhancements to \naviation security, slow down new border security initiatives, and defer \nnew grants to State and local law enforcement. DHS may have to delay or \npostpone contract awards and new acquisitions, which also hurts small \nbusinesses and our economy. DHS will have to scale back employee \ntraining and postpone the hiring of new personnel.\n  We have broad bipartisan support on almost all aspects of this $40 \nbillion Homeland Security funding measure. This legislation funds \ncritical agencies, including the Coast Guard; the Transportation \nSecurity Administration, TSA; the Federal Emergency Management Agency, \nFEMA; the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office; and the Secret Service, \njust to mention a few of the agencies that come under the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  Three former heads of the Department of Homeland Security, both under \nDemocratic and Republican administrations, recently wrote a letter to \nCongress urging us to passes a clean Homeland Security appropriations \nbill and avoid another short-term funding measure or, worse yet, a \ngovernment shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security at the end \nof February.\n  Let me quote from a part of the letter from former Homeland Security \nSecretaries Ridge, Chertoff, and Napolitano, again representing both \nDemocratic and Republican administrations:\n\n       [W]e write to you today to respectfully request that you \n     consider decoupling critical legislation to fund DHS in FY \n     '15 from a legislative response to President Obama's \n     executive action on immigration...The President has said very \n     publicly that he will ``oppose any legislative effort to \n     undermine the executive actions that he'' has taken on \n     immigration. Therefore, by tethering a bill to fund DHS in FY \n     2015 to a legislative response to the President's executive \n     action on immigration, the likelihood of a DHS shutdown \n     increases.\n\n  The letter continues:\n\n       We do not question your desire to have a larger debate \n     about the nation's immigration laws. However, we cannot \n     emphasize enough that DHS's responsibilities are much broader \n     than its responsibility to oversee the Federal immigration \n     agencies and to protect our borders. And funding for the \n     entire agency should not be put in jeopardy by the debate \n     about immigration...It is imperative that we ensure that DHS \n     is ready, willing and able to protect the American people. To \n     that end, we urge you not to risk funding for the operations \n     that protect every American and to pass a clean DHS funding \n     bill.\n\n  That is from a letter from three former Secretaries of the Department \nof Homeland Security who worked for both Democratic and Republican \nadministrations.\n  Mr. President, what if Congress allows DHS funding to lapse on \nFebruary 27? That is the end of the current funding resolution. We \nwould then ask critical frontline personnel, such as Border Patrol \nagents and air marshals, to work without pay. That is insulting to \nthose law enforcement officers who are putting their lives on the line \nto keep Americans safe every day. That is insulting to the families of \nthose law enforcement officers who depend on a steady paycheck to make \nends meet. And that is insulting to the American people, who deserve \nnothing less than world-class service from government officials.\n  I must tell you that we have gone through government shutdowns \nbefore. It hurts people, no question about it. But guess who gets hurt \nthe most. The taxpayers of this country. It ends up costing us more. We \ndon't save taxpayer dollars. It ends up costing more, jeopardizing the \nmission, and putting individual families at risk.\n  Let me cite one example that many of our States and localities know \nvery well. It is the Emergency Management Grant Program. Many local \nfire, police, and emergency management officials rely on funding from \nthe Homeland Security Grant Program, which provides funds to States, \nterritories, and other local governments to prevent, protect against, \nand respond to potential terrorist attacks and other hazards. This is a \nprogram local governments rely upon. They do not know whether they are \ngoing to get any of these funds after March 1. How do they plan? Local \nofficials as well rely on funding from FEMA's emergency management \nperformance grants. These grants help them to prepare for the \nunexpected, whether it is a natural disaster or some type of terrorist \nactivity. It allows them to be prepared. We require this training, and \nit is 50 percent Federal funds and 50 percent local funds. How do they \nmake arrangements to set up this training if they do not know whether \nthe Federal funds are going to be there?\n  I can speak for the State of Maryland. We have a very tough budget. \nOur Governor is trying to figure out how he is going to make ends meet. \nHe doesn't have the resources to advance the Federal share. That is no \nway for us to work in federalism with our local governments when we \nhave a partnership to keep everyone safe.\n  I can mention many other programs that are in jeopardy of not being \nfunded if we don't pass a clean bill, but let me just in conclusion \naddress the issue of immigration.\n  Due to many extraneous amendments that were added by the House to the \nHomeland Security appropriations bill, we have this challenge here in \nthe Senate. The President has made it clear he will veto any bill that \nexpressly limits his authority to exercise prosecutorial discretion on \nimmigration matters.\n  While we agree that our current immigration system needs \ncomprehensive reform, including border security enhancements, this \nappropriations bill is not the place for that debate. No matter what \nside of this debate you are on, most of us agree that the American \nimmigration system is badly broken. Comprehensive immigration reform is \nlong overdue. We need a balanced immigration system that is fair.\n  My strong preference is that Congress send the President a \ncomprehensive immigration reform bill that he can sign into law. This \nwould provide a more thorough and more permanent solution than \nExecutive action. The Senate passed a bipartisan bill in the last \nCongress, and I am sure we can do so again. My hope is that the House \nwill take it up soon so we can come together in a bipartisan way, \nreconcile our differences, and pass comprehensive immigration reform as \na separate bill.\n  Funding for the Department of Homeland Security expires Friday, \nFebruary 27, which is now less than 3 weeks away. We are not scheduled \nto be in session one of those weeks because of the district work \nperiod. The Senate should act now to pass a clean Homeland Security \nbill and send it to the President without further delay. That is in the \nbest interest of the American people.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). The Senator from Texas.\n\n[[Page S882]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/10/senate-section/article/S882-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S882-S883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             PRISON REFORM\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as tempted as I am to respond to my good \nfriend from Maryland about the ongoing Democratic filibuster of the \nHomeland Security funding, I want to spend just a few minutes talking \nabout a topic where there is broad and growing consensus, where both \nparties have found common ground, and I am talking about the issue of \nreforming America's prison system.\n  Pretty much everyone agrees that our prisons are dangerously \novercrowded. I think there are roughly 215,000 inmates in Federal \ncustody. And everyone pretty much agrees that by and large people who \nare in prison are someday going to get out of prison. That, of course, \nbrings about the concern about repeat crimes or recidivism and the fact \nthat it is way too high. I think in many instances it is because we \nhave simply not done enough or maybe have even given up on helping \ntransition people who actually want to transition to a more productive \nlife and providing them with the tools they need to do so.\n  The hard part about dealing with what I have just described is we \nhave to come up with a solution that addresses these problems without \njeopardizing public safety. That, obviously, is a given. It is a \nchallenge, to be sure, but it makes it even more important to find \nbipartisan consensus and to actually accomplish what we can.\n  It is in this vein that my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator \nWhitehouse, and I have joined together to introduce a piece of \nlegislation we call the Corrections Oversight, Recidivism Reduction, \nand Eliminating Costs for Taxpayers in Our National System Act--or \nCORRECTIONS Act--to reform our Federal prison system. That is quite an \nacronym. It is a mouthful to be sure. But the point is, this is real \nmeaningful reform of our prison system at the Federal level.\n\n  Before I describe the specifics of the CORRECTIONS Act, I am going to \ntell a brief story the Presiding Officer is very familiar with of the \nsuccess in that laboratory of democracy known as the State of Texas.\n  Not too long ago Texas lawmakers confronted a problem similar to what \nI have described here at the national level. We had not only growing \nbudgets for prison construction, we had overcrowded prisons and a high \nrate of criminal recidivism.\n  At some point the thought occurred to a group of people that just \nbuilding more prisons wasn't necessarily the answer. It certainly \nwouldn't fix the problem on the back end that I described, of people \nwho would eventually get out of prison not being prepared to reenter \ncivil society. But we tried a different approach in Texas: scrapping \nprison construction plans and instead funding a series of recidivism \nreduction programs aimed at helping low-risk offenders turn their lives \naround and become productive members of society and, just as important, \nnot become residents of our prison system once again. These programs \nare not all that novel. They are well known--things such as drug \nrehabilitation, educational classes, job training, faith-based \ninitiatives, and something as simple as prison work programs.\n  In Texas we gave qualified inmates the option of earning credits and \ncompleting a portion of their sentence in lower levels of custody--home \nconfinement, halfway houses, community supervision--which is \ndramatically cheaper than the big-box prisons that are very expensive.\n  The results speak for themselves. Between 2007 and 2012 our State's \noverall incarceration rate fell almost 10 percent--9.4 percent--our \ntotal crime rate dropped 16 percent, and taxpayers saved more than $2 \nbillion.\n  Again, the Presiding Officer knows as well, Texas has a certain \nreputation when it comes to crime. We are not soft on crime. We are \ntough on crime. We believe if you do the crime, you should do the time. \nBut I think what we have come up with is a model that can be used at \nthe national level.\n  Senator Whitehouse this morning, in a press conference we did \ntogether, talked about how similar initiatives that took place in Rhode \nIsland produced similar results. But I think one of the keys to this is \nthe recidivism reduction programs because these have proven successful \nfor medium-risk and low-risk inmates and delivered positive results.\n  This bill would also make a number of other reforms. I guess perhaps \nthe most important, and the first one I will mention, is a risk \nassessment program, regular risk assessments for inmates, to determine \nwhether they are a low, medium or high risk of recidivism. Indeed, we \nwould not allow high-risk inmates to participate in this program of \nearning good time credit toward less restrictive custody, but they \ncould, if they were motivated enough to change their status from high \nrisk to medium risk. They could then begin that. So the incentives are \nclearly there.\n  These assessments would assign prisoners to appropriate programming \nto ensure the system is working efficiently and effectively. In other \nwords, if someone has a mental health issue, obviously they would be \ndirected in a particular way. If somebody doesn't have employable job \nskills, obviously that would call for some training program so they \ncould acquire those kinds of skills. People who have drug and alcohol \nproblems obviously could be directed toward something that could help \nthem learn to free themselves from those challenges.\n  To me, one of the great things about this particular approach is that \nit operates on incentives. As an incentive, lower risk offenders who \nsuccessfully complete their programs would earn up to 25 percent of \ntheir remaining sentence in home confinement or a halfway house.\n  To be clear, these earned time credits would be available only to \ninmates who have been vetted by the Bureau of Prisons and classified as \nlow-risk offenders. The Nation's most violent offenders would be \nexcluded from earning any credit under this legislation. During these \nbudget-constrained times, it is important to point out that this bill \nwould not involve any additional spending. Instead, it would rely on \njob programs and partnerships of faith-based groups and nonprofits, and \nthe reinvestment potentially of the savings generated by transitioning \nlower risk offenders to less restrictive forms of custody.\n  If it works as it has at the State level, it is going to save money \nbecause we will be building fewer prisons. Indeed, in Texas I believe \nwe have actually shuttered three existing prison units because we \nsimply don't need them because of this new approach.\n  Make no mistake, though, the prisoners eligible for these program are \nall people who eventually will get out of prison anyway. What we are \ntrying to do is make sure the very high risk of repeating and \nrecidivism would go down by better preparing them to reenter society. \nOur goal would be to make it less likely that they would commit new \ncrimes and wind up behind bars again.\n  So the hope and expectation is this bill would go a long way toward \nimproving public safety, it would save taxpayers money, and it would \nease some of the burden on our Federal prisons just like we experienced \nin Texas.\n  This bill, at a time when we seem to be very divided on a number of \ntopics, is a consensus piece of legislation. It was voted out of the \nJudiciary Committee late last year by an overwhelming vote. I think \nthose who expressed some reservations at the time just wanted more \nopportunity to talk about it and learn more about it, and perhaps they \nhad other ideas they wanted to consider adding to it.\n  In addition to Senator Whitehouse, there have been a number of \ncolleagues who have been very interested in criminal justice reform, \nand this is just one place, one starting point, which I think enjoys \nperhaps the broadest consensus. But I don't think we ought to be afraid \nof the larger discussion that a number of our colleagues, including the \nPresiding Officer, have talked about--things such as mandatory \nminimums, sentencing reforms; the overcriminalization of our regulatory \nregime, where people who inadvertently violate some regulation find \nthemselves actually accused of a crime.\n  I think all of these are fair game, but I think the most important \nthing for us to do is to start--start somewhere--where there is a broad \nconsensus. Let's get done what we can get done, and let's not let the \nperfect be the enemy of the good.\n  I think if we can establish, both from the Judiciary Committee and \nthen on the floor of the Senate, that we are capable of moving \nbipartisan legislation\n\n[[Page S883]]\n\nsuch as this forward and sending it to the President for his signature, \nhopefully we will start a growing trend of doing that, and this will be \nthe beginning, and not the end, of our discussions and hopefully our \nproductivity when it comes to criminal justice reform.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor, and I have been \ntrying to get time to do this, because I stand here in amazement that \nafter the Republicans took over on January 6--after they won big in \nNovember and they took over the Senate on January 6--it took them 1 \nmonth to threaten a government shutdown of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. Unbelievable. It took them 1 month to get into a situation \nwhere we are threatened with a shutdown of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. It is unbelievable to me because we know the threat of \nterrorism that is all around us, and playing politics with this is \nabsolutely uncalled for.\n  Why did they do that? They did that because the President under his \nauthority said we shouldn't deport immigrants who were raised in \nAmerica. That is what they didn't like.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to speak for up \nto 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. With terrorists all around us, Republicans are playing \npolitics with the critical funding for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and threatening a shutdown. It took them exactly a month in \npower to do that because they didn't like the fact that the President, \nwho is in line with Presidents of both parties, issued an Executive \norder. By the way, President Obama has issued the fewest number of \nExecutive orders in the history of any President. I never heard one \nRepublican complain when Ronald Reagan did a number of Executive orders \nor George Bush did Executive orders, all on immigration. And I have \nthose, for the record. But they didn't like this. I guess they would \nrather deport these DREAMers.\n  One of my colleagues said they are more scared of the DREAMers than \nthey are of ISIL--a joke. What are they afraid of? Some child who was \nbrought here at 3 years of age, went to school, is holding down a job, \ndoing great? Those are the people the President's Executive order is \naffecting. They are in my State, they are in Texas, they are in \nArizona, they are all over the country. If there is anyone swept up in \nthat who is not a good citizen, they don't get to have this benefit, \nwhich, by the way, does not include citizenship. It just says action on \nyour deportation is deferred.\n  I would say to anyone within the sound of my voice, if anyone from \nyour family ever came here from another country, think about what they \nare doing. Think about what they are doing.\n  It will cost billions of dollars to deport these students. Then, by \nthe way, they don't take up an immigration bill. If the status quo \nprevails, you are talking about deporting 11 million people. You have \ngot to be kidding. We had an independent analysis done by USC which \nshows how important it is to resolve this immigration issue, and what a \nboon it is to our society if we do so.\n  Well, the Republicans are stomping their feet. They never said \nanything when Ronald Reagan issued an Executive order on immigration. \nThey never said anything when George Herbert Walker Bush did it. They \nnever said anything before. But when this President does something that \nI think is very wise to make sure we keep these young people here, they \nthreaten to shut down the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Now let's talk about what that means. You would stop command-and-\ncontrol activities at the Department of Homeland Security headquarters. \nYou disrupt important programs that protect weapons of mass destruction \nand train local law enforcement. You force critical frontline personnel \nsuch as Border Patrol agents to work without pay.\n  Now maybe my colleagues would like to work without pay. Go for it. \nMost of us need our pay to live. Imagine the Border Patrol agents and \nTSA agents who work every day to support their families--they don't get \npaid.\n  It would jeopardize the safety of my constituency. During the last \nfiscal year California received over $200 million in crucial grant \nmoney that enabled State and local authorities to respond to national \nsecurity threats and prepare for natural disasters. The Republicans are \nputting this crucial funding in jeopardy.\n  Let's be clear: Even if they back off their threat to shut down the \ngovernment by shutting down Homeland Security, if they back off and \nsay, well, let's just fund it at last year's level, let me tell you, we \nwill not see those safety grants.\n  Last year, Texas, for example, received $105 million from these \ngrants. You cannot go home and tell your Governor, too bad, we are \nstepping out. You step up. It doesn't work like this. We are one Nation \nunder God. We have to protect our people.\n  I will tell you what else is threatened. Even if they back down and \nlet the government stay open but they fund it at last year's level, \nfirefighting grants such as the Assistance to Firefighters Grant \nProgram and the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response \nGrants Program would be delayed. These programs are vital to \nCalifornia. We have a nearly year-round fire season. Last year \nCalifornia firefighters received $20 million in fire grants that \nallowed fire departments all over our State to purchase necessary \nequipment.\n  Let me tell you, I have been to fire scenes I will never forget where \nwe have lost firefighters. They need equipment that saves their lives. \nThey are so great, but the wind changes and they find themselves in a \ncanyon, and if they don't have the right equipment--horrific results.\n  We also received $50 million in SAFER grants last year that allowed \nfire departments to hire and train firefighters. Sometimes you are in a \nsituation and if you haven't been trained on how to respond, it puts \nyour life and other lives in jeopardy.\n  Other States such as Ohio received a total of $33 million in fire and \nsafety grants last year.\n  I have to say, this kind of threat, after what we saw the last time \nRepublicans threatened a shutdown, makes no sense at all. We need a \nclean Department of Homeland Security funding bill. When I say that, I \nhope people understand I don't mean scouring the bill. What I mean is \nkeep extraneous issues off the bill. We all have our pet peeves. \nListen, a lot of people don't like the fact that the DREAMers are \nstaying here. They want to deport them. Introduce the bill to deport \nthe DREAMers, bring it to the floor--have at it.\n  I will talk about what it would have been like for me, whose mother \nwas born in Europe, and it took her a while to get her naturalization \npapers, if she was ripped out of my life. You know, I thought we had \nfamily values around here. We need a clean bill.\n  If you want to deport all the undocumented people--11 million--who \nare living in your communities and a lot of times fearful, that is a \nposition you can defend. Defend it. Explain why we should spend \nbillions deporting these people. Put up your solution. Don't try to \nkill a bill by holding it hostage to your demands.\n  We had an immigration bill this past year. It was terrific, it was \nbipartisan. Let's go for it. Let's go for it again. Let's have a \ndebate. Oh, no. They are in power for 30 days and they are already \nthreatening a government shutdown of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. I tell you, this is no way to run the greatest Nation in the \nworld.\n  These programs are critically important and are we going to turn our \nback on those who keep us safe?\n  TSA officers would not be paid during a DHS shutdown. The agency that \nseized a record 2,212 firearms last year from passengers' carry-on \nluggage (of which 83% were loaded)--would be\n\n[[Page S884]]\n\ndoing their important work keeping the traveling public safe without \npay.\n  And communities that are relying on federal FEMA funding to help them \nget back on their feet, after disasters have shattered their lives, \nwill have to wait to be reimbursed during a shutdown.\n  California emergency officials expect slowdowns in ongoing disaster \nrecovery operations like the RIM Fire and Napa Earthquake.\n  By failing to pass a clean DHS funding bill, we're putting the safety \nof our cities and our citizens at risk. The United States Conference of \nMayors agrees--they are urging us to pass a clean DHS bill to keep our \ncities functioning.\n  Unless Republicans stop catering to their extreme Tea Party wing, \ncritical programs that protect us from terrorists will be undermined or \nfrozen just weeks after the horrifying attack in Paris and evidence \nthat our enemies are willing and able to launch cyberattacks against \nus.\n  Republicans would rather tear families apart than provide critical \nfunding for the homeland security infrastructure that was built \nfollowing 9/11. It's clear that Republicans hate DREAMers more than \nthey hate ISIS.\n  The Republicans' extreme anti-immigrant amendments would have a \nchilling effect on the Latino community, instill fear of deportation \nfor victims of domestic and sexual violence, and subject DREAMers, who \nare peacefully contributing to our economy and community, to \ndeportation and exploitation. These are young men and women who have \nbeen living in the U.S. since they were children and came here by no \nfault of their own. They consider themselves just as much a part of the \nfabric of their communities--and this country--as their classmates and \npeers.\n  Specifically, the Republican amendments would prevent the \nimplementation of President Obama's DACA initiatives, which would \nenable many unlawfully present young people who came to the United \nStates as children to apply for ``deferred action,'' a temporary relief \nfrom removal not permanent immigration status--and work authorization.\n  It would also prevent the implementation of President Obama's DAPA \ninitiative, which would enable the parents of U.S. citizens or green \ncard holders who have lived here for years to apply for deferred action \nand work authorization as long as they pay fees, have not been \nconvicted of a serious crime, and submit to a background check.\n  It would prevent ICE from using its expertise to set immigration \nenforcement priorities, to focus on the most serious public safety \nthreats, as it has done for years.\n  It would put domestic violence survivors in danger by taking away \ntheir ability to stay in the United States and obtain the help that \nthey need and ensure that the perpetrators of this violence are \npunished.\n  DACA and DAPA will strengthen community policing, improve community \nsafety, and help more immigrant women come forward sooner to protect \ntheir children and themselves from domestic violence. Immigration law \nalready provides abused women an opportunity to apply for protection. \nWhy would we want to potentially curtail these protections from the \nwomen and children who need them the most?\n  Specifically, President Obama's Executive Actions on Immigration will \nimprove California's economy with an $11.7 billion increase in GDP over \nthe next 10 years, by giving California a boost in productivity from up \nto 1.5 million more people who could pay taxes and contribute to the \nstate's economy.\n  This will increase the average wages of U.S. born workers across the \ncountry by $170 a year and raise the Nation's gross domestic product by \nup to $90 billion over the next decade by expanding the labor force and \ngiving immigrant workers the flexibility to seek new jobs.\n  Let's come together. We had a really good meeting of the minds in a \nlovely setting last week, and a lunch. We agreed these differences are \nnot personal and it is fine that we have them. I don't mind. That is \nhealthy in a society. We want to have differing views. That is what \nmakes everyone in our country feel represented. The fact that I have \ncertain views and the Presiding Officer may have a different view is \nfine. What isn't fine, in my view, is using your views to hold the \nDepartment of Homeland Security funding hostage. Too much is at stake.\n  This Chamber is empty. We are not doing a darn thing. We even have \nRepublicans on our side and saying, no, this is not the right way to \ngo.\n  Why don't we do this: Why don't we fund the Department of Homeland \nSecurity--it went through the entire process--and then make an absolute \ncommitment, which the Republicans have the ability to do, to take up \nimmigration reform. Then let's debate it. Let's hear why some of my \nfriends on the other side want to deport the DREAMers. Let's find out \nwhy they don't want to do much about keeping families together. That is \nfine. Let's debate it. Let's move on. But let's not hold hostage the \nDepartment of Homeland Security funding to some ideological debate on \nimmigration, which should stand on its own and have the focus it \ndeserves.\n  Frankly, I hope we will begin with these unanimous consent requests--\nI won't do it today because I haven't warned anybody I want to--but \nfulfill the Department of Homeland Security and then immediately go to \nimmigration reform where we can hash it out and become the deliberative \nbody we are supposed to be.\n  Nobody is here. We are not doing anything right now, because we are \nstopped dead because of this dispute that has nothing to do with \nhomeland security, in my view.\n  The American people agree across the board on this. You shouldn't \nattach irrelevant legislative matters on a funding bill. They have a \nfunding bill. They have a job to do. In this case it is protecting \nAmericans from terror, OK? That is over here, and over here is a very \nlegitimate debate on immigration policy, and one that deserves the full \ntime of this United States Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a document entitled \n``Executive Grants of Temporary Immigration Relief, 1956-Present'' be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Executive Grants of Temporary Immigration Relief, 1956-Present\n\n       1956 (Eisenhower) Paroled orphans for military families who \n     wanted to adopt them; 1956-1958 (Eisenhower) Paroled \n     Hungarians who escaped the Soviets; 1959-1972 (Eisenhower, \n     Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon) Paroled Cuban asylum seekers who \n     fled the Cuban revolution; 1962-1965 (Kennedy, Johnson) \n     Paroled Chinese who fled Hong Kong; 1975-1979 (Ford, Carter) \n     Paroled Indochinese from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos; 1976 \n     (Ford) Extended Voluntary Departure for Lebanese; 1977 \n     (Carter) Temporarily suspended expulsion of immigrants who \n     were being deported because of an error by the State \n     Department; 1977-1982 (Carter, Reagan) Extended Voluntary \n     Departure for Ethiopians; 1977-1980 (Carter) Paroled Soviet \n     refugees; 1978 (Carter) Extended Voluntary Departure for \n     Ugandans; 1979 (Carter) Extended Voluntary Departure for \n     Nicaraguans; 1979 (Carter) Extended Voluntary Departure for \n     Iranians; 1980 (Carter) Extended Voluntary Departure for \n     Afghans; 1980 (Carter) Paroled Cubans and Haitians during the \n     Mariel boatlift.\n       1981-1987 (Reagan) Extended Voluntary Departure for Polish \n     after martial law declared in Poland; 1987 (Reagan) Directed \n     the Immigration and Naturalization Service not to deport \n     Nicaraguans and to grant them work authorizations if they \n     demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution, even if they \n     had been denied asylum; 1987 (Reagan) Deferred deportation \n     for unauthorized children of noncitizens who applied to \n     legalize; 1989 (Bush Sr.) Deferred deportation for Chinese \n     nationals following Tiananmen Square; 1989 (Bush Sr.) Paroled \n     Soviets and Indochinese, even though they were denied refugee \n     status; 1990 (Bush Sr.) Formalized Deferred Enforced \n     Departure for Chinese nationals following Tiananmen Square; \n     1990 (Bush Sr.) Deferred deportation of unauthorized spouses \n     and children of those legalized under the immigration reform \n     law; 1991 (Bush Sr.) Deferred deportation of Persian Gulf \n     evacuees after the Kuwait invasion; 1992 (Bush Sr., Clinton) \n     Deferred deportation of some El Salvadorans, even though \n     their Temporary Protective Status had expired; 1994 (Clinton) \n     Paroled Cubans into the U.S.; 1997 (Clinton) Deferred \n     deportation for Haitians in the U.S. that were here prior to \n     1995; 1997 (Clinton) Deferred deportation to noncitizens who \n     might gain relief under the Violence Against Women Act.\n       1998 (Clinton) Suspended deportations to El Salvador, \n     Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua after Hurricane Mitch; \n     1999 (Clinton) Deferred deportation for Liberians; 2002 \n     (G.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the impending \nexhaustion of the disability trust fund administered by the Social \nSecurity Administration.\n  The Social Security system contains two important programs. One is \nthe Old-Age and Survivors Insurance--or OASI--Program, often referred \nto as the retirement program. That program provides income to insured \nworkers and their families at retirement or death, based on their \npayroll tax contributions to the OASI trust fund. The other is the \ndisability insurance--or DI--program, which provides income to insured \nworkers who suffer from a disabling condition, based on their payroll \ntax contributions to the DI trust fund. Unfortunately, both trust funds \nface trillions of dollars in unfunded obligations.\n  Each trust fund is legally distinct, although they have been \ncommingled in the past into an imaginary fund labeled the ``OASDI trust \nfund'' or mingled with the General Fund.\n  Reserves in the DI trust fund are projected to be exhausted sometime \nlate in calendar year 2016, after which beneficiaries face benefit cuts \nof around 20 percent. The DI program alone faces unfunded obligations \nover the next 75 years of more than $1.2 trillion. Reserves in the OASI \ntrust fund are projected to be exhausted in 2034, after which retirees \nand their survivors face benefit cuts of around 25 percent. The \nretirement program alone faces unfunded obligations of around $9.4 \ntrillion over the next 75 years.\n  Financial operations of the OASI and DI trust funds are overseen by a \nboard of trustees composed of six members. Four of them serve based on \ntheir positions in the Federal Government, and two are appointed by the \nPresident and confirmed by the Senate.\n  Currently, Treasury Secretary Lew, Labor Secretary Perez, HHS \nSecretary Burwell, and Social Security's Acting Commissioner Colvin \nserve on the board. This is not what anyone would consider a band of \nfiscal hawks. Yet, in their most recent report, these trustees--who \nare, once again, high-ranking officials in the Obama administration--\nurged Congress to take action ``as soon as possible to address the DI \nprogram's financial imbalance.'' Those are pretty clear words. Those \nare not the words of any Republican trying to manufacture a crisis. \nThey are not the words of any Republican trying to hold anyone or \nanything hostage, as some of my friends on the other side have claimed. \nRather, they come from Obama administration officials who, in their \nroles as trustees, are forced to acknowledge reality.\n  I want to take this opportunity to once again urge the administration \nand my colleagues--particularly those on the other side of the aisle--\nto begin to work with me to find solutions that will at least begin to \nchip away at the known financial imbalances in the DI trust fund so \nthat we can prevent the coming benefit cuts.\n  Last year, in a Finance Committee hearing on the DI program, I made \nclear my willingness to work with anyone in Congress or the \nadministration to examine options and ideas about the DI program before \nthe DI trust fund becomes exhausted. Indeed, I have been trying for \nyears to get the administration to engage on this issue. Unfortunately, \nto date I have heard nothing from the administration and very little \nfrom my friends on the other side of the aisle about this issue. What I \nhave heard is fearmongering about supposed Republican plans to slash \nbenefits or engineer a false crisis or hold beneficiaries hostage. I am \nnot exaggerating; those are the very words they have used.\n  In budget after budget, the President has all but ignored Social \nSecurity in general and the DI program in particular. The President's \nbudgets generally only include calls for more administrative funding \nfor the Social Security Administration or the occasional idea for an \nexperimental trial.\n  After years of my asking the administration to engage on the DI \nprogram's financial challenges, the President quietly inserted his \npolicy position on DI just recently. With his fiscal year 2016 budget, \nwe finally learned that the President supports a ``stand-alone \nreallocation'' of incoming tax receipts away from the retirement trust \nfund over to the disability insurance trust fund. Oddly, one of the \nobjectives appears to be to make a reallocation so that both the \ndisability and the retirement trust funds become exhausted in the same \nfuture year, which, according to the budget, is 2033.\n  Needless to say, having a joint trust fund exhaustion as a target \ndoes not solve any fundamental financial problem facing the long-run \nfinancial challenges of Social Security. Moreover, it takes away any \nurgency for Congress to improve the disability program now, before it \nbecomes harder to do so down the road.\n  By stand-alone reallocation, the administration means that it wants \nto shift funds from the retirement fund to the DI fund with no \naccompanying policy changes of any kind--no change in overall payroll \ntaxes, no change in benefits, no substantive changes in program \nintegrity aside from the persistent call for more mandatory \nadministrative funds, not even a study.\n  There have recently been many misconceptions and misstatements about \nthe idea of a reallocation in general and a stand-alone reallocation in \nparticular.\n  The last time Congress made a reallocation from the retirement trust \nfund to the DI trust fund was in 1994. At that time, Social Security \ntrustees wrote the following about the reallocation and the DI trust \nfund:\n\n       While the Congress acted this past year to restore its \n     short-term financial balance, this necessary action should be \n     viewed as only providing time and opportunity to design and \n     implement substantive reforms that can lead to long-term \n     financial stability. . . .\n\n  Unfortunately, those reforms never came. And now, also unfortunately, \nthe President wants to tell the American people the same story: Punt \nnow to provide time for later action.\n  In addition, the financial challenges facing Social Security are very \ndifferent from past trust fund account reshuffling, including the one \nin 1994. The public trustees of the Social Security trust fund wrote \njust last year:\n\n       The present situation is very different from that of 1994. \n     . . . The DI Trust Fund's impending reserve depletion signals \n     that the time has arrived for reforms that strengthen the \n     financing outlooks for OASI and DI alike.\n\n  Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle say that we have \nhad many reallocations between the DI and OASI trust funds in the past \nand that it is just ordinary housekeeping or a technical change. It is \nsomething we do all the time, they say, so there is nothing really to \nsee here.\n  True, there have been trust fund reallocations in the past--sometimes\n\n[[Page S886]]\n\nfrom OASI to DI, sometimes the other way around, sometimes with overall \npayroll tax rate changes and sometimes not. But there has never--let me \nrepeat that: never--been a stand-alone reallocation from the retirement \nto the disability trust fund.\n  Most people who would dispute this talk about the reallocation of \n1994, which I mentioned earlier, but if the 1994 reallocation is \nsomehow to be considered a model of ordinary housekeeping that we \nshould repeat today, I think it is a bad model for the reasons I just \nidentified. Following that model, we would defer action until later, \nall the while claiming that real changes were on the horizon. And \nfollowing that model, we would continue to do nothing to place Social \nSecurity on a more stable financial footing.\n  Moreover, thinking of reallocation as just a normal way of doing \nbusiness raises many questions: Why was a separate DI trust fund set up \nto begin with? Why do we even call them trust funds if they are merely \nfungible accounting devices? Why not merge the OASI and DI funds and \ncall them the singular Social Security trust fund? More generally, \ngiven the recent stimulus-inspired mingling of General Fund revenues \nwith the OASI and DI trust funds, why have Social Security trust funds \nat all? And if historical reallocations are to be used to guide what we \nshould do today, then perhaps the recent reallocations from the General \nFund to both the OASI and DI trust funds, having been the most recent \nhistorical reallocation episodes, should be the most prominent \nprecedents.\n  When circumstances make us focus on the solvency of any trust fund, \nthere are two options. Option one: We can face up to the known \nfinancial challenges, examine what can be done about them in a \nbipartisan way, and try to enact solutions. Option two: We can kick the \nproverbial can further down the road by taking the most expedient route \nto reshuffle resources temporarily in order to get the problem out of \nthe way in the short term.\n  Unfortunately, the President and his allies here in Congress seem to \nprefer the latter--to kick the can down the road, the kick-the-can \nstrategy. This is especially disappointing given what the President \nsaid about Social Security when he took office in 2009. At that time, \nthe President said about Social Security:\n\n       What we have done is kicked this can down the road. We are \n     now at the end of the road and are not in a position to kick \n     it any further. We have to signal seriousness in this by \n     making sure some of the hard decisions are made under my \n     watch, not someone else's.\n\n  Well, the President has been on his watch for 6 years now, and if we \nlook at his administration's proposed solution to the coming DI trust \nfund exhaustion, he seems more than content to push any hard decisions \noff until his term is over. President Obama now not only wants to kick \nthe can down the road, but he also wants to do it in a way that has \nnever been done before.\n  Elementary budget arithmetic makes clear that you simply cannot \nstrengthen the financial outlooks for our two Social Security programs \nand their trust funds simply by shifting resources from one to the \nother. Indeed, Director Elmendorf of the nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office recently said: ``If you want to help both programs you're \nnot going to accomplish that by just moving money around between \nthem.''\n  Rather than engaging in yet another unnecessary partisan battle, we \nneed to take this opportunity to work together to see what can be done \nin a bipartisan way to address the impending exhaustion of reserves in \nthe DI trust fund. Once again, I urge the administration and my friends \non the other side of the aisle to work with me on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I will have more to say on this issue in coming days. \nFor now, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

She had been in the region working \nwith Syrian refugees.\n  Kayla once said that what inspired her work was that she found ``God \nin the suffering eyes reflected in mine.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about an Arizona original--\nformer Senator and Presidential candidate Barry Goldwater.\n  Senator Goldwater was no stranger to this Senate floor, having served \nfive terms in this body and having been his party's Presidential \nnominee in 1964. By the end of his time here, Goldwater was an elder \nstatesman and the go-to guy on national security, having chaired the \nCommittee on Armed Services and the Select Committee on Intelligence \nand having reorganized the Pentagon structure with the Goldwater-\nNichols Act. He was also respected for his unapologetic fiscal \nconservatism. Goldwater was probably best known for his staunch defense \nof personal liberty and for reviving and redefining what it means to be \nconservative.\n  While he may have lost the election in 1964 to Lyndon Johnson, he \nlaid the groundwork for the Republican Party's future and the eventual \nresurgence under Ronald Reagan.\n  As columnist George Will once noted, it took 16 years to count the \nvotes from 1964, and Goldwater won.\n  For many of us, he was a role model. Before I came to Congress, I was \nhonored to serve as the executive director of the Goldwater Institute, \nan Arizona organization that bears his name and his philosophy.\n  Born before Arizona was even a State, Goldwater, as did so many great \nmen, honed his passionate interests in the nonpolitical world around \nhim. He was an avid, published photographer. In fact, Goldwater's \nestate contained some 15,000 photographs, many of them of Arizona \nlandscapes and the people he loved so much.\n  He also occasionally took his camera to social events, once even \nsnapping President Kennedy at the White House. Kennedy inscribed the \nphoto, ``For Barry Goldwater, whom I urge to follow the career for \nwhich he has shown such talent--photography.''\n  In addition to being a conservative warrior, Goldwater was an actual \nwarrior, having flown supply missions over ``the hump'' in World War II \nand retiring as a major general in the U.S. Air Force Reserve. He \nbelieved in peace through strength.\n  Barry Goldwater was plainspoken. He was stubborn. He was patriotic. \nHe was independent. In short, Goldwater embodied the very spirit of \nArizona.\n  Tomorrow--at long last--Barry Goldwater will be honored with a statue \nin the Capitol, representing his beloved Arizona. Goldwater may have \nonce described himself as ``the most underdog underdog there is,'' but \nI can't think of a more deserving recipient nor of a more fitting \nrepresentative of our State.\n  Well done, Barry Goldwater.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S887]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/10/senate-section/article/S887-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S887-S888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                UKRAINE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is ironic that the Senator from Ohio is \npresiding because I am going to speak about the situation in Ukraine.\n  For the record, the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Portman, the current \nPresiding Officer, and I have now initiated a bipartisan caucus in the \nSenate concerned with the future of Ukraine, and my remarks will \naddress that during the next minute or two.\n  We are approaching the 1-year anniversary of a dark chapter in modern \nhistory, the forcible Russian seizure of sovereign territory in \nUkraine. Perhaps the world shouldn't have been surprised by Russian \nPresident Putin's brazen attack on well-established international \nnorms. We have seen this movie before when it comes to Mr. Putin, in \nGeorgia in 2008, using military force to seize the territories of South \nOssetia and Abkhazia.\n  What we are facing in Ukraine is a threat to the foundation of \nEuropean security agreements and norms of the last several decades. We \nare facing the use of military force by Putin to undermine a democratic \nsovereign nation's aspirations to join the international democratic \ncommunity. These ugly threats and actions by Putin must not go \nunchallenged.\n  That is why this week I wrote a bipartisan letter, along with the \nPresiding Officer, Senator Portman, as well as Senators Brown, \nBarrasso, Blumenthal, and others to President Obama urging the United \nStates and NATO to work together to ensure Ukraine has the defensive \ncapabilities and equipment to halt and reverse further Russian \naggression.\n  Thousands have been killed, thousands more displaced. A civilian \nairliner was shot down, murdering hundreds of innocent people, and \nnationalistic fervor and Soviet-style propaganda have been used to \nfurther rob the Russian and Ukrainian people of their own political \nfreedoms.\n  Let's recall how we got to this awful situation. In March of last \nyear, Russian President Putin used manipulation and military might to \nannex the sovereign region of Crimea--not because Ukraine was about to \njoin NATO, not because Ukraine was about to join the European Union, \nnot because Ukraine was about to cut economic or historical ties to \nRussia, even if it did sign an association agreement with the European \nUnion, and not because Russian-speaking Ukrainians were in any danger.\n  No, Putin took this brazen and destabilizing action because he needed \nto rally nationalist sentiment in his own country for his own political \nsurvival--to protect his own kleptocracy. He did so because he needed a \nwar to distract Russians from the frustrations they had over a weak \nnational economy, domestic political repression, the elimination of \nRussia's free press and civic organizations, and increasing Russian \nexasperation with the heavyhanded rule of Mr. Putin.\n  He did so because his ally and former Ukrainian President Yanukovych \nwas democratically removed from office by a unanimous vote of the \nUkrainian Parliament after he squandered negotiations for closer trade \nties with the European Union and then presided over the murder of more \nthan 100 of his own citizens. Apparently Putin did so because he felt \naggrieved by the West.\n  Instead of inspiring his own people to share the many talents and \naccomplishments of the Russian nation as part of the larger global \ncommunity, Putin has spread a message of victimhood and the West is \nreally still the enemy.\n  What a waste. What an insult to the proud and talented Russian \npeople. Putin's tactics are from the old Soviet playbook, tired and \ndated tactics of propaganda, military power, and domestic repression.\n  The resulting destruction and human misery in Ukraine has been \nsignificant and has been increasing by the day. Thirteen innocent \nUkrainian citizens, including pensioners and little children, were \nkilled in a horrific bus attack last month in Volnovakha.\n  The city of Mariupol recently came under shelling, killing 30 and \ninjuring another 100 civilians--part of a likely attempt to militarily \nseize another strategic coastal area.\n  Ukrainian Government forces and civilians have come under mounting \nfire in the strategic city of Debaltseve, where residents are fleeing \nby the busload. Russian heavy weapons and military personnel continue \nto brazenly flow into eastern Ukraine, despite Putin's refusal to \nacknowledge the obvious. Nearly 750,000 Ukrainian citizens are now \nliving as displaced persons within their own country because of this \noffensive action by the Russians.\n  The World Health Organization estimates that 5 million Ukrainians \nliving in areas where the fighting is fiercest are in dire need of \nbasic health care services. People trapped in the cities of Luhansk and \nDonetsk are essentially without any medical assistance. The Ukrainian \nofficials say January was one of the bloodiest months in eastern \nUkraine since the conflict started. All the while, Russia and its \nproxies in eastern Ukraine continue to balk at peace talks and even \ndeny their military actions.\n  Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States and Europe \nhave worked to strengthen ties with Russia, to help it become a partner \nin the global community. Of course, our interests didn't always \noverlap, and there were disagreements. That is the nature of any \ninternational relationship. But to whip up anti-Western propaganda on \nstate-controlled media and insult Russian people--they deserve more.\n  The West didn't lock up Western opposition leaders whose only so-\ncalled crime was to disagree with Putin. The West didn't shut down all \nthe independent media in Russia to deny the Russian people a free flow \nof ideas. The West didn't shut down Russian groups whose sole purpose \nwas to ensure fair elections. The West didn't conduct a Russian \nPresidential election in 2012 that was loaded with fraud and \nirregularity. The West didn't create a system of corruption around \nPutin that enriches a lucky few oligarchs and tarnishes Russia's \neconomy and international reputation. The West certainly didn't focus \non creating false enemies, both domestic and international, to distract \nfrom the real work of diversifying Russia's economy.\n  Let me be clear. The West did not cause the protests in Ukraine, in \nthe Kiev, Maidan Square. The protesters were Ukrainians fed up with \nendless corruption and political malfeasance. I met with several of \nthose leaders in Ukraine, and I can assure everyone they were Ukrainian \npatriots, not Western proxies.\n  While I have been giving the speech, my friend and colleague Senator \nMcCain has come to the floor, with whom I visited Ukraine several \nmonths ago. He was there during the Maidan demonstrations and has \nfirsthand knowledge of how this was a homegrown effort to bring real \nchange to Ukraine. I am glad to see him on the floor at this moment.\n  New York Times columnist and Pulitzer Prize winner Tom Friedman \ncalled what is happening in Ukraine under Putin ``the ugliest \ngeopolitical mugging happening in the world today.''\n  Perhaps you have seen the recent excellent episode of the PBS \n``Frontline'' documentary entitled ``Putin's Way.'' It meticulously \nlaid out the web of corruption and destruction around Putin's rise to \npower. It showed how each contrived crisis at home has been used to \nconsolidate Putin's grip on power, and it left little doubt the lengths \nPutin will go to to protect the web of corruption that is ensuring his \nfuture. What a waste.\n  I commend the President for working with our European allies to \nimpose severe economic sanctions on Russia for its actions in Ukraine. \nThese sanctions have some impact. In fact, Russia's credit rating is \nnow reduced to junk bond status. But Putin and his proxies have only \ndoubled down, launching new offensives in eastern Ukraine, leading to \nmore death and human misery.\n  I have concluded, and I believe the Senator reached a similar \nconclusion because of a letter we cowrote this week, that the United \nStates has to do more to protect the Ukrainian people. I know it is a \ndebating point with some of our European allies as to whether we are \nescalating the conflict. But to leave Ukraine poorly prepared to defend \nits own territory--to leave the civilians in Ukraine so open to the \naggression of the Russian invaders--is\n\n[[Page S888]]\n\nwrong. We can provide lethal defensive weapons to help the Ukrainians \ndefend their own homeland, their own country, from this Russian \ninvasion. I think we should, and I encourage the administration to move \nforward. I have reached the conclusion we eventually have to deal with \nthis bully with force. Force must be met with force. We must give the \nUkrainian people the means to defend themselves and to build a modern \ndemocratic nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to mourn the tragic death of \n26-year-old humanitarian aid worker Kayla Jean Mueller of Prescott, AZ, \nwho had been held by ISIL terrorists in Syria since August of 2013.\n  I am heartbroken for the Mueller family at the loss of their \nbeautiful, beloved Kayla. The thoughts and prayers of the people of her \nhome State of Arizona, our country, and the civilized world are with \nthe Mueller family at this terrible hour.\n  I want to take the time today to share a bit of Kayla's story. This \nwonderful young woman represented the best of us. She had a remarkable \nimpact on the lives of so many people who never had the honor of \nmeeting her, and her story will forever be an inspiration to us.\n  Kayla attended high school at Tri-City College Prep in Prescott, AZ, \nwhere she was recognized as a National Young Leader and received the \nPresident's Award For Academic Excellence in 2007, the Yavapai County \nCommunity Foundation Youth Philanthropist of the Year Award in 2005, \nand the Gold Presidential Volunteer Award in 2007 for her volunteer \nefforts with Youth Count, AmeriCorps, America's Promise, Open Inn for \ntroubled youth, Big Brothers Big Sisters, and other organizations.\n  After graduating from Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff in \n2009, Kayla committed her life to helping people in need around the \nworld--first in India, then Israel, the Palestinian territories, and \nback home in Prescott where she volunteered at an HIV-AIDS clinic, and \na women's shelter. But it was the conflict in Syria that drew Kayla's \ngreatest interest and, again, sparked her desire to help those in need. \nIn a YouTube video she made in October 2011, as the Syrian civil war \nwas just beginning, Kayla said:\n\n       I am in solidarity with the Syrian people. I reject the \n     brutality and killing that the Syrian authorities are \n     committing against the Syrian people. Because silence is \n     participation in this crime, I declare my participation in \n     the Syrian sit-in on YouTube.\n\n  In December 2012, Kayla traveled to the Turkish-Syrian border where \nshe worked for months helping the thousands of Syrian refugees whose \nlives were torn apart by the humanitarian catastrophe created by Bashar \nal-Assad and the Syrian civil war.\n  According to her family, Kayla found this work heartbreaking but \ncompelling. She was extremely devoted to the people of Syria and their \nstruggle. Kayla explained to her family her call to service this way. \nShe said:\n\n       I find God in the suffering eyes reflected in mine. If this \n     is how you are revealed to me, this is how I will forever \n     seek you. I will always seek God. Some people find God in \n     church. Some people find God in nature. Some people find God \n     in love; I find God in suffering. I've known for some time \n     what my life's work is, using my hands as tools to relieve \n     suffering.\n\n  When Kayla traveled back home to visit her family in Arizona in May \nof 2013, she spoke about her experiences at the Prescott Kiwanis Club \nwhere her father was a member. After recalling helping a Syrian man, \nwhose wife had been murdered, to reunite with a 6-year-old relative he \nwas desperately searching for after their refugee camp was bombed, \nKayla said:\n\n       This story is not rare in Syria. This is the reality for \n     Syrians two and a half years on. When Syrians hear I'm an \n     American, they ask, ``Where is the world?'' All I can do is \n     cry with them, because I don't know.\n\n  After spending time with the refugees, Kayla told the Kiwanis Club \nshe was totally drawn in, and that she ``can't do enough'' to help. She \nrecalled stories of children being hurt by unexploded bombs, women \nforced into early marriages, elementary schools targeted for bombing by \nthe Syrian regime, and people living in caves to escape the bombing.\n  Kayla went on. She said:\n\n       Syrians are dying by the thousands, and they're fighting \n     just to talk about the rights we have. . . . For as long as I \n     live, I will not let this suffering be normal. [I will not \n     let this be] something we just accept. It's important to stop \n     and realize what we have, why we have it and how privileged \n     we are. And from that place, start caring and get a lot done.\n\n  She described part of her work helping the Syrian children in the \nrefugee camps--including drawing, painting, and playing with the \nchildren, many of whom were badly scarred physically and \npsychologically by the war.\n  She said:\n\n       We give and get joy from playing with these children. Half \n     the 1.5 million refugees the U.N. has registered are \n     children. In the chaos of waking up in the middle of the \n     night and being shelled, we're hearing of more children being \n     separated from their families by accident.\n\n  Asked by Kiwanis members what her recommendations for addressing the \nconflict were, Kayla said, ``A no-fly zone over refugee camps would be \nnumber one.''\n  Kayla also believed if the terrible reality of the conflict were \nbetter known to Americans, our Nation would be more heavily engaged. \n``The people of the United States would see that something needs to be \ndone,'' she said.\n  Today the Mueller family released a letter written to them by Kayla \nin the spring of 2014. I want to read a bit of it to give a sense of \nthis young woman, her deep faith in God, her profound love for her \nfamily, and her remarkable strength in the face of grave danger.\n  She wrote: I remember mom always telling me that all in all, in the \nend the only one you really have is God. I have come to a place in \nexperience where, in every sense of the word, I have surrendered myself \nto our Creator because literally there was no one else. By God and by \nyour prayers, I have felt tenderly cradled in free fall. I have been \nshown in darkness and light and have learned that even in prison one \ncan be free. I am grateful. I have to see that there is good in every \nsituation; sometimes we just have to look for it. I pray each day that, \nif nothing else, you have felt a certain closeness and surrender to God \nas well and have formed a bond of love and support amongst one another. \nI miss you all as if it had been a decade of forced separation.\n  Kayla closed with these words: The thought of your pain is the source \nof my own. Simultaneously, the hope of our reunion is the source of my \nstrength. Please be patient. Give your pain to God. I know you would \nwant me to remain strong. That is exactly what I am doing. Do not fear \nfor me; continue to pray, as will I. By God's will we will be together \nsoon. All my everything, Kayla.\n  In a statement today, the Mueller family reflected on Kayla's life \nand their commitment to work every day to honor her legacy:\n\n       Kayla was a compassionate and devoted humanitarian. She \n     dedicated the whole of her young life to helping those in \n     need of freedom, justice and peace. Kayla was drawn to help \n     those displaced by the Syrian civil war. She first traveled \n     to Turkey in December 2012 to provide humanitarian aid to \n     Syrian refugees. She told us of the great joy she took in \n     helping Syrian children and their families. We are so proud \n     of the person Kayla was and the work she did while she was \n     here with us. She lived with purpose and we will work every \n     day to honor her legacy. Our hearts are breaking for our only \n     daughter, but we will continue on in peace, dignity and love \n     for her.\n\n  On behalf of the people of Arizona and the Congress of the United \nStates, I express our deepest condolences to Kayla's parents, Marsha \nand Carl Mueller, her loving family, and many friends. Our thoughts and \nprayers are with you. Kayla devoted her young life to helping people in \nneed around the world, to healing the sick, and bringing light to some \nof the darkest and most desperate places on Earth. She will never be \nforgotten.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter written by Kayla during her \nimprisonment to her family be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Everyone, If you are receiving this letter it means I am \n     still detained but my cell mates (starting from 11/2/2014) \n     have been released. I have asked them to contact you + send \n     you this letter. It's hard to know what to say.\n\n[[Page S889]]\n\n     Please know that I am in a safe location, completely unharmed \n     + healthy (put on weight in fact); I have been treated w/ the \n     utmost respect + kindness. I wanted to write you all a well \n     thought out letter (but I didn't know if my cell mates would \n     be leaving in the coming days or the coming months \n     restricting my time but primarily) I could only but write the \n     letter a paragraph at a time, just the thought of you all \n     sends me into a fit of tears. If you could say I have \n     ``suffered'' at all throughout this whole experience it is \n     only in knowing how much suffering I have put you all \n     through; I will never ask you to forgive me as I do not \n     deserve forgiveness. I remember mom always telling me that \n     all in all in the end the only one you really have is God. I \n     have come to a place in experience where, in every sense of \n     the word, I have surrendered myself to our creator b/c \n     literally there was no else . . . . + by God + by your \n     prayers I have felt tenderly cradled in freefall. I have been \n     shown in darkness, light + have learned that even in prison, \n     one can be free. I am grateful. I have come to see that there \n     is good in every situation, sometimes we just have to look \n     for it. I pray each each day that if nothing else, you have \n     felt a certain closeness + surrender to God as well + have \n     formed a bond of love + support amongst one another . . . I \n     miss you all as if it has been a decade of forced separation. \n     I have had many a long hour to think, to think of all the \n     things I will do w/ Lex, our first family camping trip, the \n     first meeting @ the airport. I have had many hours to think \n     how only in your absence have I finally @ 25 years old come \n     to realize your place in my life. The gift that is each one \n     of you + the person I could + could not be if you were not a \n     part of my life, my family, my support. I DO NOT want the \n     negotiations for my release to be your duty, if there is any \n     other option take it, even if it takes more time. This should \n     never have become your burden. I have asked these women to \n     support you; please seek their advice.

Mr. President, despite the fact that we are just days \naway from the Department of Homeland Security shutting down, we don't \nyet have an agreement to fund a clean bill to keep the Department of \nHomeland Security operating. Unfortunately, we haven't heard from the \nmajority that there is interest in addressing this issue this week. I \nthink that is very unfortunate.\n  We are ready to work to pass a clean full-year bill to fund the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, and last week we actually asked \nunanimous consent to take up and pass the clean bill that Senator \nMikulski and I introduced to fund the Department for the rest of the \nyear and to then have votes on immigration matters. I think we are \nhappy to debate immigration, but we don't believe we should do it on \nthe bill that would fund the Department of Homeland Security. \nUnfortunately, that unanimous consent was rejected.\n  Now, we could pass a clean bill this afternoon, and we should. We \nshould stop playing politics with our national security. In just a few \ndays, with our Nation dealing with real and dangerous terror threats, \nsome Members of Congress have suggested we should shut down the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. Because of their extreme opposition to \nthe President's Executive actions on immigration, they are willing to \nput at risk the security and safety of this country. So I have come to \nthe floor today to talk about why we need to put politics aside for the \nsecurity of our Nation and why we need to pass a full-year funding bill \nfor the Department of Homeland Security.\n  A short-term budget, which is what some Members of Congress are \ndiscussing, should be off the table. A short-term budget, a continuing \nresolution, or a CR, means the government is on autopilot, and that is \nextraordinarily bad for business and for security. We need to pass a \nfull-year bill.\n  If the Department of Homeland Security operates under a short-term \nbudget, grants to protect our cities and our Nation's ports from terror \nattacks would be halted, grants to police and firefighters won't be \nawarded, contracts and acquisitions would be postponed, hiring would be \ndelayed, and employee training would be scaled back.\n  Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson recently said:\n\n       As long as this Department continues to operate on a CR, we \n     are prevented from funding key homeland security initiatives. \n     These include funding for new grants to state and local law \n     enforcement, additional border security resources, and \n     additional Secret Service resources. Other core missions, \n     such as aviation security and protection of federal \n     installations and personnel, are also hampered.\n\n  A little while ago, Senator Booker and I held a conference call with \nMayor Anisse Parker of Houston, TX, Mayor Michael Nutter of \nPhiladelphia, and New York City Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence and \nCounterterrorism John Miller. They talked about how very real and \ndangerous the consequences would be for cities if we don't fund \nHomeland Security. Our big cities and our major urban areas are \nunfortunately top targets for terrorists, and if we don't pass a full-\nyear funding bill for DHS, a grant program specifically designed to \nhelp cities plan, prepare for, and defend against possible attacks will \nbe halted.\n  One of the things that Deputy Commissioner Miller talked about is the \nfact that there have been 16 plots that have been thwarted against New \nYork City, and that was done, to a great extent, by programs funded \nthrough the Department of Homeland Security. At risk is nearly $600 \nmillion in funding to keep our cities safe that will be put on hold. \nWithout those resources, cities and the millions who live there are at \nrisk; and that is not to mention all of the other small communities \naround this country that are at risk. That is just unacceptable.\n  Now, Mayor Nutter, from Philadelphia, talked about how they are not \nable to train first responders because the funding is uncertain. They \ndo not know if we are going to get a bill, and so they do not know if \nthey can continue to train. He said they do not have reimbursement for \ntheir fusion centers if we don't get a funding bill for Homeland \nSecurity. He said: It is not right to put the heavy burden on those on \nthe front lines, those first responders who are there in cases of \nemergency.\n  Mayor Parker from Houston talked about her employees at the police \ndepartment, at the public health agency, and the Department of Homeland \nSecurity employees who are affected by our failure to get a funding \nbill. She said right now they are dealing with measles in the city of \nHouston, and it is very important they have public health workers who \ncan go out and deal with that epidemic. Yet those health employees are \ngoing to be at risk if we don't get a clean funding bill. She also \nmentioned the three airports they operate and one of the busiest ports \nin the world, and those are at risk if we can't get a funding bill.\n  Our major commercial ports are also targets for terrorism attacks. If \nwe don't pass a full-year funding bill for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, the Port Security Grant Program will be put on hold, meaning \nnearly $100 million won't be allocated to keep our ports safe \nthroughout the Nation.\n  One of those programs where we will see a gap is in radiation \ndetection. One of the things our investigators do, as they are looking \nat making sure our ports are secure, is to check for radiation, for \nnuclear materials that might be coming in to this country. Yet they \nwon't have the instruments, the equipment they need to do that if we \ndon't get a clean funding bill.\n\n[[Page S890]]\n\n  Deputy Commissioner Miller talked about, as I said, the 16 terrorist \nplots against New York City that have been thwarted. But he also \npointed out that at virtually every major New York City event when they \ndo the security, whether it is the New York marathon or New Year's Eve \nin New York City, the security that protects those events is funded in \nwhole or in part by Department of Homeland Security programs.\n  A short-term budget for the Department of Homeland Security would \nmean there are no new grants for police and firefighters in every State \nin the country. I don't mean that is a new program. I mean the grant \nfunding doesn't turn over each year. That means our firefighters in New \nHampshire won't be able to apply for SAFER grants again to make sure we \nhave the force we need.\n  I heard from our Laconia police chief in New Hampshire last week, and \nhe talked about what the impact would be if they can't get that funding \nfrom the Department of Homeland Security. He told a story about how \nthey had been able to save a young man, 22 years old, who was \nsnowmobiling and who went through Lake Winnisquam in New Hampshire. The \nreason they were able to save his life was because they had four \nfirefighters they could put into water-resistant suits and send them \nout, because they had additional funding through a SAFER grant, giving \nthem the ability both to train those firefighters and to make sure \nthere was somebody else there directing them and taking that call. So \nthere are very real impacts if we fail to get this funding done.\n  In the last 2 years, New Hampshire alone has received more than $7 \nmillion in grants to provide training for more than 3,800 first \nresponders across our State and another $6 million over that same \nperiod to help hire more firefighters--firefighters such as those in \nLaconia who saved that 22-year-old young man. Nearly 300 police \nofficers in New Hampshire have been given live-action training for \nactive-shooter situations in recent years. We were also able to train \nand equip the State police bomb squad and the Nashua bomb squad--Nashua \nis the second largest city in New Hampshire--through those DHS \nresources.\n  A short-term budget, a continuing resolution for the Department of \nHomeland Security puts all of these critical support programs in \njeopardy, and that is why we are hearing from communities across the \ncountry. That is why last week we got letters from the U.S. Conference \nof Mayors, the National Association of Counties, the International \nAssociation of Emergency Managers, and the International Association of \nFirefighters, all calling on Congress to pass a clean, full-year \nfunding bill for the Department of Homeland Security. They understand \nthat our failing to do that would be disastrous.\n  Three previous Department of Homeland Security Secretaries, two \nRepublicans and one Democrat, did the same last week. Then on Sunday \nthe Wall Street Journal wrote an editorial. I ask unanimous consent \nthat editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 8, 2015]\n\n                          Can the GOP Change?\n\n       Republicans in Congress are off to a less than flying start \n     after a month in power, dividing their own conference more \n     than Democrats. Take the response to President Obama's \n     immigration order, which seems headed for failure if not a \n     more spectacular crack-up.\n       That decree last November awarded work permits and de facto \n     legal status to millions of undocumented aliens and dismayed \n     members of both parties, whatever their immigration views. A \n     Congressional resolution to vindicate the rule of law and the \n     Constitution's limits on executive power was defensible, and \n     even necessary, but this message has long ago been lost in \n     translation.\n       The Republican leadership funded the rest of the government \n     in December's budget deal but isolated the Department of \n     Homeland Security that enforces immigration law. DHS funding \n     runs out this month, and the GOP has now marched itself into \n     another box canyon.\n       The specific White House abuse was claiming prosecutorial \n     discretion to exempt whole classes of aliens from \n     deportation, dumping the historical norm of case-by-case \n     scrutiny. A GOP sniper shot at this legal overreach would \n     have forced Democrats to go on record, picked up a few \n     supporters, and perhaps even imposed some accountability on \n     Mr. Obama.\n       But that wasn't enough for immigration restrictionists, who \n     wanted a larger brawl, and they browbeat GOP leaders into \n     adding needless policy amendments. The House reached back to \n     rescind Mr. Obama's enforcement memos from 2011 that \n     instructed Homeland Security to prioritize deportations of \n     illegals with criminal backgrounds. That is legitimate \n     prosecutorial discretion, and in opposing it Republicans are \n     undermining their crime-fighting credentials.\n       The House even adopted a provision to roll back Mr. Obama's \n     2012 order deferring deportation for young adults brought to \n     the U.S. illegally as children by their parents--the so-\n     called dreamers. The GOP lost 26 of its own Members on that \n     one, passing it with only 218 votes.\n       The overall $40 billion DHS spending bill passed with these \n     riders, 236-191, but with 10 Republicans joining all but two \n     Democrats in opposition. This lack of GOP unity reduced the \n     chances that Senate Democrats would feel any political \n     pressure to go along.\n       And, lo, on Thursday the House bill failed for the third \n     time to gain the 60 votes needed to overcome the third \n     Democratic filibuster in three days. Swing-state Democrats \n     like Indiana's Joe Donnelly and North Dakota's Heidi Heitkamp \n     aren't worried because they have more than enough material to \n     portray Republicans as the immigration extremists.\n       Whatever their view of Mr. Obama's order, why would \n     Democrats vote to deport people who were brought here as kids \n     through no fault of their own? Mr. Obama issued a veto threat \n     to legislation that will never get to his desk, and he must \n     be delighted that Republicans are fighting with each other \n     rather than with him.\n       Restrictionists like Sens. Ted Cruz and Jeff Sessions are \n     offering their familiar advice to fight harder and hold firm \n     against ``executive amnesty,'' but as usual their strategy \n     for victory is nowhere to be found. So Republicans are now \n     heading toward the same cul de sac that they did on the \n     ObamaCare government shutdown.\n       If Homeland Security funding lapses on Feb. 27, the agency \n     will be pushed into a partial shutdown even as the terrorist \n     threat is at the forefront of public attention with the \n     Charlie Hebdo and Islamic State murders. Imagine if the \n     Transportation Security Administration, a unit of DHS, fails \n     to intercept an Islamic State agent en route to Detroit.\n       So Republicans are facing what is likely to be another \n     embarrassing political retreat and more intra-party \n     recriminations. The GOP's restrictionist wing will blame the \n     leadership for a failure they share responsibility for, and \n     the rest of America will wonder anew about the gang that \n     couldn't shoot straight.\n       The restrictionist caucus can protest all it wants, but it \n     can't change 54 Senate votes into 60 without persuading some \n     Democrats. It's time to find another strategy. Our advice on \n     immigration is to promote discrete bills that solve specific \n     problems such as green cards for math-science-tech graduates, \n     more H-1B visas, a guest-worker program for agriculture, \n     targeted enforcement and legal status for the dreamers. \n     Democrats would be hard-pressed to oppose them and it would \n     put the onus back on Mr. Obama. But if that's too much for \n     the GOP, then move on from immigration to something else.\n       It's not too soon to say that the fate of the GOP majority \n     is on the line. Precious weeks are wasting, and the \n     combination of weak House leadership and a rump minority \n     unwilling to compromise is playing into Democratic hands. \n     This is no way to run a Congressional majority, and the only \n     winners of GOP dysfunction will be Mr. Obama, Nancy Pelosi \n     and Hillary Clinton.\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. The Wall Street Journal wrote:\n\n       DHS funding runs out this month, and the GOP has now \n     marched itself into another box canyon. If Homeland Security \n     funding lapses on February 27, the agency will be pushed into \n     a partial shutdown even as the terrorist threat is at the \n     forefront of public attention with the Charlie Hebdo and \n     Islamic State murders. Imagine if the Transportation Security \n     Administration, a unit of DHS, fails to intercept an Islamic \n     State agent en route to Detroit?\n\n  Well, the Wall Street Journal is right. These are dangerous times. \nOur Nation is on high alert for terror threats after the attacks in \nParis and Ottawa and Sydney that have shocked the world in recent \nmonths. We don't have the luxury of playing politics with Homeland \nSecurity funding. We are trying to keep pace with threats that can \noccur at any time, anywhere, with little or no warning. We have to be \nprepared.\n  It is not just security grant programs for State and local first \nresponders that would get shortchanged if we fail to pass a full-year \nbill. Border security, maritime security, and nuclear detection \nactivities would be underfunded as well.\n  Under a short-term budget, Immigration and Customs will not have the \nfunding they need to meet their legal mandate to have 34,000 detention \nbeds in place for immigration detainees.\n\n[[Page S891]]\n\n  Under a short-term budget, there is no additional funding for ICE--\nImmigration and Customs--to hire additional investigators for anti-\ntrafficking and smuggling cases to combat the influx of unaccompanied \nchildren at the southern border.\n  Under a short-term budget, there is no funding to address Secret \nService weaknesses identified by the independent Protective Mission \nPanel in response to the White House fence-jumping incident.\n  Under a short-term budget, aging nuclear weapon detection equipment \nwill not be replaced, causing gaps that could allow our enemies to \nsmuggle a nuclear device or dirty bomb into the country.\n  A short-term budget would delay upgrades to infrastructure that allow \nfor emergency communications among first responders.\n  A short-term budget would delay the contract for the Coast Guard's \neighth national security cutter--a cutter we need for maritime \nsecurity. Life-extending maintenance work on the important 140-foot \nicebreaking tugs, 225-foot oceangoing buoy tenders, and the Coast \nGuard's training vessel would be scaled back. The deep freeze on the \nGreat Lakes in 2014 cost the shipping industry $705 million and 3,800 \njobs. Upgrading the Coast Guard's 140-foot icebreaking fleet is \ncritical to dealing with these conditions.\n  A short-term budget would prevent Customs and Border Protection from \nawarding contracts for new remote video surveillance systems to detect \nborder crossings and track threats.\n  Funding DHS should not be controversial. Playing politics and \nthreatening to cut off critical programs that protect the country from \nterror attacks would result in consequences we can't afford. We should \nwork together to pass a full-year, clean funding bill to continue the \nimportant work the Department of Homeland Security does every day to \nkeep Americans safe.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/10/senate-section/article/S891-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S891-S892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                UKRAINE\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, each time I have taken to the floor to \ncomment on the Ukrainian crisis which I have done often the situation \nin that hard pressed country is worse. Today we see renewed and even \nmore violent Russian aggression ripping off more ragged bites of \nUkrainian territory.\n  Now, ten months after Russia's invasion of its neighbor, we are again \nseeing calls for more assistance to Ukraine, including providing \nweapons that would better enable the Ukrainians to defend themselves. \nBut still the White House dithers--baffled again by the complexities of \na world that pleads for leadership. Once again we are absent not just \nleading from behind, which is bad enough, but in many cases not leading \nat all, and the world continues to look to us for guidance and for \nsupport in dealing with some of these crises.\n  The plight of Ukraine, torn to bits by Russian aggression, is among \nmany foreign policy problems that have been aggravated by U.S. policy \nfailures. Those failures have come from a White House isolated in a \nwasteland of confusion. The Obama administration has no coherent \nstrategy for dealing with the world other than, in a now famous \nparaphrase, ``Don't do stupid stuff''--whatever that means. But not \ndoing anything is stupid stuff, and a lot of times that is exactly what \nis coming out of the White House nothing.\n  At the same time, we in Congress need to look at ourselves. We must \nconcede that Congress also has failed to grapple with these pressing \nissues particularly over the last ten months relative to Ukraine. We \nalso have failed to live up to our constitutional responsibilities. We, \ntoo, have failed to offer or compel solutions when congressional action \ncould have helped.\n  One way in which we can correct that record is by giving the \nUkrainian crisis our renewed attention. I am happy to say, under \nRepublican leadership, despite what we have been prevented from doing \nin the past ten months, we are now in a position to begin doing just \nthat.\n  Why Ukraine, and why does it deserve our full attention? For the \nfirst time since the Second World War, a European state has invaded and \nannexed the territory of a neighbor. This outrageous contravention of \nevery possible standard of state behavior in the modern world passed by \nwithout a response that could have reversed the outrage and without the \nreaction that might forestall it being repeated in other states \nbordering on Russia. We will see what happens.\n  Vladimir Putin's ruthless ambitions have been backed by a massive \nSoviet style propaganda campaign that continues to include outrageous, \nbald faced lying by the President of Russia and his most senior Russian \nofficials. They continue to deny what has been obvious to the world and \ndocumented, verified facts about Russian troops and equipment flowing \ninto Ukraine and the obvious intentions of further territorial \nexpansion.\n  Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda chief, invented the ``big lie'' \ntheory that Putin is using to great effect. Hitler famously said that \nmany people tell small lies, but few have the guts to tell really big \nones, and when they do and the lies are repeated over and over, they \nbecome a new truth. Tragically, I believe we are at that stage in the \nUkraine crisis.\n  At the onset of this crisis, I drafted and introduced a resolution \nsupporting the territorial integrity of the Ukraine and condemning \nRussian aggression. Later, I created and introduced the Crimea \nAnnexation Non recognition Act and the Russian Weapons Embargo Act. I \nalso cosponsored the Russian Aggression Prevention Act and the Ukraine \nFreedom Support Act. Unfortunately, none of these measures emerged from \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee during the previous session of \nCongress, all stymied by the committee's prior leadership. The only \nmeasure that did pass the Senate was one I coauthored and sponsored \nwith Senator Durbin, a resolution condemning illegal Russian aggression \nin Ukraine. So the Senate's record of legislative inaction does not \nshow a Senate that has dealt effectively with this international \ncrisis.\n  It is more difficult to criticize the administration for being \nineffective when we in the Senate have also failed to pass almost any \nmeaningful legislation to provide the executive branch with the advice \nand guidance it so obviously requires. I trust the record will improve \nthis year and that change will begin immediately. I believe this is \nhappening, and we will see that on this floor shortly.\n  In the meantime, the civil war in Ukraine continues and, until last \nweek, almost beneath the radar. With renewed vigor, separatists, newly \narmed and reinforced by Russia, are waging latest and continuing \nbattles for territory in eastern Ukraine. There is little pretense at \neven trying to disguise the involvement of Putin's Russia in these \nrenewed attacks. At least 6,000 people have been killed by combat in \nUkraine, more than 1,000 of them since the latest so called cease fire \nallegedly took effect. At least half a million people are internal \nrefugees.\n  But the even greater ongoing tragedy is the geopolitical catastrophe. \nA newly aggressive Russia, driven by destructive delusions of \nnationalistic destiny, poses a threat to the stability of the region \nand to Europe itself. This is a completely self-evident reality for our \nallies on Russia's periphery, including those such as Poland and the \nBaltic States, who in the past have been crushed into nonexistence by \nRussian aggression.\n  If we in Congress together with the executive branch and if the \nUnited States together with our European allies cannot respond to \nPutin's Russia in a way that stops this dangerous aggression, then he \nwill have won. Putin is counting on the force of his troops and his \npropaganda machine to create a fait accompli to which we will have \nlittle or no reply. He is counting on our distraction and exhaustion to \ngive him a free pass. He is counting on the political complexity of our \ndemocracy to obstruct sound policymaking. And he is counting on us to \nfalter just at the moment when his violent aggression is paying off and \nhis people are prepared for more.\n  I am speaking today to urge the Senate to work quickly to change \nPutin's calculations about the costs he and his nation will suffer \nshould Russia not return to rational, responsible modern state \nbehavior. Leading in this manner will not be easy. Yes, we are besieged\n\n[[Page S892]]\n\nwith foreign policy issues. Yes, providing the needed Senate response \nand meaningful legislative proposals is difficult. Yes, ultimately the \nfinal responsibility and leadership rests with the President. But the \nSenate historically has been instrumental in developing and influencing \nU.S. foreign policy. At this critical time, we must do so again, and we \nmust do so again particularly because so little comes our way from 1600 \nPennsylvania Avenue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about a little-discussed \naspect of the Affordable Care Act. Before touching on the main subject, \nI should point out that I think as of tonight there will be more than \n11 million Americans who will have already signed up for health care \ncoverage under the Affordable Care Act so far this year. Of course, the \ndeadline is coming up next week, and this weekend there could be a very \nlarge influx of newly insured Americans, which I think is an occurrence \nwe should all feel very proud of and should celebrate.\n  I wish to speak about a part of the Affordable Care Act that gets \nvery little mention, very little discussion, and very little \ncontroversy. It is a provision that enables local organizations within \na State to form cooperative insurance entities, to form nonprofits, to \nprovide insurance to their citizens. Today I wish to speak about one of \nthose--and one of the most successful in the country--the Maine \nCommunity Health Options program.\n  It is a story of an opportunity. It is a story of a vision. It is a \nstory of an idea. It is a story of risk taking. It is a story of \ncreative and dedicated Maine professionals who were willing to take a \nrisk and try to implement a new idea. It is one of the health insurance \nco-ops, as I mentioned, that was established by the Affordable Care \nAct. The Affordable Care Act provided the opportunity to develop \nsomething new and different in health insurance--a company where \npurchasers of health insurance also become members and then elect other \nmembers to serve on the board of directors of their insurance company.\n  Kevin Lewis and Robert Hillman, two of the founders, saw an \nopportunity in the ACA to develop this idea they knew was needed to \naddress the challenges of health care coverage for Maine citizens. \nWorking with a group of people in Maine who shared their concerns about \nhealth care, they built Maine Community Health Options based on this \nvision of meeting Maine's people's health insurance needs in a direct \nand hands-on way.\n  Would it work? Nobody knew. When the enrollment opened last year, \ntheir goal, their hope, their vision was for 15,000 signups. By the \ntime the dust settled at the deadline last spring, they had 40,000 \nsignups. Eighty-three percent of the marketplace signups in Maine had \nsigned up with this fledgling company. This year, I am told, as of \ntoday they have over 60,000 signups.\n  I did a tour of their offices recently in Lewiston, ME, and we talked \nabout this phenomenon of all the signups that came unexpectedly. It \nreminded me of a TV commercial we all saw a few years ago where these \nyoung people start an Internet startup. They see the sales orders \ncoming in, and they are happy. Then they start to come in even faster, \nand they get even more excited. Then they start to come in even faster, \nand they look at each other and say, what do we do now? These people in \nMaine experienced exactly that. Great, it is working. A few more. Wow, \nthat is great. Then it went crazy. They all shook their heads. When we \ntalked about this in Lewiston a few weeks ago, they said that is \nexactly the way it felt.\n  This sounds simple and straightforward, and it wasn't. When those \n40,000 folks were signing up and the systems were challenged, Maine \nCommunity Health Options faced those issues head-on. They figured out \nwhere the problems were, addressed them, and communicated to members \nquickly and directly. That is really the Maine way.\n  The explosion of growth of this little company from zero to 60,000 is \na jobs story as well. Maine Community Health Options now employs over \n130 people and has even contracted with a local call center in Maine to \nprovide additional customer support during this enrollment period. Even \ntheir chosen location is a good-news story. It is a great news story \nfor New England and for Maine because they are in an old textile mill. \nThe textile industry flourished in New England up through the 1950s but \nthen left these beautiful old mills in Lewiston, ME. One of these \nmills--first one floor and now two floors--is being repurposed for this \n21st century project of bringing health insurance to the people of \nMaine. It is humming with activity, new jobs, and people supporting \ntheir families.\n  It is also a local control story. Maine Community Health Options \nrecently held elections for the board--a board that has to be made up \nof 51 percent of their individuals who are members who are elected by \nother members. In other words, the people who use the products and who \nbuy the health insurance are actually making decisions about how those \nproducts should be designed. They are responsible to the folks who \nelect them--like us.\n  The structure of the organization is only part of the story. I think \nthis is very important. They are also focused on the business of \nhealth--individual health and community health. They are focused on \nprevention.\n  The cheapest medical intervention of all of this is the one that \nnever occurs, because people have preventive care that keeps them from \nmore serious chronic care. They have a chronic illness support program \nand a tobacco cessation program which are both designed to make it \neasier and cheaper for members to manage chronic care or stop smoking. \nThat is how we are going to save money in the health care system. They \nhave a behavioral health partnership creating a nearly seamless \ntransition for members in need of short-term mental health services, \nwith no copay for the first three visits. They are doing community \noutreach. They recognize many people who have never had health \ninsurance coverage before don't fully understand how to use it. Their \ncommunity outreach effort includes informational presentations on \nhealth care for members and nonmembers alike.\n  Another part of the good-news story is Maine Community Health Options \nhas just expanded its coverage into New Hampshire and is providing a \nnew health care option for the people of New Hampshire. Whereas last \nyear, as I understand it, New Hampshire only had one option on their \nexchange, now I think they have at least two, and perhaps three or \nfour, one of which I commend to the Presiding Officer is based in \nLewiston, ME.\n  Finally--and I think this is very important--what has this done for \nrates? I think we have lost sight of this in the last couple of years. \nFor many years, one of the problems in health care in this country was \nthe exaggerated inflation of health care costs--5, 6, 7, 8 percent a \nyear was not unusual in the late 1990s and the early first decade of \nthis century. That was the typical, somewhat expected inflation in the \nrates of health care costs--in the cost of health care and, therefore, \nin insurance rates.\n  Maine Community Health Options not only has reduced its already \ncompetitive rates, reduced its rates by 1 percent this year, but that \ncompetitive pressure, we believe, has also brought pressure to reduce \nrates for other providers and other carriers in Maine.\n  This is a great news story. This is people who saw an opportunity \ncreated by the Affordable Care Act to create a new kind of health \ninsurance company that is owned and run by its members, that is \ndelivering health care, quality health care insurance coverage, to the \npeople of Maine and now the people of New Hampshire, that is helping to \ncontrol costs, and I think most importantly is taking an active role in \nassisting its members in improving their own health. Of course, this is \nabout cost. Of course, it is about access. Of course, it is about all \nthe mechanics of health insurance. But in the end, if the result is \nhealthier people, people who need the intervention of the health\n\n[[Page S893]]\n\ncare system less frequently, that is a huge win for those individuals, \nfor our State, for our region, and for our country.\n  I come to the floor today just to share some good news about an \naspect of the Affordable Care Act that is absolutely working, and it is \nmaking a huge difference in the lives of thousands, tens of thousands, \nof Maine people. Better health coverage, better health at a lower \ncost--what is not to like about that formula?\n  I am very proud of what these entrepreneurial individuals in Maine \nhave undertaken and the success they have enjoyed so far. I look \nforward to working with them as they continue the project that has \nmeant so much to my people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/10/senate-section/article/S893-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S893-S896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               OUR SOUTHERN BORDER AND IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, last weekend--this past weekend--I was \nprivileged to visit our Nation's border with Mexico. Not my first visit \nbut maybe the most productive, most informative visit I have had. I had \nthe opportunity, as a member of the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee, on which the Presiding Officer serves, to visit our \nNation's border with Mexico from--really from California, from the \nPacific all of the way across the southern part of our country, almost \nto the Gulf of Mexico.\n  I did not cover every square inch of it or every mile of that border, \nbut we had a chance to look up close and personal, if you will, to see \nwhat we are doing and what we have been doing in California, in parts \nof Arizona, in parts of Texas. As we all know, those are some big \nStates. But we have been there enough, talked to enough smart people, \nwent with our colleagues, this time with the chairman of our committee \nnow, Ron Johnson from Wisconsin, and with Ben Sasse, the new Member \nfrom Nebraska. I am grateful to them for including a former chairman of \nthe committee and my staff. I thought it was very productive. I learned \na lot. I thought I already knew a lot going down there, but I came back \neven better informed. I hope they felt that way as well.\n  We had some discussions going and coming about the President's \nExecutive orders with respect to the status of some of the undocumented \nfolks in our country. I know there is a fair amount of heartburn on the \npart of our Republican colleagues that the President may have acted \ninappropriately. We understand that unhappiness. My hope is that we \nwill not take that unhappiness out on the Department of Homeland \nSecurity whose employees are working hard to try to do their jobs, to \nprotect us from all kinds of dangers, not just on the borders of our \ncountry with Mexico or Canada but all kinds of threats around the \nworld.\n  My hope is that at the end of the day we will use this dustup, if you \nwill, this disagreement with the President's actions to provide a sense \nof urgency to take up and debate again comprehensive immigration \nreform--not next year but this year, not this fall, not this summer but \nthe beginning of this year, now or very close to now.\n  One of the things we have learned in terms of our own work on the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs is immigration \nreform done well--and I do not know how the Presiding Officer voted. I \nvoted for it. I was not crazy about it. My guess is she probably voted \nfor it as well. But was it perfect? No, not by any stretch of the \nimagination. Was it better than nothing? It sure was. Are there some \nthings I would like to change? You bet there are.\n  My hope is that we do immigration reform again, hopefully soon, and \nthat we will have the opportunity to keep what is good and valuable in \nthat legislation and change the things that are not. But among the \nthings on the positive side that came out of that legislation is, one, \nthe bill, supported by two-thirds of the Senate a year and a half ago, \ndoes a couple of things.\n  How does it affect gross domestic product? How does it affect our \neconomy? It grows it by about 5 percent over the next 20 years. That is \na pretty good little stimulus to help make sure the economic recovery \ncontinues. So that is something to have us keep in mind.\n  The other immigration reform question a lot of people back home in \nDelaware asked me was, Immigration reform, isn't that going to cost us \na lot? Isn't it going to make the budget deficit bigger?\n  The Congressional Budget Office, which is neither Democratic nor \nRepublican, has actually studied that, drilled down on that, and here \nis what they have concluded. The immigration reform, imperfect though \nit was, that we passed a year and a half ago with strong bipartisan \nsupport, would actually reduce our budget deficit over the next 10 \nyears by $200 billion and further reduce our budget deficit over the \nnext 10 years after that by $700 billion. Add those together, it is \n$900 billion in deficit reduction.\n  We are at a time when, as our Presiding Officer knows, we still have \nall the deficits down by two-thirds from where it was 5 or 6 years ago. \nIt is still higher than we want it to be. There are actually a number \nof things we can do to continue to drive it down closer to zero, where \nwe would like it to be. I know I would like that. I know the Presiding \nOfficer feels that way too.\n  One of the things we had in the immigration reform bill, as I recall, \nwas some provisions dealing with guest worker programs. What I have \nheard in my visits to Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, my visit to the \nborder, a lot of the people--it is primarily those three countries from \nwhich the greatest numbers of people are coming across the border in \nSouth Texas--that is where they are coming from. Are there still \nMexicans who come into the United States? Yes. Legally and illegally? \nYes.\n  Last year I am told almost as many Mexicans were going back into \nMexico from the United States as are coming into the United States from \nMexico. The origin of the illegal immigration is Honduras, Guatemala, \nand El Salvador. People say: Why would anybody allow their 7-, 8-, 9-, \n10-year-old daughter or son to literally leave in the arms of a coyote \non a train--not on a passenger train but on the top of a train--and try \nto travel 1,500 miles with all kinds of threats to their life and limb? \nWhy would anybody do that?\n  Having been in those countries--Honduras is the murder capital of the \nworld, and I have seen in that country and in Guatemala and El Salvador \npolice who do not police, prosecutors who do not prosecute, judges who \ndo not administer justice, correctional systems that do not try to \ncorrect the behavior.\n  The school system in Honduras is a great example. Kids in Honduras go \nfrom--I know the Presiding Officer has young children. Our boys are \nthrough school out into the world. But in schools in Honduras, public \nschools, they go from grade 1 to grade 6. About half the kids actually \nmake it to grade 6. Of the ones who make it to grade 6, only about half \nof them can read at grade 6 level. As to the ones who actually make it \nthrough grade 6, only 5 percent of them can do sixth grade math. That \nis a problem.\n  Several years ago when Hurricane Richard came through Honduras, it \nwiped out half of their secondary roads. In that country, they have \nelectricity costs which are two or three times what they are in the \ncountries to the south of them and to the north of them. Most of the \nelectricity is created by petroleum. It is expensive. What they need to \ndo is use natural gas, bring it down from Mexico, be able to convert \nthat into electricity and build a grid that helps distribute that \nelectricity.\n  The other thing they need in that part of the world--as a former \nattorney general, our Presiding Officer knows well how important this \nis--is to restore the rule of law. In visiting the three countries--\nHonduras, I will use again as an example. Until last year, I think \ntheir murder rate was about 95 per 100,000 people. That was their \nmurder rate. It was the murder capital of the world.\n  A number of businesses were shut down by extortion because small \nbusiness people in Honduras got tired of\n\n[[Page S894]]\n\nbeing extorted basically from gangs who said: Give me money. If not, I \nwill kill you. Small business owners gave up--15,000 of them. Fifteen \nthousand small businesses that were there 3, 4, 5 years ago closed.\n  The conscription of gang members--the Presiding Officer I think has \nheard me tell this story. But we heard this from one of the folks in \nCatholic Charities in Southern Delaware, in Sussex County, Georgetown, \nwhere we have some Guatemalan population from way back--they worked in \nthe poultry industry, some of them--and some of the unaccompanied \nminors who have come to Southern Delaware, not thousands of them but \nmaybe 100 or more.\n  One of the stories was told to us by the folks who are trying to \nprovide some help for those young kids. There is a story. It is from \nHonduras. A 15-year-old boy was conscripted to join a gang. He was told \nby the gangs: We want you to join the gang.\n  He said: I don't want to join the gang.\n  A week or two later they came back and said: We want you to join our \ngang.\n  He said: I'm not interested in joining the gang.\n  A little bit later they came back and said: If you don't join this \ngang, our gang, we're going to kill somebody in your family.\n  He joined the gang, and later on he found out about his initiation \nand what he would have to do as part of his initiation into the gang \nthat he did not want to join.\n  Part of the initiation was--he had a 13-year-old sister--he had to \nrape his 13-year-old sister. Within a week or two that 15-year-old boy \nand 13-year-old sister were on their way north with a coyote to get out \nof that country and ultimately ended up in the southern part of our \nState.\n  People say to me: Well, why would all those people risk their lives? \nCan you imagine letting your kids go or my kids go? I cannot imagine \nthat, what has happened, again and again and again. Part of what was \nreiterated to me on this trip is it is all well and good that we \ncontinue to strengthen our borders. We spent a fortune, one-quarter of \na trillion dollars in the last 10 years to strengthen our borders with \nMexico. Are they stronger? You bet they are. Are they totally \nimpervious? No, they are not. Are there things we could do to make them \nstronger, more stalwart? Of course there are.\n  One of the great things about the codel that I was privileged to join \nChairman Johnson and Senator Sasse on is we basically learned--had \nreinforced to us those things that were working. Let's find out what is \nworking, do more of that, and find out what is not working and do less \nof that.\n  One of the things we have to do is not just continue to address the \nsymptoms of the problem--people trying to come across the border. God \nknows we need to do that. We can. We can do it more smartly, more cost-\neffectively. The other thing we need to do is to get at the underlying \nroot causes. The reason people are coming up, risking life and limb to \nget through Mexico to get to the United States, is because of the lack \nof hope, lack of economic opportunity, the corruption they faced in \ntheir lives for a number of years.\n  What are some of the things we learned that are working? The \nDepartment of Homeland Security folks with whom we met at the border, \nfolks working at the border, Border Patrol, people in aircrafts, \nhelicopters, Homeland Security folks on watercraft, and the people who \nare running the centers for minors, people who have been detained and \nare being held--and some will be returned; most of the adults will be \nreturned; for folks with criminal records, almost all of them will be \nreturned to their native countries--but I saw some remarkable work. We \nsaw remarkable work being done by employees at the Department of \nHomeland Security. Coast Guard people are doing it. All kinds of folks \nare involved in it--ICE, Border Patrol, folks who are working at these \nvery busy land crossings where we have billions of dollars' worth of \ncommerce going through these borders from the United States into \nMexico. We have a bunch of them across the southern part of our Nation. \nMexico is a huge trading partner with us and we with them. One of my \ntakeaways is, How do we continue to move that commerce, move that \ncommerce to benefit us, create jobs here and frankly in Mexico as well? \nHow do we do that in a way that makes sure we are doing a good job \nstopping the human trafficking from coming across our borders, and at \nthe same time make sure the illegal drugs, not just marijuana but \nespecially the cocaine and the heroin that folks are trying to get \nacross our borders by water, by air, by land gets stopped.\n  There is a real tension here, and I thought we came back with great \nideas of how to do a better job of meeting both responsibilities--the \nstuff we want to keep out of our country, including people out of the \ncountry who are illegal. We can do that. We need to do a better job--I \nthink we are doing a better job--and also at the same time make sure \nthe flow of commerce continues unimpeded.\n  The legislation that was passed about 18 months or so ago with strong \nbipartisan support sought to double, I believe, as I recall, the number \nof people who work in the Border Patrol doing some of the border \nsecurity work. We already have about 20,000 people there. I think we \nhave another maybe 20,000 or so who are working the ports of entry to \ntry to make sure we are stopping bad people, bad things, including \ndiseases, insects, and all kinds of things that hurt our agriculture \neconomy to try to stop that from getting through.\n  The bill we had said we ought to basically double the number of \npeople who are working on the border for security. Do we need some more \npeople? Yes, we especially need them at the ports of entry.\n  What we truly need though is some technology. I call them force \nmultipliers. I am a big believer in drones. I spent a lot of time in my \nlife in Navy P-3 aircraft. One of the joys of the weekend for me was to \nbe on a Navy P-3 aircraft--the kinds of airplanes I flew on as a \nmission commander, a naval flight officer on Active Duty, and later as \na reservist. I retired as a Navy captain, I think in 1991, but to \nactually be on a P-3 aircraft again and to take an aircraft that is \nmuch older than you and not as old as I, to see that aircraft \nreconfigured--actually the wings and insides are new as well, the \navionics up front--and to see the changes in the equipment that we \nhave, there is better radar, and there is an ability to put that \naircraft out over water and to pick up the bad guys whether they are in \ncigarette boats or a submersible with a periscope poking out of the \nwater.\n  There are also helicopters to see what we can do as we patrol the Rio \nGrande River--very low altitudes, twisting and turning and actually \nfinding some people trying to get across.\n  To look at the drugs and try to understand what our capabilities are \nwith the drones, I think they are terrific. Are we getting full bang \nfor our bucks? No, we are not. The inspector general from the \nDepartment of Homeland Security has issued--not that long ago--a \nfinding that was very critical of the effectiveness of the drones.\n  I am convinced there is a great potential there. I am determined. I \nam sure working with Democrats and Republicans and our committee in the \nSenate and hopefully the House and certainly with the administration. \nWe need to make sure we are getting full value for everything we are \nputting into the drone technology, in the deployment of drones.\n  If we are going to spend more money on drones, I want to make sure we \nget our entire money's worth. I am sure the taxpayers feel that way as \nwell.\n  One of my thoughts, aside from the technology, I wish to work with \nthe Presiding Officer, with the Republicans, and I want to work with \nthe Democrats on comprehensive immigration reform. I want us to finish \nthe work we started, and I want us to do it sooner than later. I hope \nthe money we have to spend in that bill to strengthen our borders, we \nspend it in a smart way.\n  I have mentioned a couple of those ways too. One of those is the \ndrones, to make sure we take into account the investigation by the \ninspector general and his folks and make sure they are being honest and \nstraightforward with us. I am sure they wouldn't deliberately mislead \nus, but I want to make sure we are getting our value.\n  I want to mention a couple of other things. I spent a little bit of \nmy life in an airplane, some of my time in the\n\n[[Page S895]]\n\nNavy in a P-3. During the Vietnam war, we flew a lot of missions off \nthe coast of Vietnam and Cambodia. Our job was to pick up little \ninfiltrator trawlers trying to resupply the Viet Cong and turn them \nover when we found them, track them to the coast, and turn them over to \nswift boats and the Coast Guard. That was our job.\n  We also did an area of surveillance of shipping traffic going into \nHaiphong Harbor. The capital of North Vietnam, Hanoi, was there. We \nwere trying to make sure we knew what was going in and out of that \ncountry.\n  When we were doing those kinds of missions, largely what we did was \nwe did ocean surveillance, subsurface ocean surveillance. We tracked a \nlot of Soviet nuclear submarines, diesel submarines, to make sure we \nknew where they were and what they were up to.\n  The other thing we did from time to time, we would be called on for \nour Navy P-3 assets to do a search and rescue. As we have seen from the \nMalaysian aircraft that disappeared a number of months ago and the \nIndonesian aircraft that disappeared a number of months ago, we put the \nP-3 airplane up there to help search for them. We put them out across \nthe Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean with, in many cases, binoculars, \nbut radar was running as well and we were trying to listen to see if \nthere were any radio signals coming out.\n  We also came out with binoculars. I am going to tell you, looking for \npeople in a boat, looking for wreckage with binoculars from an aircraft \nout of the ocean at 1,000 feet, 5,000 feet or 10,000 feet, that is very \nhard to do and not very fruitful.\n  We have these fixed-wing aircraft that the Homeland Security owns. \nThey are called Cessna 206. They are a single engine and they fly for \nmaybe 5 or 6 hours. They are actually a pretty good platform, but we \nessentially use them--if we use them at all--with binoculars, looking \nfor people coming to our border from Mexico or trying to get across our \nborder.\n  That isn't very smart. There is a system called VADER and the VADER \nsystem is a highly advanced, sophisticated system that enables us to \nsee from 5,000, 10,000, 20,000 feet, day or night, what is coming \nthrough our borders, in some cases even in inclement weather.\n  For us to fly aircraft, whether they are drones, fixed-wing aircraft, \nwhatever, and not use that technology is not very smart. If we have \nsomething that is that good--as I have seen with my own eyes, even on \nthis trip--what an advantage that gives us for being able to detect \npeople coming to our border, across our border or over our border. That \nis hugely helpful information. We can deploy our forces by helicopter, \nby vehicle or by foot or by horse.\n  The Presiding Officer has been to Afghanistan a time or two. I have \nbeen there a couple of times myself. I had a chance to see the tethered \ndirigibles--lighter than air--that were used in Afghanistan, Kabul and \nother places, to enable us to surveil through cameras and other \nassistive devices, surveil what is going on in Afghanistan and in \nKabul, for example. They are very helpful.\n  It seemed to me the first time I was there--the first couple of times \nI was at the border--the first thing I asked was why do we use that \ntechnology? Why don't we use that technology, tethered lighter-than-air \ndirigibles that can go up to 1,000 feet, 2,500 feet, 5,000, 10,000--why \ndon't we use them along the borders, particularly as we are bringing \nthat equipment technology back from Afghanistan?\n  Well, we are starting to do that. One of the things we did, we \nactually were at the tethered dirigible site on the border by the Rio \nGrande River, and we had the opportunity, with the tethered dirigible \nup and operating, to actually be in the shack, if you will--there is \nactually a modern shack right at the base of the dirigible--and see \npeople coming through Mexico--about a half dozen or so--approaching our \nborder and waiting for sundown or dusk to be able to come across the \nRio Grande River.\n  It gave us the opportunity to know they were coming, to marshal our \nforces, and to have them positioned appropriately, if these folks came \nacross, to take them into custody. If they were folks who were not \ncoming here lawfully or for asylum or just looking for an opportunity \nfor a better life or a better economic life or if they were bringing \nbad stuff--drugs, and a bunch of them do--then we were in a position to \ndeal with that.\n  But the technology, the tethered dirigible, the technology we can put \non those--cameras, radar, great stuff--we ought to be doing more of \nthat. Again, I like to find out what works and do more of that. But \nthat is a great force multiplier and not the only one.\n  We also have towers. These are towers that are not tethered \ndirigibles. These are towers that are maybe 100, 200 feet in the air. \nThey don't allow someone, as the dirigible does, to look over the \nhorizon, but they can certainly give a good idea of what is going on \nfor several miles, either way, maybe 2 or 3 miles in radius. The \ndirigibles go up 10, 15 miles in radius to see what is going on and \ninform us--in all kinds of weather. But the towers that are on the \nground are fine.\n  Airboats, one of the exciting things we did was add boats, fast \nboats. We have gone up and down the Rio Grande River--gosh, maybe a \nmile away. The fellow who was running our boat--I might be getting \nconfused with our helicopter--but in any event, as we were doing \nhelicopter runs up and down the river and airboats up and down the \nriver--I think the pilot actually saw something in our helicopter about \na mile up going around the bend. He actually picked up visually at \nleast one or two people who were approaching the banks of the river on \nthe Mexican side. Sure enough, we ran in on them, and they had a raft \nthere and several people who were apparently trying to come across the \nriver.\n  But we have some parts of the Rio Grande River--the kind of \nwatercraft we were in works just fine, but there were other parts of \nthe river where we needed airboats because the water was very shallow, \nand the boats we were in would run aground. So one of the other \ntakeaways in terms of force multiplier is to make sure we have boats, \ntechnology that is appropriate, also making sure we have the \ncommunications equipment we need but also making sure we are using \nthings such as airboats when we need them.\n  The other thing I was saying--I hadn't thought about this until right \nnow--but one of the things that is very important for us to better \nsecure our borders is for Mexico to better secure their borders. For \nMexico, when folks are trying to get across from these three Central \nAmerican countries and they are coming toward the southern border of \nMexico, Mexico needs to realize they have a dog in this fight. If we \nstop them at our border, that means all these immigrants are going to \nbe in Mexico. It will provide challenges, some problems, if you will, \nfor the Mexican people in some cases.\n  Just as a refugee needs a place, needs work or needs food or shelter, \nit is all of those challenges with movement of population such as this. \nIn some cases they are criminals. In most cases they are not, but in \nsome cases they are criminals. Does the Mexican Government want all of \nthose problems? No, they don't. They are finally awakening to that and \nthey are doing a much better job, particularly with their multi-layer \napproach on their southern border to slow and stop--to some extent--the \nflow of illegal immigrants coming from the three Central American \ncountries I have mentioned.\n  The other thing that Mexico can be very helpful with is shutting down \ntrain service. I say that with tongue in cheek. There is a train called \n``The Beast''--in fact, several of them. They emanate from southern \nMexico. They run the full length of the country, about 1,500 miles. \nPeople are able to climb--until at least recently--on top of these \nfreight trains and hold on for dear life or maybe get into the rail car \nand hunker down, travel the length of the country, and get off as the \ntrains approach the border with the United States.\n  It is sort of like riding the Amtrak train from Delaware to New \nOrleans or from Delaware to Chicago and basically not having a ticket, \njust traveling along, a free rider.\n  I have said to the Mexican Government: Why do you do this? Why do you \nallow them to do this? We would never let people ride our free trains \nlike this and come down to your country. Why do you allow this?\n\n[[Page S896]]\n\n  God bless them. They finally said: Well, we are going to stop that. \nInstead of having maybe a couple thousand people on ``The Beast,'' this \ntrain--this freight train with people on top of the freight cars \nholding on for dear life--now we have a handful--maybe a handful--of \npeople allowed to do this, which is helpful.\n  The other thing Mexico can be helpful in--and they are doing I think \na better job--is sharing information with us, the sharing of \ninformation. They have an idea of who is coming through their country, \nwho is bringing them, and we need that information. We actually need \nsome more information from Honduras and Guatemala.\n  We are getting reasonably good information, intelligence from the \nMexicans and the other countries, and we need it to be better. To the \nextent that we get that better information, it enables us to be better \npositioned to respond with human assets and with some of these force \nmultipliers that I have been talking about.\n  I wish to mention--if I could again go back to the border crossings. \nWhen we think of a border crossing, we think of a road maybe or \nsomething, maybe it is a bridge. These are unbelievable. Some of them \nare huge and unbelievable infrastructures that have been constructed \nwith multiple lanes of traffic going each way. Traffic is backed up in \nsome cases for hours trying to get from the United States into Mexico. \nMaybe they are taking parts down for auto assembly and then coming back \nwith finished products.\n  But there is a huge flow of trade which benefits Mexico and frankly \nbenefits us as well. There is an old saying: Time is money. To the \nextent that folks in a just-in-time economy are trying to move \nproducts, trying to move goods, to have to wait for those lengths of \ntime is not good.\n  We can do a better job. We need to do a better job in terms of the \npeople whom we have working there at the border for us and in terms of \nthe kind of technology we are using.\n  I wish to use as an example one piece of technology that I saw, \nsomething just a little bit bigger than my handheld device here. A \nwoman who is working the border at the crossing for all the trucks \ntrying to come and go--she showed me her handheld device. She said: \nThese are the next six or so trucks lined up to come through from \nnorthern Mexico.\n  I said: Really? Do you know anything about any of them?\n  She clicked on one of the trucks. It had the history of the truck \ncoming across our border this year--maybe even before this year--and \nthe driver information, about who is the driver, how often has he or \nshe been coming across our border. It is very good stuff.\n  We have the ability to detect radiation, the ability to detect \nshipments of guns, and the ability to detect people who are in \nvehicles. That is all well and good, but we need to continue to update \nand modernize that technology at the border and frankly put more money \ninto the infrastructure so that flow of commerce is not impeded to the \nextent it is today.\n  I think that is it, pretty much. I always think, when I go through a \nlong ramble such as this, I should come back at the end and try to \npoint out a couple of points and repeat what I really want to convey.\n  I am really glad we went to the border. I have learned a lot each \ntime I have gone. I certainly learned a lot this weekend. One of the \nthings that gives me special joy is that it helped me identify and \nreinforce items such as the tethered dirigible--the kind of technology \nwe can hang on to and deploy across the border in all kinds of \nlocations. How important that technology is.\n  The other item that came home to me was that we spend a huge amount \nof money on these measures--one-quarter of a trillion dollars in the \nlast 10 years on securing our borders. We spent less than 1 percent of \nthat trying to help--along with Mexico, Colombia, and the Inter-\nAmerican Development Bank--the countries of El Salvador, Honduras, and \nGuatemala to become less places of desolation and fear. We want to help \nthem. It is not for us to do this by ourselves. It is not our job. What \ndo they say at Home Depot? You can do it; we can help. In this case it \nwould be like Colombia. In Colombia, 20-some years ago, what happened \nwas a bunch of gunmen rounded up their supreme court justices, took \nthem into a room and shot them to death--11 justices of their supreme \ncourt. Colombia was oppressed on the one hand by leftist guerillas and \non the other hand by narco drug lords. A lot of people said they were \ngoing down. But they made it, in part with our help and Plan Colombia.\n  The folks who--the presidents of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador \nhave come up, with our encouragement, with their own Plan Colombia to \nfocus on, among other things, restoring the rule of law, going after \ncorruption, making sure police police, prosecutors prosecute, judges \nadminister justice, and correctional systems prisons actually correct \nbehavior.\n  They are looking at the schools. Kids are finishing up after grade 6 \nand, frankly, without the skills they need to do much of anything. So \nthey are looking to make sure those schools are producing students \nbetter equipped and prepared to be gainfully employed.\n  Also, as I said, half of the secondary roads in Honduras were wiped \nout after Hurricane Mitch. Half of them were wiped out, and there is a \nneed for them, with maybe some help from a bunch of us--Mexico, \nColombia, NGOs, and nonprofits--to work on that.\n  The other thing is the energy piece. If they are going to have jobs \ndown there, they need to have affordable energy, and it is not going to \nbe from the continued use of electricity through the use of petroleum \nbut through low-priced natural gas and by strengthening their grid--\nreally, to build and rebuild their electric grid.\n  So those are some of my take-aways. I wanted to share some of those \nwith my colleagues.\n  I hope we don't shut down the Department of Homeland Security. They \ndo important work for us, and we need them to be on the job. Frankly, \nwe don't need a continuing resolution because that just hampers their \nability to move assets around to meet one challenge that is greater \nthan another. Hopefully, we will not have the kind of flood events we \nhad last summer. Hopefully, we won't.\n  We are doing some smart messaging campaigns down in those three \nCentral American countries, and with the cooperation of the \ngovernments, we are saying: Look, this is really what you are going to \nfind when you try to come through Mexico and this Texas border. This is \nwhat the real truth is, and this is what you are going to run into when \nyou get into the United States. It is the kind of truth campaign we are \ndelivering with the help of those governments to try to reduce the \nattraction for coming.\n  But I came away more hopeful than maybe I was when I went down. There \nis reason for hope, but there is plenty to do--plenty to do.\n  If we can somehow put our political differences aside, I hope we will \ncontinue to fund the Department of Homeland Security so they can do \ntheir jobs. There are a lot of good people working for us around the \nworld, and we don't need to hamper them further.\n  Finally, let's work on immigration. Let's roll up our sleeves and do \nthis year a better job than what we tried to do 2 years ago--a better \njob. The American people sent us here to do that.\n  With that, I conclude my remarks. I thank you for your patience and \nattention.\n  I saw one of my colleagues walk on the floor. He is a Senator from \nanother small but mighty State, the State of Rhode Island, and I am \nhappy to yield for Senator Whitehouse to make whatever remarks he \nwishes to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/10/senate-section/article/S896-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S896-S898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I might point out that not only are \nDelaware and Rhode Island both small and mighty, but they are small, \nmighty, and coastal, which is relative to the topic of my remarks this \nafternoon. I am now here for the 89th consecutive week that Congress \nhas been in session to urge the Senate to wake up to the risks of \nclimate change and to address the carbon pollution that is causing \nclimate change.\n  We have a particular context for this conversation this week. The \nFounding Fathers in article I, section 8 of the Constitution granted to \nCongress a sacred duty, as the Constitution says, to\n\n[[Page S897]]\n\n``provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United \nStates.''\n  To that end, we have built the world's greatest military and the most \nsophisticated intelligence and national security services. After the \nattacks of September 11, 2001, we undertook the largest reorganization \nof the Federal Government in half a century to stand up the Department \nof Homeland Security. We trust these national security agencies and the \ndedicated professionals who lead them and serve in them to ascertain \nand prepare for the risks facing our country in an uncertain world. But \nthe tea party wing of the Republican caucus has chosen to hold up \nappropriations for vital Homeland Security programs--programs that \nprotect Americans from terrorism, programs that help our States prepare \nfor disasters--all to have a quarrel with the President on immigration.\n  Well, when we get to immigration--if our friends on the House side \never get to immigration--we could certainly debate the merits of the \nPresident's action. Certainly, we should pass legislation to fix our \nbroken immigration system so the President's Executive actions are no \nlonger necessary. And, by the way, in the Senate we did our job and \npassed a strong bipartisan bill. But to deny the Department of Homeland \nSecurity the resources it needs to safeguard the Nation is foolhardy.\n  Now, it is precisely because of that duty to safeguard the Nation \nthat we should take our homeland security and military professionals \nseriously when they take seriously the threats posed by climate change. \nI think we should have a vote on a resolution highlighting the fact \nfindings of our national security, military, and intelligence services \nabout the climate threat. This resolution would express the sense of \nthe Senate that the conclusions of our security professionals are not \nproducts of some hoax or deception perpetrated on the American public \nand that they deserve our respect.\n  That ought to be something every Senator can get behind. Let's look \nat some of the information. Just last week the administration's 2015 \nNational Security Strategy classified climate change as ``an urgent and \ngrowing threat to our national security.'' It is because this is \nserious that the United States is out there actively cutting pollution \nand strengthening resilience at home and leading the international \ncommunity towards stronger carbon pollution standards.\n  The challenge that climate change poses to national security and to \nemergency preparedness is clearly laid out in the Department of \nHomeland Security's 2014 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review. It \ndescribes the effects of climate change as threat multipliers, with the \npotential to aggravate hazards to American safety and health. For \nexample, higher temperatures may change patterns of disease and the \nspread of pests and pathogens.\n  Competition for resources can contribute to the kind of social \ndestabilization that engenders terrorist activity all around the world.\n  You don't have to look far to see that today. Extreme weather and \ntemperatures endanger the infrastructure that underpins our economy and \nway of life--from roads and bridges that now run too close to rising \nseas, to power and water treatment plants, to telecommunications and \ncyber networks.\n  As Assistant Secretary David Heyman of the DHS Office of Policy and \nAssistant Secretary Caitlin Durkovich of the Office of Infrastructure \nProtection explained to our own Senate Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs just last year:\n\n       The projected impacts of climate change, including sea \n     level rise and increasing severity and frequency of extreme \n     weather events, can cause damage or disruptions that result \n     in cascading effects across our communities, with \n     immeasurable costs in lives lost and billions of dollars in \n     property damage.\n\n  Why would we not want to take that seriously?\n  We heard just the same message in the Budget Committee just last week \nfrom OMB Director Shaun Donovan.\n  Already, the annual number of costly weather-related disasters is \ngoing up. According to NOAA, in the 1980s--in that decade--if you look \nat the number of natural disasters costing $1 billion or more, in each \nyear of the 1980s there were between zero and five. That was the range \nfor the 1980s--between zero and five $1 billion weather events. In the \n1990s that rate rose to between three and nine events each year. Then \nin 2000 it went up to between 2 and 11 events per year. Since 2010, in \nthe category of $1 billion disasters each year, the range has been \nbetween 6 and 16.\n  So from the 1980s, it was 0 to 5, until this decade when it is 6 to \n16. If people can't take that seriously, they are simply not meeting \ntheir responsibilities.\n  Superstorm Sandy caused tens of billions of dollars in damage, \nincluding terrible losses in my home State of Rhode Island. Across New \nEngland, Sandy destroyed thousands of homes, left millions without \nelectric service, and caused more than 100 deaths across nine States. \nOf course, we cannot say this one devastating storm was specifically \ncaused by climate change, but we do know that carbon pollution loads \nthe dice for more and more severe extreme weather such as Sandy.\n  Sandy sure showed how vulnerable we are to this kind of catastrophic \nchange. Climate change presents security challenges in every corner of \nthe homeland. To the south, DHS predicts that more severe droughts and \nstorms could increase both legal and illegal movements across the U.S. \nborder--from Mexico, from Central America, and from the Caribbean.\n  My Republican colleagues insist that protecting our border is a top \npriority--fine. I hope that means they will take seriously the warnings \nfrom our national security professionals about the destabilizing \neffects of climate change and its effects, in turn, on our border.\n  If you move up north to the State of Maine, our former colleague, \nOlympia Snowe, has just written an article in Newsweek magazine. I will \nread the opening:\n  In late 2014, fishery regulators announced that for the second \nconsecutive year there would be no shrimp fishery in the gulf of Maine \nthis winter. The culprit: principally warming ocean waters caused by \nclimate change.\n  She goes on to describe another phenomenon that scientists dubbed an \nocean heat wave in the spring of 2012 that led to an early molt and \nmigration of lobsters that caused a supply glut and subsequent price \ncollapse. Now if you know anything about Maine, you know lobsters are \npretty important to Maine. Senator Snowe's conclusion: ``The message \nhere is clear: climate change is taking dollars and jobs away from \nfishing communities.''\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that her article be printed at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  To the far north, melting sea ice opens the Arctic for shipping, \ntourism, and resource extraction, but also for smuggling and illicit \nresource extraction and environmental disasters. It is a whole new \nfrontier to be patrolled and protected by our Coast Guard, part of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, at taxpayer expense.\n  Former Coast Guard Commandant ADM Robert Papp, Jr., is now the U.S. \nSpecial Representative to the Arctic Region. He has got the job to help \nmanage risk in this remote but increasingly accessible region in the \nworld, and he had this to say about managing the consequences of \nclimate change. Admiral Papp said:\n\n       I am not a scientist. I can read what scientists say, but I \n     am in the world of consequence management. My first turn in \n     Alaska was 39 years ago, and during the summertime we had to \n     break ice to get up to the Bering Strait and to get to \n     Kotzebue. Thirty-five years later, going up there as \n     commandant, we flew into Kotzebue at the same time of year. I \n     could not see ice anywhere. So it is clear to me that there \n     are changes happening, but I have to deal with the \n     consequences of that.\n\n  The men and women of our homeland and national security forces deal \nin real-world consequences. They don't have the luxury of skirting the \nevidence or shrugging off serious adult risk analysis.\n  It is just as true at the Department of Defense as it is at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. As ADM Samuel J. Locklear, III, the \nNavy Commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, puts it, it is ``. . . not \nmy venue to debate the politics of any issue. All I do is report what I \nsee and what I think I see, and the implications.''\n  Admiral Locklear, our chief naval officer in the Pacific Command, has \ncalled climate change the biggest long-term security threat in the \nPacific, because as he sees it, ``it is probably the\n\n[[Page S898]]\n\nmost likely thing that is going to happen that will cripple the \nsecurity environment.''\n  Our colleagues may think it is funny to ignore climate change in this \nbody while they depend so heavily on funding from the fossil fuel that \nis behind the pollution. They should listen to admirals who are \nresponsible for our security when they tell us it is probably the most \nlikely thing that is going to happen to cripple the security \nenvironment.\n  Last May, the CNA Corporation released a report on the risks climate \nchange poses to our national security. This report was led by 15 \ngenerals and admirals from all 4 branches of the United States \nmilitary. Here is what they said:\n\n       The national security risks of projected climate change are \n     as serious as any challenges we have faced.\n\n  That is what they wrote. They continued:\n\n       We are dismayed that discussions of climate change have \n     become so polarizing and have receded from the arena of \n     informed public disclosure and debate. . . . Time and tide \n     wait for no man.\n\n  Our military intelligence and homeland security services have been \nwarning Congress for far too long about the risks of climate change. It \nis a dereliction of duty for this body to continue to ignore this \nproblem. It is time to heed the warning. It is time to responsibly \nprepare for the clear risk before us, and it is time to wake up.\n  I yield the floor. I see the majority leader is present on the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Newsweek, Feb. 9, 2015]\n\n        Lack of Action on Climate Change Is Costing Fishing Jobs\n\n                       (By Senator Olympia Snowe)\n\n       In late 2014, fishery regulators announced that for the \n     second consecutive year, there would be no shrimp fishery in \n     the Gulf of Maine this winter. The culprit? Principally, \n     warming ocean waters caused by global climate change.\n       Maine in particular is feeling this climate pinch: The \n     water temperature in the Gulf of Maine increased eight times \n     faster than the rest of the world's oceans in recent years, \n     according to a 2014 study by Andrew Pershing, chief \n     scientific officer at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute.\n       As a result, while the shrimp fishery is the first to close \n     in New England primarily as a result of our changing climate, \n     it is unlikely to be the last. Some of the Gulf of Maine's \n     depleted stocks of groundfish, particularly Gulf of Maine \n     cod, have been slow to rebuild from overfishing in the 1980s \n     and 1990s in part as a result of warming water. Lobster has \n     been disappearing from its traditional habitat in southern \n     New England.\n       Meanwhile, the iconic lobster industry in Maine has \n     experienced record landings in recent years, but more and \n     more of the catch is coming from areas further down the coast \n     toward Canada. And a phenomenon that scientists dubbed an \n     ``ocean heat wave'' in the spring of 2012 led to an early \n     molt and migration of lobsters that caused a supply glut and \n     subsequent price collapse.\n       The message here is clear: climate change is taking dollars \n     and jobs away from New England's fishing communities.\n       Scientists, fishery managers and industry members recognize \n     the necessity of better understanding this phenomenon, and \n     numerous research projects are already underway. For example, \n     the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and \n     Rutgers University have partnered to analyze data from \n     oceanographic and fisheries-dependent studies. Their project, \n     OceanAdapt, has confirmed that fish species off the northeast \n     United States are collectively moving to higher latitudes and \n     deeper water in search of the cooler temperatures they \n     require to survive.\n       Of course, fishermen are the ones who know their ocean the \n     best. So in order to get their perspective on what they are \n     experiencing on the water, the Center for American Progress \n     (CAP) commissioned a poll of participants in the \n     groundfishery as well as the lobster fisheries in Maine and \n     Massachusetts.\n       The CAP poll shows that majorities of all these fishermen \n     and women believe climate change poses a significant risk to \n     their industry, as warming waters lead to lower profits and \n     lower catch limits. Respondents are deeply concerned these \n     impacts could force them from the fishery or result in the \n     disappearance of traditional markets for their product.\n       This perspective is consistent with the findings of the \n     ``Risky Business'' report released last June by a bipartisan \n     committee co-chaired by Michael Bloomberg, Hank Paulson and \n     Tom Steyer. I was involved as a member of this project's \n     ``Risk Committee,'' which found that the American economy \n     faces significant and diverse economic threats from the \n     effects of climate change--rising seas, increased damage from \n     storm surge, and more frequent bouts of extreme heat--all of \n     which will have measurable impacts on our nation.\n       Each geographic region analyzed by the project faces \n     distinct and significant economic risks. Here in the \n     northeast, projections are already showing that temperature \n     increases in Gulf of Maine waters will restrict habitat for \n     commercially vital species such as cod and lobster. In \n     addition, sea levels are likely to rise by two to four feet \n     in Boston by the end of the century threatening to swamp \n     coastal infrastructure, including the wharves and fish houses \n     critical to sustaining our fishing industry.\n       These numbers fail to reflect the potential for dramatic \n     ``storm surge'' events, in which higher sea levels combine \n     with more intense weather activity to increase flooding and \n     storm damage. The Risky Business research finds that these \n     kinds of impacts, combined, could increase annual property \n     losses along the northeast coast from $11 billion to $22 \n     billion--a two- to four-fold increase from current levels.\n       As vigorous policy debates continue in Washington, the \n     economic impact of addressing climate change and \n     transitioning to a lower carbon economy is understandably a \n     key issue--and one that is not the domain of one side versus \n     the other. Here in New England's fishing communities, there \n     is serious and legitimate concern for the fishing jobs that \n     will be lost if we don't act to rein in the emissions warming \n     and acidifying our waters and causing sea levels to rise.\n       The loss of Maine's $5 million shrimp fishery should serve \n     as a warning. A similar blow to our $300 million lobster \n     fishery must be avoided at all costs. That will require \n     honest, fact-based discussion and a genuine bipartisan \n     commitment to solutions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/10/senate-section/article/S898-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S898-S899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. ROBERT LASKOWSKI\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nspeak on behalf of the Delaware Delegation to honor the exemplary \nservice of the president and CEO of Christiana Health Care System, Dr. \nRobert ``Bob'' Laskowski. He served in this position since 2003, and \nduring that time he transformed the largest not-for-profit health care \nsystem in Delaware into an award-winning hospital organization with a \nnational reputation of patient quality and innovation. Bob is now \nretiring after more than two decades of serving Christiana Care. He is \na tremendous leader and true advocate for the patient and health-care \nworker, as well as a devoted husband to his wife, Kathy, and loving \nfather to their children and grandchildren. His hard work, leadership \nand willingness to work together on transforming the health care system \nin Delaware and the Nation will truly be missed.\n  Bob used his leadership role at Christiana to cultivate philanthropic \nendeavors in the community. He lives ``The Christiana Care Way'' of \nserving our neighbors as respectful, expert, caring partners in their \nhealth. Under his leadership, Christiana Care has given back millions \nof dollars to the Delaware community.\n  Bob is a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania School of \nMedicine with a master's degree in business administration from the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business. He is a board-\ncertified internist specializing in geriatric medicine who understands \nthe needs and priorities of health care professionals, as well as the \nbusiness of running a health care system.\n  Bob's reach extends far beyond Delaware's borders. He is nationally \nrecognized for his work on health care transformation. He fearlessly \ntook on the challenge of making Christiana Care Health System a model \nfor other hospital systems around the country. Bob's notable \naccomplishments include expanding the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & \nResearch Institute to a 200,000-square-foot state-of-the-art facility \nthat serves the majority of cancer patients in Delaware. This National \nCancer Institute selected Community Cancer Center is a national model \nfor care and a leader in enrolling patients in clinical trials. He also \nled Christiana Care in earning recognition by the American College of \nSurgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program as 1 of only 37 \nhospitals in the Nation achieving ``meritorious'' outcomes for surgical \npatient care in 9 clinical areas. His expertise is sought out \nthroughout the country as he serves on the board of directors of the \nAssociation of American Medical Colleges and on its finance and \nexecutive compensation committees. He serves\n\n[[Page S899]]\n\non the American Medical Association Section on Medical Schools, and is \na former member of the American Hospital Association Section for Health \nCare Systems Governing Council and the Health Management Academy Chief \nExecutive Officers Forum.\n  Apart from his work in the health care field, Bob is an excellent \ncook, honing his skills in his own kitchen and cooking for colleagues \nand guests. He also spends his time playing piano, violin, the \naccordion, and is currently learning Spanish.\n  On behalf of Senator Chris Coons and Congressman John Carney, I \nwholeheartedly thank Dr. Bob Laskowski for his service to Christiana \nCare and our State. His model leadership and dedication has improved \nthe quality of life for not only Delawareans, but patients and health \ncare workers around the Nation. We offer our sincere congratulations on \na job well done and wish him many happy, healthy, and successful years \nto come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/10/senate-section/article/S899-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          enrolled bill signed\n\n  At 6:02 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 203.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor an exclusion for assistance provided to participants in certain \nveterinary student loan repayment or forgiveness; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Veterinary \nMedicine Loan Repayment Program Enhancement Act that I am introducing \ntoday with Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan. This bipartisan \nlegislation would address the shortage of veterinarians in many areas \nof this Nation by helping to increase the placement of more \nveterinarians in areas of the country where they are desperately \nneeded.\n  Veterinarians are a critical part of ensuring our access to a safe \nand high-quality food supply. Americans depend on veterinarians to help \nensure food safety and public health, improve animal health and \nwelfare, promote sustainable economic development and safeguard our \nhomeland from foreign animal disease. Unfortunately, nearly every state \nhas a rural community that is suffering from a shortage in essential \nveterinary services.\n  To help address this concern, in 2003, Congress established the \nVeterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program, VMLRP. This program assists \nselected food animal and public health veterinarians with student loan \nrepayment for a three-year commitment to practice in areas of the \ncountry facing a veterinarian shortage. This program helps \nveterinarians with daunting student loan debt with making a living in a \ncommunity where starting a practice may be otherwise financially \nimpossible. Through the program, more than 280 veterinarians have been \nplaced in communities throughout the country--a benefit for food \nsafety, the communities, farmers and ranchers, the veterinarians and \nmore.\n  The problem is the VMLRP is subject to a significant Federal \nwithholding tax on the assistance provided to qualifying veterinarians. \nThis affects the amount of limited resources that can go toward this \nworthy effort and the reach of its benefits. The legislation we are \nintroducing will address this by providing an exemption from the \nFederal income withholding tax for payments received under the VMLRP \nand similar State programs. Thus, more veterinarians would have the \nopportunity to practice in small, rural communities where their \nservices are so desperately needed and more communities will have much-\nneeded veterinarian services.\n  To illustrate the need for the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment \nProgram Enhancement Act, consider the following example. In October \n2014, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food \nand Agriculture announced more than $4.5 million was awarded to 51 \nveterinarians through the VMLRP. The awards announced in October will \nfill shortage needs in 22 States. However, estimates show that if this \nwithholding tax were to be eliminated, an additional veterinarian could \nbe placed in a shortage area for every three currently participating in \nthe program. That means approximately 17 additional awards could have \nbeen issued last year had this tax been eliminated.\n  This legislation would also help bring the tax treatment of this \nprogram in line with the tax treatment of assistance for doctors and \nnurses who are serving areas of the country in need through the \nNational Health Service Corps' loan repayment program. In 2004, \nCongress exempted the benefits available under the National Health \nService Corps' loan repayment program from the federal withholding tax. \nEnactment of the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Enhancement Act \nwould create tax parity for the counterpart program for veterinary \nmedicine.\n  So far, 15 Senators--including Senators Thad Cochran, Johnny Isakson, \nJim Risch, Pat Roberts, Michael Bennet, Kirsten Gillibrand, Amy \nKlobuchar, Al Franken, Mazie Hirono, Angus King, Jr., Pat Leahy, Bernie \nSanders, and Tammy Baldwin--from both sides of the aisle have \ncosponsored this important legislation and 152 national and local \norganizations support the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program \nEnhancement Act. Congress can help ensure that every community across \nAmerica has access to needed veterinary care. Please join us in this \neffort to place more veterinarians in areas of the country where they \nare desperately needed and support passage of this bipartisan, \ncommonsense legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStatement of Support for the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program \n                            Enhancement Act\n\n       The undersigned organizations urge Congress to pass the \n     Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program (VMLRP) \n     Enhancement Act to address the challenges rural areas face in \n     accessing veterinary services for livestock medicine and \n     public health and to maximize funding congress appropriates \n     for VMLRP so that it can be stretched further to fill \n     shortage areas across the country.\n       By exempting the loan repayment awards from a 39 percent \n     withholding tax, Congress will make it possible for one \n     additional veterinarian to be selected to participate for \n     every three currently working in federally designated areas. \n     Since 2010, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has selected \n     286 veterinarians to practice in nearly every state across \n     the country. If the VMLRP program awards were exempt from \n     withholding taxes, then roughly 100 additional veterinarians \n     could have served rural communities during that same time \n     period.\n       It is time for every American community to gain access to \n     needed veterinary services. Congress can ensure that our \n     nation's livestock are healthy, our food supply is safe and \n     secure, and public health is protected by passing the \n     Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program Enhancement Act \n     this session.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Veterinary Medical Association, Association of \n     American Veterinary Medical Colleges, Academy of Rural \n

Res. 72\n\n       Whereas Russian-backed rebels continue to expand their \n     campaign in Ukraine, which has already claimed more than \n     5,000 lives and generated an estimated 1,500,000 refugees and \n     internally displaced persons;\n       Whereas, on January 23, 2015, Russian-backed rebels pulled \n     out of peace talks with Western leaders;\n       Whereas, on January 24, 2015, the Ukrainian port city of \n     Mariupol received rocket fire from territory in the Donetsk \n     region controlled by rebels;\n       Whereas, on January 24, 2015, Alexander Zakharchenko, \n     leader of the Russian-backed rebel Donetsk People's Republic, \n     publicly announced that his troops had launched an offensive \n     against Mariupol;\n       Whereas Mariupol is strategically located on the Sea of \n     Azov and is a sea link between Russian-occupied Crimea and \n     Russia, and could be used to form part of a land bridge \n     between Crimea and Russia;\n       Whereas the indiscriminate attack on Mariupol killed 30 \n     people, including 2 children, and wounded 102 in markets, \n     homes, and schools;\n       Whereas, on April 19, 2000, the United Nations Security \n     Council adopted Resolution 1296, reaffirming its strong \n     condemnation of the deliberate targeting of civilians;\n       Whereas, even after the Russian Federation and the Russian-\n     backed rebels signed a ceasefire agreement called the Minsk \n     Protocol in September 2014, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, \n     General Philip Breedlove, reported in November 2014 the \n     movement of ``Russian troops, Russian artillery, Russian air \n     defense systems, and Russian combat troops'' into Ukraine;\n       Whereas, on January 24, 2015, NATO Secretary General Jens \n     Stoltenberg stated, ``For several months we have seen the \n     presence of Russian forces in eastern Ukraine, as well as a \n     substantial increase in Russian heavy equipment such as \n     tanks, artillery, and advanced air defense systems. Russian \n     troops in eastern Ukraine are supporting these offensive \n     operations with command and control systems, air defense \n     systems with advanced surface-to-air missiles, unmanned \n     aerial systems, advanced multiple rocket launcher systems, \n     and electronic warfare systems.'';\n       Whereas, on January 25, 2015, after Russian-backed rebels \n     attacked Mariupol, European Council President Donald Tusk \n     wrote, ``Once again appeasement encourages the aggressor to \n     greater acts of violence; time to step up our policy based on \n     cold facts, not illusions.'';\n       Whereas, on November 19, 2014, at a Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate confirmation hearing, Deputy National \n     Security Adviser Anthony Blinken stated that the provision of \n     defensive lethal assistance to the Government of Ukraine \n     ``remains on the table. It's something we're looking at.'';\n       Whereas the Ukraine Freedom Support Act (Public Law 113-\n     272), which was passed by Congress unanimously and signed \n     into law by the President on December 18, 2014, states that \n     it is the policy of the United States to further assist the \n     Government of Ukraine in restoring its sovereignty and its \n     territorial integrity to deter the Government of the Russian \n     Federation from further destabilizing and invading Ukraine \n     and other independent countries in Central and Eastern \n     Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia; and\n       Whereas the Ukraine Freedom Support Act authorizes \n     $350,000,000 in fiscal years 2015-\n\n[[Page S904]]\n\n     2017 for the President to provide the Government of Ukraine \n     with defense articles, defense services, and military \n     training for the purpose of countering offensive weapons and \n     reestablishing the sovereignty and territorial integrity of \n     Ukraine, including anti-tank and anti-armor weapons; crew \n     weapons and ammunition; counter-artillery radars; fire \n     control and guidance equipment; surveillance drones; and \n     secure command and communications equipment: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I want to comment on an interview that was \npublished yesterday, quoting the President. In an interview published \nyesterday, the President spoke about a number of issues facing the \nUnited States. During that interview he had commentary on terrorism and \nhe referenced the January attacks in Paris, France, in what I would \ndescribe as a very concerning way. The President addressed the attacks \nin Paris as ``randomly shooting a bunch of folks in a deli.''\n  The President's stated perception of the hostage taking and murder of \nfour Jews in a kosher supermarket in that way--we ought to all be \nconcerned. When asked to clarify the President's comments today, the \nWhite House stated that the Jewish victims of this attack were ``killed \nnot because of who they were, but because of where they randomly \nhappened to be.''\n  The White House today suggested that because there were non-Jews in \nthe kosher supermarket named Super Kosher, the attack did not \nspecifically target Jews.\n  The State Department restated this explanation today, refusing to say \nthat an attack on a kosher supermarket that killed four Jews could be \nJewish. The absurdity of this logic is apparent. Let me give you a \nhypothetical. If an attack occurs in a synagogue or in a church or in \nthe American Embassy, are we really to accept the idea that on the \nchance that there were diverse people there, that that somehow \ndisqualifies the possibility that members of the group who would \npredominantly frequent that place might be targeted? In other words, if \nsomebody who happened to work in an American embassy but is not an \nAmerican is killed in an attack, would we reach the conclusion that the \nattack on the embassy is not an attack on America?\n  The Obama administration's logic doesn't make sense and it is \ndifficult to understand what they are trying to convey. It is also \ncontrary to the open source media reports about the attack. Reuters \nreported that the perpetrator of the attack called a French television \nstation to declare his allegiance to the Islamic State and stated his \nintentions to target Jews. Given this information, the Obama \nadministration's now repeated comments that chalked this up to \nrandomness--that is just amazing to me, that it is just random, this \nattack\n\n[[Page S905]]\n\nin Paris. The fact that four Jews were killed at a kosher supermarket, \nit is just random.\n  It is dangerous for our government leaders to reach such a conclusion \nand for us to be operating as we make a determination of how to proceed \nnext in the war on terror to reach the kind of conclusions the \nPresident, his spokespersons, and the State Department are reaching.\n  The Islamic State, the organization the perpetrators of the Paris \nattack claim allegiance to, has made a point to persecute various \nethnic and religious minorities. The denial of anti-minority or anti-\nSemitic motivations in this case gives me hesitation about whether the \nPresident understands the true nature of the threat we now face. This \ncomes in the context of a report that the administration is soon to \npresent to Congress for approval an authorization for the use of \nmilitary force against Islamic State fighters.\n  Authorizing a war is a decision that should be made with the fullest \nof information and the most complete understanding possible. The Obama \nadministration should be doing everything it can to clearly describe \nthe threat our country faces--in fact, that people around the globe \nface--and a strategy that will be employed under this potential \nauthorization to use force. If we don't know who we are fighting, how \ncan we have a strategy to prevent the death and destruction those \nenemies will cause? The stakes are way too high to operate under \nanything but a clear understanding of the significant challenges our \ncountry faces. It makes no sense to describe something different than \nreality.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/10/senate-section/article/S905-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S905-S906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL CHILDREN'S DENTAL HEALTH MONTH\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize February as \nNational Children's Dental Health Month. Every year since 1981 we have \nacknowledged the importance of children's dental health and worked to \nensure that all children have access to proper oral health. As former \nU.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop reminded us, ``There is no health \nwithout oral health.''\n  Today tooth decay is the single most common chronic childhood \ndisease--5 times more common than asthma, 4 times more common than \nearly childhood obesity, and 20 times more common than diabetes. \nDespite the fact that tooth decay can be prevented, nearly half of all \n5-year-olds have experienced tooth decay.\n  Left untreated, tooth decay can not only destroy a child's teeth and \nhealth but also have a severe negative impact on a child's quality of \nlife. Because children with severe tooth decay are frequently in \nconstant pain, they are often unable to learn, play, or interact with \nothers. Recent studies have shown that children with poor oral health \nare nearly three times more likely to miss school due to dental pain, \nand children reporting recent toothaches are four times more likely to \nhave lower grade point averages than peers without dental pain.\n  Good oral health is essential for our children to thrive. It is \nsimply unacceptable that 16.5 million children are denied basic dental \ncare each year. The health and well-being of every child depends on \naccess to affordable care for all of his or her health needs, including \ndental services.\n  Tooth decay and oral health problems also disproportionately affect \nchildren from low-income families and minorities. According to the \nNational Institutes of Health, about 80 percent of dental disease in \nchildren is concentrated in 25 percent of the population, and children \nfrom poor families face an inordinately high barrier in receiving \ndental care. To these children, the consequences of poor health care \ncan be devastating.\n  Many have heard me speak before, including on the floor of the \nSenate, about the tragic loss of Deamonte Driver, a 12-year-old Prince \nGeorge's County resident who died in February of 2007. Deamonte's death \nwas particularly traumatic because it was entirely preventable. It is \noutrageous that only a few years ago a young boy died in our country \nbecause his family was unable to find a dentist to remove an infected \ntooth. By the time he was evaluated at the Children's Hospital \nemergency room, the infection had spread to Deamonte's brain. After \nmultiple surgeries and a lengthy hospital stay, he passed away.\n  This was a tragic loss of life that was completely preventable, and a \nwaste of terrible resources. A person's life, hundreds of thousands of \ndollars, and all it took was $80 in dental care to save his life.\n  I recently heard another story that gives me both hope in the future \nand strength and resolve to guarantee that all Americans have access to \nproper dental care. Ronald shared his story at the 2-day Mission of \nMercy Health Equity Festival at the University of Maryland, where he \nwaited 15 hours at the charity clinic to have a tooth pulled that had \nbeen troubling him for 2 years. Prior to the charity clinic, Ronald had \nbeen living with two choices: endure increasingly worse pain or go into \ndebt to pay for dental care. A working man, Ronald had spent $800--his \nentire life savings--to get a tooth fixed in 2012, but it continued to \nbother him. He recently paid a dentist for relief. The dentist \nsuggested a more expensive procedure, but Ronald was unable to pay the \nhigh cost. So it was just a bandaid, he said. Now he is behind with his \nlandlord and trying to catch up.\n\n  Ronald talked, however, with great pride about his 9-year-old soccer-\nplaying daughter, who waves away candy and drinks water instead of \nsoda. ``I didn't know about oral health when I was her age,'' he said. \nLike many other children in Maryland, Ronald's daughter has access to \ndental care through our State's Children's Health Insurance Program. \nShe has coverage for pediatric dental, she learns about oral health in \nher school, and she is taking steps to make sure she has proper oral \nhealth. She has coverage if she needs to see a dentist.\n  Thanks to CHIP, we now have the highest number in history of children \nwho are insured with medical and dental insurance. CHIP provides \naffordable, comprehensive health coverage to more than 8 million \nchildren from working families--people who earn too much to qualify for \nMedicaid but cannot afford private insurance. CHIP also provides \nfunding for school-based health centers that are critical to providing \ndental services to at-risk children. I have visited these schools and \nhave seen firsthand how effective they are in delivering dental care to \nour children. However, if Congress does not act to reauthorize funding \nfor CHIP before September 30, the program's funding will run out and \nmillions of children will again be at risk.\n  I am very proud that my State of Maryland has been recognized as a \nnational leader in pediatric dental health. In the 2010 Pew Center \nreport on the state of children's dental health, Maryland earned an A \nand was the only State to meet seven of the eight policy benchmarks for \naddressing children's dental health needs.\n  In addition, in the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, every plan \nexcept one includes pediatric dental coverage as part of the \ncomprehensive medical plan, so families don't have to pay a separate \npremium for pediatric dental coverage and they don't have an additional \nout-of-pocket cost.\n  In the Affordable Care Act, we included pediatric dental as part of \nthe essential benefits; therefore, every family now has access to \naffordable pediatric coverage. That is primarily offered to most of the \npeople in our State through a universal policy, meaning that they don't \nhave to pay a separate premium or copayment.\n  Dental diseases are chronic, progressive, and destructive over time. \nYet too often oral health care is overlooked or ignored. We have made \ngreat progress, but there are still millions of children in our country \nwithout dental care. We must continue to work to ensure that all \nAmericans have access to both medical and dental care, as no citizen of \nour country should ever have to choose between going into debt and \nreceiving proper health care.\n  The health care system was not there for Ronald, but thanks to CHIP \nand the Affordable Care Act, it has the potential to help his daughter \nstay healthy for years to come.\n  Let's pledge to do more for our children, starting with a \nreauthorization of\n\n[[Page S906]]\n\nthe Children's Health Insurance Program--CHIP--including the guaranteed \npediatric dental benefits.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are in a countdown of sorts right \nnow, and it is one I am deeply concerned about. On February 27, the \nfunding for the Department of Homeland Security of our country runs \nout, and that is 17 days from now. Only 17 days from now, our Border \nand Customs and air traffic controllers, air security, Coast Guard--all \nof those agencies and all of the people involved in protecting us from \nthe terrorist threats all around us--will lose their funding in one way \nor the other if we don't act.\n  On Sunday morning in Michigan, we had a reminder of the threat that \nexists within our borders. A man crashed his truck into a U.S. Coast \nGuard station in Grand Haven on the west side of Michigan. Then he \nassaulted members of the Coast Guard, which is, by the way, a \nDepartment of Homeland Security facility and will be affected by what \nis going to happen. The man claimed to have explosives in his truck. \nFortunately, that turned out not to be true. Still, local officials \ninitially called it ``an act of domestic terrorism.''\n  Department of Homeland Security officials have been working alongside \nother Federal agencies and local law enforcement to investigate. My \ncolleagues can imagine how people on the west side of Michigan are \nfeeling right now and how members of the Coast Guard are feeling about \nthis.\n  This is the work the men and women of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity do every day in every part of Michigan, in every part of our \ncountry, in every part of our cities, including the District of \nColumbia, and in the communities we all represent. Frankly, people are \nscratching their heads right now about what in the world is going on.\n  I appreciate the fact there are disagreements with the President \nregarding immigration policy. Certainly, we can debate that. We can \ndiscuss it. The Republican leader can bring up the issue of immigration \nat any time on the floor of the Senate. But that should not be tied to \nwhether we fund the Department of Homeland Security for our country. \nHomeland security funding should not be held hostage to what I view as \nthe politics of the moment on immigration. We may have a disagreement \nin terms of immigration issues, but we should not have any disagreement \nabout the need to fully fund the Department of Homeland Security.\n  We rely on the Department of Homeland Security to provide our \ntransportation security at shipping ports and at all of our airports. \nWe all go back and forth every single week. Millions of Americans are \ncounting on the fact that people at our airports--people we see and \npeople we don't see--are keeping us safe from attacks--the passengers, \nthe cargo.\n  Michigan is a border State. We are the largest northern border \ncrossing in the country for goods, services, and people coming back and \nforth from Detroit to Windsor. It is the men and women of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security--Border and Customs--who are keeping \nour borders safe every day.\n  We rely on the Department of Homeland Security to protect us against \nnuclear attacks, chemical attacks, and cyber attacks every day. In \nrecent years, major American financial institutions have been attacked \nby hackers. I have been in a situation as a customer of a major company \ngetting that notice in the mail about my credit card. Millions of \nAmericans have been in that situation. We expect that we are going to \nmake sure we are protecting people's information, their financial \nsecurity, the financial security of businesses. That is what is done \nthrough the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Seventeen days from now, if we don't act to fully fund the Department \nof Homeland Security, we will see the funding for that Department stop.\n  Chinese hackers targeted the U.S. Transportation Department Command, \nwhich directs the global movement of U.S. military forces. Hackers have \ngone after America's transportation and communications infrastructure \nover and over again.\n  This is very serious. This is very serious. This is not about \npolitics or differences of opinion with the United States or having \nsome leverage by holding funding up in order to get something else that \ngroup of people wants to get. This is about whether we are going to \nstraight-up fund the security operations of our country. We have \nterrorists and terror threats all around us. Look at the globe--all \naround us. This is not the time to play politics with Homeland Security \nfunding.\n  Last year we passed, with a huge majority, a bipartisan immigration \nbill. Immigration deserves a debate. There will be differences of \nopinion. I still think there is a broad bipartisan coalition to do \ncomprehensive reform that makes sense for everyone, makes sense for \nAmerica. But this is not the time to say: It is either my way or the \nhighway. Either I get the changes I want or I will say to the President \nof the United States that he is wrong, that he is playing politics, \nwhatever it is, and I am going to hold up the security of our country \nin order to do it.\n  I think most people in Washington are saying: What in the world is \ngoing on here? Terror threats are all around us, and we are 17 days \naway from a shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security. This makes \nabsolutely no sense to me. Frankly, we can do better than that as an \ninstitution, as the U.S. Senate. We can do better in Congress than \nconstantly having these roller coasters up and down and threats of \ngovernment shutdowns. We have seen it before. We are now seeing the \npossibility of it again.\n  Seventeen days from now, if Homeland Security is shut down, if we \naren't funding our border, cockpits, airport security, ports, the Coast \nGuard, and all the other things that keep us safe, there is going to be \na big party. Do you know who is going to throw that party? The enemies \nof America. The terrorists who want very much to have the opportunity \nto attack our country. That makes absolutely no sense.\n  Let's come together this week before we leave. We are not in session \nnext week. We can get this done. Let's just pass the Homeland Security \nbudget and get on with important debates on other topics that we all \ncare about. I hope we can do that and get this done as soon as \npossible.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/10/senate-section/article/S906-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
