The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                          GUANTANAMO DETAINEES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, President Obama has left the American \npeople to wait for many years for a serious plan--one that poses no \nadditional risk to our Nation or our Armed Forces, for instance--in \npursuit of his desire to close a secure detention facility at \nGuantanamo Bay. Americans have been waiting for 7 long years to find \nout what the serious plan might look like. They are still waiting \ntoday.\n  What the President sent to Congress yesterday isn't a plan. It is \nmore of a research project than anything. It does call on Congress, \nhowever, to act. It turns out we already have. Congress has repeatedly, \nover and over again, voted to enact clear, bipartisan prohibitions on \nthe very thing the President is again calling for, and that is the \ntransfer of Guantanamo Bay terrorists into our local communities. We \nhave enacted bipartisan prohibitions in Congresses with split party \ncontrol. We have enacted bipartisan prohibitions in Congresses with \nmassive, overwhelming Democratic majorities. Just a couple of months \nago, Members of Congress in both parties expressed themselves clearly \none more time--not once, but twice, and on an overwhelming bipartisan \nbasis. President Obama signed these bipartisan prohibitions into law as \nwell. So let's not pretend there is even the faintest of pretenses for \nsome pen-and-phone gambit here.\n  Congress has acted clearly, repeatedly, and on a bipartisan basis. \nThe President now has the duty to follow the laws he himself signed. It \nshouldn't be that hard when you consider his admonition yesterday about \n``upholding the highest standards of rule of law.'' He said: ``As \nAmericans, we pride ourselves on being a beacon to other nations, a \nmodel of the rule of law.'' That is interesting in light of a recent \nGAO ruling that the administration's detainee swap of Taliban prisoners \nfor Bowe Bergdahl violated the law. It is especially interesting in \nlight of the President's continuing refusal to rule out breaking the \nlaw if he doesn't get his way on Guantanamo. President Obama's own \nAttorney General says he cannot unilaterally do that. It is clear. \nPresident Obama's own Defense Secretary says he cannot unilaterally do \nthat. President Obama's own top military officer says he cannot \nunilaterally do that. In the words of one of our Democratic colleagues, \n``He's going to have to comply with the legal restrictions.'' It is as \nsimple as that--``going to have to comply with the legal \nrestrictions.''\n  Breaking the law as a way to supposedly uphold the rule of law is \njust as absurd as it sounds. It is time that the President finally \nruled that option out categorically, and then he should finally move on \nfrom a years-old campaign promise and focus on the real problem that \nneeds solving today.\n  My own hope is that the Commander in Chief will not put his own chain \nof command in the position of having to carry out an unlawful direct \norder.\n  But, look, closing Guantanamo and transferring terrorists to the \nUnited States didn't make sense in 2008, and it makes even less sense \ntoday. We are a nation at war. The administration's efforts to contain \nISIL thus far have not succeeded. The next President may very well want \nto pursue operations that target, capture, detain, and interrogate \nterrorists because that is how terrorist networks are defeated. Why \nwould we take that option away from the next Commander in Chief now?\n  Let's be clear: The two options on the table are not keeping \nGuantanamo open or closing it, but keeping Guantanamo terrorists at \nGuantanamo or moving them to some Guantanamo North based in a U.S. \ncommunity. Changing the detention center's ZIP Code is not a solution. \nIt is not even serious.\n  The fact that the President missed a deadline for submitting a plan \nto defeat ISIL last week--presumably because he was just too busy \nworking on his ancient campaign promise--is completely unacceptable.\n  Some of the most senior national security officials within President \nObama's own administration are already working to better position the \nnext President for the national security challenges we will face in \n2017. It is time President Obama finally joined them and us in the \nserious work of keeping Americans safe in a dangerous world.\n\n[[Page S968]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/senate-section/article/S968-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, yesterday the senior Senator from Iowa, \nalong with other Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nannounced that they won't be holding a hearing on President Obama's \neventual nominee to the Supreme Court. They won't give the eventual \nnominee the common courtesy of even a meeting--no hearings, no \nmeeting--and this was all done even before the President sent a name to \nus. This is historically unbelievable and historically unprecedented.\n  Republicans don't know who the nominee will be, and they have already \nmentioned that. Already they have decided they won't even start the \nconfirmation process. Why? Because the person was nominated by \nPresident Obama. Remember, the Republican leader said many years ago \nthat the No. 1 goal he had was to make sure President Obama was not \nreelected. That failed miserably. The President won by more than 5 \nmillion votes. Everything has been done by the Republicans in the \nSenate to embarrass, obstruct, filibuster--anything that could be done \nto focus attention on President Obama, none of which has helped the \ncountry.\n  Senator Grassley has surrendered every pretense of independence and \nlet the Republican leader annex the Judiciary Committee into a narrow, \npartisan mission of obstruction and gridlock--so partisan, in fact, \nthat the senior Senator from Iowa won't respond to a personal \ninvitation from the President inviting him to the White House to \ndiscuss the vacancy. Think about that. The President of the United \nStates calls a very senior Senator, and he hasn't even responded to the \nPresident. This is a sad day for one of the proudest committees in the \nSenate. So I ask, is this the legacy he wants? Is this how he wants his \ncommittee work remembered--as a chairman who refused his duty and \ninstead allowed the Republican leader to ride roughshod over the \nJudiciary Committee's storied history?\n  The strength of committee chairmen in the U.S. Senate has been \nlegendary. No majority leader or minority leader could tell a chair \nwhat to do with his committee. That was off bounds, but it doesn't \nappear so now.\n  In abdicating this responsibility, which the Senate has always \nupheld--never in the history of the country has a Senate simply refused \nto do anything, even meet with the person who has been nominated. So \nRepublicans are setting a dangerous precedent for future nominations, \nnot only for the Supreme Court but for the Senate itself as an \ninstitution.\n  Yesterday the Senate Historian's office reported that the denial of \ncommittee hearings for a Supreme Court nominee is unprecedented. If \nthat is unprecedented, how about the fact that he won't even meet with \nthe person who has been nominated? If that is unprecedented, how about \nthe fact that a Member of the Senate won't even go to the White House \nto talk to the President about filling the Supreme Court seat?\n  The senior Senator from Iowa will be the first Judiciary Committee \nchairman ever to refuse to hold a hearing on a Supreme Court nominee. \nThat is quite an achievement, but not one of which he should be proud. \nThat sort of wanton obstruction is not what the American people want. \nIt is not what the people of Iowa want. Last week no fewer than six \nIowa newspapers issued scathing editorials calling on Senator Grassley \nto change course and give the President's Supreme Court nominee the \nrespect he or she deserves.\n  For example, the Mason City Globe Gazette wrote:\n\n       We were especially disappointed to see Iowa's own Chuck \n     Grassley join the partisan crowd calling for a delay. . . . \n     There is no constitutional or even historical precedent for \n     such flagrant, outrageous, shameful, bald-faced partisanship.\n\n  The Gazette in Cedar Rapids, IA, wrote of Senator Grassley's actions:\n\n       It's hard to conclude this is anything but political \n     maneuvering meant to meet partisan objectives at the expense \n     of the Supreme Court, our constitutional process and the \n     common good.\n\n  The headline of the Des Moines Register editorial reads, ``Grassley's \nSupreme Court stance is all about politics.''\n  Is that the legacy the chairman wants for Iowa and our Nation? I \ncertainly hope not. Does he want to be remembered as the least \nproductive Judiciary Committee chairman in history? At his current \npace, he will be remembered as the most obstructive chairman in \nhistory.\n  Instead of studying what the Vice President said a quarter of a \ncentury ago, perhaps Senator Grassley should take note of what Senator \nBiden did 25 years ago or generally as a member and chairman of that \ncommittee.\n  In 1992, under Senator Biden's leadership, the Judiciary Committee \nconfirmed 64 circuit and district court nominations. All of the \njudicial nominations were made by a President of the opposite party--\nPresident George H.W. Bush. In 2015, Senator Grassley's first year as \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, the Senate confirmed 11 judicial \nnominations. That was the fewest judicial nominations confirmed ever. \nWe were a much smaller country, perhaps, so ``ever'' might be a little \nmuch, but certainly in the last 50 or 75 years. That is quite a \ncomparison: Biden, 64; Grassley, 11.\n  It gets even worse than that for my friend from Iowa. In the entire \n102nd Congress, when Joe Biden was chair, the Senate confirmed 120 \nnominees--120 judicial nominations under Biden. Compare that to 16 \nunder Chairman Grassley. The difference is stunning.\n  I would encourage my friend from Iowa to focus on Vice President \nBiden's actions and results, rather than cherry picking remarks of 25 \nyears ago. The Judiciary Committee of Joe Biden honored its \nconstitutional obligations by considering and confirming--even visiting \nwith nominees--in a timely fashion, even though they were a Republican \nPresident's nominees. I can't say the same for the committee today. No \none can.\n  As chairman, Joe Biden did his constitutional duty and processed four \nnominations from Republican Presidents to the Supreme Court, including \nJustice Kennedy--that vote occurred in the last year of President \nReagan's Presidency--Souter and Thomas.\n  Let us focus on Thomas just a little bit. Thomas got 52 votes. He \nsqueaked through the Senate. Any one Senator could have forced a \ncloture vote. Any one Democrat could have done that. We didn't do that. \nIt was never done until the Republicans showed up here in the last few \nyears.\n  Now, Bork was a very controversial person, but he received a long, \nlong hearing before the committee and a long debate here in the Senate. \nHe was voted down. That is how this place is supposed to work. Other \nnominees have been voted down. But we didn't say we are not going to \nhold a hearing on Bork. We didn't say we are not going to take the \ncommittee's actions and just leave it at that. Listen to this: Bork was \nturned down in the Judiciary Committee by an overwhelming margin. In \nspite of that, we brought it to the Senate floor and it was debated, \nand he won by two votes--no filibusters. He was defeated in the \ncommittee. We didn't look for an excuse. That is the way it used to be \ndone.\n  With the Republican leadership now they will not meet with the \nnominee, even though they do not know who it will be; they won't hold a \nhearing; and the chairman of the committee will not even go to the \nWhite House and visit with the President.\n  As chairman, Senator Biden did his constitutional duty and processed \nnominations, even though they were Republican nominations. So we don't \nhave to go back to 1988 or 1992 to prove the current Judiciary \nCommittee chairman's ineptness. Look at the spike in judicial \nemergencies that have occurred on Chairman Grassley's watch just in the \npast year.\n  What is an emergency? It means there are not enough judges--too many\n\n[[Page S969]]\n\ncases for a judge to do the work. A vacant judgeship is automatically \ndeclared an emergency, as it should be. When the Republicans assumed \ncontrol of the Senate last year there were 12 emergencies nationwide. \nToday, a year later, that number has almost tripled to 31.\n  By nearly every metric, the Judiciary Committee under Chairman \nGrassley is failing dramatically, setting all records of failure in \nthis great body. The committee is failing the people of Iowa and the \nNation.\n  To the senior Senator from Iowa, I stress, I plead, don't continue \ndown this path. Reject this record-setting obstruction and simply do \nyour job as a powerful chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. President, I see no one on the floor. Will the Chair announce the \nbusiness of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/senate-section/article/S969-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, every Member of the Senate stands in the \nwell of the Senate when they are elected, takes an oath of office. That \noath of office, required by the Constitution, is our statement to not \nonly the people we represent but to the Nation, that we will uphold and \ndefend the Constitution of the United States.\n  Article II, section 2 of that Constitution empowers the President. \nThose powers include the President's power to fill vacancies on the \nSupreme Court. It is not permissive language. The word ``shall'' can be \nfound in this paragraph. It basically says that the President of the \nUnited States shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of \nthe Senate, shall appoint judges of the Supreme Court.\n  For the first time in the history of the United States of America, \nSenate Republicans are prepared to defy this clear statement of the \nU.S. Constitution. What an irony that filling the vacancy on the Court \nby the untimely death of Antonin Scalia--filling the vacancy on the \nCourt of a man who prided himself throughout his judicial career as \nbeing what he termed an ``originalist,'' sticking to the strict letter \nof the law, as spelled out in the Constitution--in filling that \nvacancy, the Senate Republicans have basically decided to reach a new \nlow; in fact, to make history in a very sad way. A seat on the U.S. \nSupreme Court lies vacant because of the death of Justice Scalia. The \nPresident has the constitutional obligation, as I have read, to name a \nnominee to fill that vacancy. Senate Republicans are now saying they \nwill not even hold a hearing on that nominee.\n  If the President sends a name--and he will--to the Senate to fill \nthat vacancy, they have said they will not hold a hearing, they will \nnot schedule a vote, and, listen to this, yesterday Senator McConnell \nsaid: I will not even meet with that person.\n  This is a new low. Since the Senate Judiciary Committee started \nholding hearings on Supreme Court nominees a century ago, the Senate of \nthe United States of America has never--never--denied a hearing to a \npending Supreme Court nominee. It has never happened, but that is what \nSenate Republicans are saying they will do.\n  This level of obstruction, of ignoring the clear language of the \nConstitution, is unprecedented, and it is dangerous. This goes beyond \nany single vote for any Supreme Court nominee. This is an abdication of \nthe Senate's responsibility under article II, section 2 of the \nConstitution to provide advice and consent on Supreme Court \nnominations, which the President shall appoint and shall nominate.\n  Senate Republicans want to keep the Supreme Court seat vacant for \nmore than 1 year. They want this vacancy to continue for more than 1 \nyear. That will encompass two terms of the Supreme Court. This is \ndemeaning to the institution of the Supreme Court, and unfair to \nmillions of Americans who rely on that Court to resolve important legal \nquestions.\n  In the coming days, the President will name a nominee, as the \nConstitution requires him to do. Senate Republicans should meet their \nresponsibility under the Constitution, do their jobs, and give the \nPresident's nominee a fair hearing and a vote.\n  Yesterday, the Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee \nsent a letter to the majority leader, and here is what they said: \n``This Committee will not hold hearings on any Supreme Court nominee \nuntil after our next President is sworn in on January 20, 2017.''\n  Why did they take this unusual position in defiance of the \nConstitution? They said: ``The presidential election is well underway. \nAmericans have already begun to cast their votes. . . . The American \npeople are presented with an exceedingly rare opportunity to decide, in \na very real and concrete way, the direction the Court will take over \nthe next generation.''\n  This argument is specious. The American people have already voted; \nthey voted to elect our President, Barack Obama, and they voted to \nelect 100 Senators who currently serve in this body. President Obama \nwas elected to a 4-year term, and 11 months remain. The American people \nvoted for each of us to do our jobs for as long as we serve in office. \nBy a margin of 5 million votes, the American people have chosen the \nPresident. Did they elect the President for 3 years, or 3 years and 2 \nmonths? No. They elected a President for 4 years, and this President's \nterm continues until January 20, 2017.\n  The Republicans conveniently ignore the obvious. The will of the \nAmerican people was expressed in that election, and the election of \nBarack Obama as President of the United States empowers him under the \nConstitution to fill this vacancy with an appointment. They didn't vote \nin that election for us to sit on our hands for over a year while the \nSupreme Court twists in the wind and while the Republican Senators pray \nevery night that President Donald Trump will somehow give America a \ndifferent Supreme Court nominee. Not a single American, incidentally, \nhas yet cast a vote for President of the United States--not one--in the \nnext election, despite the statement of the Judiciary Committee \nRepublicans that says otherwise.\n  It is February of this year. The nomination conventions are scheduled \nfor late July. The modern Supreme Court confirmation process has taken \nan average of 67 days. There is more than adequate time to hold a \nhearing on this nominee and get this done properly. All we need is for \nthe Senate Republicans to do their jobs.\n  Yesterday on the Senate floor, I urged my Republican colleagues not \nto duck a vote on the President's nominee. They could vote yes, they \ncould vote no, but they shouldn't abdicate their constitutional \nresponsibility for political advantage. I am amazed that my Republican \ncolleagues now say that\n\n[[Page S970]]\n\nnot only do they want to duck that vote, but they also want to avoid \neven having a hearing on the nominee. And they are afraid to even meet \nwith this nominee for fear that maybe they might think he or she is a \ngood nominee.\n  Even more shockingly, the Republican leader and several Republican \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee said yesterday they would not even \nmeet with the President's nominee. One of our colleagues in the Senate \nlast night on television was asked pointedly or directly: If the \nPresident nominates someone from your State to the Supreme Court \nvacancy, are you saying you wouldn't meet with that person? My \ncolleague on the other side of the aisle ducked the question. This is \nstunning.\n  Remember, the President is obligated by article II, section 2 of the \nConstitution to send a nominee to the Senate. That is the process the \nFounding Fathers established. That is the President's responsibility. \nHow can Senate Republicans refuse to even meet with the person selected \nunder this constitutional process? How is that being faithful to the \nterms of the Constitution? How are Senate Republicans upholding and \ndefending this Constitution by this evasive, historically unprecedented \naction?\n  Sadly, it appears that Senate Republicans have calculated it is in \ntheir best political interests to keep the nominee out of the \nspotlight. They were hoping that, with this letter and by saying \nyesterday we will have nothing to do with it, they are going to turn \nout the lights on this issue. That is not what is going to happen. This \nissue is going to be there and remembered, and it is going to be \nrecalled on the floor of the Senate repeatedly. They thought they could \nclose down the government when Senator Cruz of Texas sat here for, I \ndon't know how many hours, reading Dr. Seuss while we shut down the \ngovernment, and they thought people would forget Senator Cruz shutting \ndown the government; they didn't, and he is finding on this campaign \ntrail that a lot of people have remembered that. The American people \nare not going to forget what Senate Republicans are trying to do with \nthe Supreme Court.\n  I have served on the Judiciary Committee for the hearings and \nconfirmation votes of four of the eight sitting Supreme Court Justices. \nLet me state clearly that this Senator is more than happy to meet with \nthe President's Supreme Court nominee, as I have on all such nominees--\nRepublican and Democrat alike--and I will consider that nominee on his \nor her merits, as I have always tried to do in the past.\n  Yesterday, Senate Republicans also tried to deflect attention from \ntheir unprecedented obstruction by pointing to quotes from some \nDemocrats years ago. But the record is clear: Democrats have never, \nnever blocked a Supreme Court nominee from having a hearing. \nRepublicans are breaking new ground with this obstructionism. The \nAmerican people deserve better.\n  The bottom line is there is no excuse for the Senate to fail to do \nits job. Once the President has named his nominee, the Senate must give \nthat nominee a fair hearing and a timely vote. If the Constitution \nmeans anything to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, they \nunderstand that what they are doing is unprecedented. It has never \nhappened once in American history. We are now finding the \nobstructionism of Senate Republicans reaching a new low. They are \nignoring the clear wording of our Constitution, which they have sworn \nto uphold and defend, and they are obstructing in a way that we have \nnever seen before in the history of the United States. That is the \nreality--a reality that will not be lost on the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Prescription Drug Abuse\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \na drug abuse problem that is literally hurting millions of Americans. \nThere has been a dramatic rise in the use and misuse of prescription \npainkillers. These prescription painkillers--and I tell you this as a \ndoctor--are known as opioids.\n  Between 1999 and 2013, sales of prescription painkillers in the \nUnited States have quadrupled. It is no coincidence that over that same \nnumber of years overdose deaths from these drugs have also quadrupled. \nThis is how we know there has been a huge shift from the appropriate \nuse to abuse of these medications. People in rural areas like my own \nare almost twice as likely to overdose on prescription painkillers as \npeople in large cities. Some people think these problems are only a \nproblem in the big cities. That is not the case with these opioids.\n  I can tell you as a doctor who practiced medicine in Casper, WY, for \n25 years, treating pain in our patients is one of the most difficult \nthings we do. When we have a patient who is in pain, we want to help \nrelieve that pain. Opioids are a very effective way to help patients \nwith pain, and doctors use these medications through prescriptions to \nhelp manage the pain. It is important that we have the capacity to do \nthat as long as it is done appropriately. This can be a very good \noption for someone suffering from chronic pain, such as pain from \ncancer. It can be appropriate for someone who is suffering from acute, \ntemporary pain, such as someone who just had surgery.\n  The problem is that these are extremely powerful narcotics. \nChemically, they are not that different from heroin, and they can \nbecome addictive. Some patients have no problem at all taking these \npainkillers for the proper amount of time, while other patients might \ndevelop a problem and actually have trouble getting off the pain pills. \nAs they get accustomed to the drugs, sometimes they may seek out \nstronger and more addictive drugs to get the same pain relief. That is \nwhy doctors have to be very careful about prescribing the right \nmedicine for each patient and each situation. They have to balance the \nrisk of the drug with the reward of easing the patient's pain.\n  Not every doctor in this country has been as careful as they should \nbe. We didn't get into this difficult situation because of a handful of \ndoctors writing too many prescriptions. These prescriptions are being \nwritten by doctors in communities all across the country. It is \nhappening in emergency rooms, with family doctors, with specialists, \nand even with dentists.\n  I believe Washington policies have inadvertently contributed to the \nproblem. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid have made payments to \nhospitals partly based on how well the specific hospital has scored on \nsurveys filled out by the patients--the patients who have been in those \nhospitals. Here are some examples of questions that are asked on these \nsurveys: During this hospital stay, how often was your pain well \ncontrolled? Some patients are asked that. They are also asked: How \noften did the hospital staff do everything they could to help you with \nyour pain?\n  Well, you can see how doctors might feel pressure to prescribe more \nand stronger opioid pain relievers to make sure their hospital doesn't \nget low scores and get penalized by the bureaucrats here in Washington. \nThe Department of Health and Human Services is looking into whether \nthese surveys are contributing to this rise in prescriptions and what \ncan be done about it.\n  Earlier this month I was 1 of 26 Senators, Republicans and Democrats \nalike, who wrote to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make \nsure she keeps us apprised on the effects these regulations might be \nhaving. If these pain relievers are being prescribed inappropriately, \nthey can do more harm than good. That's the problem. Some of these \npeople who get these prescriptions for all the right reasons end up \nbeing addicted. When the prescription runs out, they may actually \nexperience withdrawal symptoms, and I have seen it happen.\n  So what do the people who become addicted to these opioids do? Well, \nthey seek pills on the black market or they turn to other drugs, \nincluding heroin. Heroin is often cheaper than the actual prescription \nopioid and, of course, more deadly.\n  From 2002 to 2013, heroin use in the United States has nearly \ndoubled. The deaths from heroin overdoses have quadrupled. Why? One of \nthe reasons\n\n[[Page S971]]\n\nseems to be that because heroin has become much cheaper on the street, \nit has also become a more attractive drug for addicts to buy and use. \nAt the same time, the heroin today is believed to be much more powerful \nthan it used to be, and so it may be that people who use it are much \nmore likely to overdose.\n  When we see statistics like these--or just talk to people, such as \nthose who work in the emergency room, who have to deal with the drug \naddictions, 911 calls, opioid abuse, heroin abuse, and see all these \nproblems--it is time for Congress to act. We can't turn a blind eye to \nAmericans who are suffering and dying. That is why I think it is \nimportant that the Senate needs to take up action to help stop the \ndamage being done.\n  Recently the Senate Judiciary Committee passed the Comprehensive \nAddiction and Recovery Act. It has bipartisan support, and it is one \nmore sign that the Senate has gotten back to work on behalf of the \nAmerican people. Just as the name of the legislation says, it actually \naddresses both problems--addiction and recovery. It will increase \neducation and prevention efforts to help keep people from becoming \naddicted to painkillers in the first place. It is also going to \nstrengthen State programs to monitor prescription drugs and to track \nwhen these drugs end up in the wrong hands.\n  For the people who have already passed from use of the medications to \nabuse and addiction, this legislation will help to launch treatment \nprograms that are based on actual evidence of what works. There are a \nlot of treatment programs out there and lots of different opportunities \nto seek treatment. We want to make sure we can identify the ones that \nare actually succeeding and helping people and then make sure these \nprograms are available to more people. These are just a few of the \npositive ideas in the legislation.\n  Senator Kelly Ayotte, who is one of the main sponsors of this \nlegislation, has said that we can't arrest our way out of this problem. \nShe is exactly right. The misuse and abuse of these drugs is illegal. \nWe must acknowledge that fact. We must still try to do everything in \nour power to keep this misuse from turning into addiction and even \ndeath. There are States and communities and families suffering because \nof the abuse of these drugs. We can all be part of the solution, and we \nmust all be part of the solution.\n  I know that the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nis looking into another aspect of this subject, as is the Finance \nCommittee. There are lots of ideas out there, and I am glad to see \nMembers taking the issue so seriously. I am glad we are moving forward \nwith bipartisan legislations and solutions.\n  Senator Ayotte has been a major force in talking about this problem. \nSenators Whitehouse, Kirk, Portman, and others have addressed this \nissue.\n  Another good, commonsense idea is looking into changing Medicare Part \nD and Medicare Advantage. This legislation has been introduced by \nSenator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. I am a cosponsor of that \nlegislation. The bill is called the Stopping Medication Abuse and \nProtecting Seniors Act. That is it: Stopping Medication Abuse and \nProtecting Seniors. It allows Part D and Medicare Advantage plans to \nlock in patients to a single prescriber, a single pharmacy, for their \nopioid pain medicine. This is going to do a couple of things. It will \ndeal with the issue of doctor shopping. That is when a patient goes to \nmultiple providers to get duplicate prescriptions if they become \naddicted. Many private insurance companies already do this and so does \nMedicaid. So we should allow and encourage Medicare to do it as well.\n  These are all ideas with bipartisan support in the Senate. They are \nexamples of ways that Democrats and Republicans are working together to \nhelp Americans who need and deserve help. The abuse of prescription \ndrugs and heroin is happening everywhere in America. It is harming our \nNation. Congress must do what it can to stop it.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, our Republican colleagues have decided \nthat the Senate should not hold a hearing or vote on any Supreme Court \nnominee this year. The reason? It is an election year. That is a \nbreathtakingly candid but utterly irresponsible reason for the Senate \nnot to do its job. That decision may not surprise those who have \nfollowed the Senate in recent years, as our Republican colleagues have \ntime and again chosen to obstruct President Obama's agenda.\n  We can disagree on legislation, we can disagree on policies, we can \ncertainly disagree on judicial nominations, but the idea that the \nSenate should not take any action on a Supreme Court vacancy is \nunprecedented.\n  In the last 100 years, the Senate has taken action on every Supreme \nCourt nominee whether it is an election year or not. The Senate has not \nonly taken action, but the Senate has confirmed more than a dozen \nSupreme Court Justices in the final year of a Presidency. In fact, a \nDemocratic Senate confirmed Justice Anthony Kennedy in the final year \nof President Reagan's term. Yet roughly 9 months before the next \nelection, the Republican position is that the Senate should not do its \njob because 11 months from now, we will have a new President. I ask \nyou, what has that got to do with us doing our jobs?\n  Under the Republican timeline, the Supreme Court will be left with \nonly eight Justices for over a year. The last time it took so long for \nthe Senate to fill a vacancy on the Court was during the Civil War. The \nrationale that the Senate should not act because of an upcoming \nelection is not only stunning, but I think most Americans would agree \nis absurd. In what other workplace can employees announce that they \ndon't plan to fulfill their responsibilities for 9 months and still get \npaid? But that is exactly what Republicans are saying to the American \npeople.\n\n  We work for the American people. The American people elect Senators, \nRepresentatives, and Presidents. Through elections, the people shape \nthe direction of our country.\n  While Republicans may want to forget it, in 2012 the people elected \nPresident Obama to a full 4-year term. That term doesn't end for nearly \na year. His responsibilities as President don't stop because a \nRepublican Senate says so.\n  The Constitution requires a President to nominate someone to fill a \nvacancy on the Supreme Court. The Constitution requires the Senate to \nprovide advice and consent on the President's nominee. That is our job \nas Senators.\n  The President hasn't nominated anyone to fill the current Supreme \nCourt vacancy. When he does, no Senator is required to vote for that \nnominee, but what is required is for the Senate to fulfill its \nconstitutional duties. The President's nominee deserves a hearing and a \nvote. No excuses. Let's do our job.\n  Mr. President, I wish to now turn to another subject.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Hirono pertaining to the submission of S. Res. \n373 are printed in today's Record under ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yesterday it was my privilege to say a few \nwords honoring Justice Antonin Scalia, known to his friends as \n``Nino,'' a man whose intellect, wit, and dedication to our \nConstitution have served our country for decades. I am pleased that \nothers have said appropriate words honoring his memory and the many \nways he helped strengthen our constitutional self-government and our \ndemocracy.\n  As we know, the Constitution gives the Senate an equal role in \ndeciding who eventually is to serve on the Supreme Court of the United \nStates.\n\n[[Page S972]]\n\nPresident Obama called me and other members of the Judiciary Committee \nyesterday, saying he intends to exercise his constitutional authority, \nand I recognize his right to make that nomination. But not since 1932 \nhas the Senate, in a Presidential election year, confirmed a Supreme \nCourt nominee to a vacancy that arose in that Presidential election \nyear. And it is necessary to go even further back--I believe to the \nadministration of Grover Cleveland in 1888--to find an election-year \nnominee who was nominated and confirmed under a divided government, \nsuch as we have now.\n  So I found it very curious that some of our colleagues across the \naisle are effusive in their criticism of our decision to withhold \nconsent until we have a new President and in effect say this ought to \nbe a choice not just confined to the 100 Members of the Senate and the \nPresident but to the American people.\n  We are not saying--we are not foreclosing the possibility that a \nmember of one party or another party would be the one to make that \nnominee. This isn't a partisan issue. This is about the people having a \nchance to express their views and raising the stakes and the visibility \nof the Presidential election to make the point that this isn't just \nabout the next President who will serve 4 years, maybe 8 years; this \nwill likely be about who will serve the next 30 years on the Supreme \nCourt of the United States.\n  I am going to remind our colleagues of some of the things they have \nsaid in the past for which they have so roundly criticized us. People \nunderstand when there are differences of opinion. It is a little harder \nto understand hypocrisy when you have taken just the opposite position \nwhen it suited your purposes in the past to the position you take \ntoday. So let me just be charitable and say maybe they have just \nforgotten.\n  For example, the minority leader, Senator Reid of Nevada, the \nDemocratic leader, said on May 19, 2005, when George W. Bush was \nPresident of the United States:\n\n       The duties of the Senate are set forth in the U.S. \n     Constitution. Nowhere in that document does it say the Senate \n     has a duty to give Presidential appointees a vote.\n\n  That was Senator Reid. I agree with him. That is exactly right, but \nthat is not the position he appears to be taking today.\n  The President has every right to nominate someone, but the Senate has \nthe authority to grant consent or to withhold consent. And what I and \nthe other members of the Judiciary Committee on the Republican side \nsaid yesterday in a letter to the majority leader is that we believe \nunanimously--all the Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee--\nthat we should withhold consent, exercising a right and an authority \nrecognized by Senator Reid in 2005.\n  I have read some of the press clips. People recoil in mock horror: \nWell, you are not even going to have a hearing? You are not even going \nto meet with the President's proposed nominee?\n  Well, that is right, for a very good reason--because it is not about \nthe personality of that nominee. So it would be pretty misleading for \nus to take the same position that Senator Reid has taken and then to \nsay: Well, we are going to go through this elaborate dance of having \ncourtesy meetings, maybe even having a hearing, when we have already \ndecided--as Senator Reid acknowledged is the right of the Senate--not \nto bring up this President's nominee for a vote. And not to preordain \nwho that next nominee will be, whether they will be nominated by a \nRepublican or Democratic President--we don't know what the outcome of \nthe Presidential election is going to be. But this is too important for \nthe Congress and for the Senate to be stampeded into a rubberstamp of \nPresident Obama's selection on the Supreme Court as he is heading out \nthe door--a decision that could well have an impact on the balance of \npower on the Supreme Court for the next 30 years.\n  I am not through with my charts.\n  The next Democratic leader in the Senate, Senator Schumer--first, I \nguess you could call this the Reid standard. We call it the Reid rule \nand the Schumer standard. That rolls off the tongue better.\n  So this is what Senator Schumer said 18 months before President \nGeorge W. Bush left office. We are only looking at, what, 10 or 11 \nmonths until President Obama leaves. In 2007, Senator Chuck Schumer \nsaid: ``[F]or the rest of this President's term. . . . We should \nreverse the presumption of confirmation.''\n  I, frankly, don't know what he is talking about. The Constitution \ndoesn't talk about a presumption of confirmation. But it is pretty \nclear to me that he wants a presumption that the nominee will not be \nconfirmed for the next 18 months.\n  Senator Schumer, one of the Democratic leaders, said: ``I will \nrecommend to my colleagues that we should not confirm a Supreme Court \nnominee except in extraordinary circumstances.''\n  So what we are doing is what Senator Reid and Senator Schumer \nadvocated back when it was convenient and served their purposes way \nback when. They are now taking a different position because, of course, \ntheir interests are different. They want to make sure President Obama \ngets a chance to nominate and the Senate confirm President Obama's \nnominee, who will serve for perhaps the next quarter of a century or \nmore on the Supreme Court. But it is pretty clear that the Senate is \nnot bound to confirm a Supreme Court nominee or even hold a vote.\n  Finally, I wish to point out--we will call it the Reid rule, the \nSchumer standard, and the Biden benchmark.\n  This is what the Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, said \nin 1992 when he was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He gave \na long speech, of which this is an excerpt. He said: ``[T]he Senate \nJudiciary Committee should seriously consider not scheduling \nconfirmation hearings on the nomination until after the political \ncampaign season is over.'' He went on to say: ``[A]ction on a Supreme \nCourt nomination must be put off until after the election campaign is \nover.''\n  That is the Biden benchmark--the Reid rule, the Schumer standard, and \nthe Biden benchmark.\n  I read a statement from the Vice President that he issued after he \nsaw that this old news clip and his statement had been made public. He \nquite conveniently said this was ``not an accurate description of my \nviews on the subject.'' Well, I think the words are very clear. I think \nwhat he might have said is ``These are no longer my views on the \nsubject'' because, of course, he would like President Obama to be able \nto make that nomination.\n  So I wish to reject this myth that many of our Democratic colleagues \nare spreading that what we are doing here and now is somehow \nunprecedented. Quite the contrary. What we are doing is what the \nDemocrats' top leadership has advocated in the past. What do they think \nwe are? They think we are going to abide by a different set of rules \nthan they themselves advocated? How ridiculous would that be? I could \nnot explain that to my constituents back home in Texas. If I were going \nto say: Well, the Democrats can apply one set of rules, but then when \nthe Republicans are in the majority, the Republicans must apply a \ndifferent set of rules--well, the fact is, the rule book has been \nburned by the Democrats, and what we are operating under is the status \nquo they advocated back in 1992, 2005, and 2007.\n  The Senate has every right under the Constitution not to have a \nhearing, and we shouldn't go through some motions pretending like we \nare or that this is really about the personality of whomever the \nPresident nominates. I have confidence that the President will nominate \nsomebody who he thinks is qualified to be on the Supreme Court. I would \npoint out, though, that this nominee will not be confirmed. I don't \nknow many leading lawyers, scholars, and judges who would want to be \nnominated for the U.S. Supreme Court to a seat that President Obama \nwill never fill.\n  So during this already very heated election year--and the election is \nalready underway. Democrats are voting in Democratic primaries, and \nRepublicans are voting in Republican primaries and caucuses. The \nelection is already underway, and the Supreme Court can function in the \nvast majority of cases with eight members. It frequently does anyway \nbecause most cases are not decided 5 to 4; most cases are decided on a \nconsensus basis.\n  But let's say, for the six or so cases in which Justice Scalia was a \ndeciding vote on a 5-to-4 case last year--if there\n\n[[Page S973]]\n\nis a deadlock, those cases can simply be held over until the next year \nwhen there is a new Justice or the Court can come up with some other \nway to dispose of it as it sees fit. That frequently happens. For \nexample, Justice Kagan was Solicitor General of the United States. She \nwas recused from and could not sit on cases that she handled as an \nadvocate for the U.S. Government once she got to the Supreme Court. So \nthe Court operated with eight Justices for a long time because of \nJustice Kagan's recusal. Similarly, Justice Anthony Kennedy served on \nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Once he got to the Supreme Court of \nthe United States, he couldn't then sit on those cases and decide them \nonce as a circuit court judge and another time as a Supreme Court \nJustice. He recused, which means there were eight Justices to decide \nthose cases. That is not extraordinary; that is not uncommon. And it is \nnot going to paralyze the Supreme Court of the United States from doing \nits job. It has all the tools it needs at its disposal to handle these \ncases as it sees fit--either to dismiss them as improvidently granted, \nto hold them over if they are truly deadlocked, or to find some other \nperhaps more narrow basis upon which to decide the case, which would \ncommand a five-vote majority with eight members of the Court.\n\n  So Mr. President, I would like our colleagues to come out here and \nexplain this apparent contradiction in the position they took in 2007, \n2005, and 1992. Because if they can't explain that, then it looks to me \nlike this is pure hypocrisy--holding Republicans, when we are in the \nmajority, to a different standard than they themselves were willing to \nembrace when they were in power.\n  As I said, people may not understand a lot of the nitty-gritty \ndetails of this, but they do have a strong sense of fairness and \nevenhandedness, and they do smell hypocrisy and see it when it is right \nbefore their eyes.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I come to the floor today with what I \nthink is a pretty simple message--a message the American people have \nbeen delivering to me and the people of North Dakota and which reflects \nexactly why I wanted to come to Washington, DC--which is that Congress \nneeds to do its job. Whether it is legislating on WOTUS or making sure \nwe are moving appointments properly or taking votes that may make some \nof us uncomfortable, that is our job. That is why the American \ntaxpayers pay us. So I come today to say: Congress, do your job. \nSenate, do your job.\n  Every day families across this country go to work and fulfill their \nresponsibilities and obligations. They do their jobs to put food on the \ntable for their family, and they pay their bills. Imagine a \nconstruction worker in North Dakota telling his boss he didn't want to \ndo his job for the rest of the year until conditions are probably more \nfavorable. He might get a good laugh. He might be told to go back to \nwork. If he was serious, he wouldn't have a job very long.\n  Everyone here knows American workers can't go to their jobs and just \nannounce: I don't want to do that today. They can't just say: I am not \ngoing to do my job for the rest of the year. I am going to wait to find \nout who might be the new boss. That is not how it works for the \nAmerican people, and it is certainly not how it should work for the \nSenate.\n  In many ways, I think it is an embarrassment that some of my \ncolleagues would not only ask the President not to do his job--a job \nour Constitution instructs him to do--but they would also shirk their \nown duties to provide advice and consent to the President simply \nbecause it is not a good political time to do it.\n  It says something pretty terrible about Congress if the Senate now is \nmaking determinations about how a popularly elected President, \nregardless of political party--regardless of whether that President is \npopular in this Chamber or not--is no longer allowed to perform the \nduties of that office and nominate and receive a vote on the Supreme \nCourt nominee of his choosing.\n  It is a disappointing day when some Senators will tell the President: \nDon't even bother because we will not even consider or even talk to \nyour nominee. This is before the President has even announced or named \na nominee. It is particularly frustrating to those of us who really \nwant the Senate to work that some Senators are willing to hamper the \nfunctioning of yet another branch of our Federal Government simply to \nplay politics, with the hope that those politics will benefit one \nparty--to maintain and possibly take control of the other two branches \nof government.\n  I don't think anyone can dispute the facts. The Supreme Court \nconsiders some of the most critical issues facing our country, and the \nAmerican people deserve a fully functioning Court. To insist the Court \ngo through potentially two terms without a full slate of Justices is an \nabdication of our responsibility as Senators. That responsibility is to \nmake sure that America's three branches of government are fully \nfunctioning.\n  Just yesterday, we heard that our colleagues are not even going to \nentertain the thought of a hearing before the Judiciary Committee for \nany nominee the President puts forward. I don't know how to explain \nthat decision. I don't know how one can say that for the next 10 months \nthat doesn't matter. I don't know how to explain that to people back in \nNorth Dakota.\n  In the last 100 years, the full Senate has taken action on every \npending Supreme Court nominee to fill a vacancy, regardless of whether \nthe nomination was made in a Presidential election year. According to \nCRS--Congressional Research Service--since 1975 the average number of \ndays from nomination to final Senate confirmation is 67 days or just \nover 2 months.\n  Since committee hearings began in 1916, every pending Supreme Court \nnominee has received a hearing, except nine nominees who were all \nconfirmed within 11 days. In addition to holding hearings on the \nnominations, the Senate Judiciary Committee has a longstanding \nbipartisan tradition of sending to the full Senate all pending nominees \nto the Supreme Court for a Supreme Court vacancy, even when the \nmajority of the committee may not have supported that nominee.\n  If, in fact, this Supreme Court vacancy is held open until the next \nPresident makes the nomination, that will mean it is vacant for well \nover a year. Not since the Civil War--not since the Civil War--has the \nSenate taken longer than 1 year to fill a Supreme Court vacancy.\n  An extended period of time with only eight members of the Supreme \nCourt sitting would delay or prevent justice from being served. There \nare American citizens across the country who need decisions from the \nCourt on a variety of issues. In fact, what we have done is we have \nelevated the circuit courts--the courts that have made the decisions \nthat are currently pending--to the position of the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States, denying access to those claimants one way or the other--\nwhether the court agreed with them or the court disagreed with them in \nthe circuit courts--denying them access to that final appeal, to that \nSupreme Court decision.\n  So I simply want to say: Let's do our job. Let's give the nominee a \nhearing. Let's vote in committee. Let's all do our job to vet the \ncandidates. Let's not prejudge this. Let's do the responsible thing and \nvote yes or no. Let's take a look at the candidate to be nominated, and \nlet's get a fully functioning Supreme Court.\n  I want to close with just one reminder. The last time we went through \na very contentious hearing was the hearing for Justice Thomas, and I \nthink my colleague from Washington, who is on the floor, well remembers \nthat, as do a lot of people here remember that. I want to remark that \nJustice Thomas was sent to this floor without a positive vote out of \ncommittee. But his nomination was sent to the floor, and the nomination \nof Justice Thomas, at the urging of then-majority leader Mitchell, was \nnot filibustered. So probably the most contentious nominee in my \nlifetime certainly--and it certainly raised some very interesting \ngender issues--did not even get filibustered.\n\n[[Page S974]]\n\n  Let's do our job. Let's do the work the people sent us here to do. \nLet's vet this candidate, whoever it might be, and let's move forward \nso that every person who has a case pending before the Supreme Court or \nwill have a case pending before the Supreme Court is given access to \njustice by providing a fully functioning Supreme Court.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on \nbehalf of the nomination before the vote for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the role of the FDA Commissioner is \ncentral to the health and safety of every family and community \nnationwide, from a dad making his daughter's peanut butter sandwich in \nthe morning to a patient headed into an operating room. I know this is \na nomination we all take very seriously.\n  After careful review, I believe Dr. Califf's experience and expertise \nwill allow him to lead the FDA in a way that puts patients and families \nfirst and upholds the highest standards of patient and consumer safety. \nDr. Califf has led one of our country's largest clinical research \norganizations, and he has a record of advancing medical breakthroughs \non especially difficult-to-treat illnesses.\n  He has a longstanding commitment to transparency in relationships \nwith industry and to working to ensure academic integrity. He has made \nclear he will continue to prioritize independence at the FAA as the \nCommissioner and always put science over politics. His nomination \nreceived letters of support from over 128 different physician and \npatient groups.\n  He earned the strong bipartisan support of the members of the HELP \nCommittee. There is a lot the FDA needs to get done in the coming \nmonths, including building a robust postmarket surveillance system for \nmedical devices, making sure families have access to nutritional \ninformation, putting all of the agency's tools to work to stop tobacco \ncompanies from targeting our children, and playing a part in addressing \nthe epidemic of opioid abuse that is hurting so many communities so \ndeeply.\n  I believe Dr. Califf will be a valuable partner to Congress in taking \non these challenges and the many others the FDA faces. I am here to \nencourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this nomination.

Mr. President, I wish to talk about Judge Scalia for a few \nminutes, and then I will address the vacancy on the Court.\n  There is no question that the Supreme Court has lost a strong and \nthoughtful voice. No matter what issues the Justices on the Court might \nhave disagreed with, or even when there was a disagreement on how to \ninterpret the Constitution, there is no question that Judge Scalia had \na unique capacity to get beyond that. He will be missed by the Court \nfor both his intellect and his friendship. He was an Associate Justice \non the Court for almost 30 years. He was a true constitutional scholar, \nboth in his work before the Court and on the Court, and he brought a \nlifetime of understanding of the law to the Court.\n  He began his legal career in 1961, practicing in private practice. In \n1967, he became part of the faculty of the University of Virginia \nSchool of Law. In 1972, he joined the Nixon administration as General \nCounsel for the Office of Telecommunications Policy, and from there he \nwas appointed Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal \nCounsel. He brought a great deal of knowledge to his work and finished \nthe first part of his career as a law professor at the University of \nChicago, and that is the point where he became a judge.\n  In 1982, President Reagan appointed him to the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the District of Columbia, a court that gets many of the cases that \nwind up on the Supreme Court. He was on that court for a little more \nthan 4 years.\n  In 1986, President Reagan nominated him to serve as an Associate \nJustice. He was an unwavering defender of the Constitution, and as a \nmember of the Supreme Court, he had the ability to debate as perhaps no \none had in a long time--and perhaps no one will for a long time. He had \na sense of what the Constitution was all about and a sense of what the \nConstitution meant, and by that he meant what the Constitution meant to \nthe people who wrote it.\n  There is a way to change the Constitution. If the country and the \nCongress think that the Constitution is outmoded in the way that it \nwould have been looked at by the people who wrote it, there is a \nprocess to do something about that. That process was immediately used \nwhen the Bill of Rights was added to the Constitution and can still be \nused if people feel as though the Constitution no longer has the same \nmeaning as what the people who wrote\n\n[[Page S975]]\n\nit and voted on it thought it meant. Justice Scalia had the ability to \nbring that up in every argument and would sometimes argue against his \nown personal views. He argued for what the Constitution meant and what \nit was intended to mean. His opinions were well reasoned, logical, \neloquent, and often laced with both humor and maybe a little sarcasm, \nbut they were grounded with the idea that judges should interpret the \nConstitution the way it was written.\n  His contributions to the study of law left a profound mark on the \nlegal profession. Lawyers, particularly young lawyers in many cases, \ntalk about the law differently than they did before Justice Scalia \nbegan to argue his view of what the Constitution meant and what the \nCourt meant. He had a great legal mind.\n  He was fun to be with. I will personally miss the opportunity to talk \nto him about the books we were reading or books the other one should \nread or maybe books that the other one should avoid reading because of \nthe time required to read it. He had a broad sense of wanting to \nchallenge his own views and was able to challenge other people's views \nnot only in a positive way but in a way that he thought advanced the \nConstitution and what the Constitution meant to the country.\n  As I stand here today, I am sure many people all over America and the \npeople who the Scalias came into contact with are continuing to \nremember his family. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife \nMaureen, their nine children, and their literally dozens of \ngrandchildren. I am not sure if the number is 36 or 39, but it is an \nimpressive number.\n  Those who had a chance to see, be there, or read his son's eloquent \nhandling of the funeral service and the eulogy can clearly see the \ngreat legacy he and Maureen Scalia left to the country.\n  I am not a lawyer, which is often the most popular thing I say, so I \ndon't want to pretend to be a lawyer here talking about the law and the \nConstitution, but you don't really need to be a brilliant lawyer to \nunderstand the Constitution or understand what Justice Scalia was going \nto be.\n  I was a history teacher before I came here, and I know the Presiding \nOfficer was a university president. I was the first person in my family \nto graduate from college. I had unbelievable opportunities because of \nwhere we live.\n  We have the Constitution, and there is no magic as to the number of \nJustices that should be sitting on the Court at any given time. In \nfact, the Constitution doesn't even suggest what the number should be, \nand there have been different numbers over time. For some years now the \nnumber has been nine, but there have often not been nine Justices \nsitting. In the event of a recusal or some other reason that a Justice \nhas to leave, such as resigning to do something else, there has often \nnot been nine Justices. In fact, there have often been eight Justices. \nThere has often been a Court that could easily wind up in a 4-to-4 tie. \nIn fact, since World War II, the Court has had only 8 Justices 15 \ntimes.\n  Right after World War II and about a month after Harry Truman became \nPresident--when he was a Member of the Senate, he used the desk that I \nnow get to use--he asked Justice Robert Jackson to be the chief \nprosecutor at Nuremberg. Justice Jackson then went to Nuremberg, and \nfor the better part of a year and a half--from May of 1945 until \nOctober of 1946--he was not sitting on the Court and wasn't making \ndecisions on the Court. He was the chief prosecutor at the Nuremberg \ntrials.\n  A tie on the Court can do a lot of things. It can uphold a lower \ncourt decision. A tied Court can decide to rehear a case, which is also \nnot unusual in the history of the country. Again, you can be tied even \nif there are nine Justices and one of them, for whatever reason, \ndecides not to participate in that case. When that happens, the Court \ncan do a number of things and will.\n  This is an important decision, and it is a decision in the shadow of \nthe next election. We are 9 months and a few days away from people \ngetting a chance to vote, and a lifetime appointment on the Court is an \nimportant thing.\n  Justice Scalia was appointed by Ronald Reagan and served for three \ndecades. He served for a quarter of a century after Ronald Reagan left \nthe White House and for a decade after President Reagan died. This is \nsomething worth thinking about, and frankly at this moment in history \nand in other moments in history when a vacancy has occurred in an \nelection year, it has often been the case that the decision is that the \nAmerican people ought to have a say on who sits in that Supreme Court \nseat. That is what will happen this time, and I think it is the best \nthing to happen this time.\n  There is a lot at stake. The Court has had 5-to-4 votes on decision \nafter decision. What the Court does on the Second Amendment matters, \nand what the Court does on the First Amendment matters. The first \nfreedom in the First Amendment is freedom of religion. No other country \nwas ever founded on the principle that the right to pursue your \nconscience and the right to pursue your faith is a principal tenant of \nthe founding of this government. It was a principal tenet in the \nRevolution. More importantly, it was immediately added to the \nConstitution when there was some concern that maybe the Constitution \nwas not clear enough about this fundamental principle.\n\n  During a time when the Obama administration is suing the Little \nSisters of the Poor because the Little Sisters of the Poor doesn't want \ntheir health care plan to be a plan that includes things that are \ndifferent than their faith beliefs, freedom of religion is very \nimportant.\n  That is one of the cases before the Court right now. I don't know how \nthe Court will decide to determine it. I do know there is a reason we \nshould be concerned about freedom of religion, the right of conscience. \nPresident Jefferson, in writing to a church that asked him about \nindividual freedom, said to that church--I think it might have been \nlate in his administration, might have been an 1808 letter--of all the \nrights we have, right of conscience is the one we should hold most \ndear. The American people need to be thinking about that as they \ndetermine the next President, who is likely to not just fill this \nvacancy but likely to fill more than one vacancy during their time in \noffice.\n  Mrs. Clinton says if she is elected President, she will not appoint \nanybody to the Supreme Court who will not reverse the freedom of speech \ncase in Citizens United. Sounds to me as though the Presidential \ncandidates are willing to make the Court a major issue in this \ncampaign. Voters should have the right to make the Court a major issue \nin this campaign as well--freedom of religion, freedom of speech, the \nSecond Amendment, the Tenth Amendment that says anything the \nConstitution doesn't say the Federal Government is supposed to do is \nleft to the States. The closer you are to where a problem is, when \nsolving that problem, the more likely you are going to get a \ncommonsense solution. That is why that Tenth Amendment is there and why \nit needs to be vigorously adhered to.\n  These are important times. Anytime we have an election in the \ncountry, there is always a sense that this may be the most important \nelection we have ever had. They all are and particularly an election \nwhere the constitutional principles of government, where Executive \noverreach, where regulators who are unaccountable and out of control \nare one of the big concerns in America today. It is an important time \nto be thinking about the Supreme Court and an important time to be \nthinking about the responsibilities of citizens and the \nresponsibilities of the next President of the United States. This \nPresident has every constitutional right and obligation to nominate \nsomebody to a vacancy on the Supreme Court, but there is a second \nobligation in the Constitution; that is, the obligation of the Senate \nto confirm that nomination. I have a view that the answer to that \nquestion is not this person, not right now because we are too close to \nmaking a big decision about the future of the country to not include \nthis process of what happens to the Supreme Court in that process.\n  I wish the process of democracy well, the American people well as \nthey think about these things, and the Senate well as we do the other \nwork that the Constitution requires us to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S976]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I rise to address a topic under the \nbroad notion of the first three words of our Constitution: ``We the \nPeople.'' These are the most important three words because they set out \nthe theory, the strategy for our entire Constitution and what it is all \nabout, which is to ensure that we do not have government of, by, and \nfor the most affluent in our society; or government of, by, and for the \ntitans of commerce and industry; but instead a government of, by, and \nfor the people, the citizens. It is within the framework of this \nConstitution that we find many elements designed to preserve this ``we \nthe people'' purpose.\n  In recent years, in recent decades, we have had major attacks on the \ntheory of our Constitution, ``we the people.'' We had the Buckley v. \nValeo Supreme Court decision 40 years ago that said it is all right for \nthe most affluent citizens in our society to drown out the people in \nthe election process. We had Citizens United, which said the \nConstitution doesn't say ``we the people''; it says ``we the titans of \ncommerce and industry; we the corporations.'' So the Supreme Court has \nmade several decisions that have taken us far afield, and we see the \nresults of this. We see the impact of policies crafted by a legislature \nelected with fabulous sums of money from the people at the height of \nour society, the height of power and influence, of wealth and \nconnections.\n  Somehow, we have to reclaim our Constitution. In fact, this \nunderstanding is something that is way off base, is the foundation of \nthe frustration we see across our Nation. We see it reflected in the \nPresidential campaigns this year on the Democratic side and on the \nRepublican side. People know that something is wrong when over the last \nfour decades virtually all additional income in our economy has gone to \nthe top 10 percent. People understand that the middle class is being \nsqueezed and crushed. People are starting to see tent cities pop up in \ncities across our Nation because policies made here are no longer \ncrafted for ``we the people'' but instead for ``we the titans.''\n  Well, I am going to rise repeatedly to address this challenge that is \nat the core of who we are as a nation, the core of our Constitution. \nOur Constitution is being attacked continuously, and we the people must \nfight back to reclaim it.\n  The most recent attack has come from colleagues in this body who said \nthey don't want to honor the responsibilities that they took on when \nthey took the oath of office. One of those responsibilities is to give \nadvice and consent on nominations. Recently, we have the majority \nleader who said: I don't even want to talk to a nominee from the \nPresident, let alone take my responsibilities under the Constitution \nseriously to give advice and consent.\n  So I thought it might be useful to go back and think a little bit \nabout this advice-and-consent power and how it came to be, what it \nmeant, and what it means for us to honor our responsibility today as \nMembers of the U.S. Senate.\n  In those days in which the Founders were crafting the Constitution, \nthey had a couple of different theories about how they might possibly \ncreate this power, and some said it should go solely to the Executive, \nsolely to the President. Others said that is too much power to \nconcentrate in single hands, that it should go to the body of a \nlegislature, it should go to an assembly.\n  Some decades after our Constitution was signed, they had a Federalist \nPaper written by Alexander Hamilton that laid out this discussion. He \nnoted--and I am going to quote at some length here--that the argument \nfor the Executive is as follows:\n\n       The sole and undivided responsibility of one man will \n     naturally beget a livelier sense of duty and a more exact \n     regard to reputation. He will, on this account, feel himself \n     under stronger obligations, and more interested to \n     investigate with care the qualities requisite to the stations \n     to be filled, and to prefer with impartiality the persons who \n     may have the fairest pretensions to them.\n\n  So that was the argument for the President to exercise these powers.\n  In addition, there was discussion of the weaknesses of an assembly, a \nbody like the U.S. Senate having that responsibility all to itself. \nAgain, I will quote Alexander Hamilton:\n\n       Hence, in every exercise of the power of appointing to \n     offices, by an assembly of men, we must expect to see a full \n     display of all the private and party likings and dislikes, \n     partialities and antipathies, attachments and animosities, \n     which are felt by those who compose the assembly. The choice \n     which may at any time happen to be made under such \n     circumstances, will of course be the result either of a \n     victory gained by one party over the other, or of a \n     compromise between the parties. In either case, the intrinsic \n     merit of the candidate will be too often out of sight.\n\n  So thus the argument for the Executive over the assembly to have \nthese appointing powers. But there was a concern, and that was, what if \nthe Executive, the President, goes off track? Wouldn't it be useful to \nhave a check on nominations when the Executive goes off track? So \nHamilton explained why this check on the President's nomination power \nwas placed into the Constitution.\n  Once more I quote:\n\n       To what purpose then require the co-operation of the \n     Senate? I answer, that the necessity of their concurrence \n     would have a powerful, though, in general, a silent \n     operation. It would be an excellent check upon a spirit of \n     favoritism in the President, and would tend greatly to \n     prevent the appointment of unfit characters from State \n     prejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment, \n     or from a view to popularity. In addition to this, it would \n     be an efficacious source of stability in the administration.\n\n  He goes on to note that the body would be expected to approve most \nnominations, except when there are special and strong reasons for the \nrefusal.\n  So that is our job. That is how it is laid out, that we are to make \nsure the power the President has is not exercised in a way that results \nin unfit characters being appointed. Thus, this mutual system that took \nthe strengths of the assembly as a check--that is, of the Senate--and \nthe strength of the President in terms of accountability was combined. \nAnd Hamilton notes: ``It is not easy to conceive a plan better \ncalculated than this to promote a judicious choice of men for filling \nthe offices of the Union.''\n  So that is where we fit in. That is our role. We are to make sure \nthat a nomination--an individual has the preparation, the \nqualifications, the character, if you will, to fill an office \neffectively. Hamilton points out in his conversation that just the fact \nthat the Senate will be reviewing the nominations will serve as a check \nfor, if you will, off-track nominations, inappropriate nominations.\n  During the time I have had a chance to be connected to the Senate--\nand that now spans four decades; it was 1976 when I came here as an \nintern for Senator Hatfield--I have seen this body operate as \nenvisioned in the Constitution. I saw this body operate as a simple \nmajority, with rare exception. The use of the filibuster was not used \nto paralyze, and the power of confirmation--of advice and consent of \nthe Constitution--was not used to systematically undermine the \nPresident because he simply happened to be of a different party. It was \nnot used to undermine the judiciary by keeping judicial vacancies open. \nIndeed, when this body starts to operate in that fashion--as it has \nbeen during the time I have been here as a Senator, seeing across the \naisle the effort to systematically change the makeup of the core by \nundermining the responsibility to give advice and consent--then we \ndeeply polarize and undermine this important institution that is our \njudiciary.\n  I must say, even though I have seen for years the effort to really \nharness some gain through the strategy of undermining the ability of \nthe President to appoint, I never thought it would come to this.\n  Article 2, section 2, declares that ``the President, with the advice \nand consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public \nMinisters and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other \nOfficers of the United States.''\n\n[[Page S977]]\n\n  It is a responsibility of the President to nominate. It is a \nresponsibility of the Members of this body to give advice and consent \non that nomination. Yet here we are today with the majority of this \nbody saying we do not take seriously our responsibility under the \nConstitution to give advice and consent.\n  We have seen the process of really slowing--slow-walking nominations, \nbut this is on a different scale of magnitude.\n  It is our responsibility to have a committee vet the nominees, our \nresponsibility to have a floor debate on the floor, our responsibility \nto have a vote, and that certainly is a way the Senate has operated \ndecade after decade, century after century.\n  I just have to ask each of my colleagues across the aisle, do you \nfind in this beautiful Constitution any phrase that says the President \nshall nominate but only in the first 3 of the 4 years he or she is in \noffice? Can you find that in the Constitution? Can you truly raise your \nhead and say you are doing your responsibility when you say: I only \nwant to exercise my constitutional responsibility of advice and consent \n3 out of every 4 years, and then I will take a year off. I think if you \nread the Constitution you will find that is not what it says, and the \nAmerican people know this. They know the Supreme Court is very \nimportant to calling the balls and strikes when actions or laws move \ninto areas that are out of bounds. That is what the Supreme Court does. \nIt makes sure our structure of laws and regulations stay within the \nbounds of the rights and rules of our Constitution.\n  This is a critical part of the construction of American democracy. \nThe Supreme Court serves as a check on the overreach of the President, \nthe overreach of this body, and the overreach of its regulators. It \ncannot do its job if it does not have a full set of members.\n  Not since the Civil War has the Supreme Court been left with a \nvacancy for more than a year, and of course the Civil War was a very \nunusual situation. Since the 1980s, every person appointed to the \nSupreme Court has been given a hearing and a vote within 100 days. \nSince 1975, on average, it has taken 2 months to confirm Supreme Court \nnominees.\n  Despite what some of my colleagues claim, the President's duty to \nmake nominations to the Supreme Court does not disappear during a \nPresidential election year. Our responsibility to do advice and consent \ndoes not disappear in a Presidential year. Let's look to history. More \nthan a dozen Supreme Court Justices have been confirmed in the final \nyear of a Presidency. More recently, Justice Kennedy, who is still on \nthe bench, was confirmed in the last year of President Reagan's final \nterm. That was done by a Senate led by the opposite party. It was a \nDemocratically controlled Senate that honored its responsibility to \ngive advice and consent.\n  The American people spoke overwhelmingly when they reelected \nPresident Obama in 2012 to a 4-year term. They expect him to fulfill \nhis duties for a full 4 years. They expect us to do our duties under \nthe Constitution. The current campaign events do not stop the \nresponsibilities of the U.S. Senate. For the last 200 years, the Senate \nhas carried out its duty to give a fair and timely hearing and a floor \nvote to the President's Supreme Court nominees. Let us not change that \nposition today, this week or this year. Let's not only honor the \ntradition, let's honor the constitutional responsibility.\n  I note it is not only the Supreme Court we have to worry about. Last \nyear the Senate confirmed just 11 Federal judges, the fewest in any \nyear since 1960--in the last 56 years. Only one Court of Appeals judge \nwas confirmed, the lowest in any given year since 1953. The number of \njudicial emergencies, where there are not enough judges confirmed to do \nthe workload, has nearly tripled over the past year, from 12 in January \n2015 to 31 judicial emergencies today.\n  The obstruction is not limited simply to the judicial branch. The \nabuse of advice and consent or disregard for the responsibility extends \nto the executive branch. When we elect a President, the President is \nnot a President of the party, he or she is the President of a nation. \nWhether you are a Democrat or Republican, the President is our \nPresident. Systematically using party politics to undermine the \nindividual because they were elected from the opposite party diminishes \nthe individuals who serve in this body, it diminishes the stature of \nthis institution, and it diminishes the function of our Nation so \ncarefully crafted in our Constitution.\n  Let's ponder the path forward this year. Let's not diminish this \ninstitution by forsaking our responsibility. Let's not politically \npolarize the Court that is so essential to making sure our laws and \nregulations and attitudes stay within the bounds of the Constitution. \nLet's instead restore this institution. Let's restore the Senate. Let \nit be at least as healthy as it was when we were youngsters serving \nhere as interns, coming to DC for the first time or simply reading \nabout it in a book back home.\n  Let's restore the effectiveness of our judiciary. When we have \njudicial emergencies, we have justice delayed, and justice delayed is \njustice denied, and that does not honor the vision of the role of \njustice in the United States of America.\n  So I call on my colleagues to end this obstruction that diminishes \nyour service, diminishes this institution, and damages our Nation. In \nshort, do your jobs. Work together as 100 Senators for the future of \nour Nation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/senate-section/article/S977-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S977-S985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to address the recent \nvacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court and to urge my colleagues to grant \nswift consideration of the President's eventual nominee.\n  Make no mistake, the passing of Justice Antonin Scalia came as a \ngreat shock. Although Justice Scalia and I did not share a common view \nof the Constitution or of the country, I recognized that he was a man \nof great conviction and, it should be said, a man of great humor. My \nthoughts and prayers are with his family, his friends, his clerks, and \nhis colleagues. But we must now devote ourselves to the task of helping \nto select his successor.\n  The Constitution--so beloved by Justice Scalia--provides that the \nPresident ``shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of \nthe Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges of the supreme Court.''\n  Let us all remember that each and every Senator serving in this body \nswore an oath to support and defend that same Constitution. It is our \nduty to move forward. We must fulfill our constitutional obligation to \nensure that the highest Court in the land has a full complement of \nJustices. Unfortunately, it would seem that some of my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle do not agree, and they wasted no time in \nmaking known their objections.\n  Less than an hour after the news of Justice Scalia's death became \npublic, the majority leader announced that the Senate would not take up \nthe business of considering a replacement until after the Presidential \nelections. ``The American people should have a voice in the selection \nof their next Supreme Court justice,'' he said.\n  The only problem with the majority leader's reasoning is that the \nAmerican people have spoken. Twice. President Barack Obama was elected \nand then reelected by a solid majority of the American people, who \ncorrectly understood that elections have consequences, not the least of \nwhich is that when a vacancy occurs, the President of the United States \nhas the constitutional responsibility to appoint a Justice to the \nSupreme Court. The Constitution does not set a time limit on the \nPresident's ability to fulfill this duty, nor, by my reading, does the \nConstitution set a date after which the President is no longer able to \nfulfill his\n\n[[Page S978]]\n\nduties as Commander in Chief or to exercise his authority to, say, \ngrant pardons or make treaties. It merely states that the President \nshall hold office for a term of 4 years, and by my count, there are in \nthe neighborhood of 11 months left.\n  If we were truly to subscribe to the majority leader's logic and \nextend it to the legislative branch, it would yield an absurd result. \nSenators would become ineffective in the last year of their terms. The \n28 Senators who are now in the midst of their reelection campaigns and \nthe 6 Senators who are stepping down should be precluded from casting \nvotes in committee or on the Senate floor. Ten committee chairs and 19 \nsubcommittee chairs should pass the gavel to a colleague who is not \ncurrently running for reelection or preparing for retirement. Bill \nintroduction and indeed the cosponsorship of bills should be limited to \nthose Senators who are not yet serving in the sixth year of their \nterms. If the majority leader sincerely believes the only way to ensure \nthat the voice of the American people is heard is to lop off the last \nyear of an elected official's term, I trust he will make these changes, \nbut I suspect he does not. Rather, it seems to me that the majority \nleader believes the term of just one elected official in particular \nshould be cut short, which begs the question, just how should it be \ncut? As I said, by my count, approximately 11 months remains in Barack \nObama's Presidency. Now, 11 months is a considerable amount of time. It \nis sizeable. It has heft, but I wouldn't call it vast.\n  Then again, there is a certain arbitrariness to settling on 11 \nmonths. After all, it is just shy of a full year. Perhaps, in order to \nsimplify matters, an entire year would be proper or maybe just 6 \nmonths, half a year. It is a difficult decision. If only the American \npeople had a voice in selecting precisely how much time we should shave \noff the President's term.\n  Of course, now that I mention it, there is a way to give the American \npeople a voice in this decision. The majority leader could propose a \nconstitutional amendment. It would, of course, have to pass both Houses \nof Congress with a two-thirds majority, but that is not an \ninsurmountable obstacle. Provided it clears Congress, the amendment \nwould then bypass the President--which, in this case, would be very \napt--and be sent to the States for their ratification. So if the \nmajority leader truly wants the voters to decide how best to proceed, \nour founding document provides a way forward.\n  Suggesting that the Senate should refuse to consider a nominee during \nan election year stands as a cynical affront to our constitutional \nsystem, and it misrepresents our history. The Senate has a long \ntradition of working to confirm Supreme Court Justices in election \nyears. One need look no further than sitting Associate Justice Anthony \nKennedy, a Supreme Court nominee appointed by a Republican President \nand confirmed by a Democratic Senate in 1988--President Reagan's last \nyear in office--during an election year. So when I hear one of my \ncolleagues say ``It's been standard practice over the last 80 years to \nnot confirm Supreme Court nominees during a presidential election \nyear,'' I know that is not true.\n  I am not the only one who knows that is not true. The fact-checking \npublication PolitiFact recently observed that ``[s]hould Republican \nlawmakers refuse to begin the process of confirming a . . . nomination, \nit would be the first time in modern history.'' SCOTUSblog, an \nindisputable authority on all matters related to the Court, confirmed \nthat the ``historical record does not reveal any instances [in over a \ncentury] of the . . . Senate failing to confirm a nominee in a \npresidential year because of the impending election.''\n  The fact is that there is a bipartisan tradition--a bipartisan \ntradition--of giving full and fair consideration to Supreme Court \nnominees. Since the Judiciary Committee began to hold hearings in 1916, \nevery pending Supreme Court nominee, save nine, has received a hearing. \nAnd what happened to those nine nominees? They were confirmed within 11 \ndays of being nominated.\n  In 2001, during the first administration of President George W. Bush, \nthen-Judiciary Committee Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Hatch sent a \nletter to their Senate colleagues making clear that the committee would \ncontinue its longstanding, bipartisan practice of moving pending \nSupreme Court nominees to the full Senate, even when the nominees were \nopposed by a majority of the committee, but, regrettably, my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle are leaving that long tradition behind.\n  Yesterday, every Republican member of the Senate Judiciary Committee \nsent a letter to the majority leader vowing to deny a hearing to the \nPresident's eventual nominee. ``This committee,'' they wrote, ``will \nnot hold hearings on any Supreme Court nominee until after our next \nPresident is sworn in on January 20th, 2017.'' This marks a historic \ndereliction of the Senate's duty and a radical departure not just from \nthe committee's past traditions but from its current practices.\n  I know that my good friend Chairman Grassley cares a great deal about \nmaintaining the legacy of the Judiciary Committee and the propriety of \nits proceedings. Under his leadership, we have seen the committee put \ncountry before party and move consensus, bipartisan proposals. I had \nhoped Chairman Grassley would approach the task of confirming our next \nSupreme Court Justice with the same sense of fairness and integrity. I \nstill hope that. But I was very disappointed to learn that yesterday \nChairman Grassley gathered only Republican committee members in a \nprivate meeting where they unilaterally decided behind closed doors to \nrefuse consideration of a nominee. The decision to foreclose even \nholding a hearing for a nominee to our Nation's highest Court is \nshameful, and I suspect the American people share that view.\n  The Supreme Court is a central pillar of our democracy. The women and \nmen who sit on that bench make decisions that touch the lives of every \nsingle American, regardless of party or political persuasion. Now the \nSenate must do the same. We must honor our solemn duty to uphold the \nConstitution and to ensure that Americans seeking justice are able to \nhave their day in court before a full bench of nine Justices.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the impulse to put politics before our \nsworn duty to uphold the Constitution.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor to my colleague \nfrom Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was an \nextraordinary man whose contributions to this country and the American \npeople, whom he faithfully served from the bench, are so prodigious \nthat it will take generations for us to fully comprehend our debt of \ngreat gratitude to him. His untimely, recent death is a tragedy, and \nhis legacy is a blessing to friends of freedom throughout this country \nand everywhere.\n  Justice Scalia was a learned student of history and a man who \nrelished, perhaps more than any other, a spirited, lively debate, so it \nis fitting that his passing has sparked a conversation in America, a \nspirited conversation about the constitutional powers governing the \nappointment of Supreme Court Justices and the historical record of \nSupreme Court vacancies that happen to open up during a Presidential \nelection year.\n  This debate gives the American people and their elected \nrepresentatives in the Senate a unique opportunity to discuss our \nNation's founding charter and history at a time when our collective \nchoices have very real consequences, so it is important that this \ndebate proceed with candor, mutual respect, and deference to the facts. \nIn that spirit, I wish to address and correct a few of the most \npernicious errors, inaccuracies, fallacies, and fabrications we have \nheard from some of the loudest voices in this debate over the last few \ndays.\n  From the outset, I have maintained that the Senate should withhold \nits consent of a Supreme Court nomination to fulfill Justice Scalia's \nseat and wait to hold any hearings on a Supreme Court nominee until the \nnext President, whether it is a Republican or a Democrat, is elected \nand sworn in. This position is shared by all of my Republican \ncolleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee, consistent with the \nSenate's powers in the appointment of Federal judges and supported by \nhistorical precedent.\n\n[[Page S979]]\n\n  In response, some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and \nmany in the media have resorted to all manner of counterarguments, \nranging from the historically and constitutionally inaccurate to the \nabsurd, and in many cases, the claims made by some of my colleagues \ntoday flatly contradict their own statements from the past.\n  I believe the plain meaning of the Constitution and the historical \nrecord are sufficiently clear to stand on their own as evidence that \nthere is absolutely nothing unprecedented and absolutely nothing \nimproper about the Senate choosing to withhold its consent of a \nPresident's nominee to the Supreme Court, so I would like to focus on \none particular allegation offered by some of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle.\n  With the letter and the spirit of the Constitution, as well as their \nown words standing against them, many have turned to fearmongering in a \nlast-ditch effort to win the debate. They claim that leaving Justice \nScalia's seat vacant until the next President nominates a replacement \nwould somehow inflict a profound institutional injury on the Supreme \nCourt by disrupting the resolution of this term's cases before the \nCourt, a term including important cases on abortion, immigration, \nreligious liberty, and mandatory union dues, among others, ensnaring \nthe Court in endless gridlock with an evenly split eight Justices on \nthe bench and leaving it short-staffed for an unprecedented and \npotentially prolonged period. Here, the doomsayers are on weak ground, \nindeed. Let's look at each of these claims in turn.\n  First, is it true--as many have claimed--that the business of the \nSupreme Court will be obstructed or otherwise disrupted if the Senate \nwithholds its consent of President Obama's nominee? Absolutely not.\n  In recent history--in fact, since the nomination of Justice Scalia to \nthe Supreme Court in 1986--it has taken more than 70 days on average \nfor the Senate to confirm or reject a nominee after that nominee has \nbeen formally submitted by the President to the Senate for its advice \nand consent--more than 70 days on average. In many cases, it has taken \nfar longer for the Senate to grant or withhold its consent. It took \nthis body 108 days to reject Judge Robert Bork and 99 days to confirm \nJustice Clarence Thomas.\n  Presuming the modern historic average would hold true for any future \nnominee, even if President Obama were to announce and refer a nominee \nto the Senate today for our advice and consent, the process would carry \nthrough until at least early May. But, significantly, the Supreme Court \nstops hearing cases in April, which means that even if President Obama \nwere to announce a nominee today, right now, and even if the Senate \nwere to confirm that nominee in a period of time consistent with \nhistorical standards, that individual would not be seated in time to \nhear and rule upon any of the cases that are currently on the Court's \ndocket or any of the cases that are before the Court in this term. In \nother words, it would be historically anomalous for any of the cases \ncurrently pending before the Court to be decided this term by a nine-\nmember Supreme Court no matter what the Senate chooses to do regarding \nany future nominee.\n  Let's put this in perspective. In this scenario--a scenario endorsed \nby Senate Democrats--it is highly unlikely that the nominee to fill \nJustice Scalia's seat would hear oral arguments until the beginning of \nOctober, literally just a few weeks before the Presidential election. \nThis proves that the main argument made by President Obama and his \nallies is based on a myth. In their telling, the Senate's choice to \nwithhold consent of a nominee would deny President Obama a Supreme \nCourt Justice who will serve during his final year in the White House, \nbut in reality, it is unlikely that the President's nominee will join \nthe Supreme Court until the country is just weeks away from choosing \nPresident Obama's replacement. I think most Americans recognize the \nproblem of a President having the ability to reshape the Supreme Court \nin his image on his way out of office, and that is exactly why the \nSenate is choosing to withhold its consent in this case. This is the \nright course not because of anything the Senate does or does not do and \nnot because of anything the President does or does not do, it is simply \na function of the unfortunate timing of Justice Scalia's death. Claims \nto the contrary are flatly contradicted by an empirical analysis of the \nCourt's history.\n  Second, the Senate's decision to withhold consent will not lead to an \nintractable impasse or hopeless gridlock, even if the eventual \nappointee were to miss the entirety of the next term, which starts in \nOctober of 2016 and runs until the end of June 2017.\n  In each of its previous 5 terms, the current Court has decided only \n16 cases on average--or 23 percent of its caseload--by a 5-to-4 \nmajority, and Justice Scalia was 1 of the 5 Justices in the majority in \nthose 5-to-4 cases only about half of the time on average. That means \nthat the vacancy left by Justice Scalia would result in about eight \ncases out of dozens being decided by a 4-to-4 split. In fact, in the \nlast term served by Justice Scalia, the last complete term, he was in \nthe majority in only six of those 5-to-4 cases, and in the year before \nthat, the preceding term, Justice Scalia's second to last term, he was \nin the majority in only five of the cases decided by a 5-to-4 majority. \nWhat does this mean? Well, it means that it is likely that the effect \nof his absence on the final vote and ultimate disposition of cases will \nbe lower than even the average suggests. Instead of eight cases being \ndecided by a 4-to-4 split in Justice Scalia's absence, it is likely to \nbe closer to five or six, as it has been in the last two full terms of \nJustice Scalia's service on the Court.\n  Let's not forget what should be obvious: The sky does not fall when a \n4-to-4 split occurs on the Supreme Court; rather, the decision of the \nlower court is left standing. And if there is the prospect of a 4-to-4 \nsplit on a particularly salient matter, the Court always has the option \nof scheduling or rescheduling the hearing for a later time when the \nCourt will have all nine Justices presiding and hearing the case.\n  Finally, a vacancy on the Court lasting through the Presidential \nelection season will have no greater effect on the Court's ability to \ndecide cases than any number of instances in the past where the Court \nhas had to decide matters with eight Justices or even fewer.\n  As recently as the Court's 2010-to-2011 term, the Court had to decide \nover 30 cases with eight or fewer Justices, almost entirely as a result \nof recusals arising from Justice Kagan's nomination.\n  Likewise, following the retirement of Justice Powell in 1987, the \nCourt had to act on 80 cases with 8 or fewer justices. This was a \nresult of Democratic opposition to Judge Bork and the eventual late-\nFebruary confirmation of Anthony Kennedy, coupled with dozens of \nrecusals by Kennedy and other Justices later in that term.\n  In the October term of 1945, the Court functioned as an eight-member \nbody while Justice Robert Jackson was serving as a prosecutor in \nNuremberg, acting on a full term's caseload without him. Tellingly, \nwhen Justice Jackson expressed concern about missing so many cases and \nactually considered returning early for that reason, Justice Felix \nFrankfurter wrote to encourage Justice Jackson to stay on as a \nprosecutor, stating that his absence was not ``sacrificing a single \ninterest of importance.'' Compared to today, the Court had a larger \nworkload and issued many more opinions during that term in which \nJustice Jackson was absent. This suggests that a vacancy of a similar \nduration as Jackson's full-term sabbatical would be even less damaging \nto the Court's functioning than the absence of Justice Jackson--an \nabsence that, to reiterate, did not sacrifice ``a single interest of \nimportance.''\n  The next President's future nominee is unlikely to miss as many cases \nas Justices Kennedy or Jackson missed.\n  These are the facts, Mr. President. They can't be ignored nor can \nthey be wished away. If we are going to have a serious, honest debate \nabout the vacancy left by Justice Scalia's tragic passing, we must \nproceed on the basis of these facts.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, since the beginning of our Nation, the \nU.S. Senate has maintained an important bipartisan tradition of giving \nfair consideration to Supreme Court nominees.\n\n[[Page S980]]\n\nArticle II, section 2 of the Constitution is unambiguous about the \nrespective duties and responsibilities of the President and the Senate \nwhen there is a Supreme Court vacancy. The Founders did not intend \nthese roles to be optional or something to be disregarded. Article II \nalso states that the President shall hold his office during the term of \n4 years, not 3 years or 3 years and 1 month, but 4 full years.\n  The Constitution plainly says that it is the President's duty to \nnominate a Supreme Court Justice and it is the Senate's duty to provide \nadvice and consent on that nomination. Throughout our history, Senators \nhave done their constitutional duty by considering and confirming \nSupreme Court Justices in the final year of a Presidency. In fact, the \nSenate has done that 14 times, most recently in 1988, when the Senate \nconfirmed Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was President Reagan's nominee \nto the Supreme Court. He sent that nomination over to the Democratic \nmajority in this body. Almost 28 years ago exactly to the day in \nFebruary of 1988, the Democratic majority in the Senate confirmed \nRepublican President Ronald Reagan's judicial nomination, Anthony \nKennedy, unanimously 97-0. They didn't debate whether it was a \nPresidential year and whether they could act. It was in the middle of a \nhard-fought election. It was not at all clear what the outcome of that \nelection was going to be.\n  Since 1975, the average length of time from nomination to a \nconfirmation vote for the Supreme Court--that is the average length of \ntime; sometimes it has taken longer and sometimes it has been shorter--\nbut since 1975, the average length of time has been 67 days because our \npredecessors in the Senate recognized how important it is for the \nSupreme Court to be fully functioning.\n  Unfortunately, this week we are seeing this bipartisan tradition \nregarding the Court being put at risk. Yesterday we heard the majority \nleader say that if the President nominates a person to the Supreme \nCourt--any person, no matter how superbly qualified--there will be no \nhearings and no vote. We even heard some Senators say they would refuse \nto meet with any potential nominee. I think that is very unfortunate.\n  It is unfortunate for a number of reasons, probably first and \nforemost because the people of the United States expect us to work \ntogether here in Washington to do the job of the country--to do the \njobs we were elected to do--and because the current President's term \nends in January of 2017. That is more than 300 days from now. During \nthat time, the Supreme Court will hear many important cases, but if the \nmajority in the Senate has their way, the Court will do so without a \nfull roster of Justices.\n  As Brianne Gorod of the Constitution Accountability Center has said, \nand I quote:\n  The consequences of the Supreme Court being without all nine justices \nfor so long can hardly be overstated. Most significant, a long-standing \nvacancy would compromise the Court's ability to perform one of its most \nimportant functions, that is, establishing a uniform rule of law for \nthe entire country.\n  Every Senator here has sworn to support and defend the Constitution--\nfull stop. That is the oath we have taken. Our oath doesn't say to \nuphold the Constitution most of the time or only when it is not a \nPresidential election year or only when it is convenient for us or only \nwhen we like the ideology that is being presented to us. Our oath says \nto uphold and defend the Constitution every day, no matter what the \nissue is that comes before us. The American people expect us as \nSenators to be faithful to our oath. They also expect us to do our jobs \nregardless of whether it is a Presidential election year.\n  I believe we should respect our oath of office. I believe we should \ndo the job we were sent here to do by the American people. I believe we \nshould follow the Constitution. As former Justice Sandra Day O'Connor \nsaid last week, and I quote again, ``I think we need somebody [on the \nSupreme Court] now to do the job, and let's get on with it.''\n  I say, let's get on with it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I join the Nation in offering my heartfelt \ncondolences to the family and friends of Justice Scalia, who was an \nAssociate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. For more than three \ndecades, Justice Scalia devoted himself to the rule of law and public \nservice at the highest levels. Whether you agreed or disagreed with his \ndecisions, there is no debate about Justice Scalia's profound impact on \nthe Supreme Court. He served his country with great honor.\n  I was privileged to serve as a member of the Judiciary Committee when \nI first joined the Senate. I participated in confirmation hearings for \njudicial nominees for both President Bush and President Obama, \nincluding the hearings for Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.\n  The Constitution spells out quite clearly what happens when a vacancy \noccurs on the Supreme Court. Article II, section 2, of the Constitution \nstates that the President ``shall nominate, and by and with the Advice \nand Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges of the supreme \nCourt.''\n  The American people twice elected President Obama to 4-year terms in \noffice. Their voices have been heard very clearly. Elections have \nconsequences, and President Obama must carry out the constitutional \nresponsibilities and duties of his office by nominating a successor for \nJustice Scalia. The President is simply doing the job that the American \npeople elected him to do. The President doesn't stop working simply \nbecause it is an election year. He has more than 300 days left in \noffice, as do the Senators who will face the voters this November. \nCongress should not stop working, either, in this election year and \nshould earn their full paycheck.\n  So my message is clear. Do your job. It is our responsibility to take \nup the nominations the President will submit to us. And I think the \nAmerican people will ultimately demand that the Senate do its job and \nnot threaten to stop working simply to coddle and pander to the most \nextreme fringe elements of its base, as was done when the government \nshut down a few years ago with the flirtation of a default on the full \nfaith and credit of the U.S. Government.\n  Just as the President is carrying out his constitutional duties, so \nshould the Senate. My colleagues in the Senate took an oath to support \nthe Constitution. It is only February, leaving the Senate plenty of \ntime before the elections to consider a nomination that President Obama \nwill make in the coming weeks.\n  I find it disgraceful that my Republican colleagues would try to \nobstruct the nomination before the nominee has even been named. Our job \nas Senators is to examine the qualifications of the nominee for the \nposition. The Senate should get to work once President Obama makes his \nnomination, in a process that usually takes around two months.\n  If you look over the history of nominations that have been made by a \nPresident on Supreme Court nominees in the amount of time the Senate \nhas considered those nominations, the average is 2 to 3 months. Let me \nremind you, we have almost a year left in this term of Congress. There \nis plenty of time. The Senate Judiciary Committee has historically \nreported nominees to the floor even if the nominee did not garner a \nmajority vote in the committee. And then let the Senate work its will \nto either confirm or reject the President's nominee.\n  The tradition of the Senate is to allow each Senator to vote yea or \nnay on a nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States. That has \nbeen the tradition of the Senate. Of course, every Senator has the \nright to vote no. Senators were elected for 6-year terms by the \ncitizens of their State and have the right and obligation to vote. \nPresident Obama was elected by the people of the United States for a 4-\nyear term and has the right and obligation to nominate.\n  History has shown that when the roles were reversed and the Democrats \nheld the majority in the Senate, Supreme Court and judicial nominees \nfor\n\n[[Page S981]]\n\nRepublican Presidents were given hearings and up-and-down votes \nregardless of when the vacancy occurred. Justice Kennedy was confirmed \nto the Supreme Court in the last year of President Ronald Reagan's \nfinal term in 1988. Other examples of Presidential election-year \nconfirmations include Justice Murphy in 1940, Justice Cardozo in 1932, \nand Justice Brandeis in 1916. And the Democratic-controlled Senate \nconfirmed numerous judicial nominees of President George W. Bush \nthroughout his final year in office, including nearly a dozen judges in \nSeptember 2008, just weeks before the election of President Obama.\n  While I might have picked different judges as a Senator, I voted to \nconfirm the vast majority of President Bush's judicial nominations in \nhis final year in office. I will continue to carry out my \nconstitutional responsibilities that I undertook when I became Senator \nand swore to support the Constitution. In my view, Justice Scalia would \nexpect nothing less than for the President and the Congress to follow \nthe letter and spirit of the Constitution, our Nation's most \nfundamental legal document. Justice Scalia wrote a 2004 opinion about \nthe importance of having all nine Justices on the Supreme Court. He \nstated that without a full complement of Justices, the Court--I am \nquoting from Justice Scalia--``will find itself unable to resolve the \nsignificant legal issues'' in pending cases and that a vacancy \n``impairs the functioning of the Court.''\n\n  Justice Scalia understood the importance to have nine Supreme Court \nJustices. Are we really going to allow there to be a vacancy for that \nninth seat for a year?\n  Former Justice Rehnquist, when he was an Associate Justice of the \nSupreme Court in 1972, wrote that the prospect of affirming lower court \njudgments by an equally divided court was ``undesirable'' because ``the \nprinciple of law presented by [each] case is left unsettled.'' When \nthere is a circuit split, Justice Rehnquist continued, ``the prospect \nof affirmance by an equally divided Court, unsatisfactory enough in a \nsingle case, presents even more serious problems where companion cases \nreaching opposite results are heard together here. . . . [A]ffirmance \nof each of such conflicting results by an equally divided Court would \nlay down `one rule in Athens, and another rule in Rome' with a \nvengeance.''\n  What Justice Rehnquist was saying is when we have different appellate \ncourt decisions--one circuit ruling one way and another circuit ruling \nanother way--they come to the Supreme Court, we have conflicting \ninterpretations, and we have the Supreme Court of the United States to \nresolve that difference.\n  What happens if there is a 4-to-4 vote? We have different rules in \nthe Fourth Circuit than in the Third Circuit. That is why we have a \nSupreme Court. And for a year-plus we are going to say we are not going \nto allow the full complement to be there?\n  I am also privileged to serve as the ranking member of the Senate \nCommittee on Foreign Relations and the ranking member and former chair \nof the Helsinki Commission. I must tell my colleagues, as I meet with \nheads of foreign governments, parliamentarians and judges overseas, I \nfeel great pride in that America has created independent judges where a \nneutral fact-finder decides the case based on the law and the facts and \ncannot be fired for making a decision that offends the government or \nthe politically powerful. I really do believe the Supreme Court and \nFederal judiciary are some of the crown jewels of our American system \nof government and the envy of the world. That is why I am so disgusted \nand disappointed today with the majority's attempt to abdicate their \nresponsibilities as Senators and as Americans by not doing their job \nand simply obstructing the operation of good governance for partisan \npolitical purposes. I say that because the Republican members of the \nJudiciary Committee have written a letter saying they are not even \ngoing to take up this nomination. There will not even be any hearings.\n  Do your job. Our job is to consider a nomination that is submitted by \nthe President.\n  What the Republicans are effectively trying to do is to temporarily \nshrink the Supreme Court from nine to eight Justices and shorten the \nterm of the President from 4 years to 3 years. That is not in the \nConstitution. This is disgraceful and indefensible. Frankly, it reminds \nme of the arguments Republicans used in 2013 when they accused \nPresident Obama of trying to pack the court when they announced they \nwould not support further nominees to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit. No, President Obama was not trying to \npack the court by changing the number of seats on the court. He was \nmerely nominating individuals to existing vacancies on the court that \nwere authorized by Congress by an enacted statute. That is the \nPresident's responsibility.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that Congress has the authority to pass a \nstatute that is signed into law by the President or by overriding his \nveto. What Congress cannot and the Senate should not do is purport to \nshrink the size of the court, be it the Supreme Court or district court \nor circuit court, by simply refusing to even consider a nominee until \nthe next President takes office.\n  If this decision by the Republicans is allowed to stand, it would \ncreate an artificial vacancy for over a full year, spanning two terms \nof the Court, which would be unprecedented since the Civil War. We \nrecall that after the last century, Supreme Court nominees have \nreceived timely hearings and considerations by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and the full Senate.\n  It matters if the Supreme Court is not fully operational and \ngridlocks in 4-to-4 ties. Under that scenario, the division of the \nlower court stands, even when there is a split among the circuits where \nonly the Supreme Court could and should clarify the law. This will lead \nto more uncertainty, litigation, wasted time and resources, and \nultimately delay and deny justice for the American people.\n  It would be a great tragedy--and potentially do long-term damage to \nthe Supreme Court and the independent judiciary--if the Republican \nstrategy of delay and obstruction prevails. I urge my colleagues: Do \nyour job. Do your job. When the President submits the nomination for \nthe Supreme Court vacancy created by the death of Justice Scalia, \nschedule a timely hearing and establish a reasonable schedule for the \nSenate and each of its 100 Members to vote yea or nay on the person the \nPresident submits as a nominee for the Supreme Court. That is our \nresponsibility. We need to do our job.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, former Chief Justice Warren Burger once \nexplained the historical significance of the U.S. Constitution as \nfollows. He wrote that ``in the last quarter of the 18th century, no \nnation in the world was governed with separated and divided powers \nproviding checks and balances on the exercise of authority by those who \ngoverned.''\n  The Chief Justice went on to call the Constitution ``a remarkable \ndocument--the first of its kind in all of human history.''\n  Chief Justice Burger was right. The Constitution is remarkable, and \nit is remarkable not only for what it says but how it says it.\n  In some places the Constitution speaks in poetry, like the Preamble \nthat begins with ``We the People of the United States,'' and talks of \n``a more perfect Union'' and ``the Blessings of Liberty.''\n  In other places, the Constitution is simple prose, but given the \nimportance of every single word in the text of the Constitution, the \nFounding Fathers wrote in plain, concise, and understandable language.\n  That clarity can be found in the advice and consent clause of article \nII, section 2. Its words could not be clearer. It simply states that \nthe President of the United States ``shall nominate, and by and with \nthe Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other \npublic Ministers and Consuls, and Judges of the supreme Court.''\n  There is no ambiguity there. It is not an invitation to \nreinterpretation. The President's obligation under the Constitution is \ncrystal clear. He shall nominate someone to fill a vacancy on the \nSupreme Court.\n  President Obama has stated that he will fulfill his obligation and \nsend the Senate an eminently qualified nominee to fill the vacancy \ncreated by the unfortunate passing of Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\n[[Page S982]]\n\n  When President Obama does that, it will be the Senate's turn to \nfulfill its obligation under the Constitution.\n  The text of the Constitution on the Senate's responsibility is \nsimilarly clear. The Senate is to provide its advice and consent. Let \nme repeat that. The Senate is to provide its advice and consent.\n  Advice and consent does not mean the Senate disregards the \nConstitution and ignores a nomination to the Supreme Court. It is \nadvice and consent, not avoid and contempt.\n  The advice and consent clause is not the constitutional equivalent of \nRoger Maris's home run statistics. There is no asterisk in the \nConstitution that directs readers to small print that says ``except in \nan election year.'' There is no fine print in the Constitution that \nsays the Senate is to give its advice and consent except in the last \nyear of a President's term.\n  Despite the clear constitutional instruction on how the executive and \nlegislative branches are to handle a vacancy on the Supreme Court, the \nRepublicans on the Judiciary Committee yesterday unilaterally decided \nthey would not hold a hearing on a Supreme Court nominee to fill \nJustice Scalia's seat until after the upcoming Presidential election. \nThis partisan decision to obstruct is a drastic departure from long-\nestablished practice and procedure in filling Supreme Court vacancies. \nThe Senate has routinely confirmed Supreme Court Justices in the final \nyear of a Presidency. In fact, it has happened more than a dozen times, \nmost recently with the confirmation of Justice Anthony Kennedy during \nthe last year of Ronald Reagan's second term as President. In the last \n100 years, the Senate has taken action on every Supreme Court nominee \nregardless of whether the nomination was made in a Presidential \nelection year.\n  So the American people now have to deal with two vacancies: one on \nthe Supreme Court and the other in the judgment of Senate Republicans \nbecause they seem willing to go to unprecedented lengths to stop this \nconstitutionally mandated process from moving forward.\n  Republican Senators' reading words into the Constitution to reach the \nresult they want is no different from the so-called judicial activism \non the bench they routinely decry.\n  The Republicans would rather shirk their constitutional \nresponsibility than let President Obama appoint another Justice to the \nCourt. They would rather deprive the country of a fully functioning \nSupreme Court than fulfill their constitutional duty, not just for the \nremainder of this term but for the next term of the Supreme Court as \nwell.\n  Now, why is that? Well, because a Justice of the Supreme Court has \nonly one vote, but a single seat on the Court and a single vote that \ncomes with it can carry enormous significance. We need only look at \nthis divided Supreme Court's recent 5-to-4 decisions to understand why \nRepublicans prefer a vacancy on the Supreme Court. With only eight \njustices instead of nine, the Court's decisions can deadlock with a 4-\nto-4 vote. A tie vote leaves in place the lower court decision that has \nbeen appealed to the Supreme Court. A 4-to-4 deadlock can have far-\nreaching consequences.\n  Take Bush v. Gore, the 2000 decision that stopped Florida's vote \nrecount in the 2000 Presidential election. Bush v. Gore was decided by \na 5-to-4 vote. If a seat on the Supreme Court had been vacated, \nresulting in a 4-to-4 vote, then the outcome of that election could \nhave been different.\n  So that is pretty much the consequence here. It is going to have, \nwithout question, some impact on how these decisions are going to be \nmade, but it is without any full comprehension of what that change \ncould be, only because nine human beings are involved, but there is a \nresponsibility that we have in the Senate to ensure that we, in fact, \nhave a full Supreme Court.\n  The President shall nominate. That is without question the duty he \nhas. We shall provide advice and consent. That is our duty. We don't \nhave to give consent at the end of the day. We can have a vote on the \nSenate floor to determine whether someone is, in fact, going to be \nconfirmed, but we have that constitutional responsibility.\n  There is still ample time for the President to submit a nomination, \nfor the Judiciary Committee to hold hearings on it, and for the full \nSenate to vote on it.\n  The U.S. Constitution remains a remarkable document. Let us treasure \nit, not twist it. Let us respect it, not run from it. Let us fulfill \nour constitutional obligations and have a hearing on the President's \nnominee and a vote by the Senate. In other words, to the U.S. Senate: \nDo your job. It is in the Constitution. There is no way you can run \nfrom a clear interpretation of what the Constitution requires us to do \nonce the President has nominated a new candidate for the Supreme Court. \nThere are direct instructions for the President in the Constitution and \nthere are direct instructions for us in the Senate.\n  Let us hope that after the President nominates a candidate, that this \nbody deliberates, listens to all the testimony, and then has a vote on \nwhether that person is qualified to serve on the Supreme Court, but the \nonly way that is going to happen is if this body does its job. So we \nask the Members of the majority to ensure that happens.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am here today to urge this body to \nfulfill its constitutional duty and take action on the Supreme Court \nnominee who shortly will be submitted by President Obama. I come here \nnot only as a U.S. Senator but also as a former Federal prosecutor, a \nU.S. attorney in Connecticut from 1977 to 1981, a former State attorney \ngeneral for 20 years, and a veteran of four arguments before the U.S. \nSupreme Court. I am also here as a former law clerk to Justice Harry \nBlackmun, and I share with the Presiding Officer the experience of \nhaving had that supremely important and formative experience, and, of \ncourse, it shapes my view as well of the Court.\n  I have immense respect and awe for the position and power and \neminence of the U.S. Supreme Court, its role in our democracy, and its \nhistory of scholarship and public service. I have the same admiration \nfor Justice Antonin Scalia, and I take this moment to remember his \nuniquely American life.\n  As the son of an immigrant, he was a dedicated public servant, a \ngifted writer, and a powerful speaker. I heard him speak on a number of \noccasions and argued before him in the Court in a number of memorable \nexchanges. His sense of humor and his quickness of wit and insight \nremain with me now. As all of my colleagues will attest, he dedicated \nhis life to serving the public, which can be demanding and difficult at \ntimes, but his life showed, as we know, that the difficulties and the \ndemands are well worth the rewards. My thoughts are with his wife \nMaureen and his entire family.\n  My personal view, speaking only for myself, is that one way to honor \nJustice Scalia is to adhere to the Constitution, to follow its words, \nwhich are very explicit on the topic of nominating and confirming a \nSupreme Court Justice and which give us the role of advising and \nconsenting after the President has nominated. I hope we will fulfill \nour constitutional duty to advise and consent--to do our job, \nliterally, to do our job as we were elected and took an oath of office \nto do. That is what we are paid to do--our job as prescribed by the \nConstitution. I fundamentally reject the notion that the Senate's \nrefusal to act, as laid out in no uncertain terms by my Republican \ncolleagues, fulfills this obligation. In fact, the abdication of \nresponsibility through this rejection is disrespectful to that document \nand to the Court itself.\n  President Obama has indicated that he is currently engaged in a \nthoughtful and deliberative process, working to select a nominee with \nthe intellect and integrity that will persuade the American public and \nhopefully also the Senate to support his suggestion. His nomination \nwould allow the Supreme Court to function again with the nine members \nwho are essential to its deliberation.\n\n[[Page S983]]\n\n  The conclusions my colleagues advance during such a process will, of \ncourse, be to each of them to decide. I will be, in fact, among the \nmost exacting and demanding of our colleagues who question that nominee \nin a hearing, who seek answers in screening and researching the \nexpertise and experience of that person. In no way should the Judiciary \nCommittee, on which I serve, or the U.S. Senate, where we all serve, \nact as a rubberstamp. No way. No rubberstamp. We must advise as well as \nconsent, and advising means being demanding and careful. But I think we \nhave an obligation to go through that process. We can't just say, sight \nunseen, no. We can't say that we are going to leave it to the next \nelected Senate or the next elected President. We have been elected and \nhe has been elected to do our job.\n  The Supreme Court must have a full complement of Justices to \neffectively address some of the most complex issues and consequential \nlegal challenges our Nation faces today. Put aside the merits of each--\nwhether it is immigration or affirmative action, women's reproductive \nrights, voting rights--decisions are needed. The lack of decision has \nconsequences, just as elections have consequences.\n  Obstruction has consequences, too, and we cannot afford to weaken the \nFederal judiciary's capacity for effective governance. We can't allow a \nmanufactured crisis in the Senate to plunge another branch of \ngovernment into gridlock and to plague the judiciary with the same \npartisan paralysis that is so detested by the American people. In fact, \nthe rejection of our constitutional responsibility to do our job would \nepitomize the gridlock and partisan contention that America finds so \nabhorrent today. Like my colleagues, I go around the State of \nConnecticut, and what people say to me more commonly than anything else \nis ``Why can't you do your job? Why can't you get stuff done?'' Let's \nget this done.\n  Statements by Majority Leader McConnell and Chairman Grassley, as \nwell as a number of my other colleagues, have indicated that President \nObama's nominee to the highest Court in the land should not even be \nconsidered, but turning our backs on that constitutional obligation to \nact would be equivalent to shutting down the government. It is of \nexactly the same kind of consequence. It may not be as far-reaching in \nits immediate effect, but it has the same long-term consequences, which \nare not merely to prevent decisions and actions from happening--\nnecessary decisions and actions--but also to undermine credibility and \nfaith and trust in our government.\n  When it comes to the Congress or the President, maybe that \ncredibility is of lesser importance, but it is a chief asset of our \njudiciary. The Supreme Court of the United States has no armies or \npolice force. It commands the Nation's respect through its credibility. \nIt enforces obeyance by virtue of that credibility.\n  This posture by my Republican colleagues threatens to drag a vital, \nnonpartisan institution into the morass of procedural gamesmanship and \nelectoral mudslinging--the kind of game playing and gamesmanship that \nhas so disillusioned and dismayed Americans more broadly.\n  As I have discussed this process with the people of Connecticut, I \nhave heard outrage over this attempt to hamstring the Supreme Court, \nwhich looks like the recent, similarly illogical process of shutting \ndown the government.\n  If my Republican colleagues want to reject a nominee, that is their \nright. After a hearing, they can vote no. They may have reason, and \nthose reasons may be subjective or fact-based and objective. But to \nsimply deny any consideration--even a meeting with a nominee--is stark \nobstructionism. It is an extreme version of the phenomenon that has \nfrozen this body for much too long.\n  The majority campaigned in 2014 on restoring law and getting things \ndone. They promised Americans everywhere that the new Senate majority \nwould usher in an end to gridlock on Capitol Hill. We made some \nprogress--too slow, too little--but moving in the right direction will \nbe forestalled, if not doomed, by this obstructionism, and these \npromises would be broken if the Senate refuses to act.\n  At this critical time, we cannot hold the highest level of an entire \nbranch of government hostage because of political gamesmanship. That is \nnot what the American people elected us to do, and it is not what the \nAmerican people deserve. Doing so would dishonor the bipartisan \ntradition of providing a hearing and a vote for a Supreme Court \nnominee, which is our constitutional obligation and has been followed \nby past Senates.\n  Even when a nominee during President Reagan's Presidency was \nnominated 14 months before the election and even though the vote came \nduring the last year of that President's term in office, Justice \nKennedy was confirmed. We should do the same. Why not? There is plenty \nof time between now and then to give deliberate due consideration to \nthe President's nominee.\n  I hope that the outrage and outcry from the American people will \npersuade my colleagues to reconsider, reflect, and reverse this \ndisastrous course. In fact, I believe they will relent because this \ncourse is dangerous to the Court, damaging to our Nation, and \nultimately destructive to our democracy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, we are here on this conflict we have \nover a Supreme Court nominee, which has turned into a considerable, \nunprecedented fuss, I believe, for a fairly simple reason. The \nelephant, so to speak, in the room is that the Court has become a \npolitical actor under Chief Justice Roberts. The rightwing bloc on the \nCourt delivered politically because it had a 5-to-4 majority. Now their \nrightwing majority is gone, and Republicans are predictably upset.\n  Justice Frankfurter admonished:\n\n       But it is not the business of this Court to pronounce \n     policy. It must observe a fastidious regard for limitations \n     on its own power, and this precludes the Court's giving \n     effect to its own notions of what is wise or politic.\n\n  Well, that was then. The five-judge bloc on the Roberts Court, of \nwhich Justice Scalia was an essential part, systematically and \npredictably pronounced policy in favor of three things: No. 1, \nconservative ideology; No. 2, the welfare of big corporations; and No. \n3, the electoral well-being of the Republican Party. And people \nnoticed. Linda Greenhouse wrote that it is ``impossible to avoid the \nconclusion that the Republican-appointed majority is committed to \nharnessing the Supreme Court to an ideological agenda.'' Other noted \nCourt watchers, such as Norm Ornstein and Jeffrey Toobin, agree. As \nJeffrey Toobin noted, the pattern of decisions ``has served the \ninterests, and reflected the values, of the contemporary Republican \nparty.'' Columnist Dana Milbank observed of a recent decision that \n``the Roberts Court has found yet another way to stack the deck in \nfavor of the rich.'' The Court has become so political that Justices \nScalia and Thomas have attended the Koch brothers' secretive annual \npolitical conference. Just this week, Ms. Greenhouse wrote, ``[T]he \nconservative majority is permitting the court to become an agent of \npartisan warfare to an extent that threatens real damage to the \ninstitution.''\n  It is not just the Court watchers who have noticed; less than one-\nthird of Americans have confidence in the Supreme Court. Americans \nmassively oppose its Citizens United decision--80 percent against, with \n71 percent strongly opposed. Most tellingly, by a ratio of 9 to 1, \nAmericans now believe the Court treats corporations more favorably than \nindividuals. Even conservative Republicans agree, by a 4-to-1 margin, \nthat this Court treats corporations more favorably than individuals.\n  Let's take a look at the Court's decisions in these three areas: \nelection politics, corporate interests, and the conservative social \nagenda.\n  In elections decisions, the Court's Republican-appointed majority \nalways seems to come down on the side that helps the election prospects \nof the Republican Party.\n  The Voting Rights Act, for example, protects minority access to the \nballot,\n\n[[Page S984]]\n\nand in States that had long histories of discriminating against \nminority voters, it required preclearance of voting restrictions. In \nthe 5-to-4 Shelby County decision, the Republican-appointed Justices \ngutted that preclearance requirement. Predictably, the result was \nalmost immediate enactment across many States of voter-suppression \nlaws. The Washington Post described, for instance, the ``surgical \nprecision with which North Carolina Republicans approved certain forms \nof photo IDs for voting and excluded others.'' Texas, for another \ninstance, allowed gun permits for voting but not State university IDs. \nAnd even where these voter-suppression laws ultimately fail in court, \nRepublicans still gain the benefit of fewer Democrats in the electorate \nwhile they are litigated.\n  The conservative judges' decisions on gerrymandering are a second \nexample. ``Gerrymandering'' is named after Massachusetts Governor \nElbridge Gerry and his efforts to shape the district of a State senator \nhe needed to protect. A clever modern variant of gerrymandering has \nemerged--bulk gerrymandering--which looks at the whole congressional \ndelegation of a State. This tactic isolates Democrats into small, \nsupersaturated Democratic districts so that majority-Republican \ndistricts can be created out of the remainder of the State.\n  By manipulating the districts this way through its so-called REDMAP \nproject, Republicans delivered congressional delegations that didn't \nreflect the State's popular vote, over and over. For instance, when \nPennsylvania voters went to the polls in 2012, Democratic votes for \nCongress outnumbered Republican votes by a little over 80,000. \nPennsylvania also reelected President Obama that year and our \ncolleague, Democratic Senator Bob Casey. But Pennsylvania at that \nballot sent a House delegation to Congress of 5 Democrats and 13 \nRepublicans--more votes for Democrats, more Republicans in the \ndelegation by 13 to 5.\n  This was not just a Pennsylvania fluke. In 2012, Ohio voted for \nBarack Obama for President and returned our Democratic colleague \nSherrod Brown to the Senate but sent 12 Republicans to Congress and \nonly 4 Democrats. Wisconsin voted for Obama in 2012 and elected \nprogressive Senator Tammy Baldwin to the Senate but sent five \nRepublicans and only three Democrats to Congress.\n  The Republican organization behind REDMAP bragged of this \nachievement. I will quote REDMAP's memo:\n\n       [A]ggregated numbers show voters pulled the lever for \n     Republicans only 49 percent of the time in congressional \n     races, [but] Republicans enjoy a 33-seat margin in the U.S. \n     House seated yesterday in the 113th Congress, having endured \n     Democratic successes atop the ticket and over one million \n     more votes cast for Democratic House candidates than \n     Republicans.\n\n  This gerrymandering ran wild because in a Supreme Court case called \nVieth v. Jubelirer, four Republican Justices announced that they would \nno longer question whether gerrymandering interfered with any \nconstitutional voting rights. One, Justice Kennedy, left a glimmer of \nlight, but the practical effect was to announce open season for \ngerrymandering. As the American Bar Association's publication on \nredistricting has noted, ``The Court's recent decisions appear to give \nlegislators leeway to preserve partisan advantage as zealously as they \nlike when drawing district lines.'' In practice, gerrymandering of \nCongress squarely benefited Republicans.\n  A third example is campaign finance decisions, the most noticeable \nbeing Citizens United, but a constellation of decisions surrounds \nCitizens United, beginning with Justice Powell's 1978 opinion in First \nNational Bank of Boston v. Belloti. The careful work of Republican \nappointees on the Court over many years to open American politics to \ncorporate spending has conferred obvious political advantage to the \nRepublican Party, and, as many news outlets reported, it was \nRepublicans who cheered the Citizens United decision.\n  So, in elections, it is three for three in favor of the Republican \nParty.\n  Turning from elections to the conservative agenda on social issues, \nsuch as religion and abortion and gun control, let's start with the \nDistrict of Columbia v. Heller decision, a Second Amendment decision in \nwhich this same five-man bloc created, for the first time in our \nhistory, an individual right to keep firearms for self-defense. As \nrecently as 1991, this doctrine was such a fringe theory that it was \npublicly described by retired Chief Justice Warren Burger as ``one of \nthe greatest pieces of fraud, I repeat the word `fraud,' on the \nAmerican public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my \nlifetime.'' That was the theory which five on the Court adopted. As one \nauthor noted, ``Five Justices on the Supreme Court were able to \nreinterpret, by some standards radically, the Second Amendment's right \nto keep and bear arms as a personal, not a collective right in \nHeller.''\n  At the wall separating church and state, the bloc of five chipped \nsteadily away: Christian crosses in public parks, Federal tax credits \nfunding religious schools, Christian prayer at legislative meetings. As \nconstitutional scholar Erwin Chemerinsky summed it up: ``Rather than \nobliterating the wall separating church and state all at once, the \nRoberts Court's opinions are dismantling it brick by brick.''\n\n  Four decades ago, Roe v. Wade recognized a wall of privacy in the \nConstitution between the government and a woman's private medical \ndecisions. In this context, the court has long required State laws \nbarring late-term abortions to have an exception to protect the health \nof the mother. Then the Roberts Court upheld a ban on the procedure \nthat had no exception for the health of the mother.\n  As Justice Ginsburg stated in her dissent: ``[T]he Act and the \nCourt's defense of it cannot be understood as anything other than an \neffort to chip away at a right declared again and again by this Court--\nand with increasing comprehension of its centrality to women's lives.''\n  If the conservative win rate in the Court is striking, the corporate \none is even more so. A recent study found the Roberts Court more \nfavorable to business interests than its predecessors, with all five \nmembers of the recent rightwing bloc among the top 10 most business-\nfriendly judges in the last 65 years. Chief Justice Roberts was No. 1 \nand Justice Alito No. 2.\n  Studies showed the Roberts Court following the legal position of the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is a de facto organ of the National \nRepublican Party, 69 percent of the time, up from 56 percent during the \nRehnquist Court and 43 percent during the Burger Court. Connect the \ndots. The Republicans are the party of the corporations, the judges are \nthe appointees of the Republicans, and the judges are delivering for \nthe corporations. It is being done in plain view.\n  Many Chamber victories were significant, such as making employment \ndiscrimination harder to prove, letting manufacturers and distributors \nfix minimum prices for retail goods, letting mutual funds advisers \ninclude misstatements made by others in the documents they prepare for \ninvestors, and even Hobby Lobby, where the Court put the religious \nrights of corporate entities over the rights of employees.\n  Big corporations hate being hauled into court and having to face \njuries, and the five Republican appointees protected them by raising \npleading standards for victims, letting companies push disputes into \ncorporate-favored arbitration, restricting Americans' ability to press \ncases of large-scale wrongdoing in class actions, making it more \ndifficult for workers to hold employers accountable for workplace \nharassment, and making it harder for consumers with serious side \neffects to sue the drug companies.\n  Now before the Court is a case the five-man bloc has pursued for some \ntime. It was expected that the five would use it to deal a significant \nblow to the political and economic clout of unions, a great boon for \nthe big corporations. It also looked like the five were teeing up for \nthe fossil fuel industry, a big victory against the President's Clean \nPower Plan.\n  There was a lot at stake in that fifth vote. There was a lot that was \ndelivered because of that fifth vote. At 4 to 4, the circuit court \ndecision below\n\n[[Page S985]]\n\nstands. At 4 to 4, the challenged regulation ordinarily prevails.\n  I will close with the big sockdolager: Citizens United. It was once \nthe opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court that ``to subject the state \ngovernments to the combined capital of wealthy corporations [would] \nproduce universal corruption.'' No more. The five judges behind \nCitizens United opened the floodgates for unlimited anonymous corporate \nspending in elections. They found that corporate corruption of \nelections was near impossible, and they caused a tsunami of slime--to \nuse a phrase that I borrow--that we have seen in recent election \ncycles. Such a brute role for big corporations in our American \nGovernment would shock the Founding Fathers who foresaw no important \nrole in our Republic for the corporations of the time.\n  To unleash that corporate power in our elections, the five \nconservative justices had to go through some remarkable contortions. \nThey had to reverse previous decisions where the Court had said the \nopposite. They had to make up facts that were then predictably and are \nnow demonstrably wrong. They had to create a make-believe world of \nindependence and transparency in election spending that present \nexperience belies, and they had to maneuver their own judicial \nprocedures to forestall a factual record belying the facts they were \nmaking up.\n  It was a dirty business with a lot of signs of intent, and it has \nproduced evil results that we live with every day. All of this--\nRepublican election advantage, corporate welfare, the conservative \nsocial agenda--is because the activists, corporatists, and rightwing \nbloc had a fifth vote. That bloc of five did more for the far right, \nfor the Republican Party, and for its corporate backers than all of the \nRepublicans in the House and Senate have been able to do. They \ndelivered. Now it is 4 to 4 and that advantage is gone; hence the panic \non the Republican side; hence the departure from plain constitutional \ntext.\n  Imagine any other constitutional duty of the President that he failed \nto do that would not cause uproar and outrage. There would be nobody on \nthe floor here because everybody would have run off to FOX News to get \ntheir talking headshot in and talk about what a terrible thing the \nPresident had done by violating his constitutional duty. Well, the \nPresident has a constitutional duty--he shall nominate.\n  They are in a political pickle, but the Constitution doesn't care \nabout the politics. From the Constitution's point of view, the politics \nare just too darn bad. The Constitution directs the President to make \nthe appointment, and he should do his job. The Constitution gives the \nSenate the job of advice and consent to the President's nominee. We \nshould do our job just as the Constitution provides.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/senate-section/article/S985-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S985-S986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING WILLIAM USHER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the life and \nlegacy of a distinguished Kentuckian who has sadly passed away. William \n``Bill'' Usher of Paducah died this February 14, 2016, after a short \nillness. He was 86 years old.\n  Bill was the owner and manager for many years of Usher Transport, a \nfamily-owned and operated Kentucky business founded in the 1940s. He \nwas well known in Paducah and western Kentucky as a community leader, \nand he was a friend of mine whom I saw often in my travels through \nPaducah.\n  Bill gave generously of his time and resources to many organizations, \ncharities, and causes. He served as both president and chairman of the \nGreater Paducah Chamber of Commerce. He served with Greater Paducah \nIndustrial Development, the Paducah Rotary Club, the Kentucky Motor \nTransport Association, and National Tank Truck Carriers.\n  Bill was a board member of Citizens Bank and helped found Paducah's \nfirst industrial development group. He was the chairman of the Barkley \nRegional Airport board of directors. He was also the chairman of the \nBoard of Exhibit Management in Louisville.\n  Bill understood what it means to serve from a young age. While \nstudying at the University of Kentucky, he was named outstanding cadet \nof the Air Force ROTC. Upon graduation in 1952, he served as a fighter \npilot in the U.S. Air Force and Air Force Reserves for several years, \nretiring as a major.\n  While in the military, he served as an air combat and gunner \ninstructor at Luke Air Force Base in Phoenix, AZ, and with the 417th \nTactical Fighter Squadron based in France and Germany flying F-100s. He \nwas awarded the Commendation Medal. In the 1960s, he moved back to \nPaducah to help build the family business.\n  Bill was a native of Graves County and attended the First United \nMethodist Church in Mayfield, KY.\n  He leaves behind his wife Virginia ``Ginger'' Sabel Usher; two sons, \nWilliam A. Usher, Jr., and Alan W. Usher; a stepdaughter, Karen \nElizabeth Reed Alpers; a stepson, James Boone Reed; three grandsons, \nRyan Lunsford Usher, William Patrick Usher, and William A. Usher III; \nthree stepgrandsons, David Roscoe Reed II, William Murphy Reed, and Ely \nE. Mazmanians; a stepgranddaughter, Avary Frazier; extended family \nmembers Gabriel Vieira, Kathleen Overlin, Sabel Overlin, Max Overlin, \nElise Overlin, and Stacy Overlin; and many more beloved family members \nand friends.\n  The Paducah Sun recently published an article highlighting the impact \nBill Usher had on his friends, family, and community. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy of the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Paducah Sun, Feb. 15, 2016]\n\n           Bill Usher Remembered as Benevolent Public Servant\n\n                          (By Kaylan Thompson)\n\n       Paducah leaders and friends remember William ``Bill'' Usher \n     as a driving force of leadership and benevolence throughout \n     the area and say his impact will be felt throughout the \n     community for years to come.\n       ``He's a rare breed of community leader in Paducah,'' said \n     Bill Bartleman, McCracken County commissioner and friend of \n     Usher for nearly 40 years. ``He was the old kind of \n     leadership, the behind-the-scenes leader that we used to \n     have, the kind of people who weren't in the limelight. They \n     just did what they thought was right for the community.''\n       Usher died early Sunday morning at Morningside Assisted \n     Living. He was 86.\n       Bartleman, a former legislative reporter with The Sun, \n     first got to know Usher while covering community and \n     political movements in the 1970s. During that time, Usher \n     proved a helpful source and political liaison.\n       ``He was a major force for our community,'' Bartleman said. \n     ``He did a lot to help the community and did it quietly. He \n     had contacts with political leaders, and he worked with them \n     to get benefits for the community. He did things that people \n     probably didn't know about and would have been hard to \n     document because he worked so humbly.''\n       Usher's political and civic resume includes an array of \n     titles, including chairman of the McCracken County Democratic \n     Party, president of the Greater Paducah Chamber of Commerce, \n     president of the Paducah Rotary Club, and chairman of the \n     Barkley Regional Airport Board of Directors.\n       ``He was always supportive and always encouraged good \n     government,'' Bartleman said. ``He wanted people to do the \n     right thing. He didn't use his influence to benefit himself, \n     he used it solely to benefit the community through the \n     bureaucracy of government.''\n       During Bartleman's campaign for political office, he added, \n     Usher often reached out to him.\n       ``He said he was supportive of me as long as I would do \n     what's right for the community and the people,'' he said. \n     ``Even in his senior years he was involved in politics and \n     wanted things done right, not to see people elected to help \n     himself, but to see people elected who would do good \n     government.''\n       That inspiration, Bartleman said, is the torch Usher passed \n     on to him and others, encouraging them to lead with humility.\n       ``What I learned from him is to just do the right thing and \n     don't seek publicity,'' Bartleman said. ``In the long run \n     you'll be rewarded, at least in knowing you benefited the \n     community. Your involvement in anything should be to do \n     what's right and not seek self-gratification.''\n       Usher, a Mayfield native, was a graduate of Mayfield High \n     School and the University of Kentucky.\n       He came to Paducah in 1960 following eight years of service \n     in the U.S. Air Force, then taking on the family business, \n     Usher Transportation Co., as president.\n       In recent years, he strongly supported several charitable \n     organizations and the Paducah Police Department.\n       While most of his work remained anonymous, his chief \n     involvement with the department was with Christmas Cops, a \n     program\n\n[[Page S986]]\n\n     engaging police with area families and youth through shopping \n     for gifts and necessities.\n       ``Bill, being a huge supporter of the mission of the police \n     department to build relationships with the community and the \n     children, has been instrumental in affecting many, many lives \n     in this community positively by either financial support or \n     being there to support our efforts,'' said Paducah Police \n     Chief Brandon Barnhill, a friend of his for many years.\n       Usher's support of the department began when he initiated \n     an annual fundraiser in support of the program in the 1990s. \n     His efforts remained largely anonymous until the early 2000s, \n     when he became a member of the Christmas Cops board.\n       ``Whether it was financial or moral, he was always there in \n     a supporting nature,'' Barnhill said. ``He was a big driving \n     force behind much of what we do during the Christmas season. \n     He was a well-grounded individual, and he stayed true to his \n     principles. He would give you the shirt off his back if \n     that's what it took, and that's putting it lightly.''\n       A healthy community with thriving individuals was Usher's \n     goal, believing connections and relationships were key to \n     achieving it.\n       ``He fully understood the value of mentoring and fostering \n     a positive relationship with the police and youth,'' said \n     Stacey Grimes, retired assistant chief of criminal \n     investigations with the Paducah Police Department. ``We're \n     not always arresting people or writing tickets, and he wanted \n     them to see us in a different light.''\n       Grimes met Usher in 1994 at a Christmas Cops fundraiser, \n     then called Shop with a Cop.\n       ``He and his wife didn't want any praise or publicity for \n     hosting the fundraiser,'' Grimes said. ``He was extremely \n     humble and was probably the most benevolent man that I've \n     ever met. He never sought praise for what he did, not even a \n     pat on the back.''\n       ``He always worked everything behind the scenes. His work \n     helped ensure the program is sustainable for the future. \n     Because of what Bill set up, I think it will be there for \n     generations to come.''\n       Usher's friends agree that helping others was always his \n     top priority.\n       ``The hardest part of this is that we will never know how \n     many lives Bill has positively affected,'' Barnhill said. \n     ``But we do know there are many, many out there. It's just \n     the person that he was.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/senate-section/article/S986-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LESLIE PROLL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to recognize Leslie Proll, the \ndirector of policy for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, \nInc., for her years of excellent public service as she begins a new \nchapter in her career. Since 1998, Leslie has served as policy director \nat LDF, where she has advocated for the organization's policy and \nlegislative priorities. She has brought her expertise to bear on \nadvancing important Federal civil rights legislation and advocating for \nwell-qualified, diverse nominees to serve in our Federal judiciary and \nthe executive branch.\n  My staff has worked closely with her over the years, and she has been \nsteadfast and unwavering in her commitment to civil rights. Leslie \nprovided invaluable support when Congress reauthorized the Voting \nRights Act in 2006 and passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act in 2009. \nHer contributions to these two critical legislative initiatives, along \nwith the civil rights community, proved instrumental in moving these \ntwo bills through Congress.\n  Leslie has been an effective and tireless advocate in promoting \ndiversity in our Federal judiciary so that our courts are more \nrepresentative of the citizenry they serve. Our justice system has been \nmade a better one because of her contributions. I commend Leslie for \nher years of service and wish her the best as she moves forward in her \ncareer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/senate-section/article/S986-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONFIRMATION OF ROBERT CALIFF\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating Dr. Robert Califf on his confirmation today as Food and \nDrug Administration, FDA, Commissioner. Dr. Califf is a well-respected \ncardiologist that hails from Anderson, SC,--very close to where I grew \nup. He has served our country and its medical needs in a variety of \ncapacities. As a faculty member and professor at Duke University, he \nfounded the Duke Clinical Research Institute and served as vice \nchancellor for clinical research. In addition to his accomplishments \nduring his tenure at Duke, he is an active member of several \nprofessional organizations, including committees of the Institute of \nMedicine of the National Academies and the FDA.\n  In 2015, Dr. Califf was named Deputy Commissioner for Medical \nProducts and Tobacco for the FDA. In this role, Dr. Califf is \nresponsible for overseeing and directing the Center for Drug Evaluation \nand Research, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, and the \nCenter for Tobacco Products. He also oversees the Office of Special \nMedical Programs.\n  The broad bipartisan support for Dr. Califf's nomination is testament \nto his strong, transparent leadership and record of advancing medical \nbreakthroughs. The FDA has been operating without a confirmed \nCommissioner for the past year, and I applaud the Senate's confirmation \nof Dr. Califf. I look forward to working with Dr. Califf as he brings \nhis expertise to addressing challenges facing the FDA and our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/senate-section/article/S986-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today the Senate voted on the confirmation \nof Dr. Robert Califf to serve as Commissioner of Food and Drugs, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. While I was unable to vote \ntoday, I would have supported Dr. Califf's nomination, just as I \nsupported proceeding to cloture on his nomination in Monday evening's \nvote.\n  The Food and Drug Administration has lacked a permanent Commissioner \nfor almost a year, despite its role overseeing the safety of 25 percent \nof goods sold in the United States, including food, drugs, medical \ndevices, cosmetics, and vitamin supplements.\n  I believe that Dr. Califf, a Duke cardiologist and clinical trial \nresearcher endorsed by over 100 physician and patient groups, is well \nqualified to oversee this critical mission.\n  I look forward to working with Dr. Califf to implement key public \nhealth priorities, including examining ways to tackle rising \nprescription drugs prices, improve clinical trials, and combat the \nopioid epidemic.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mrs. McCASKILL.

Mr. President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget \nscorekeeping report for February 2016. The report compares current law \nlevels of spending and revenues with the amounts provided in the \nconference report to accompany S. Con. Res. 11, the budget resolution \nfor fiscal year 2016. This information is necessary to determine \nwhether budget points of order lie against pending legislation. It has \nbeen prepared by the Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee \nand the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, pursuant to section 308(b) of \nthe Congressional Budget Act, CBA.\n  This is the second scorekeeping report for this calendar year but the \nsixth report I have made since adoption of the fiscal year 2016 budget \nresolution on May 5, 2015. My last filing can be found in the \nCongressional Record on January 11, 2016. The information contained in \nthis report is current through February 22, 2016.\n  Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee \nis below or exceeds its allocation under the budget resolution. This \ninformation is used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant to \nsection 302 of the CBA. Over the fiscal year 2016-2025 period, which is \nthe entire period covered by S. Con. Res. 11, Senate authorizing \ncommittees have spent $147.9 billion more than the budget resolution \ncalls for.\n  Table 2 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations is below or exceeds the statutory spending limits. This \ninformation is used to determine points of order related to the \nspending caps found in section 312 and section 314 of the CBA. On \nDecember 18, 2015, the President signed H.R. 2029, the Consolidated \nAppropriations Act, 2016, P.L. 114-113, into law. This bill provided \nregular appropriations equal to the levels set in the Bipartisan Budget \nAct of 2015, P.L. 114-74, specifically $548.1 billion in budget \nauthority for defense accounts, revised\n\n[[Page S987]]\n\nsecurity category, and $518.5 billion in budget authority for \nnondefense accounts, revised nonsecurity category.\n  Table 3 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations is below or exceeds its allocation for Overseas \nContingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism, OCO/GWOT, spending. \nThis separate allocation for OCO/GWOT was established in section 3102 \nof S. Con. Res. 11 and is enforced using section 302 of the CBA. The \nconsolidated appropriations bill included $73.7 billion in budget \nauthority and $32.1 billion in outlays for OCO/GWOT in fiscal year \n2016. This level is equal to the revised OCO/GWOT levels that I filed \nin the Record on December 18, 2015.\n  The budget resolution established two new points of order limiting \nthe use of changes in mandatory programs in appropriations bills, \nCHIMPS. Tables 4 and 5 show compliance with fiscal year 2016 limits for \noverall CHIMPS and the Crime Victims Fund CHIMP, respectively. This \ninformation is used for determining points of order under section 3103 \nand section 3104, respectively. Enacted CHIMPS are under both the \nbroader CHIMPS limit, $1.3 billion less, and the Crime Victims Fund \nlimit, $1.8 billion less.\n  In addition to the tables provided by the Senate Budget Committee \nRepublican staff, I am submitting additional tables from CBO that I \nwill use for enforcement of budget levels agreed to by the Congress.\n  For fiscal year 2016, CBO estimates that current law levels are \n$138.9 billion and $103.6 billion above the budget resolution levels \nfor budget authority and outlays, respectively. Revenues are $155.2 \nbillion below the level assumed in the budget resolution. Finally, \nSocial Security outlays are at the levels assumed in the budget \nresolution for fiscal year 2016, while Social Security revenues are $23 \nmillion below assumed levels for the budget year.\n  CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate's \npay-as-you-go rule. The Senate's pay-as-you-go scorecard currently \nshows deficit reduction of $20.4 billion over the fiscal year 2015-2020 \nperiod and $95.7 billion over the fiscal year 2015-2025 period. Over \nthe initial 6-year period, Congress has enacted legislation that would \nincrease revenues by $17 billion and decrease outlays by $3.3 billion. \nOver the 11-year period, Congress has enacted legislation that would \nincrease revenues by $36.8 billion and decrease outlays by $59 billion. \nThe Senate's pay-as-you-go rule is enforced by section 201 of S. Con. \nRes. 21, the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution.\n  All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n TABLE 1.--SENATE AUTHORIZING COMMITTEES--ENACTED DIRECT SPENDING ABOVE\n                   (+) OR

His contributions make up the largest \nportion of $34,000 raised during this year's third annual charitable \ncontribution program on behalf of the Red Lodge Area Community \nFoundation.\n  His generous giving is not just a one-time occurrence. Throughout his \n20 years in business, Red Lodge Pizza Co. has made supporting community \norganizations a priority.\n  Some of the organizations profiting from Red Lodge Pizza Co.'s \ndonations include Boys and Girls of Carbon County, Domestic & Sexual \nViolence Services, Red Lodge Public Schools Foundation, Beartooth \nHumane Alliance, and Bridger Community Food Bank.\n  Tom is also the Red Lodge fire chief and was gracious enough to give \nme a tour of an area fire discussing fuels reduction in August of 2013. \nI am grateful for Tom's dedication to his hometown, his generosity and \nselfless actions benefitting the people and organizations that make up \nhis community. It's people like Tom that make me proud to call Montana \nhome.

In 1982, after \nmoving to Rockford, IL, in the 1970s, they recognized growing substance \nabuse rates among teenagers and created a first-of-its-kind chemical \ndependency treatment program in northern Illinois specifically for this \npopulation. In 1992, this program expanded to serve adults as well.\n  Five years ago, they recognized the importance of integrating \naddiction and mental health treatment and merged with the Janet Wattles \nCenter in Rockford. This has enabled them to treat individuals with co-\noccurring disorders that require behavioral health and addiction \ntreatment more effectively.

Julia loves to fish and play cards and dominoes with family at the \nMurdo Senior Center.\n  Julia has always welcomed challenges with a loving and caring \nattitude and is the embodiment of the American values of faith, family, \nfriends and freedom.\n  Happy birthday, Julia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/senate-section/article/S990-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/senate-section/article/S990-4", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/senate-section/article/S990-5", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n REPORT ON THE MODIFICATION AND CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY \n  WITH RESPECT TO CUBA AND OF THE EMERGENCY AUTHORITY RELATING TO THE \n REGULATION OF THE ANCHORAGE AND MOVEMENT OF VESSELS, AS AMENDED--PM 42\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport;

Reg. 52877) is consistent with section 1404 of \n     the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (42 U.S.C. 10603).\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am proud to introduce the Justice \nfor All Reauthorization Act of 2016 with Senator Cornyn. The Justice \nfor All Act, originally enacted in 2004, was an unprecedented \nbipartisan piece of criminal justice legislation. It has improved many \naspects of our criminal justice system, and this reauthorization \nincludes critical updates to ensure public confidence in the integrity \nof the American justice system.\n  The bill builds on the work I began in 2000, when I introduced the \nInnocence Protection Act. That measure was designed to ensure that \ndefendants receive competent representation in\n\n[[Page S1000]]\n\ncriminal cases and have access to post-conviction DNA testing in those \ncases where the system got it wrong. The Innocence Protection Act \nbecame a key component of the Justice for All Act, and is reauthorized \nin the bill we introduce today.\n  We know our justice system is imperfect and that innocent people are \nsometimes convicted, and even sentenced to death. There were 149 people \nexonerated just last year, the highest number on record. They spent an \naverage of 15 years in prison before their names were cleared. There \nhave been 337 post-conviction DNA exonerations in the United States \nsince 1989. Twenty of them were sentenced to death.\n  The first person exonerated from a death row crime by DNA evidence \nwas a man named Kirk Bloodsworth. Kirk was a young man just out of the \nMarines when he was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to death for a \nheinous crime that he did not commit. Now the Kirk Bloodsworth Post \nConviction DNA Testing Grant Program is a cornerstone of the Justice \nfor All Act. This program provides grants to States for testing in \ncases like Kirk's where someone has been convicted, but where \nsignificant DNA evidence was not tested.\n  This bill expands access to post-conviction DNA testing so that more \ninnocent people will have a chance at the redemption they deserve. For \nexample, this reauthorization will permit individuals to access DNA \ntesting even if they previously waived their right to testing as part \nof a guilty plea. This change is critical because we know that people \nsometimes pled guilty or confess to crimes they did not commit. In \nfact, of the 337 people who have been freed based on DNA evidence, 88 \nfalsely confessed or pled guilty. That is almost 30 percent of DNA \nexonerations. Had it not been for DNA testing, they would likely still \nbe behind bars, or worse.\n  The bill also takes steps to encourage prosecutors to search for \nadditional leads when the DNA evidence tested excludes an individual. \nUnder the legislation, the government must run that DNA through the \nnational database to see if it matches someone else in the system who \nmight be the actual perpetrator. Unfortunately, this is not always \ndone. This commonsense measure will increase public safety by getting \nthe true criminals off the street.\n  Even in cases that do not involve DNA, it is imperative that every \ncriminal defendant, including those who cannot afford a lawyer, receive \neffective representation. This bill requires the Department of Justice \nto assist states in developing a proficient system of indigent defense. \nI know as a former prosecutor, that the system only works as it should \nwhen each side is well represented by competent and well-trained \ncounsel. This helps prevent wrongful convictions in the first place.\n  The Justice for All Reauthorization Act also increases resources for \npublic forensic laboratories. Prosecutors and police officers depend on \nthe efficient and accurate testing of evidence to solve cases. Putting \nmore resources into forensic testing will also help reduce rape kit \nbacklogs and ensure that survivors of this terrible crime are able to \nsee their cases prosecuted and begin to feel safe again.\n  This bill further addresses the needs of sexual assault survivors by \ndirecting grants to forensic exam programs, prioritizing those that \noperate in rural areas or provide assistance to underserved \npopulations. Timely access to forensic exams is a critical first step \nin ensuring perpetrators are held accountable and taken off the \nstreets. We must also ensure that the evidence collected from these \nexams in the form of rape kits are processed quickly. To help with that \neffort, the bill also provides support for law enforcement to create \nevidence tracking systems for rape kits, so their processing can be \nmonitored and accounted for.\n  Finally, we must ensure that law enforcement and victim services \nprograms have the resources they need to move these cases through our \njustice system and assist these survivors.\n  This bill also strengthens some key provisions of the Prison Rape \nElimination Act, a bill I strongly supported when it was enacted in \n2003. Specifically, changes imposed by this bill will require that \nstates comply with regulations designed to prevent sexual assaults in \nour jails and prisons or lose Federal grant money. The Department of \nJustice will work with the states to assist them, but ultimately states \nwill be penalized if they do not act. This bill imposes the true \naccountability required to eradicate this awful crime.\n  This reauthorization also expands rights for victims of all crime. It \nbuilds upon the success of the Crime Victims' Rights Act by making it \neasier for crime victims to have an interpreter present during court \nproceedings and to obtain court-ordered restitution.\n  I firmly believe that improving our criminal justice system is a \npriority and a place we should not be afraid to invest additional \nresources. There are parts of this legislation that I would like to see \nreceive more funding, but this bill, like most legislation, is a \ncompromise. As a result, this bill does reduce the total authorized \nfunding under the Justice for All Act, but I believe it does so \nresponsibly. I also believe that many of the changes advanced by this \nlegislation will help states, communities, and the federal government \nsave money in the long term.\n  The programs created by the Justice for All Act have had an enormous \nimpact, and it is crucial that we reauthorize and improve them. It has \nbeen 12 years since this law was updated, and we must work together to \naddress the challenges currently facing our Nation's justice system.\n  I thank the many law enforcement and criminal justice organizations \nthat have helped to pinpoint the needed improvements that this law \nattempts to solve and I appreciate their ongoing support in seeing it \npassed.\n  Today, we rededicate ourselves to building a criminal justice system \nin which the innocent remain free, the guilty are punished, and all \nsides have the resources they need to advance justice. Americans \ndeserve a criminal justice system which keeps us safe, ensures \nfairness, and fulfills the promise of our constitution. This bill will \nbring us closer to that goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/24/senate-section/article/S1000-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1000-S1001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         SENATE RESOLUTION 372--CELEBRATING BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND (for herself, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Reid, Mr. Brown, Mrs. \nMcCaskill, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Casey, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Coons, Mr. Portman, \nMr. Wicker, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Warner, Mr. Booker, Mr. Carper, Mrs. \nShaheen, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Reed, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \nFranken, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Nelson, Mr. Kaine, Ms. Warren, Mrs. Boxer, \nMr. Cardin, Mr. Bennet, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Markey, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. \nPerdue, Mr. Burr, Mr. Moran, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Paul, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \nPeters, Mr. Scott, Mr. Tillis, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Isakson, \nand Mr. Leahy) submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, 74 years ago, President Roosevelt signed \nExecutive Order 9066. That order led to the mass internment of nearly \n120,000 Japanese Americans. Executive Order 9066 is an example of what \ncan happen when a government acts out of fear.\n\n[[Page S1002]]\n\n  Today I am submitting a resolution that recognizes this dark chapter \nand calls for the Senate and all Americans to uphold the lessons \nlearned from the issuance of Executive Order 9066.\n  In the wake of the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941, Americans of \nJapanese ancestry living in the United States became a target of \nparanoia, suspicion, and fear. Without any evidence of subterfuge, the \ngovernment classified Japanese Americans as ``enemy aliens'' based \npurely on race and removed Japanese families from the west coast in the \nname of national security. These were families like yours and mine--\nfarmers, students, shop owners, Buddhist priests, and teachers, parents \nand grandparents working toward the American dream of giving their \nchildren a better future. The majority were American citizens. These \nfamilies were forced to abandon or sell for a pittance homes and \nbusinesses they had spent decades building. Many destroyed family \ntreasures that could link them to Japan.\n  Thousands of college students had their educations cut short when \nthey were forced to leave school for the internment camps.\n  One University of Washington student who was forced to leave school, \nGordon Hirabayashi, would go on to challenge the legality of the \ninternment all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Gordon's parents had \nemigrated from Japan and settled in Washington State, where they were \nfarmers.\n  Upon the signing of Executive Order 9066 and subsequent orders, the \nHirabayashi family and tens of thousands of other Japanese American \nfamilies were forced to pack up only what they could carry for a long \ntrain ride to unknown destinations. Upon arriving at barren and \nisolated internment camps, including Honouliuli Internment Camp in \nWaipahu, Oahu, these families passed through barbed-wire fences and \narmed guards. They settled in cramped, hastily constructed shanties \nthat let in the elements. There was little privacy. And until these \ninternment camps were built, many families were forced to live in horse \nstalls. The shame and humiliation were extreme. Nearly 120,000 men, \nwomen, and children did the best they could under harsh circumstances, \npersevering through what at the time seemed unbearable.\n  Despite this treatment at the hands of their own government, the time \ncame when many joined the war effort. From behind barbed wire, these \nyoung Japanese American men fought for their country and in the \nprocess, in doing so, proved their loyalty to the United States.\n  The Army agreed to form the segregated 442nd Regimental Combat Team, \nthe 100th Battalion, and the Military Intelligence Service. Thousands \nof men in Hawaii and across the internment camps, including our late \ncolleague Senator Daniel K. Inouye, volunteered to take on the most \ndangerous missions in Europe. Today, the 442nd and the 100th Battalion \nremain the most decorated units in the Army's history. These units, as \nwell as the Military Intelligence Service, were awarded the \nCongressional Gold Medal in 2011.\n  After the war ended, for all of the sacrifice Japanese Americans were \nforced to make, for all they had to give up, each internee was then \ngiven $25 and a train ticket to their prewar residences. Many of them \nnever returned to their homes because there was nothing to return to.\n  It was not until 34 years later, due to the work of the Japanese \nAmerican Citizens League and other individuals and groups, that \nPresident Gerald Ford issued Proclamation 1447, which formally \nterminated the authority of Executive Order 9066. The Ford proclamation \nread, in part, ``I call upon the American people to affirm with me this \nAmerican Promise . . . to treasure liberty and justice for each \nindividual American, and resolve that this kind of action shall never \nagain be repeated.''\n  While the internment is now recognized as one of the darkest periods \nin our Nation's history, we must not forget that Executive Order 9066 \nhad widespread support at the time. The fight for formal recognition of \nthese injustices has been a long and challenging road that continues to \nthis day.\n  I wish to recognize the efforts of three Japanese Americans--Gordon \nHirabayashi, Minoru Yasui, and Fred Korematsu--who were convicted and \nimprisoned while bravely challenging the constitutionality of \ninternment during the war. They were right, but it took decades of work \nto achieve justice for these individuals who took their cases all the \nway to the Supreme Court.\n  In the majority opinion of Korematsu v. U.S. in 1944, the Supreme \nCourt found that the internment was justified during a time of war--a \nruling that further underscores what can only be characterized as the \nrampant fear and racism at the time.\n  I had the privilege of meeting Fred Korematsu and his family several \ntimes before his passing in 2005. After the war, he, Gordon, and Minoru \ncontinued to fight for others' civil rights their whole lives. Fred's \nwork is carried on by his daughter, Karen Korematsu, through the \nKorematsu Institute. These three individuals were years later awarded \nthe Presidential Medal of Freedom, and in Minoru Yasui's case, only \nlast year.\n  It was not until the 1980s--almost 40 years after internment ended--\nthat a new generation of attorneys and scholars took up their fight. \nThey uncovered evidence that the government hid information that proved \nthat Japanese Americans were not a threat to the United States. Gordon, \nMinoru, and Fred appealed their earlier convictions, and the Ninth \nCircuit Court vacated all of their convictions in the 1980s.\n  Gordon said after the Ninth Circuit overturned his earlier \nconviction:\n\n       There was a time when I felt that the Constitution failed \n     me. But with the reversal in the courts and in public \n     statements from the government, I feel that our country has \n     proven that the Constitution is worth upholding. The U.S. \n     Government admitted it made a mistake. A country that can do \n     that is a strong country. I have more faith and allegiance to \n     the Constitution than I ever had before.\n\n  Today, I call upon all of my colleagues to uphold Gordon's faith in \nour Constitution.\n  Undoubtedly, the U.S. Government must keep people safe. However, as \nwe learned with the internment, a government gripped by fear and \nhysteria can make terrible mistakes. Not one American of Japanese \nancestry who was interned has ever been found guilty of sabotage or \nespionage.\n  Focusing on the most vulnerable of targets--usually a minority \ngroup--does not make our Nation safe or more secure. Actions like the \ninternment betray our values and undermine our strength as a people.\n  We are often reminded to learn from history. That presumes we are \naware of the relevant history. The story of internment remains one \nstill unfamiliar to many Americans--for instance, Mayor David Bowers of \nRoanoke, VA, who used the internment as justification to suspend \nassistance to Syrian refugees. He later apologized. More recently, \nGeorge Takei's play ``Allegiance,'' which just ended its Broadway run, \ndepicted the shock, humiliation, anger, and resolve of one family--the \nKimuras--who were interned in Heart Mountain, WY. Their internment was \nlike that of thousands of other Japanese Americans, and, like too many \nothers, the internment didn't end for the Kimuras when World War II \nended. Their family relations were irreparably damaged.\n  Yet, despite efforts to educate a new generation of Americans through \nefforts like ``Allegiance,'' today we hear echoes of the sentiments of \n1942 directed toward members of the South Asian, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu, \nArab, and Middle Eastern communities. There are reports of children \nfrom these communities beaten up in schools, families being threatened \nin their homes, and houses of worship vandalized and set on fire. We \nhear calls from public figures and officials to racially profile and \nconduct surveillance on Muslim Americans, as well as to bar their entry \ninto our country.\n  While the security of the American people is a top priority, divisive \nproposals to ban all Muslims, for example, from entering the United \nStates do nothing to make us safer; rather, they take us back to a time \nwhen our policies were guided by fear, stereotypes, and mistrust.\n  Now is not the time to turn on one another. Now is the time to stand \ntogether against the hate and fear that divides our country.\n  In affirming our commitment to liberty and justice for all, let us \nremember that the United States is a diverse\n\n[[Page S1003]]\n\ncountry in which individuals of all backgrounds have and continue to \nmake positive contributions to the well-being and security of our \nNation. It is important to speak out against hateful rhetoric and \ndivisive policy proposals that prey on people's fears and instead \npromote our American values that are rooted in compassion, respect for \nothers, justice, and equality.\n  I am joined today in the Gallery by advocates from the Asian American \nand Pacific Islander and Muslim communities. Mahalo to all of you for \nthe work you do every day to advance equality, liberty, and justice for \nall.
