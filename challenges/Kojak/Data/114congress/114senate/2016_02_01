Mr. President, the senior Senator from Alaska knows \nthat reform is urgently needed to modernize America's energy policies \nfor a new era, with new challenges and new opportunities. Under her \nleadership, the energy committee has worked hard the past year to \nachieve that aim. The committee convened listening sessions, the \ncommittee held oversight hearings, the committee worked hard and worked \nacross the aisle focusing on areas of common ground that can move our \ncountry forward.\n  That constructive and collaborative process ultimately resulted in a \nbroad bipartisan energy bill, the Energy Policy Modernization Act. It \ncleared committee with the support of more than 80 percent of the \nSenators, Republicans and Democrats alike, including the top energy \ncommittee Republican, the Senator from Alaska, and the top energy \ncommittee Democrat, the Senator from Washington. Both recognize the \nimportance of preparing our country for the energy challenges of today \nand the energy opportunities of tomorrow.\n  They are also committed bill managers. I ask colleagues to continue \nworking with them as they have amendments. Talk to the Senators from \nAlaska and Washington and get your amendments dealt with. This is \nbipartisan legislation that provides a commonsense approach to help \nAmericans produce more energy, pay less for energy, save energy, all \nwithout raising taxes or adding to the deficit.\n  So let's keep working and move the process forward. Let's keep \nworking to pass this bipartisan bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/01/senate-section/article/S405-7", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\nCongratulating The Nfl's Nfc Champion Carolina Panthers and the Arizona \n                               Cardinals\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Last week, Senator Tillis and I agreed to a friendly--or \nnot so friendly--wager on the NFC championship game. The terms of that \nfriendly wager are that the loser would\n\n[[Page S406]]\n\ndeliver a congratulatory speech on the Senate floor and wish the winner \nluck in the Super Bowl. Unfortunately--even tragically--this is what \nbrings me before you today. It is also why I am wearing this unsightly \nblue tie, which I am sure is an assault on the senses of C-SPAN viewers \nall over the world.\n  It is with all sincerity that I wish the Carolina Panthers luck as \nthey play the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 50. The 15-1 NFC \nchampionship season has been nothing short of remarkable. Led by head \ncoach Ron Rivera and the sensational quarterback Cam Newton, the \nPanthers have been a dominant force all season long as they certainly \nwere against the Arizona Cardinals. I have no doubt we will see the \nPanthers' explosive offense continue to have success in Super Bowl 50. \nWhile I could go on about the Panthers' impressive offensive line and \ncoaching staff, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate \nmy Arizona Cardinals on an exceptional season that included numerous \nmilestones. The Cardinals' wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald wrote \nrecently that the Cardinals ``broke the mold of what kind of football \npeople expect to be played in the desert.'' Witnessing this team \nachieve a franchise record of 13 regular season wins and a No. 2 seed \nin the NFC, Arizonans could not agree more.\n  Perhaps there is no better example of the Cardinals' toughness and \nnever-say-die attitude than their thrilling January 16 overtime win \nover Green Bay. After an improbable Hail Mary touchdown pass from Green \nBay quarterback Aaron Rodgers to send the game into overtime, the \nCardinals--boosted by two amazing and memorable plays by the legendary \nLarry Fitzgerald--scored the game-winning touchdown to advance to the \nNFC championship game.\n  I have always been proud to count myself among the most loyal and \nspirited Cardinals fans, and I am confident Arizona will continue to \nsee exciting Super Bowl-caliber performances in the season to come.\n  Congratulations to Arizona Cardinals' president Michael Bidwell, head \ncoach Bruce Arians, and the members of the 2015 Arizona Cardinals on a \nbanner season. I also recognize Larry Fitzgerald, Carson Palmer, \nPatrick Peterson, Mike Iupati, Justin Bethel, Calais Campbell, and \nTyrann Mathieu, known as the Honey Badger, for being selected to \nrepresent the Cardinals in the Pro Bowl this year.\n  All season long, these two teams stood among the best in the NFL. On \nany given Sunday, anything can happen. Unfortunately, for my Cardinals \nlast Sunday was not their day.\n  Senator Tillis, you may have gotten the best of me this year, but I \nhave a good feeling this is not the last time one of us will stand \nbefore the body to offer our congratulations. You would be wise to get \na head start and purchase a Cardinals' red and white tie now because \nyou will be standing in my shoes this time next year. I guarantee it.\n  To Carolina Panthers head coach Ron Rivera, the NFL's probable MVP \nCam Newton, and every member of the Carolina Panthers football team, \ngood luck on Sunday. To my beloved Cardinals, thanks for an exciting \nseason. I look forward to your bringing a Super Bowl trophy home to the \nvalley next year. Go Cards.\n  Mr. President, I gladly yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                        Welcoming the New Pages\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, before I begin my remarks, I want to \nwelcome the new pages to the Senate. We said goodbye to a great group \nof young men and young women from around the country last week, their \nlast day being Friday. Here we are on Monday, and we have a whole new \nbatch.\n  So to you all, through the Chair, welcome. Know that you are here at \na most exciting and interesting time. We rely on our pages a great \ndeal, and it is always nice to see these young ambassadors who come to \nus from around the country to serve us in the Senate. Welcome.\n  Mr. President, I wish to give an update as to where we are on the \nstatus of our broad bipartisan energy bill. Last week we started out a \nlittle rough because of the blizzard, the snow days. But once we began \nthe debate, we heard some very strong statements in support of our \nEnergy Policy Modernization Act.\n  We heard it from Members on both sides of the aisle, and that was \nvery encouraging. We heard Members tout provisions that relate to \nsupply, to innovation, to efficiency, really the whole gamut.\n  As we promised, we began an open amendment process, which has already \ndrawn close to 200 proposals now. Last week we accepted 11 amendments. \nWe had three rollcall votes, and we had eight voice votes. I think it \nis important to recognize that those amendments were sponsored by 10 \ndifferent Senators. They were cosponsored by many, many others, and \nthey really add to the Members whose priorities we have seen \nincorporated into the energy bill through the process that we had in \ncommittee. So the benefit of really getting back to regular order, \nwhere you have good, robust committee work, then being able to come to \nthe floor, to go through the amendment process, and then to gain input \nfrom other Members is kind of good, old-fashioned governing. I like the \nfact that we are back to it.\n  We agreed to boost our efforts to develop advanced nuclear energy \ntechnologies. This came to us by way of an amendment from a very \ndiverse group. Some might not have anticipated the collection of \nSenators that this advanced nuclear energy technology measure brought \ntogether. It was the two Senators from Idaho, Risch and Crapo, and we \nhad Senator Booker, both Senator Kirk and Senator Durbin from Illinois, \nas well as Senator Hatch and Senator Whitehouse. With this amendment, \nwe have all different perspectives in terms of political perspectives \nas well as geographic.\n  We also agreed to a proposal from Senator Daines and Senator Tester \nthat will help facilitate the use of clean, renewable hydropower in \ntheir State of Montana.\n  Among others, we agreed to an amendment from Senator Capito and \nSenator Manchin to study the feasibility of an ethane storage and \ndistribution hub in this country. I think that is a real possibility as \na result of the shale gas revolution.\n  We moved through 11 amendments. Eleven is a good number, but, \nhonestly, I would have hoped that we would have been able to process \nmore amendments last week. What we are going to do this week--and I am \ngoing to put everybody on notice--is that we are going to redouble our \nefforts. I want to move forward and process even more over these next \ncouple of days.\n  Our staffs have been extraordinarily busy over this weekend, as have \nI and as has been Senator Cantwell, my ranking member. We were going \nthrough all of the amendments that have been offered to the bill, \ndetermining which ones we can clear, which ones we need to bring up for \na vote, and which may not be offered at all. We are moving right along, \nand that is good. We need to keep moving right along because we know \nthat time on the floor is not unlimited. As important as the energy \nbill is and as important as modernizing our energy policies are, we are \nnot the only show in town here. There are Members and there are other \ncommittees that are either on deck or want to be on deck. They are \nwaiting for their turn and are waiting to move to advance their bills.\n  If we still have Members who are thinking about filing amendments, I \nstrongly encourage that be done today. We have dozens of options to \nvote on. So at this point, unfiled amendments are really at a \ndisadvantage, just given all that we are dealing with. Know that we are \ngoing to process as many amendments as possible, but the window for \nadvancing them is closing rapidly.\n  Many of the amendments we are seeing would address opportunities and \nchallenges from across the energy spectrum. I really am thankful for \nthe Senators who have come forward with very, very constructive \nsuggestions and for their work to make this bill even better.\n\n[[Page S407]]\n\n  As we resume consideration of this legislation today, I also want to \nexplain how the provisions that are already within the Energy Policy \nModernization Act will help our country. I want to do that today--to \nspend a few minutes this afternoon--by explaining how it will benefit \nmy home State of Alaska, how it will help Alaskans produce more energy \nand more minerals, how it will help Alaskans pay less for their energy, \nand how it will boost Alaska's economy at a time when we really need a \nboost.\n  The most obvious place to start is with supply. Alaska, as all my \ncolleagues know, is a producer for the rest of the country--really, for \nthe rest of the world. That is our legacy. It is also our future. That \nis because we are blessed with an amazing abundance of resources that \nmost States--and, really, even most countries--cannot even dream of. \nYou name the resource, and there is a pretty good chance that we have \nit. In fact, there is a pretty good chance that we have a lot of it.\n  How will our bill help Alaska produce more energy and minerals? For \nstarters, it boosts hydropower development. Hydropower right now \nprovides 24 percent of our State's electricity, which is good and \ncritically important. There are however more than 200 promising sites \nwith untapped hydropower potential. So our commitment to this clean, \nrenewable resource and our efforts to improve the regulatory process \nfor it could benefit communities throughout the southeastern part of \nthe State, the south-central part, and the southwest. It provides \nbenefit for all.\n  Our bill also streamlines the approval process for LNG exports. The \nPresiding Officer knows full well the benefit that this will bring to \nthe country, but it will also ensure that in Alaska our efforts to \nmarket its stranded natural gas can proceed in a timely manner without \nFederal delay, which is extremely important for us as we move forward \nwith our efforts to move Alaska's natural gas.\n  It will also help Alaskans harness more of our geothermal potential. \nWe have enormous quantities of geothermal, but we have some challenges, \nas you know, with our extensive geography. But we are looking to \ndevelop a renewable resource that could potentially help power one-\nquarter of our States' communities, particularly in some very remote, \nhigh-cost energy States.\n  Our bill also reauthorizes a program to advance the development of \nelectricity from ocean and river currents as well as tides and waves. I \nhave mentioned before that Alaska has some 33,000 miles of coastline. \nThat is a lot of area to harness the power of the tides and waves. \nThere is considerable potential to generate electricity from our \nextensive river systems as well.\n  So working to do more with our marine hydrokinetic and our ocean \nenergy could really provide a boost to projects that are showcasing \nsome new technologies, such as those that we have proposed in Igiugig. \nYakutat is looking at a project south of Kenai and along the Yukon \nRiver.\n  Within the bill we also promote the production of heat and \nelectricity from the tremendous biomass resources within our forests, \nwhich could help the development of technology to aid the construction \nof wood pellet plants across the State, again taking that resource that \nis there and helping to reduce our energy costs. It will also renew a \nresearch program to develop Alaska's immense resources of frozen \nmethane hydrates. This is something they sometimes call fire ice. It \nhas significant promise as a secure, long-term source of American \nenergy, but making sure that we are able to move out on that research \nis going to be important.\n  Then there is a subtitle on minerals, a very important part of our \nbill. I spoke on Thursday that we have incorporated much of the text of \nmy American Mineral Security Act, which is designed to focus on our \nNation's deepening dependence on foreign minerals and the concern that \nwe do not want to get in the same place with our minerals that we once \nsaw with oil, where we are reliant on foreign sources to supply the \nthings that we need.\n  We are obviously known in Alaska for our oil production, but Alaska \nalso has nearly unparalleled potential for mineral production. We had a \nhearing last year before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nand we had the deputy commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural \nResources, Ed Fogels, testify. He said: If Alaska were a country, we \nwould be in the top 10 in the world for coal, copper, lead, gold, zinc, \nand silver. He also noted that we have the potential to produce many of \nthe minerals that we import from abroad. One example is our State \ngovernment has already identified over 70 deposits of rare earth \nelements just within the borders of the State. As I mentioned last week \non the floor, we use rare earth for everything from renewable energy \ntechnologies and smartphones to defense applications. Right now in this \ncountry we are not producing any of that supply--none of that supply on \nour own--yet we have the potential to do so in Alaska.\n  If we pass this bill, our Nation will begin to place a much greater \npriority on resource assessments so that we can understand what we \nhave. If we have not done an inventory, if we have not done an \nassessment, how do we really know the extent of our mineral resources?\n  We will finally make some commonsense reforms to improve our \nnotoriously slow Federal permitting system, which could benefit some of \nthe projects that we have that we would like to get moving on. We have \na project on Prince of Wales Island called Bokan Mountain that has rare \nearth potential. We also have a graphite deposit near Nome, and making \nsure that we help some of the changes that we see within this bill will \nbe important.\n  As we produce more of our natural resources, Alaskans will benefit \nsignificantly. We will see new jobs created, new revenues will be \ngenerated for our State's treasury, and local energy costs, which is \nthe next area I want to focus on, will decline, allowing Alaskans to \nkeep more of their money for other purposes and needs. This is an issue \nwhen I am at home and I am talking to Alaskans about what their No. 1 \nconcerns and priorities are. I do not care what part of the State I am \ntalking to folks. It is all about the high energy costs and what we can \ndo to make a difference. What can we do to bring down our energy costs?\n  The Energy Policy Modernization Act will not only boost our energy \nsupplies, but it is also designed to help lower the costs of energy and \nto help lower the cost of energy for Alaskans. We are an energy and a \nmineral producer in the State, but due to our vast geography, energy is \nstill extremely expensive in many parts of the State. It is always an \neyepopper for people to do a comparison of what is going on with energy \ncosts. Right now in the lower 48, people are enjoying going to the \nfilling station and seeing prices that are less than $2 a gallon. I was \nin Nome, AK, just a few weeks ago, and they are paying over $5.50 a \ngallon at the pump. It is not unusual that in many of our communities \naround the State, we are still looking at $5 a gallon for fuel. This is \nnot only fuel for your vehicles or your snow machine or your four-\nwheeler to move you around or for your boat. It is also your stove oil \nand how you are keeping warm.\n  So it is moving around, keeping you warm, and you are paying \nextraordinarily high costs. In many cases, our electricity costs are \ntwo to three times higher than in most other States. When we think \nabout what it means to live in a community where effectively 40 to 50 \npercent of the household budget goes to stay warm and to keep the \nlights on--what does that leave for educating your kids, for feeding \nyour kids, and for retirement? It does not leave you with much when you \nare spending half of your income to stay warm and to keep your lights \non. This is part of the reality in Alaska that every day we work to \naddress and every day we work to make a difference.\n  State Senator Lymon Hoffman is from the Bethel region and has been a \nvoice for rural Alaska. He sent me a letter last year. He wrote that \n``the high cost of diesel and home heating fuels are just crushing'' in \nrural Alaska and that he believes ``the energy situation is the single, \nmost important problem facing the lives and well-being of rural \nAlaskans.'' I agree with him. That is why we worked so hard within the \nEnergy Policy Modernization Act to make sure that as we are modernizing \nour energy policies, we are working to do everything we can to lower \nthe costs of energy for Americans and for Alaskans. We reauthorized the\n\n[[Page S408]]\n\nWeatherization Assistance Program, which provides our State with \nfunding to improve the energy efficiency for low-income families' \nhomes. We also renewed the State Energy Program, which allows Alaska to \ninvest in energy efficiency, renewable energy, emergency preparedness, \nand other priorities.\n  As we have heard talked about on the floor, we have an entire title \nof the bill--Senator Portman and Senator Shaheen have been working on \nthis--devoted to efficiency for everything from voluntary building code \nimprovements to the retrofitting of schools. As our vehicles, our \nappliances, and our homes are all becoming more energy efficient, that \nin turn works to reduce energy consumption as well as energy costs \nthroughout the State.\n  This bill also has a provision to promote the development of hybrid \nmicrogrid systems. I get excited about this part of the bill because I \ncan see the direct application in my State. It allows communities to \nutilize local resources and storage technologies. Microgrids are \ncritical within the State of Alaska. We have multiple dozens of \nisolated communities that are not connected to anybody's grid. In fact, \nthey are hundreds of miles from anything that could even be considered \na grid. So how do they get their energy? They are basically burning \ndiesel to meet their electricity needs. So what we are seeing come \ntogether are energy solutions where you take a little bit of wind and \nperhaps a little bit of hydromarine, hydrokinetic, coupled with battery \nand storage, and we are finding some solutions. It is innovative. In \nfact, it is so innovative we have a hearing scheduled over the \nPresidents Day recess up in Bethel, AK, so Members can see what we are \ndoing when it comes to energy innovation and coupling things together \nto make them work.\n  We are never going to be part of a big energy grid in many parts of \nour State. We have had some great successes--such as Kodiak, a huge \nfishing port, which now produces 99.7 percent of its electricity from \nrenewables. They have wind, they have hydro, and they have a storage \nsystem that has allowed it to work. But think about it. This is a major \nfishing port which, during the summer, needs a lot of energy when they \nare processing the fish. During the winter months, the local people \nthere do not have energy needs that are as high as the demand during \nthe summer. So how do you even this out? How do you make it meet during \nthe highs and the lows? This is what Kodiak has done. They have taken \nthemselves, as a community that was once 100 percent dependent on \ndiesel for their energy needs, to being 99.7 percent on renewables.\n  One of the best provisions in the bill to help address energy costs \nis a modification that we make within DOE's Loan Guarantee Program. \nInstead of allowing only major corporations to apply, we allow States \nwith energy-financing institutions to seek funding and to advance a \nrange of energy projects.\n  Just to give a little context here, if the bill becomes law, the \nState of Alaska would be able to apply for a loan guarantee and then \nuse those funds to help rural communities finance small hydropower \nprojects, geothermal wells, MHK technology, marine hydrokinetic \ntechnologies, and the hybrid microgrids that I have been talking about. \nSo instead of these top-down, government-driven programs, we would see \nthe State DOE programs and other elements contained within this Energy \nPolicy Modernization Act leveraging the innovation of local people--\nleveraging the innovation of Alaskans, the American people, and the \nprivate sector--to improve our energy landscapes.\n  These are just a few of the ways that this Energy Policy \nModernization Act will help Alaskans produce more energy, save energy, \nand reduce local energy costs. In the process, the extra gain and \nbenefit is that we create new jobs, generate new revenues, and provide \nother economic benefits we sorely need right now.\n  I have talked about Alaska and the impacts on my State as a result of \nmodernizing our energy policies, but know that as Alaska benefits, \nother States benefit as well. Many of the provisions I have mentioned \nin my comments this afternoon are just as applicable in Louisiana, \nMaine, Arizona, and Montana as they are in my State. This bill will \nfairly bring economic benefits to every State, and as it brings \neconomic benefits, the energy security that stems from the economic \nsecurity that leads to the national security makes us all stronger--yet \nanother reason I encourage the Senate to work with Senator Cantwell and \nme over these next couple of days to move forward this broad, \nbipartisan effort to modernize our Nation's energy policies.\n  Mr. President, I know we have Members who are anxious to speak this \nafternoon. Again, I will make the same request I made earlier: If \nMembers are interested in submitting any amendments to the Energy \nPolicy Modernization Act, now is the time because we are going to be \nmoving--and hopefully moving quickly--so we can proceed with some \nexpediency and efficiency throughout this week.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                        Welcoming the New Pages\n\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I wish to echo the comments Senator \nMurkowski made in terms of the new pages. We welcome all of you. We are \nexcited about having you here. It is a big change to go from the \nprevious pages to the new pages. We are excited about how things are \nmoving along. As many people will tell you around here, pages end up \ndoing great things. I have served in the House, and I have served in \nthe Senate. There are Members of the House who started as pages, and \nthere are Members of the Senate who started here as pages. So we are \nproud of you and expect good things of you.\n  Mr. President, it has been over 8 years since we passed a \ncomprehensive energy bill. A lot has changed since then.\n  I first want to thank Senators Murkowski and Cantwell for their \nleadership and hard work. I know both of them worked very hard to find \ncommon ground. Senator Murkowski is my chairman of the Interior \nDepartment Appropriations subcommittee, and she is always trying to \nfind a way for us to work together to move that appropriations bill \nforward. The same thing is true of Senator Cantwell's very good \nleadership on the energy committee. They both had a very tough job, and \nthey crafted an energy bill that I believe moves us forward.\n  This legislation isn't perfect, but it is bipartisan and it is moving \nus in the right direction. I am pleased that my bill, the Smart Energy \nand Water Efficiency Act, was included in this legislation. All too \noften, treated water is lost. A lot of it is wasted because of leaks \nand broken pipes. My State and many States have had historic droughts. \nWe need every drop of water we can get. We can't afford leaking pipes. \nWe have to do better, and we can do better.\n  This bill supports the Federal pilot projects to develop water and \nenergy efficiency technology. We can create a smart grid of technology \nto detect leaks in pipes even before they happen. This is critical to \ncommunities all across our Nation. Saving water is saving energy. \nTreating and transporting water is energy intensity. The more we waste, \nthe more we pay--now and later.\n  I also plan to file an amendment I have been working on with a number \nof other Senators. This amendment, like the House Energy bill, \nauthorizes the WaterSense Program at EPA. The WaterSense Program is to \nwater efficiency what the ENERGY STAR label is to energy efficiency. \nProducts and services that have earned the WaterSense label have to be \nat least 20 percent more efficient without sacrificing performance. It \npromotes smart water use and helps consumers decide which products are \nwater efficient. By authorizing this valuable program, we will make the \nWaterSense Program permanent and help consumers save water energy and \nmoney.\n  We face great challenges, and one thing is very clear: Our energy \nfuture depends on investment in a clean energy economy. We have to be \nbold, we have to be innovative, and we have to encourage investment in \nthe kind of creativity and enterprise that change the world and move us \nin the right direction. So today I am proposing a new initiative that \nwill help us make those investments: clean energy victory bonds.\n  During the First and Second World Wars, our country faced threats we \nhad\n\n[[Page S409]]\n\nnever faced before. We rose to the challenge. We gave it everything we \nhad. Everyone contributed. For many, that included investing in victory \nbonds. They helped pay for the costs of war--$185 billion--over $2 \ntrillion in today's money. Folks lined up to buy those bonds. That is \nthe spirit of the American people--to pull together. It was true then, \nand it is true now.\n  Today, we face a very different threat, but it also requires us all \nto come together to face our challenges and to fight. National security \nexperts tell us that rising global temperatures are one of our greatest \nsecurity concerns. In 2015, global temperature records were shattered--\nrecords that were set just the year before. Climate change threatens \nagriculture, public health, water resources, and weather patterns. We \nare already feeling the impacts. In New Mexico, temperatures have been \nrising 50 percent faster than the global average, not just this year or \nlast year but for decades. We have had historic drought. We have had \nthe worst wildfires in our history.\n  The science is clear: The threat is growing, and time is running out. \nWe must act. Governments are working together to reduce emissions, as \nwe saw in Paris last month. The United States is leading, with \ncommitments from over 140 nations to reduce their emissions. This is \nproviding a major signal in the marketplace and is driving up interest \nin investing in clean energy. Over the next 5 years, 20 nations will \ndouble their renewable energy research to $20 billion. Industry is \nstepping up to the plate as well, pledging to invest at least $2 \nbillion in clean energy startups. This is progress. This is momentum. \nOur job now is to keep it going. Investment--public and private--is the \nkey.\n\n  My amendment is very simple. It directs the Secretaries of Treasury \nand Energy to submit a plan to Congress, to develop clean energy \nvictory bonds--bonds all Americans could invest in. These bonds would \nraise up to $50 billion. That money could leverage up to $150 billion \nto invest in clean energy technology and would create over 1 million \nnew jobs.\n  People across the country want to do their part. They want to invest \nin a clean energy future and to help fight climate change. But most of \nthem can't afford clean energy mutual funds with $1,000 or $5,000 \nminimums. Many can't afford $25 or $50. We must invest in jobs and \nhealthier communities. Clean energy victory bonds will provide that \nopportunity. We can do this without any new taxes on individuals or \nbusinesses. Bonds are completely voluntary, and they are an opportunity \nfor ordinary Americans who see the challenge and who want to do \nsomething about it.\n  Here is how it works: Like war bonds, clean energy victory bonds \nwould be U.S. Treasury bonds backed by the full faith and credit of the \nU.S. Government. Investors will earn back their full investment--plus \ninterest that comes from energy savings to the government--and loan \nrepayments for solid projects. The investment would make a critical \ndifference in our energy future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this effort. We face a great \nchallenge, and we have a great opportunity. Now is the time for action. \nThe American people want to pitch in and do what they can to fight \nglobal warming and to help ensure that the United States leads the \nworld in the clean energy economy. Support for this amendment is \ngrowing with groups like the American Sustainable Business Council and \nGreen America. Americans are already asking where they can purchase \nthese bonds.\n  This Energy bill is a good step, but it is a modest step. Our energy \nand climate challenges demand much more. Again, I thank Chairman \nMurkowski and Ranking Member Cantwell. They have managed to move a \nbipartisan bill and keep the process on track. I urge them to accept my \namendment and to further strengthen this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate the leaders who have worked \non this bill--Senator Murkowski and Senator Cantwell--and the good work \nthey put into it. I have served on the Energy Committee and now serve \non Environment and Public Works. Those are important committees as we \nwrestle with how to produce energy at lower prices that is healthy for \nour Nation.\n  As we consider this Energy Policy Modernization Act, I want to focus \non a critical point about public policy and what is a primary goal of \nthe United States of America. We are in a very competitive world. \nEnergy is a big part of how we compete on manufacturing, production, \nand jobs. The American people want us to focus on that.\n  In addition, energy impacts everybody when they fill up their tank \nand when they drive to work. It is important when it comes to paying \nthe electric bill or the heating bill at home. Is it expensive or \ninexpensive? The price of energy has a dramatic impact on the quality \nof life for American people to a degree that is almost impossible to \nascertain. When the price of gasoline is cut in half and somebody has a \nlong commute every day, they may have had $200 a month in gasoline \nbills and now it is $100. They have $100 extra in their pocket. Without \ntaxes, without insurance, and without house payments to be paid out of \nthat, they can use that to take care of their own personal needs--their \nfamily, their vacation, going out to eat, or just paying down that \ncredit card that has been run up too high.\n  For decades Republicans have called for producing more American \nenergy. Our Democratic colleagues have attacked those proposals that \nwould increase the supply of energy, claiming that these efforts are \npart of some corrupt deal with big oil companies to make them rich at \nthe expense of the taxpayers and the American citizens. That has been \nthe argument. You have heard it for the last 30 years. But is that the \ncorrect way to analyze the challenges we face? Is that the way to \nestablish good, sound public policy that will produce more American \nenergy and bring down the cost?\n  Our Democratic colleagues objected to the Keystone Pipeline. We had a \nnumber of votes over a number of years, and finally it passed, and then \nthe President vetoed that. What would the Keystone Pipeline do? It \nwould produce another source of oil for the United States of America. \nIs that good or bad for big Texas oil companies? It is bad for those \ncompanies. It made it harder for them to get a higher price. There is \nanother substantial competitor pouring another supply of oil into the \nUnited States.\n  This was not a corrupt deal to try to benefit some big oil company \nbut a way to make the supply more plentiful, to bring down the cost of \nenergy for American people. That is what we were fighting for, and it \nbaffled me to no end that the President finally vetoed it at the end, \nafter the American people so clearly favored it.\n  The Federal ban on drilling in the Gulf of Mexico--we had the \nDeepwater Horizon disaster in 2010. There is no doubt about that. This \ncountry really focused on it. Great effort was made to find out how it \nhappened and how we could prevent it in the future. Eventually the \nObama administration said they were reopening production in the gulf--I \nthought it took longer than necessary.\n  There is now onsite, according to a government official, a cap, and \nif the Horizon Disaster were to occur again, that cap within matter of \ndays could be taken out, and it would successfully have stopped that \nblowout as well. We didn't have it in advance. We should have had it. \nBut that is fixed, and other things were done, and the President said \nwe are going to open up drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. It wasn't so. \nThey referred to it as a de facto moratorium. They still couldn't get \napproval, and we lost a lot of production that went to other places \naround the globe.\n  More production means lower prices. More American oil means more \nAmerican jobs and more revenue for the Federal and State governments \nthat benefit from that and a smaller wealth transfer from Americans to \nsome foreign country which may be hostile to us and from which we have \nto buy our oil. We should look to head in that direction.\n  Additionally, the Obama administration recently placed a moratorium \non new leases for coal mined on Federal lands. I believe the \nadministration has bypassed Congress and the will of the American \npeople by drafting regulations that seriously constrain the use\n\n[[Page S410]]\n\nof coal as an energy source. We just have to use coal. It is a \nmagnificent energy source. We can do it and are doing it cleaner year \nafter year.\n  Closing producing coal mines reduces American energy competition and \ncertainly increases the cost of everyday living for Americans, and it \ncertainly causes economic dislocation where mine after mine is being \nclosed and United Mine Workers are being laid off.\n  I have always believed in and fought for increased energy production \nfor the American people--not for big oil companies but because greater \nproduction brings down price. We know now that is true because we have \nseen a worldwide increase in supplies, which has resulted in a dramatic \ndecrease in the price of oil--an amount below what anyone may have \nexpected. This price collapse affects Americans at the gas pump every \nday. Gas prices are the lowest they have been since 2008. The national \naverage as of last week was $1.84. This is half of what it was a few \nmonths ago. This has been my goal and the goal of my Republican \ncolleagues and a lot of Members on both sides of the aisle.\n  In addition, we have increased oil production throughout the country \nwith new fracking technologies. We have had battle after battle over \nthat, but we have never had water supplies that have been impacted \nadversely by fracking. It is a highly efficient technology. It also \nhelped collapse the price of oil.\n  We have had good, bipartisan support for efficiency breakthroughs \nover the years. They have caused us to have a car that uses a little \nless gas, houses that are more efficient, and other energy sources that \nare more efficient. As a result, we have needed less oil. That also \nhelps increase the supply as the demand increases. That has been a \npositive step toward seeing the collapse in prices.\n  If Big Oil were so powerful, how is it that the price of oil has gone \nfrom $140 a barrel to $30 a barrel? They dictate the price. They can \nset the price at whatever they want it to be. Not if the supply starts \ncoming in in large numbers. The prices begin to decline. It was at $140 \na barrel, and now it is at $30, $35 a barrel.\n  The energy industry supports 9.8 million U.S. jobs, which represents \n8 percent of the U.S. economy. Low energy costs are critical to advance \nAmerican manufacturing. Without affordable, efficient, and reliable \nenergy sources, American companies cannot supply their factories and \nemployees with the kind of production we want to see.\n  In a recent investment report, Standard & Poors wrote that affordable \nenergy is critical to give U.S. manufacturers ``a competitive edge over \noverseas competitors.'' We have lower energy prices than Europe, Japan, \nand South Korea. That is an advantage. We want to keep that advantage.\n  We need more American jobs, not fewer. We need to see fewer offshore \nincidents than we have seen. We need to have some onshoring, some \nreturn of manufacturing to America. If we can keep our energy prices \nlow, that is a way our businesses can take advantage of that and expand \ntheir production of various products, many of which can be sold around \nthe world.\n  The President's agenda, which he has carried on since the beginning, \nhas had the effect of really helping foreign countries by keeping our \nprices higher than they should be and blocking reasonable efforts to \nadd more production in America. Instead of American energy being \npromoted at home and abroad, Iran is able to export oil more freely, \nthanks to the President's flawed nuclear deal. Instead of promoting the \ngeneral welfare of the United States, the President has limited the \nproduction of domestic oil, further increasing costs for consumers. \nRegulators have delayed American production many times.\n  These are important dynamics, along with nuclear power. I believe \nthis is a very valuable part of the American energy production. I have \nbeen a strong advocate of nuclear power for years, and Republicans have \ntoo. It is a direct competitor to Big Oil, to carbon fuel, and we need \nmore of that. So I think we need to remember that.\n  Yes, wind and solar are getting more competitive, but it still \nremains for the most part more expensive in most places in the country. \nI hope it will continue to drop in price. Maybe it will. But I can't \nimagine we will see dramatic decreases any time soon. If we were to \nshift America immediately to a total solar and wind power system, \nprices would go through the roof. It would hammer Americans far more \nthan we have ever seen before.\n\n  I think this bill has many good qualities. It helps improve \nefficiency and innovation, and maybe we can build on it in a way that \nwill bring America to the point where we can produce more American \nsupply, keep prices down, help revitalize our manufacturing base, and \nput this country in a position to compete far more effectively in the \nworld marketplace.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n20 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I wish to address an issue that the \nSenator from Alabama touched on before he leaves the floor. I am here \nto speak about the Florida Everglades, but since the Senator just \nraised the issue of the Gulf of Mexico, which is certainly an interest \nof his, just as it is for the Acting President pro tempore, the Senator \nfrom Louisiana, I just want to clarify something and make sure the \nSenators understand that this part of the Gulf of Mexico, which is off-\nlimits to drilling up to and through 2022, has nothing to do with the \nObama administration. It has to do with a law that Senator Martinez and \nI passed in the last half of the last decade.\n  Now, why did we do that? Well, it would be nice to say that we were \nprescient and understood that when the oil spilled into the gulf off of \nLouisiana--relative to the whole spill, a little oil got into Florida \nand covered up Pensacola Beach and got into Perdido Bay, Pensacola Bay, \nChoctawhatchee Bay and went as far east as Panama City Beach; the \nsugary white beaches that so many people visit were just covered with \ntar balls--as a result, a whole tourist season was lost, not just for \nPensacola, Destin, Sandestin, and Panama City Beach but for the entire \ngulf coast of Florida down to Clearwater Beach, Sarasota, Fort Myers, \nNaples and for the farmost beaches on the west coast of Florida on the \ngulf and Marco Island. Now, if that were not enough, I just want the \nSenator to understand why we are so opposed to drilling off the coast \nof Florida. Clearly, there is the economic reason. So much of the \nenvironment got messed up, and it was unhealthy for the critters that \nget into the estuaries. Here is the ringer, and the Senator from \nAlabama will especially appreciate this because he has, at times, been \nmy leader on the Armed Services Committee. The Gulf of Mexico off of \nFlorida is the largest testing and training range in the world for the \nU.S. military, and every admiral, general, and the Secretaries of all \nof the branches will simply tell you that we cannot have drilling \nactivities where we are testing and training some of our most \nsophisticated weapons.\n  Why do we have all of those training, tests, and evaluation \nactivities at Eglin Air Force Base, Tyndall Air Force Base, and the \nNaval Training Center in Panama City? I didn't even include Pensacola \nand Whiting Field and all of the Department of Defense. When we shut \ndown the U.S. Navy's testing range of Vieques, off of Puerto Rico, \nwhere did the fleet of the U.S. Navy go? They went to the gulf. They \nwill send squadrons coming down to Key West Naval Air Station and stay \nthere for a week or two because when they lift off the runway of Boca \nChica, within 2 minutes, they are over a protected area so they can get \ninto their training and testing activities.\n  I will finally say to my friend--and I am not sure that my colleague \nhas ever been able to see this through the eyes of someone who is \ntrying to protect the defense assets in the State of Florida----\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the Senator----\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I will yield to the Senator for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator is a great friend, and we have a couple of \ngood battles going on right now where we stand shoulder to shoulder, \nbut for the most part the area that was approved for production was \nshut down\n\n[[Page S411]]\n\nwhen the problem with Deepwater Horizon was fixed rather than expanding \nthat into Florida where the Florida waters, which Senator Nelson has \nbeen an effective advocate for, would not allowing drilling there. I do \nbelieve we have a situation where we have agreed and proved that this \nkind of problem would not occur now. I do believe there is a tremendous \nadvantage for America, and we can have an advantage of low energy for \nAmerican workers, for our jobs, and that way we will not send money \nabroad.\n  I thank Senator Nelson for his good comments. He is highly informed \non this issue. It is a pleasure to serve with him.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. He knows how \naffectionate I am toward him as a friend. I appreciate that friendship \nand that willingness in a bipartisan way--even when we had all kinds of \nthorny issues, such as national missile defense in the Armed Services \nCommittee--that the two of us could work it out.\n\n\n                           Florida Everglades\n\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about the Everglades, and \nI need to start by saying that the Army Corps of Engineers began \nreleasing water from Lake Okeechobee into the two rivers on either side \nof the lake. The problem is that we have a dike--not like the one that \nMother Nature intended, where the whole surrounding of Lake Okeechobee, \nwhich is the largest lake in Florida, was nothing but a marsh. That is \nhow Mother Nature had it. But after people moved in--and then in the \nlate 1920s, the hurricane that drowned 2,000 people--we came in there \nand diked all the way around it. Well, the dike is only so structurally \nsound so that as the water rises in the lake, there is more water \npressure on the sides, and if you start getting above 15 feet of depth \nof the lake, we have to worry about the dike collapsing and all the \nflooding of the surrounding towns and people and farmlands. So you get \nthe picture.\n  So the Army Corps of Engineers has to give some relief. So they \nrelease water to the east into the St. Lucie River and to the west into \nthe Caloosahatchee River, and as a result, it relieves the dike \npressure problem. But since Lake Okeechobee is so polluted, until we \ncan get it cleaned up--and there is an effort--what happens when it \ngoes into these pristine estuaries to the east into the St. Lucie and \nto the west into the Caloosahatchee, is that you get much too much \nnutrient content into those estuaries. The salinity in those estuaries \ngoes down, which is harmful to things like oysters and certain fish, \nand the nitrogen and phosphorous and other pollutants come up. And what \nhappens? Algae grows. When algae grows, it sucks up the oxygen from the \nwater, and it becomes a dead river. The mullet can't jump because there \nis no mullet, the fish hawk can't dive because there is no fish, and it \nbecomes a dead river.\n  Now, that is why it is so necessary that we proceed with the \nEverglades restoration projects that will help us clean up the \npollution in Lake Okeechobee, and at the same time when the dike \nstructure gets threatened, we will have a place to send that water \ninstead of directly into those two estuaries. That is presently being \nbuilt on the east--a storage area--and it is to be built on the west \nover near LaBelle on the Caloosahatchee River. Well, it is just another \nreason why many of us are fighting so hard to complete these Everglades \nrestoration projects, so that impossible decisions that face the Corps \nof Engineers right now--that either they threaten the dam and hold it \nback or they release the polluted water and kill the rivers--are not \nchoices that the Corps has to make. It is certainly not a good choice \nfor our environment and for all the people who live in the surrounding \narea. So Everglades restoration must move forward aggressively and \nwithout delay, and that is why this Senator is going to be introducing \nlegislation tomorrow to expedite that process. It is going to be called \nthe Everglades for the Next Generation Act. It will authorize all of \nthese Everglades restoration projects that the Army Corps of Engineers \nhas deemed ready to begin. It would allow the Corps to begin work on \nthem immediately instead of having to wait around for us to pass \nanother water bill. Remember, we just passed a water bill. When was the \nlast time we passed a water bill? It was 7 years ago. We just can't \nwait that long. There is too much at stake, and this is why we want to \nget these all bundled up, so the Army Corps of Engineers can proceed.\n  The Everglades, for the first three-quarters of the last century, was \ndiked, drained, and deferred, and now we are trying to bring back as \nmuch of that plumbing and reverse it so that it will flow much more \nlike Mother Nature had intended it and did for eons and eons. It is a \nmonumental task. We have to look at what we are doing to protect this \nland that we love that has been called the ``river of grass.'' We have \nto do everything we can to protect it. But right now, beware. The \nNational Park Service has in front of it and is evaluating a proposal \nfrom a Texas-based company for drilling and fracking activity. This \ncompany is looking to conduct--this is what they say: Oh, this is just \na seismic survey--first on 70,000 acres, but it is just the first part \nof seismically mapping the entire Big Cypress National Preserve. This \nis a national preserve of 700,000 acres, and where is it located? It is \nlocated right next to the Everglades National Park, which is 1.5 \nmillion acres, but it includes hundreds of thousands of other acres \nthat are part of this water discharge area where we are cleaning up \nthat water as it is coming south.\n\n  They will say: Oh, this is just a seismic survey. But what do we have \nseismic surveys for? To drill. By the way, this is a company in Texas \nthat not only drills for oil, it also fracks for oil. Why in the world \nwould we want this to happen? Why would we spend hundreds of millions \nand billions of dollars to restore the Everglades and then suddenly \nturn around and hand it off to a Texas wildcatter to go out there and \ndrill--a wildcatter that is also a fracker.\n  This Senator has nothing against fracking. Where is our fracking \ndone? It is done in the hard shale rock of the Dakotas, of Oklahoma, of \nTexas. They go down under high pressure and shoot water and chemicals \nto break up the shale rock. It is solid rock. What does the State of \nFlorida sit on? It sits on a porous honeycomb of limestone, and that \nporous rock is filled with freshwater near the surface.\n  So people wanted to go in there and start doing high-pressure \nfracking that we do successfully to shale rock, which was done by the \nDan Hughes Company. They were given a permit by the State of Florida. \nThen the county commission of Collier County found out about it and \nstarted raising Cain, and suddenly the pressure became too great \nbecause of what that fracking would do, with the high-speed chemical \ngoing into that porous limestone, not only to the water supply of \nFlorida but to the very foundation of Florida. If you ever look and \nenvision a piece of coral that our divers go down to look for in some \nof the national reefs--we have seen that beautiful coral, and it builds \nup. That is very similar to how Florida was formed: Over years, over \nand over, those corals and shells and skeletons and limestone that \ncreated that substructure holds up the State of Florida and contains a \nbubble of water, which is our Floridian aquifer.\n  Some people think a seismic survey is no big deal, but watch out. It \nis just like the proverbial camel getting its nose under the tent. \nWatch out. That camel is pretty soon going to be in the tent. So why \nconduct a huge, prolonged seismic survey if we don't have the plans to \nextract the resources that are found? Why would the Federal Government \napprove risky behavior such as fracking and a brandnew type of seismic \nsurvey equipment in an area we have spent decades trying to restore? \nRemember, I said it is the Everglades National Park, 1.5 million acres. \nRight next to it, to the west, is the Big Cypress National Preserve, \nanother 700,000 acres. To the north are all of those protected lands of \nthe water recharge area, hundreds of thousands of acres.\n  All of this is why I wrote to the Interior Secretary asking her \nagency to complete a very thorough environmental review of this \nproposal. It is interesting. I wasn't the only one who responded. The \nNational Park Service told me they had received about 8,000 comments \nduring the public comment period. It seems to me that is a pretty clear \nsign that there is a great deal of concern and controversy out there in \nthe public interest and especially those\n\n[[Page S412]]\n\nin Collier County. My colleagues can't imagine the political backlash \nwhen this Dan Hughes oil company--not the one that is applying for the \nseismic survey but they were a wildcatter as well as a fracker, that \nDan Hughes company--my colleagues can't imagine the political backlash \nthat occurred from people of both parties. I can tell my colleagues \nthere was backlash, especially from the Republican county commission in \nCollier County, when they found out there was fracking going on out \nthere without their knowing about it and without any of their input \ninto whether it should have been done.\n  Fortunately, the outcry was so severe that the State of Florida \nfinally revoked the permit and they had to pull out. They had--that \ncompany--performed an unauthorized acid stimulation procedure, which is \na glorified term for fracking. So we rose up and we fought that. Again, \nI say to the Senate, this Senator does not have a problem with fracking \ndone environmentally well, but fracking in all of our oil reserves has \nbeen done in the shale rock. That is what has made it possible to, in a \nfew years, be able to completely eliminate our dependence on foreign \noil. This Senator has no problem with that. This Senator is thankful \nfor that, but when we try to perform that procedure on a different kind \nof substrate--a porous limestone filled with water--then we are \ncourting economical and environmental disaster.\n  I must say, this didn't stop some in the State Legislature of Florida \nwho are determined to open parts of Florida to companies looking to \ndrill. To make sure all of this local opposition doesn't get in their \nway, State legislators in session right now in Tallahassee have \nproposed a bill that would prohibit a county, a city or any other local \ngovernment from limiting fracking within that city or county's borders. \nSuch a decision, under this proposed legislation, would be left up to \nthe State only. It is not hard to figure out how that is going to turn \nout, especially since it was the State of Florida that gave a permit to \ndo the fracking that there was such a reaction to 2 years ago.\n  This is one of the most pristine areas on the planet. I urge my \ncolleagues to join our efforts to protect this unique environment for \ngenerations to come.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                       Transparency in Government\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the Founders of our great land believed in \ntransparency of government because they believed that only an informed \ncitizenry was in a position to consent to what the government was doing \non their behalf. The very legitimacy of our government is based on that \ninformed consent. It is also important for the voters to be able to \nhold elected leaders politically accountable. Of course, they can't \nhold their elected leaders accountable for something they don't know \nabout or something hidden from their view.\n  It is no understatement to say that the American people's confidence \nin the Federal Government is at if not an alltime low, certainly a new \nlow in recent memory. Unfortunately, they see the President acting \nunilaterally, where he should be working on a collaborative and \ncooperative basis with Congress to pass legislation rather than to try \nto do things by Executive action. Then we see where elected officials \nand members of the administration have made blatant misrepresentations \nof the facts only to be proven wrong and then are not even embarrassed \nby it.\n  So it is important to have transparency in government, to have an \nopen government. The American people need to know what their government \nis purporting to do on their behalf so they can approve or disapprove \nas they see fit. That is the foundation of our democracy and our \nRepublic.\n  Back in October I stood on the floor of the Senate and outlined \nconcerns I had about the evolving scandal involving Secretary Clinton's \nuse of her private, unsecured email server during her service as \nSecretary of State. I said at the time that her behavior not only \nviolated the President's promise to be the most transparent \nadministration in history--I remember him making that statement during \nhis first inaugural address--but it also represented a violation of the \npublic trust. Now we learn of very serious national security concerns \nwhich I am going to speak about in just a moment.\n  Because we know that the Department of Justice is headed by the \nAttorney General--a political appointee of the President of the United \nStates who serves at the pleasure of the President--and because of the \nconflict of interest by asking Attorney General Lynch to investigate \nand perhaps even prosecute somebody in the Obama administration, I \ncalled upon the Department of Justice, and the Attorney General in \nparticular, to appoint a special counsel to investigate the matter, \ngiven those obvious conflicts of interest. Of course, we read in the \npaper and understand from testimony before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee just recently by Director Comey of the FBI that the FBI is \nconducting an investigation into this matter, as they should. For \nmyself, I would say the FBI, notwithstanding what I have said about the \nFederal Government's poor reputation generally--that the FBI is still \nvery widely respected for its integrity, as it must be, but the FBI \ncannot go further and convene a grand jury to consider potential \nviolations of the criminal law. That can only be done by a court at the \nrequest of a prosecutor with the Justice Department.\n  If we are going to be true to the promise of equal justice under the \nlaw--those are the words carved above the entryway to the U.S. Supreme \nCourt--if we are going to be true to that promise, we have to be able \nto demonstrate that the same rules and the same laws apply to everybody \nin this country, whether a person is the President of the United States \nor whether a person is one of our Nation's humblest citizens. We are \nall equal before the law--or at least we should be--and it is a \nviolation of the public trust when people act as if the rules that \napply to everybody else don't apply to them.\n\n  So far the Attorney General has declined to appoint a special \ncounsel, but I think that even in the interim, since I first made that \nrequest and it was declined, we see why it is even more important today \nthan it was back in October.\n  The Obama administration has demonstrated time and time again \nprecisely why we need the decisionmaking in this case as far removed \nfrom White House politics as it can possibly be. For example, in \nOctober the President went on television and publicly opined on the \nresults of the ongoing criminal probe. He said, ``I don't think it \nposed a national security problem.'' That is the President of the \nUnited States. Based on his comments, one might reasonably conclude \nthat the White House was somehow privy and in consultation with the FBI \nabout their ongoing criminal investigation. Subsequently, I had a \nchance to ask Director Comey whether in fact that was the case, and he \nsaid absolutely not. I believe Director Comey.\n  It is not a little matter when the President of the United States is \nsaying ``I don't see a problem here'' when he actually doesn't even \nknow the facts, and it might appear that he is trying to influence the \nconduct of that investigation. That is a real problem. In fact, the \nPresident's comments were out of line--offering his opinion on what the \nresults of an ongoing criminal investigation might or should be.\n  Since that time, we found out that Secretary Clinton had 18 emails \nbetween herself and the President on her private email server. I don't \nknow whether the President still feels like this is not a problem, but \nit is a big problem.\n  I earlier outlined the publicly reported evidence and explained the \nvery real likelihood of criminal violation on the part of Secretary \nClinton and her staff. Since then, my concerns--that the information \nheld and sent by Secretary Clinton contained some of the most sensitive \nclassified information of the U.S. Government--have been confirmed.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, several of my colleagues received a letter from the \ninspector general of the Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence, the agency whose core mission it is to integrate all the \nintelligence operations of the U.S. Government. That letter was\n\n[[Page S413]]\n\nsent in response to one from the chairman of the Select Committee on \nIntelligence and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nabout the security of Secretary Clinton's private email server. What \nthe inspector general said should give us all pause. He said that there \nwere ``several dozen e-mails containing classified information.''\n  As we know, there are several different levels of classification for \ngovernment correspondence, some more sensitive than others, but the \ninspector general went on to say that these emails were ``determined by \nthe [intelligence community] element to be at the Confidential, Secret \nand the Top Secret/SAP level.'' That ``SAP'' term may be a new one to a \nlot of people, but it is an acronym that means special access programs. \nIt is the most sensitive classified information known to the U.S. \nGovernment, and it is a classification even above ``top secret.''\n  Access to special access program information is so highly restricted \nin part because it exposes information about programs that are \nincredibly sensitive to national security, such as how intelligence was \ngathered in the first place, sources, and methods--some of which would \nbe jeopardized, if not individuals killed if it was known that they \nwere providing a source of intelligence for the U.S. Government. In the \ncase of special access programs from an intelligence agency, that means \nexposing this information would put intelligence collection and, as I \nsaid, potentially human sources at great risk.\n  On Friday, more news regarding the type of information that was on \nSecretary Clinton's server was announced. It was widely reported for \nthe first time that the State Department admitted that it had \ncategorized at least 22 emails found on Secretary Clinton's server as \n``top secret''--that is the agency she was responsible for that said 22 \nemails were top secret.\n  I think it is pretty obvious, even based on the public reports--most \nof which were generated from information produced as a result of a \nfreedom of information lawsuit in Federal court--I think it is pretty \nobvious that her email server did contain information that jeopardized \nour national security.\n  Let me digress for a second to talk about a new development, a new \nconcern that was raised by this information that some of these \ndifferent classifications of information were contained on her private \nemail server. The fact is, there are three different government email \nsystems. There is the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network--known as \nthe SIPRNet--which is used by the Defense Department and some other \ngovernment agencies and which is separate and apart from the Internet. \nIt is also separate and apart from the usual government system called \nthe Nonclassified Internet Protocol Router Network, NIPRNet. The \nSIPRNet is secret and separate, and the NIPRNet can be used to send \nemails outside the government on a government email server. Then there \nis a third type of system known as JWICS. This is the Joint Worldwide \nIntelligence Communication System, which is even more sensitive than \nthe information contained on the SIPRNet, which I mentioned earlier. If \nsomehow, as appears to be the case, information got from the SIPRNet or \nJWICS onto a NIPRNet system or onto a private email server system, it \nwould have to be physically transferred because they are not connected. \nPart of their security is that they are maintained as independent \nsystems. The concern is that highly classified information from SIPRNet \nor the super-secure JWICS somehow jumped from those closed systems to \nthe open system and turned up in at least 1,340 Clinton home emails.\n  In an article in today's New York Post, the author points to \nSecretary Clinton's Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills or Deputy Chiefs Huma \nAbedin and Jake Sullivan because in one of the emails that has been \nmade public, Clinton pressured Sullivan to declassify cabled remarks by \na foreign leader.\n\n       ``Just email it,'' Clinton snapped, to which Sullivan \n     replied: ``Trust me, I share your exasperation. But until ops \n     converts it to the unclassified email system, there is no \n     physical way for me to email it.''\n       In another recently released email, Clinton instructed \n     Sullivan to convert a classified document into an \n     unclassified email attachment by scanning it into an \n     unsecured computer and sending it to her without any \n     classified markings. ``Turn into nonpaper w no identifying \n     heading and send nonsecure,'' she ordered.\n\n  One gentleman associated with Judicial Watch, which has been one of \nthe entities that have filed the freedom of information litigation \nwhich has produced the huge volume of emails contained on Secretary \nClinton's server, said, ``Receiving Top Secret SAP intelligence outside \nsecure channels is a mortal sin.''\n  So, as one can see, these are not trivial matters; these are very \nserious matters.\n  It is important to remind folks that this issue was even made worse \nbecause it is likely that some of our adversaries had access to and \nmonitored her private email server. We have heard many of our Nation's \ntop national security and intelligence leaders indicate that is likely.\n  Recently, Secretary Gates, whose long service to our country includes \nbeing Defense Secretary under President George W. Bush and President \nBarrack Obama, as well as high-level jobs in the CIA, said, ``I think \nthe odds are pretty high'' that Russians, Chinese, and Iranians had \ncompromised Secretary Clinton's server.\n  Here we are now knowing that information on that server not only \nincluded classified information but information classified at the \nhighest level known to the Federal Government.\n  On Friday, given these reports, President Obama's Press Secretary, \nhis chief spokesman, Josh Earnest, was asked about the status of the \ninvestigation and if he believes Secretary Clinton would be indicted. \nIt would have been easy enough for him to say ``No comment'' or ``We \nare not privy to the investigation because it is being conducted by a \nlaw enforcement agency and that is the way these things are done,'' but \ninstead he said, ``Some officials have said she is not the target of \nthe investigation'' and that an indictment ``does not seem to be the \ndirection in which it is trending.''\n  As with the President's reckless remarks on television in October, \neither the White House has information they should not have about the \nstatus of this ongoing criminal investigation by the FBI or they are \nsending a signal to the FBI and the Department of Justice that they \nwant this to go away. It is hard for me to interpret these comments by \nthe President and by his Press Secretary as anything other than trying \nto influence the FBI and the Department of Justice on the outcome the \nadministration prefers. That is completely inappropriate, it is \noutrageous, and it has to stop.\n  Today this Senator is back on the Senate floor where I started months \nago to make the very same point but with a greater sense of urgency and \nwith a lot of new information that has come to light. I believe \nSecretary Clinton has likely violated multiple criminal statutes. For a \nSecretary of State to conduct official business--including transmitting \nand receiving information that is classified as SAP level--on a \nprivate, unsecured server, when sensitive national defense information \nwould likely pass through it, is not just a lapse of judgment, it is a \nreckless disregard for the security of the American people, not to \nmention the lives of our intelligence professionals who are involved in \ngaining this important intelligence. It is important for us to protect \nourselves against our adversaries.\n  In light of the unprecedented nature of the case and of the multiple \nconflicts for the Department of Justice, I can see no other appropriate \ncourse of action but for Attorney General Loretta Lynch to appoint a \nspecial counsel to pursue this matter wherever the facts may lead. That \nneed is underscored by the apparent inability of the White House to \nresist the temptation to try to influence or, at worst, obstruct the \ncurrent investigation.\n  I hope the Attorney General seriously considers my request to appoint \na special counsel given the conflict of interest and the extraordinary \ncircumstances of this case because in the end it is the right thing to \ndo for the American people. If the U.S. Government--including Congress \nand the administration--is going to regain the trust and confidence of \nthe American people, they need to know that the chips will fall where \nthey may and that our law enforcement officials, such as the FBI and \nthe Department of Justice, will pursue these cases wherever the\n\n[[Page S414]]\n\nfacts may lead, that there isn't a separate set of rules for high \ngovernment officials, such as the Secretary of State, and you and me.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to speak on an amendment that I \nsubmitted last week, amendment No. 3140, which is a tripartisan \namendment to the Energy Policy Modernization Act, which is the pending \nlegislation. I submitted the amendment last week with Senators \nKlobuchar and King as my lead cosponsors. Our amendment would support \nthe key role that the forests in this country can play in helping to \nmeet our country's energy needs.\n  The carbon benefits of forest biomass are clearly established. Yet \ncurrent policy uncertainty could end up jeopardizing--rather than \nencouraging--investment in working forests, harvesting operations, \nbioenergy, wood products, and paper manufacturing. Biomass energy is \nsustainable, responsible, renewable, and economically significant as an \nenergy source. Many States are already relying on biomass to meet their \nrenewable energy goals. There is a great deal of support for renewable \nbiomass, which creates the benefits of establishing jobs, boosting \neconomic growth, and helping us to meet our Nation's energy needs. \nFederal policies across all departments and agencies must remove any \nuncertainties and contradictions through a clear policy that forest \nbioenergy is an essential part of our Nation's energy future.\n  With these goals in mind, I have offered a very straightforward \namendment with a group of colleagues who span the ideological spectrum. \nThey include, as I mentioned, Senators Klobuchar and King, as well as \nSenators Ayotte, Franken, Daines, Crapo, and Risch. I am very pleased \nto have all of these colleagues cosponsoring my bill.\n  Our amendment supports the key role that forests in the United States \ncan play in addressing the Nation's energy needs. The amendment echoes \nthe principles outlined in the June 2015 letter that we sent, which was \nsigned by 46 Senators. As the Acting President pro tempore knows, it is \nvery unusual for 46 Senators on both sides of the aisle to come \ntogether in support of a policy.\n  Specifically, our amendment would require the Secretary of Energy, \nthe Secretary of Agriculture, and the Administrator of the EPA to \njointly ensure that Federal policy relating to forest bioenergy is \nconsistent across all departments and agencies and that the full \nbenefits of forest biomass for energy conservation and responsible \nforest management are recognized.\n  The amendment would also direct these Federal agencies to establish \nclear and simple policy for the utilization of biomass as an energy \nsolution. These include policies that reflect the carbon neutrality of \nforest bioenergy that recognize biomass as a renewable energy source, \nthat encourage private investment throughout the biomass supply chain, \nthat encourage forest management to improve forest health, and that \nrecognize State initiatives to use biomass.\n  The carbon neutrality of biomass harvested from sustainably managed \nforests has been recognized repeatedly by numerous studies, agencies, \ninstitutions, and rules around the world, and there has been no dispute \nabout the carbon neutrality of biomass derived from the residuals of \nforest products manufacturing and agriculture.\n  Our tripartisan amendment would help ensure that Federal policies for \nthe use of clean, renewable energy solutions are clear and simple.\n  I am in conversations with the two managers of this important bill, \nthe chairman, Senator Murkowski, and the ranking member, Senator \nCantwell, about our amendment. I hope that it will be adopted, and I \nencourage our colleagues to support its adoption.\n  As I mentioned, Senators Klobuchar and King joined with me last week \nin submitting this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Ayotte, Senator \nFranken, Senator Daines, Senator Crapo, and Senator Risch be added as \ncosponsors to the amendment as well.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Student Loan Debt\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, Senate Democrats announced \nour commitment to end the crushing burden of student loan debt. Our \ncampaign is called ``In the Red'' because we agree with what President \nObama said during his final State of the Union: ``No hard-working \nstudent should be stuck in the red.''\n  My special guest at President Obama's final State of the Union \naddress highlighted exactly this point. Alexis Ploss is a student at \nUMass Lowell. She is a first-generation college student working on a \ndegree in math. She wants to get a master's degree so she can become a \npublic school teacher, but she has already taken on over $50,000 in \nstudent loan debt.\n  Think about that, smart, hard-working students who want to build a \nfuture for themselves and who want to teach the next generation of kids \nare weighing the benefits of more education against the fear of an \nunmanageable debt load.\n  I don't think Alexis will quit, but I want my Republican colleagues \nto explain to me how America is any better off if a young woman doesn't \nget a master's degree and become a first-rate math teacher. How is this \ncountry any better off if young people get scared by debt, quit school, \nand take a job that requires less education?\n  What Alexis and hundreds of thousands of other people like her end up \ndoing will be affected by decisions we make right in this room. If \nCongress does nothing, then Alexis and hundreds of thousands of other \nstudents just get squeezed harder. The debts get bigger, they grow \nfaster, and the decision to give up is just a little closer.\n  Seventy percent of students now need to borrow money in order to make \nit through school. Democrats are here to say: Enough is enough, and \nthat is what this ``In the Red'' campaign is all about. The Democratic \nplan has two basic parts: debt-free college and refinancing student \nloans.\n  There are a lot of ways to get to debt-free college. We can give \nstudents the opportunity to graduate from community college without \nstudent debt by making it completely tuition free. We can increase Pell \ngrants. We can hold colleges accountable for keeping costs low and \nproviding a high-quality education that will help students get ahead.\n  We can also cut the outstanding debt. Some student loans are charging \n6 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent, and even higher interest rates. We \ncould cut those interest rates right now. Democrats are ready to go, \nbut the Republicans are blocking us every step of the way. Instead of \nlowering the cost of student loans, they support the status quo, where \nthe U.S. Government turns young people who are trying to get an \neducation into profit centers to bring in more revenue for the Federal \nGovernment.\n  In fact, Congress has set interest rates so high on loans that just \none slice of those loans--those issued from 2007 to 2012--are now on \ntarget to make $66 billion in profits for the U.S. Government. This is \nobscene. The Federal Government should be helping students get an \neducation, not making a profit off their backs.\n  The main response from Republicans in Congress has been to claim that \nrefinancing wouldn't save students that much money. Really? There are \nmore than 40 million people currently dealing with student loan debt. \nWhen their interest rates are cut, many will save hundreds of dollars a \nyear and some will save thousands of dollars a year.\n\n[[Page S415]]\n\nThat is money that can help someone out of a hole or money to save for \na downpayment on a home or money to pay off those student loans \nfaster--but Republicans say that money is trivial? What comes next? Do \nRepublicans say let them eat cake?\n  Where are all those Republicans who think Washington takes too much \nof our money? These artificially high interest rates are a tax we \nimpose on students to fund government, a tax that keeps hard-working \nyoung people from buying homes, from starting businesses or for from \nsaving for retirement.\n  The Republicans may not want to tax billionaires or Fortune 500 \ncorporations, but evidently they don't mind squeezing students who have \nto borrow money to pay for college.\n  For 2 years now, Democrats have tried to get a bill through Congress \nto lower the interest rate on student loans, and for 2 years the \nRepublicans have blocked this bill. As the Republicans have said no, \nhardworking people who are just trying to build a life have paid and \npaid and paid.\n  So I am here to ask the Republicans: What is your idea? What is your \nplan for how to deal with existing student loan debt? Democrats have \nput a proposal on the table to make college affordable, but I don't \nhear anything from the Republicans except ``no, no, no.'' Well, it is \ntime for change--debt-free college and lower interest rates on student \nloans. That is what Senate Democrats are fighting for, and together \nthat is what we are going to win.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                  Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, on Wednesday of this week, in the dead \nof the night--at least here--the President intends to have his trade \nrepresentative sign the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive trade \nagreement, for our Pacific trading partners. It is the product of fast-\ntrack, a procedure that cleared the Senate. Presumably at some point, \nit will then be advanced to the Congress for approval. The advancement \nwill be the result of the President filing implementing legislation \nthat will move the agreement forward.\n  Even though the President regards this deal as one of his signature \naccomplishments, he is not making the trip. Instead, he has deputized \nTrade Representative Michael Froman to sign the agreement in New \nZealand on behalf of the United States. New Zealand is a long way away.\n  We haven't had much talk about this event. The reason is that the \nAmerican people are very uneasy about it. The American people are not \nhappy with this agreement. The American people, I believe, fully oppose \nit and would oppose it even more so if they knew more about it, and \nthey will learn more about it. So I think there has been an effort not \nto talk about it, to keep the language low, and to see if it can't be \nbrought up some way and passed. I think that would be a mistake.\n  This trade agreement is 5,554 pages long and stacks 3 feet high on my \ndesk, so I would like to point my colleagues to examples of what the \ndeal will do.\n  The American Automobile Policy Council recently issued a report which \nstated that the TPP would threaten 90,000 American automotive jobs \nbecause of its failure to include strong currency protections. This is \njust one of the problems we have. It has to be dealt with. Currency \nmanipulation is exceedingly dangerous. It has very large impacts, and \non a $20,000, $30,000, $40,000 automobile, we are talking about \nthousands of dollars difference through currency.\n  American industries across the board are beginning to oppose TPP. \nMany believe that all of the businesses are for it. But that is not the \ncase. Many American manufacturers would see their future even more \nproblematic under the TPP.\n  Ford released a statement opposing the deal. They argued that the TPP \nis not adequately open and does not adequately open foreign markets to \nU.S. goods.\n  We are going to further open our markets to foreign goods, but we are \nnot going to make the kind of progress that must be made to help our \nexports, which is why we are told this agreement should pass--because \nit is going to open up markets for us. Ford says no.\n  Last week Ford announced they were leaving the Japanese market--Japan \nbeing the key country in this agreement--because they say that Japan \nhas nontariff barriers that have limited their ability to sell cars in \nJapan.\n  For example, in 2015, Ford sold fewer than 5,000 cars in Japan. Ford \nis an international manufacturer. They sell large numbers of \nautomobiles in Europe, in Mexico, in South America, but they cannot \npenetrate the Japanese market. Hyundai, a superb South Korean \nmanufacturer, also not too long ago gave up trying to sell automobiles \nin Japan. It is not tariffs; it is nontariff factors, constructed by \nJapan, that make this happen.\n  Given this evidence, one would hope that the United States would be \nable to negotiate a deal that would support American manufacturing and \nAmerican workers, but that is not the case with the TPP.\n  This is the World Bank's evaluation. The World Bank has concluded \nthat Japan would see an extra economic growth of 2.7 percent by 2030 \nwhile the United States can expect only four-tenths of 1 percent of \nadditional economic growth.\n  The White House's own study--a study they cite with pride, although \nthey omit many of the facts that are set forth in that report--\nconducted by the Peterson Institute for International Economics claimed \nthat TPP will decrease the growth of manufacturing in the United States \nby 20 percent by 2030. In other words, without this deal, manufacturing \nin the United States would grow 20 percent more than if we signed the \nTPP.\n  Is this good for America? Manufacturing jobs are high-paying jobs. \nManufacturing jobs demand resources from the community, and all kinds \nof people support those manufacturing jobs. The products that Americans \nmanufacture are sold in the United States, around the world, and money \nis brought home, and it pours into that community to buy more products, \nmore machines, more gasoline, more electricity, and to pay the workers \nwho work in the plants.\n  You have to have manufacturing in this world. A nation cannot get by \nwithout it. A nation that has the greatest economy in the world, a \nnation that has the greatest military in the world must maintain a \nmanufacturing base.\n  According to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, this \n20 percent reduction in potential growth would result in around 120,000 \nfewer jobs than would have been created otherwise. That is a very large \nnumber--120,000 high-paying, good jobs in manufacturing plants. But \nthat is the President's study. That is his group that they got to give \nthe results he wanted. Trust me--and we are going to show this over \ntime--the predictions for these trade agreements have fallen massively \nshort of what the administration has promised.\n  However, a more critical study by the economists at Tufts \nUniversity--that prestigious university--recently found that TPP would \ncost up to 400,000 jobs in the United States. We are supposed to sign \nthis deal, and it is supposed to make America better, and it is going \nto cost us jobs. That is what the other deals have done. I think this \none is likely to do the same. I wish it weren't so.\n  We need better trade deals. We don't need to enter into trade deals \nthat don't protect the legitimate interest of American workers and \nAmerican manufacturers. Our trading partners, good countries, good \npeople--Japan, South Korea, Philippines, and others--are tough trading \npartners. They are mercantilists. They are not free traders, really. \nThey are out to maximize their exports, and the export market they lust \nafter the most is the U.S. market. That is where they want to export \ntheir products and bring home American dollars. We haven't done a good \njob of defending our interests.\n  The United States already has trade agreements with major Asian \nnations. We have many of them now. How have they turned out? Shouldn't \nwe study\n\n[[Page S416]]\n\nthat? Has anyone talked about that? Have we had hearings on how well \nthey worked out before? No.\n  We haven't really looked into the effects of previous agreements \nbecause we don't want to talk about that. What we want to say in the \nSenate and the House of Representatives is that trade deals are good. \nIf anybody has a trade deal, be for it. That is not a sound way to \nproceed.\n  South Korea is a good ally of the United States. It is a good \ncountry, but they are tough competitors. Our trade deficit with South \nKorea last year from January through November was $26 billion, and by \nthe end of the year, that country alone will be about $28-plus billion. \nThey have not published numbers yet, but estimates suggest that the \n2015 trade deficit will be 15 percent higher than the previous year--\n2014. Is that a good deal for the United States?\n  Trade deficits reduced U.S. GDP, as products that Americans consume \nare made abroad instead of produced here as part of our gross domestic \nproduct. It is not good for economic growth. Our growth fell way below \nexpectations--0.7 percent--in the fourth quarter of this year, and \nevery dollar of trade deficit subtracts from our GDP.\n  Some think we could be heading into a recession. Many people are \nseriously discussing this. Who knows what will happen? We are not in a \nbooming economy; there is absolutely no doubt about it. Wages are down. \nJob prospects are down. We have the lowest percentage of Americans in \ntheir working years actually working since the 1970s. It is not a \nhealthy environment.\n  In 2010, President Obama promised that the South Korean trade deal--\nhe said this when he signed the agreement. They have been promising \nthese kinds of things in advance. It passed, and he signed the \nagreement. I voted for it. I voted for most of these deals, but it is \ntime for us to be honest about it, to evaluate how well they are \nactually turning out. When he signed the deal, he promised it would \nincrease American exports to South Korea by $11 billion a year. That \nwas nice. We would like to have seen that. However, in the 11 months of \nlast year, the United States exported only $1.2 billion more than we \ndid when the deal was signed 6 years ago. The year before that, it was \na $0.8 billion export increase; it was not even $1 billion.\n  What about Korean exports to the United States, what we import from \nKorea? Since 2010, our trade deficit with South Korea has risen nearly \n260 percent, from $10.1 billion in 2010 to more than $26 billion this \nyear. That is a very serious matter. I am very concerned about this \nloss of jobs.\n  I think the American people need to know what is happening. The \nTranspacific Partnership Agreement not only fails to deal with \nmanufacturing jobs in general, but it also fails to include any kind of \nserious measure that would address currency manipulation.\n  During the time President Reagan was President, the economy went \nthrough a tough period, but it rebounded under his leadership. Paul \nVolcker and Reagan's leadership put us on a path of sound, solid growth \nthat went all the way through the 1990s. Mr. Volcker once said a moment \nof currency manipulation can wipe out years of trade agreements with \nour trading partners.\n  Currency is a huge thing. That is why the American Automotive Council \nis concerned about it, why Ford and other manufacturers care about it, \nand why we had a series of votes on the Senate floor to try to do \nsomething about currency.\n  But the powers that be had the ultimate victory. We got to vote for a \nbill that wouldn't become law; that would push back and allow us to \nresist currency manipulation. We got to vote on that one, but they made \nsure it didn't get on the bill that is going to become law--the Trans-\nPacific Partnership Agreement. It was a show vote. The President was \nnot going to execute it, and he threatened to veto it.\n  The Wall Street Journal, on November 5, wrote:\n\n       Mexico, Canada and other countries signaled that they were \n     open to the [currency] deal when they realized it [would not] \n     include binding currency rules that could lead to trade \n     sanctions through the TPP.\n\n  These countries want to be able to manipulate their currency. \nObviously, they agreed to go forward with the trade deal because they \nknew there were no binding currency rules. In fact, last year the \nJapanese Finance Minister, Taro Aso, said that ``there [will not] be \nany change'' in Japan's currency policy because of the provisions \nincluded in the TPP.\n  Some milk toast language got in the agreement. The Senators were able \nto say they voted for a bill that had teeth to it, but that was in a \nseparate bill that would not become law. My currency provisions in the \nbill, the language with real teeth, was stripped out during the \nConference Committee because the President threatened to veto it. It is \nnever going to become law.\n  But the agreement included alongside the TPP is meaningless. Japan \nand others say it is not going to make any change in their currency \npolicy. Japan significantly devalued the yen again recently. China \ndevalued its currency by 6 percent last summer alone, and many expect \nthey will devalue it even further.\n  I have to say, it is time for the United States of America to \nunderstand something. We are the largest economy in the world. We have \nthe greatest military in the world. We need to demand that people who \nsell in our markets--and whose exports to the United States are \ncritical to their economic well-being--don't get to do this if they are \nnot playing by the rules. They don't get to manipulate their \ncurrencies. They don't get to subsidize their manufacturing, and we are \nnot going to allow them to use nontariff barriers to prohibit the \nimports of American products.\n  That is what we need from the leadership in this country--not an \nagreement that allows continued manipulation of currency and that does \nnot deal effectively with the nontariff barriers and subsidies these \ncountries use to take market share away from U.S. companies.\n  What happens to an American business? U.S. Steel just closed some \nproduction and laid off 1,000 workers in Birmingham last year. Is that \nplant going to reopen? We would like to think so, but I doubt it. Once \nthese American plants that get no support from their government to \ncompete abroad are closed, they don't reopen. Our competitors know \nthat, and they take market share. They get to sell more in the United \nStates and bring home strong American dollars.\n  I think it is time for us to slow down on this. We are going to \ncontinue to look at how these trade agreements have worked. I don't \nthink they have worked very well for the American worker. They haven't \ndone very well for American manufacturing. I think few would dispute \nthat this Nation can be prosperous without manufacturing. One time they \nsaid you could do it with a service economy and high-tech economy. \nSaturday's Barron's did a report on a study that has been done about \nour high-tech companies, which we are so proud of and hear so much talk \nabout. What about the job prospects they have for this year? Are they \ngoing to add more jobs to high-tech computer companies in America? No, \nthis analysis said that the information technology companies in America \nwould reduce employment by 330,000 people this year.\n\n  I have to tell you that if we lose automobile manufacturing and steel \nplants, these people are not going to work in computer companies. That \nis one of the biggest misrepresentations I have ever heard. The facts \nare becoming very clear on that. Microsoft laid off over 100,000 people \nthe year before last. We have had a continual decline in high-tech job \ncreation. Oh yes, some plant somewhere is adding jobs, but more plants \nare laying off workers. There is an election going on out there. People \nare concerned about their future. They need to know about the trade \nagreement. They need to be asking their Representatives and their \nPresidential candidates how they feel about it. Which side are you \ngoing to be on? Let's hear the reasons why you are for or against this \nagreement. After they hear that, I think they will be in a better \nposition to decide how to cast their vote.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor as we are moving \nforward, as many of my colleagues know, on this energy package. I thank \nmy colleagues who have already come to the floor today to talk about \nit, and I especially thank Senator Murkowski\n\n[[Page S417]]\n\nfor helping us to move through so many different proposals by our \ncolleagues. We were able to clear some of these amendments by voice \nvotes, and, hopefully, we will be able to move forward over the next 24 \nhours on this bill by getting some votes locked in.\n  One of the things we are going to talk about this week is energy \nefficiency, which is creating jobs and making our economy more \ncompetitive by holding down the cost of energy. Many of us know that \nfor centuries the use of energy has been a very important factor in our \neconomy. Last week I mentioned that the Northwest economy was built on \na hydrosystem. Cheap hydropower has worked for us over and over again, \nas companies that use a lot of electricity have moved to the Northwest. \nWe have stored everything from apples to terabytes of data because of \nthe huge efficiencies that we were able to pull off with cheap \nhydropower.\n  As my colleague from Alaska will say, energy costs are high in Alaska \nand she wants to make sure we are making it more affordable and \nenabling distributed generation, as she just mentioned earlier today. \nEnsuring that we have a microgrid to do that is a key component to how \nthe state will successfully diversify their economy. As we debate this \nbill on the Senate floor, each of us is thinking about the regions of \nour country we represent and how to make sure we are dealing with \nenergy successfully.\n  One important thing I wanted to discuss is that in 2007, for the \nfirst time in our history, the United States actually delinked economic \ngrowth from energy use. Now, our economy is producing more in goods and \nservices, yet it is using less in electricity. The chart behind me \ndemonstrates this.\n  This is a very important point because it shows that we can still \ngrow our economy while consuming and using less energy. This is \nimportant if you are a homeowner and want to use the energy in your \nhome more efficiently, while still having many apps and devices that \nrequire electricity but make your life easier. It is also important for \nbusinesses. As U.S. businesses compete in a global economy, they want \nto produce goods and services and do so in a cost-effective manner. So \nthe more you can drive down energy costs without having to drive down \nconsumption, the better.\n  If we want to continue to compete in that global economy, we must \ncontinue to improve our energy productivity, and that is exactly what \ntitle I of the bill does. The Energy Policy Modernization Act will help \nensure that the Nation is eliminating energy waste and making \nimprovements in new technologies that will improve our competitiveness \nfor the 21st century.\n  Energy efficiency is the cheapest and most affordable energy resource \nbecause it is typically about one-third of the cost of new production; \nthat is, by saving energy at home, by using what we already have more \nefficiently--and there are all sorts of smart ways to do this--you can \nactually spend only one-third of the cost of what it would take to get \nnew production online.\n  In the last 40 years, since the oil embargo, energy efficiency became \nan integral part of our energy policy. We have learned that efficiency \nis not like most other resources that are depleted and consumed. \nInstead, we found that as we keep making progress on energy efficiency, \nwe have created new technologies. These have become the most cost-\neffective ways to cut waste and the most cost-effective ways to take \nthe ``low-hanging fruit'' available in front of us and help businesses \nand homeowners alike.\n  There are two examples of this that we, as the Federal Government, \nhad a hand in: No. 1, automobiles and No. 2, lighting technology. Now \nboth of these were in the previous 2007 Energy bill. Since then, \naverage automobile fuel economy has improved dramatically, from 15 \nmiles per gallon in 1978 to 28 miles per gallon in 2016, thanks to the \nCAFE standards in effect. That was something we pushed here that made \nour automobiles more efficient.\n  With respect to lighting, the latest light-emitting diode, LED, \ntechnology is 6 to 7 times more efficient in energy consumption than \ntraditional incandescent lights and can last at least 25 times longer. \nIn 2012 alone, nearly 50,000 LEDs were installed in the United States, \nsaving an estimated $675 million in annual electricity costs.\n  What we are saying here is that we want to continue to move forward \non energy efficiency. It is saving money for businesses and homeowners. \nWe also want to continue the advancements of these energy-efficiency \ntechnologies and make sure that we are making the right investments. So \nI want to remind my colleagues that there are going to be several ways \nin which we are going to try to build on this progress. Energy \nefficiency must be a major part of our policies here, and I know many \nStates across the country are also making investments in this.\n  So tomorrow I expect us to have a vote on an amendment to establish a \nFederal energy efficiency resource standard, or an EERS.\n  Since its establishment, the Department of Energy has implemented \nsuccessful energy efficiency programs that develop new technologies and \npromote best practices within the major sectors of our energy economy. \nYet many States have used their role to also establish energy \nefficiency standards. Behind me, you will see the number of States that \nhave already developed these incentives for investments in energy \nefficiency by giving utilities an incentive to invest in low-cost, \nenergy efficiency programs before investing in more expensive new \nenergy production. You can see that many of these States across the \nUnited States have adopted such initiatives--25 States with energy \nefficiency resource standards.\n  Why is that important? Well, once you start down the road of energy \nefficiency, you continue to make your grid more efficient, which is \nsomething California has done. California made a huge investment as a \nmarketplace for energy efficiency, and now they continue to be on the \ncutting edge of energy efficiency. They have continued to grow as an \neconomy yet use less energy. In fact, the 19 States with the greatest \nenergy savings in the Nation all have energy efficiency resource \nstandards.\n  So, to me, this is an area of the bill that I think we would like to \nimprove. States are the laboratories of democracy, and because 25 of \nthem have demonstrated the benefits of this policy, I believe it is \ntime the Federal Government should also establish a national energy \nefficiency resource standard. My colleague Senator Franken from \nMinnesota will be offering an amendment to do just that on this bill.\n  The Federal Government could require States to do their part in \nreducing the waste of resources and increasing our Nation's energy \nproductivity by establishing an energy efficiency resource standard \nthat would promote investments in efficiency--everything from cost \neffectiveness in new buildings to production capacity. The proposed \nEERS would set a very modest, easily achievable energy savings target \nthat electrical and natural gas utilities must meet as is already \nrequired in half of these States.\n  The American Council for an Energy- Efficient Economy estimates that \nimplementing the Federal EERS would save $130 billion, or about $1,000 \nper household by 2040. The adoption of this EERS amendment would more \nthan triple the energy efficiency savings benefits of the act before us \ntoday. A Federal EERS would not only save every American money by \nreducing their energy bill, but it would also strengthen our Nation's \neconomic competitiveness by improving our energy's productivity and \nmaintaining our leadership in the commercialization of these products.\n  This is something I learned during my time in the private sector. \nAnytime you can make something that is of value to everybody more \nefficient, such as energy, you are on the winning path; that is, if you \nbecome the experts of constantly knowing how to make everything more \nefficient, whether you are talking about development in China, in \nEurope or in other parts of Asia, the fact that we are experts on \nenergy efficiency by deploying this here in the United States gives us \na winning hand on deploying it around the world. Anytime you can be \nmore efficient, you are also being more cost effective and saving \ndollars. That is what we are pushing in this bill. It will move us \nforward on energy efficiency.\n  As we have seen, energy efficiency--and I am sure Senator Franken \nwill talk more about this tomorrow--is not only commonsense economics, \nbut it\n\n[[Page S418]]\n\nalso has the ability to focus on some of the cleaner sources of energy \nthat we have been discussing too.\n  The Federal Government has had a history of promoting energy \nefficiency, and the government itself, being the single largest energy \nuser in the Nation, could benefit from this. We hope that when we look \nat the Federal Government, we will also be talking about energy \nefficiency products. One of the examples of how Congress directed the \nFederal Government to lead was by the enactment of section 433 of the \nEnergy Independence and Security Act of 2007. This provision \nestablished a Federal leadership role in the development of high-\nefficiency, low-emission commercial buildings by requiring the Federal \nGovernment to phase out the use of fossil fuel energy in Federal \nbuildings and major renovations by 2030.\n  The U.S. Government, as the single largest occupant of Federal \nbuildings in the Nation, should continue, I believe, to demonstrate its \nenergy efficiency as well. I know in the Pacific Northwest we have the \nBullitt Center, which is the greenest commercial building in the United \nStates. We have a hospital in Issaquah that is one of the most energy \nefficient hospitals in the United States, and we have other businesses \nthat are developing these buildings that are smart buildings that are \ndriving down the costs. What does that mean? It means that businesses \ncan invest money into R or into the manufacturing of goods or into \nthe promotion of ideas instead of spending it on energy costs.\n  For us in the Pacific Northwest, someone might ask: With the cheapest \nkilowatt rates in the Nation, why would everybody spend so much time on \nenergy efficiency? We spend so much time on energy in the Northwest \nbecause we know it pays dividends. We know it gives us a competitive \nedge, and we know it continues to put us in the driver's seat with \ntechnology. Even though we have the cheapest kilowatt rates, we \ncontinue to make an investment.\n  These buildings were designed by architects to show what is now \ntechnologically possible and to feature state-of-the-art ground-source \nheating and cooling, both photovoltaic and thermal solar energy \ncollection, and computers that automatically adjust the building \nsystems in order to keep them comfortable and efficient. Some buildings \nhave an elevator that converts kinetic energy from braking into usable \nelectricity. All of these things are about cutting-edge technology. The \nBullitt Center and other buildings like it in the United States \ndemonstrate that it is technologically feasible and cost effective to \nphase out the use of fossil fuel generated energy in new Federal \nbuildings within the next 14 years, as required by current law.\n\n  These are not radical policies. These laws, which were passed in \n2007, are things that I know people here would like to strike and \nrepeal. Let me mention another one we will likely hear about, which is \nthe SAFE Act, offered by our colleagues from Georgia and Colorado. The \nSenators likely will offer this bill for sensible accounting to value \nenergy. This bipartisan amendment was included in the Shaheen-Portman \nbill that would help homeowners account for the energy efficiency of \ntheir home during the mortgage and underwriting process. The average \nhomeowner pays more than $2,000 annually for the energy in their home. \nAfter the mortgage, this is typically the second largest cost in buying \nand owning a home, but it is not accounted for in the mortgage \nunderwriting process. Many of us have gone through this process of \nbuying a home and getting a mortgage. So why can't a homeowner, on a \nvoluntary basis, have their home audited for its energy efficiency \ncharacteristics and have that information accounted for in the mortgage \nunderwriting process? This is what Senators Isakson, Bennet, Shaheen, \nand Portman have introduced in an amendment, and I think it will be one \nof the things we will hear about tomorrow and one of the potential \nvotes we will be having.\n  A recent study from the University of North Carolina found that \nowners of more efficient homes are less likely to default on their \nmortgages. Adopting this amendment creates an incentive for homeowners \nto invest in energy efficiency improvement because those improvements \nwill be accounted for in the underwriting process for their homes. \nOrganizations as diverse as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the Alliance to Save Energy, and the U.S. \nGreen Building Council all support this amendment. So this is another \nidea that is not in the underlying bill that we will be discussing.\n  Today we are here with many amendments that were added last week to \nthis legislation. I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for \ntheir hard work and for continuing to move forward with my colleague, \nthe Senator from Alaska, Ms. Murkowski, and myself in getting through \nthe next couple of days of these policies.\n  I know my colleagues want to continue to discuss this legislation, as \nI do, but we also know there is a limited time that we will be able to \nbe on this legislation. So I urge our colleagues to bring any \namendments to the floor tonight that they would like to have \nconsidered, if they haven't already filed them today.\n  We need to continue to build on the successes of the last 40 years, \ncontinue to cut our energy waste, and de-link our economic growth from \nenergy use so we can make sure we can continue to grow in the most \ncost-effective way, and continue to produce the jobs that these new \nrenewables and energy efficiency opportunities are creating for us. I \nthink this legislation will help give us another foothold toward a \nfuture economy that is cleaner, more efficient, and a better driver of \nU.S. competitiveness on an international global basis for the types of \nenergy solutions that we think will help the world as well.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senate is currently considering a \nbipartisan energy bill that could lead America on a pathway to \nrebuilding our Nation's economy in this century. It has been 9 years \nsince we passed an energy bill and a lot of things have changed.\n  The bill we are considering contains important provisions to build \ndomestic clean energy sources, strengthen energy efficiency measures, \nand modernize our electric grid.\n  This bill also represents a commitment to basic science research at \nthe Department of Energy. I believe it can and should do more than what \nthe original bill proposes. We need more robust support for basic \nscience research--the kind of research that costs too much and takes \ntoo long for any individual company to undertake. We need to invest in \nmedical and basic science research. The investment will pay off for \ngenerations to come.\n  I cochair the Senate National Lab Caucus, and I know that if we \ninvest in research in the National Labs, it will lead to breakthroughs \nthat will help keep America competitive and create good-paying jobs.\n  At Fermi National Accelerator Lab in Illinois, the development of \nsuperconducting wire technology enabled the large-scale manufacture of \nthe magnetic resonance imaging--or MRI--machines doctors use today. \nSometimes it is hard for the scientists and engineers and leaders at \nthese labs to explain in simple words what they are doing and why it is \nimportant. This is an example. They were working on a wire technology \nthat probably didn't mean much certainly to me or to many people, but \nwhen they finished, they came up with an MRI--a brandnew way of imaging \nour bodies to detect illnesses and plot a way to cure them.\n  In the 1970s, the scientists building Fermilab's particle accelerator \ndrove cutting-edge research in superconducting wire fabrication. Rather \nthan patent these advances, Fermilab made them freely available to the \npublic and private sector, opening the door to large-scale \nsuperconducting wire manufacturing by private industry. Since MRI \nmachines rely on superconducting wires, this made commercialization \npossible.\n  Today, MRI machines are widely used to image the human body. Using\n\n[[Page S419]]\n\nMRIs nearly eliminates the need for exploratory surgery, which, of \ncourse, means it is cheaper in the long run and safer.\n  Last month, a new generation of MRI machines at the Illinois \nNeurological Institute saved the life of a 27-year-old farmer from \nCanton, IL, Cody Krulac. Cody had a tumor that was located in the part \nof his brain that would have been difficult to image using old \ntechnology and would have relied on surgery and guesswork, but using \nthe new MRI machine, his doctors were able to pinpoint exactly where \nthe tumor was and exactly how much to remove, meaning Cody spent less \ntime in surgery and recovered more quickly.\n  Another example of the Department of Energy's success can be found in \nArgonne's Advanced Photon Source. Its power x-ray beams enable the \nobservation of extremely small objects in unprecedented detail. This \nallows scientists to see how viruses, such as HIV, replicate and how \ncancer grows. This understanding led to the discovery of a new drug for \nAIDS therapy, a drug called Kaletra, which is now the most prescribed \ndrug in its class for this deadly disease. It also led to the \ndevelopment of a drug, Zelboraf, to treat melanoma. This drug has been \nused by 11,000 patients worldwide and is approved in 43 countries. The \nresearch at this National Lab really paved the way.\n  Building and operating a facility like the Advanced Photon Source is \ntoo expensive and specialized for any single company to do. Only \ninvestment by America in its own Department of Energy can make \nsomething like this possible.\n  Let me give one final example of how the Department of Energy's \nOffice Of Science has had an impact on every American life. Researchers \nfrom Illinois University, Fermilab, and Argonne have teamed up to give \na tenfold boost to normal CT scanning capabilities. The result was a \nnext-generation CT scanner that limits the patient's exposure to \nradiation while giving better images that allow doctors to more \naccurately detect and treat cancer and save lives. This research also \nled to two U.S. patents and spurred an Illinois startup company called \nProtonVDA through the National Institutes of Health small business \ninnovation research grant.\n  These are only some of the Department of Energy's and the National \nLab's success stories, but they are examples that show that this \ninvestment, which cannot be effectively made by most businesses in \nAmerica, can really make America safer, healthier, and pave the way for \nnew businesses and jobs. America's place as a world leader in cutting-\nedge research is at risk if we fail to make the necessary investments \nin basic science research.\n  I want to commend my colleagues in the Senate, particularly Senator \nRoy Blunt, a Republican from Missouri; Senator Lamar Alexander, a \nRepublican from Tennessee; and Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from \nthe State of Washington. They really stepped up when it came to NIH \nresearch--the National Institutes of Health. In this year's budget, we \nare going to have virtually a 5-percent real increase in research--$2 \nbillion of new money going to NIH. I am willing to stake my future in \nthe Senate and tell you that investment at the NIH this year in \nresearch will ultimately lead to breakthroughs that will save lives. \nThis is another area which is equally promising.\n  I remember visiting the Department of Energy a few months back with \nErnest Moniz, our Secretary, whom I respect very much. I told him the \nstory of how I am committed to NIH's basic biomedical research. I said \none example is Alzheimer's.\n  I was surprised when my staff said one American is diagnosed with \nAlzheimer's every 67 seconds. I said: Go back to the drawing board. \nThat can't be true.\n  They went back and came back and said: No, Senator, that is exactly \nright. One in every 67 seconds on average, an American is diagnosed \nwith Alzheimer's.\n  I told that story to Ernest Moniz, the Secretary of Energy, and I \nsaid that is why we need this NIH research.\n  He said: Senator, my Office of Science in the Department of Energy is \ndeveloping the imaging techniques so that we can detect Alzheimer's in \nliving human beings.\n  Currently, the only confirmation of the diagnosis is confirmed in \nautopsy. If we can look at the early onset of Alzheimer's, we can \nbetter respond to it. That is why, if one is interested in curing \ndiseases, in finding ways to avoid expensive surgery, in reducing the \ncost of medicine but still protecting America, this generation of \nlawmakers needs to make a commitment to science research.\n  I have already thanked my colleagues by name who have done so much \nfor the NIH, and I will be offering an amendment with Senator Alexander \nof Tennessee that is going to help increase our commitment to research \nin the Energy bill which is before us. The 4-percent growth in the bill \nis good, but unfortunately it does not protect against inflation. What \nwe are calling for is 5-percent growth over inflation in this \nDepartment. I can guarantee that the breakthroughs that will come from \nthis research will make life better and create more opportunities for \npeople living in this country. We need to have sustained funding to \nensure that cutting-edge research can bear fruit, and we are asking \nthat they maintain this growth period of 5-percent real growth for 5 \nyears.\n  Congress needs to help America's best and brightest do what they do \nbest. This amendment represents an investment that will save lives.\n  I will say parenthetically that this morning I made a trip to \nAtlanta, GA. Every 2 or 3 years, I go down to visit the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention. This agency is not well known or well \nunderstood by most Americans. The Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention in Atlanta, GA, is the first line in America's national \ndefense when it comes to public health threats.\n  We now have a mosquito called the Zika mosquito spreading a virus in \nBrazil to the point where women are being warned that now is not the \ntime to be pregnant. If one of those mosquitoes should sting you and if \nsome of the virus gets into your body, it can cause a miscarriage or \nsome terrible birth defects in the baby. That is how dangerous it is. \nThe frontline of defense in the United States is the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, GA.\n  As I walked through there and met with the pathologists, the doctors, \nveterinarians, and others who work there, I saw this amazing array of \nextraordinary talent, people who were excited about their work, about \nmaking our country and the world safer. The Zika virus, of course, is \nour current threat, but there are many more. They faced the Ebola \ncrisis in Africa, and luckily it did not spread beyond the few \ncountries where it was first reported. So when we talk about \ninvestments in research by the U.S. Federal Government, it is research \nthat is good for us and our families, and it is good for the world.\n  I will be offering this amendment probably this week with Senator \nAlexander and others to increase this commitment to research. It is an \ninvestment that will lead to new breakthroughs in this bill on energy, \nin scientific discoveries, energy innovation, and national security. \nThis amendment strengthens the bill before us and helps us move to our \n21st-century economy in the world. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we have had an opportunity to have a \nfew speakers here this afternoon. Senator Cantwell and I have come to \nthe floor and urged our colleagues to help us as we work to advance the \nEnergy Policy Modernization Act.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \nanniversary of the signing of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.\n  Lilly Ledbetter is an inspiring woman and a courageous trailblazer. \nShe fought the system in her workplace and the courtroom. She was a \nlongstanding and loyal employee at the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company \nfor 19 years. But then she found out that Goodyear thought she was \nworth less than her male counterparts. A jury found Goodyear owed her \nalmost $400,000 in backpay, but the Supreme Court said that she was too \nlate. When Justice Ginsburg read her dissent from the bench, she called \nfor Congress to fix it, so we went to work.\n  It has been over 7 years since we passed this historic legislation. I \nwas so proud to lead the charge in the Senate to keep the courthouse \ndoors open to sue for discrimination. This wasn't an easy road. When we \nlost the first vote on this bill, I called upon the women in the Senate \nand across America to put their lipstick on, square their shoulders, \nand suit up to fight for an American revolution.\n  We did just that, and the Lilly Ledbetter Act became the first bill \nthat President Obama signed into law in 2009.\n  Passing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was a big accomplishment--\nbut our work is far from done. We need to finish what we started by \npassing the Paycheck Fairness Act. The Lilly Ledbetter Act kept the \ncourthouse door open, but the Paycheck Fairness Act will make it more \ndifficult to discriminate in the first place.\n  Women are tired of being paid crumbs. Women still only make 79 cents \nfor every dollar a man makes, and it is even worse for women of color--\nAfrican-American women earn 62 cents on the dollar, and Hispanic women \nearn 54 cents. By retirement, the average woman loses $431,000 to the \npay gap. This affects Social Security, pensions, and retirement \nsecurity. Everybody says, ``Oh you've come a long way,'' but women have \nonly gained 20 cents in 50 years.\n  We will not take no for an answer. We will continue to demand equal \npay for all. We are going to change the Federal law books, so women get \nchange in their family checkbooks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/01/senate-section/article/S421-5", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S421-S422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL SCHOOL CHOICE WEEK\n\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, as National School Choice Week came to a \nclose last week, I want to highlight the important role school choice \nplays in our education system in Arkansas and across the country.\n  I am the proud graduate of Arkansas's public schools and the son of a \npublic school teacher and principal. Throughout my life, I was blessed \nwith wonderful parents, teachers, and coaches who taught the skills, \nknowledge, and values needed for success in the workforce. \nUnfortunately, not all children have the same experience.\n  Dardanelle High School was the right choice for me, but the local \npublic school isn't always the right fit for everyone. Too many \nchildren aren't receiving the attention or education they deserve. This \nis especially true in areas with poor performing schools. But it is not \nalways about the quality of education; sometimes local schools cannot \nmake adequate accommodations for a child's religious beliefs or \npersonal needs. Quite simply, one size fits all isn't the key to \nsuccess for education.\n  That is why I believe in school choice.\n  Parents--not politicians and bureaucrats--know what is best for their \nchildren. We should empower them and ensure they have access to \nalternatives to the traditional public system. This includes home \nschooling, charter schools, and private and religious schools. That \nway, every child will receive the type of education that best fits \ntheir learning style.\n\n[[Page S422]]\n\n  To countless families across America, school choice means accessing \nthe best possible education for their children. By providing school \nchoice, we can promote innovation in our schools, provide more \npersonalized education for our children, and improve racial and \neconomic disparities in educational outcomes.\n  I am pleased to have celebrated National School Choice Week and the \nimprovements that school choice has brought to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/01/senate-section/article/S422-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S422-S423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                        VERMONT ESSAY FINALISTS\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the \nRecord copies of some of the finalist essays written by Vermont High \nSchool students as part of the sixth annual ``What is the State of the \nUnion'' essay contest conducted by my office. These finalists were \nselected from nearly 800 entries.\n  The material follows:\n\n\n              SARA MANFREDI, MILTON HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)\n\n       Before I begin this address, I would like to take a moment \n     to thank all of you for being here today. But, there are \n     issues our country must conquer in order to make our home \n     safer, as well as more equal, for both ourselves, and the \n     generations to come.\n       In recent years, it has come to attention of our government \n     that there have been over 400,000 untested rape kits stuck in \n     backlog all around the country. One precinct held over 5,000 \n     in backlog, all untested, most cases left without any trial. \n     How dare we do this to those hundreds upon thousands of \n     victims? Who are we to deny them any sense of safety or \n     justice? These facts have done nothing more than allow \n     rapists to get out of any sort of punishment. This horrid \n     trend must be stopped, and can only be stopped if this \n     government takes immediate action. The issue with this is \n     that many of these local jurisdictions do not have the money \n     to process these kits, because of the innate lack of funding \n     for said kits to be processed. I am willing to offer more \n     funding through federal grants to these precincts, so these \n     long backlogs can finally be tested, and the victims of these \n     crimes can get the justice they deserve. To ensure this money \n     is used to test these rape kits, I will work with Congress to \n     pass a law into action that will give precincts a time \n     constraint in which they must have these kits tested, most \n     likely within 72 hours. By having this deadline set into \n     place, as well as the money to fund said testing, this \n     national backlog will gradually dwindle down. This justice is \n     owed to the survivors of these vicious assaults.\n       Some victims, however, cannot be given the justice they \n     deserve. A recent influx of mass shootings have killed 380 \n     American citizens, and left hundreds of families in mourning \n     over their lost loved ones. I am not going to say that any \n     one of the perpetrators of the 294 mass shootings in the past \n     year killed because they were lonely, lost outsiders. These \n     killers were not in the right mind, no, but mental health is \n     not to blame. What is to blame is American gun laws. These \n     men were able to commit these heinous crimes because of how \n     accessible guns are in this country. How do we stop this? We \n     restrict and complicate. If we are to ensure the safety of \n     the American public, we must ensure that only those who are \n     specifically trained to use a gun, those who are able to \n     handle one and not go awry are allowed to carry one. Police \n     officers and military personnel should be the only ones to be \n     able to carry handguns at all times for their jobs. Rifles \n     shall be heavily restricted as well, only distributed to \n     those who undergo a complicated vetting process, as to ensure \n     that they will not become the next person to kill innocent \n     bystanders. I just want the American public to be safe. I do \n     not want any more men, women, and children to be victims of \n     these preventable crimes. I only wish the best for us. Thank \n     you.\n\n\n       WILLIAM MARTIN, MOUNT ABRAHAM UNION HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)\n\n       The United States is being cornered by problems, of all \n     shapes and magnitude, from every direction. These issues need \n     more attention and they will not be solved unless action is \n     taken against them. Many of these situations will only get \n     worse the longer we put them off. There are a variety of \n     problems ranging from climate change to healthcare and we \n     should be looking for a solution for all of them. The three \n     issues that the U.S. should put most of its focus on, \n     however, is the threat from ISIS, the price of higher \n     education, and the cases of racism, especially those in \n     police shootings.\n       The United States should spend more money to prevent ISIS \n     from growing and causing more damage, because ISIS is a \n     danger to the U.S., as well as other countries around the \n     world and their citizens. Terrorism could also continue for a \n     lot longer if we do not stop it soon. Terrorism really came \n     onto the world stage after September 11, 2001. In a single \n     day, a small group of people managed to kill thousands. Even \n     before this, al-Qaeda truly started in the 1990s. This shows \n     how long these groups have managed to continue, despite our \n     efforts, which means we need to do more. Not only do we need \n     to get rid of the organizations like ISIS that are here now, \n     but we have to provide a stable system to make sure these \n     types of groups don't return, or we could risk another \n     disaster. ISIS will actually pay foreign fighters $1,000 a \n     month, which is how they get many of their recruits. \n     Unfortunately, ISIS has a wide spread with connections in \n     many places. This is a reason why it is hard to eradicate \n     them, but also shows that we need to invest more into it if \n     we want to get it done. The U.S. is however, already spending \n     $40 billion on fighting ISIS annually. This is a large sum of \n     money, but of the $1.1 trillion that the U.S. had for \n     discretionary spending in 2015, it is only about 3.6 percent. \n     The U.S. has a responsibility to help with the fight against \n     ISIS, and the government should spend more money to disrupt \n     this organization because they are a threat to everyone, \n     everywhere, and will not go away unless we make them.\n       The U.S. should also spend more money on education, to make \n     college more accessible to the average student, because it is \n     important for getting good jobs and it costs far too much \n     now. The average cost to go to a private college is $32,405 \n     which deters a lot of students who can't afford that price \n     for four years. Since this price is so high, and those who \n     can't afford it simply can't go, it leaves many without the \n     education needed for higher paying jobs. This number is far \n     too high. This even gives some doubt about getting their \n     degrees, simply from the fear of debt. It is necessary to get \n     a high paying job to be able to happily provide for a family, \n     however the cost to get there is damaging, which is why the \n     government has to step in. If the government did decide to \n     make public college tuition free, it would cost $62.6 \n     billion. This cost may be high, but it's not even what is \n     needed. There simply needs to be more spent on making it more \n     affordable. Also, theoretically, if the government needed to \n     raise taxes to make tuition affordable, and nearly everyone \n     had gone to college and had a high paying job, then after a \n     couple years they could raise taxes without too much effect. \n     The U.S. needs to make college easier for everyone and make \n     it more affordable, because it costs far too much and could \n     help citizens live an easier life with more money.\n       The U.S. government needs to take more action against \n     racial events because they defy the constitutional values of \n     the United States and these problems only get worse when left \n     unsolved. The U.S. abolished slavery in 1865 under President \n     Lincoln, but since then there has always been a separation of \n     people of color because of the false thought of white \n     superiority. We can see this in the way black people were \n     treated in the 20th century, in how they were allowed little \n     compared to those who were white. This shows a deep root of \n     racism in this country, and though we have been making \n     efforts to reduce it more and more, it still seems to not be \n     enough. A large racism topic that has been in the media for a \n     while is the shooting and other abuse white cops have \n     committed on people of color. One example is Michael Brown, a \n     black 18 year old, who was fatally shot in 2014 by a white \n     officer. After there was no conviction of Darren Wilson, the \n     shooter, many cried out in outrage. The commotion that was \n     caused from that killing, and others, caused massive amounts \n     of damage in protests to both people and property. There \n     needs to be a better way to deal with these situations, \n     otherwise the outrage will continue. There is also a question \n     raised by statistics like that only 13.2% of the U.S. \n     population is black, and yet they make up 39.4% of the prison \n     population, or that nearly 50% of hate crimes are about \n     racism. These numbers show how we need to increase the \n     involvement of the government in these events--we cannot just \n     ignore the danger behind these statistics. On the other hand, \n     all U.S. citizens have the same legal rights, no matter their \n     gender, race, or religion. This fact however, may not be \n     fully true, because though on paper it may say there is no \n     discrimination, that does not mean that there aren't people \n     who do discriminate based on race. The government needs to \n     step in on this issue, and use their power to end it, because \n     it is dangerous to all and defies our American morals.\n       The U.S. will find itself in trouble if solutions are not \n     quickly found to ISIS, the price of higher education, and \n     acts of racism. If action is not taken against ISIS to \n     permanently disrupt them, the danger they cause for everyone \n     will only increase and get worse. Similarly, if money is not \n     put towards helping offset the cost of higher education, we \n     could see more and more people who can't afford to get a \n     degree that could get them a job they can live off of, which \n     would increase the separation of the upper and middle class. \n     Lastly, it is very important that the U.S. finds a solution \n     to the acts of racism that cause only harm and anarchy. The \n     U.S. will never become the true country it was meant to be, \n     and the ``American Dream'' will be fiction for many, until \n     the problems we face today are solved.\n\n\n       HADLEY MENK, CHAMPLAIN VALLEY UNION HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)\n\n       All men are created equal. America was founded upon this \n     fundamental belief, but today the meaning of these words has \n     been lost.\n       Americans are not equal when some cannot afford healthcare, \n     when a woman's power over her body is diminished, or when the \n     pursuit of happiness is lost in the struggle to\n\n[[Page S423]]\n\n     feed a family. Economically, there is more inequality in \n     America than ever. According to the Pew Research Center, \n     since 1983 ``virtually all wealth gains made by U.S. families \n     have gone to the upper-income group.'' The top 1% of American \n     families received 22.5% of all pre-tax income in 2012, with \n     the bottom 90% receiving less than 50% of total income for \n     the first time ever.\n       For the plights of everyday Americans to rightfully regain \n     the attention of the government, the deluge of money being \n     pumped into the electoral system by big corporations and \n     wealthy donors must be stopped. New campaign finance \n     regulations and a reversal of the Citizens United decision \n     will take the government out of the control of the wealthy \n     elite and put it back into the hands of the people.\n       Policies designed to combat income inequality at its roots \n     are the only way to fix our broken system. For example, we \n     need a minimum wage that allows families an equal chance at \n     happiness. We need political leadership that will give low-\n     income women an equal chance at personal liberty, instead of \n     seeking to strip funding from organizations like Planned \n     Parenthood, which for many women are their only option for \n     reproductive healthcare. We need a healthcare system that \n     ensures that no one has less of a right to health because of \n     their socioeconomic class. We need affordable education and \n     job training programs to give young people the tools they \n     need to contribute to our economy. Tax cuts for the \n     wealthiest have only widened the gap and made life harder for \n     too many Americans. It's time to unite, rather than divide, \n     our country.\n       In order for the American people to unite, elected \n     officials must lead the way, by following the will of the \n     people, instead of the dictates of their wealthy donors. For \n     example, in their 2014 National Climate Assessment, the White \n     House found that low-income and minority communities suffer \n     the most from climate change-induced events, including heat \n     waves and floods. Still, many in Congress who benefit from \n     oil companies continue to deny climate change exists. \n     Congress must begin a full-scale attack on climate change \n     including carbon emission taxes, incentives for renewable \n     energy companies and consumers, and efforts to protect \n     valuable natural resources.\n       ``Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness . . . to \n     secure these rights, Governments are instituted among men.'' \n     It's time for our government to reaffirm its commitment to \n     the founding document which formed it 250 years ago, one \n     which outlined a government whose purpose was to uphold its \n     people's fundamental rights. When these rights are infringed \n     upon by inequality, it is the duty of the government to \n     address that inequality in order to preserve our American \n     identity.\n\n\n         SOPHIA PARKER, VERGENNES UNION HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)\n\n       Nelson Mandela proclaimed: ``It is in your hands to make of \n     our world a better one for all.''\n       It is easy to feel overwhelmed by the complex and \n     devastating crises we face today as a nation, to believe the \n     solutions are out of our hands. I see two parallel sets of \n     problems. On one hand, we have institutionalized problems \n     which will require institutional solutions, financial \n     resources, and political will. On the other hand, there is a \n     personal malaise, discouragement, and alienation among \n     citizens. The two problems are related because the alienation \n     and discouragement stem in part from systems that have become \n     corrupt and ineffective, serving the needs of the few at the \n     expense of the many. However, there is also power in our \n     simple personal choices and actions, which is often \n     overlooked. Engaging this power does not require a political \n     solution. A child can bring this forth. The most \n     disenfranchised person can make a difference. This power \n     resides in the simple personal choice to do good, to take \n     action, to care, to make one small or large movement towards \n     making life a little better for somebody.\n       Every one of us has strengths that we can bring to bear for \n     the sake of another individual, our community, a specific \n     cause, or the world at large. If each person devoted even an \n     hour a week to making the world a better place, it would have \n     a tremendous impact.\n       You are never too young or old to make a difference. You \n     are never too poor, too weak, or too busy to make a \n     difference. Every single one of us has strengths that we can \n     harness to make the world better for the people around us. My \n     10 year-old neighbor drives his family's tractor to plow our \n     driveway after every snowstorm, out of the kindness of his \n     heart. My mom and I run wildlife camps for kids; one of our 9 \n     year-old campers started an organization to help older \n     shelter cats find homes. A sophomore at my high school helped \n     organize a winter sleep-out to end homelessness, attended by \n     over a hundred people. These are all young people seeing \n     problems and finding ways to take action through compassion, \n     courage, creativity, and community service.\n       I serve as Miss Vermont's Outstanding Teen; my platform is \n     wildlife rehabilitation and stewardship of the natural world, \n     which is a cause to which I have been devoted since I was a \n     small child. I travel across Vermont encouraging young people \n     to find their own passion and get involved in contributing \n     something of value to their communities. The response is \n     always inspiring.\n       The problems around us are daunting indeed. However, we \n     cannot underestimate the power for good that resides in each \n     individual. It can begin with something as simple as lending \n     each other a hand, and can build into making our world a \n     better one for all.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/01/senate-section/article/S423-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                150TH ANNIVERSARY OF NORWAY SAVINGS BANK\n\n Mr. KING. Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the 150th \nanniversary of Norway Savings Bank, a mutual savings bank based in \nsouthern Maine. This community bank has a long and proud history of \nserving the people of Maine, and I am proud to add my voice to those in \nour grateful State in recognizing this milestone. Norway Savings Bank \nwill celebrate its anniversary by hosting events on February 5, 2016, \nat each of their 24 locations across western and southern Maine.\n  When Norway Savings Bank was incorporated in 1866, Norway was a small \nbut growing town with a third of the population settled today. A \ncentury and a half later, Norway has become a bustling mill town, as \nwell as a popular tourist destination. And since it opened its original \nbuilding on Main Street in Norway in 1894, Norway Savings Bank has \nproven itself to be an exemplary community bank.\n  As a mutual savings bank, Norway Savings Bank is first and foremost \naccountable to its depositors and the community. At Norway Savings \nBank, customers not only find high-quality service, but also an engaged \nand warm environment. Its dedicated employees have continued the \ntradition of providing customers with prompt and personalized \nsolutions, regardless of the financial challenge. The bank's great \ncustomer service and hard work even has people ``from away'' taking \nnotice: DepositAccounts.com named them one of the top 200 healthiest \nbanks in 2014.\n  Norway Savings Bank's investment in its employees is also \ncommendable. The bank consistently prioritizes the well-being of its \nstaff and is consistently recognized as a top employer in the State of \nMaine. The bank was named one of the Best Banks to Work For in America \nin 2013 by the American Bankers Association, and branches of the \ncompany have been awarded Best Places to Work in Maine by the Society \nfor Human Resource Management's, SHRM, Maine State Council.\n  Finally, bank leadership and employees prove that they understand the \ntrue meaning of ``relationship banking'' by devoting countless hours of \ntheir valuable time, as well as their resources, to the betterment of \nMaine by regularly supporting important community initiatives and \nissues. Between 2012 and 2014, Norway Savings Bank employees \nvolunteered 27,788 hours of their time to different organizations in \nthe community.\n  The bank's core business model of putting community first remains \ntrue today even as Norway, ME, and the broader financial depository \nindustry have changed dramatically. I am proud to join the people of \nNorway, ME, and communities across western and southern Maine in \nthanking Norway Savings Bank for their commitment to the people of \nMaine and continued work on behalf of our great State. This milestone \nis a testament to their hard work over the past 150 years, and I wish \nthem many more years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/01/senate-section/article/S423-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S423-S424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  RECOGNIZING LEFT HAND DITCH COMPANY\n\n Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, today I honor the Left Hand Ditch \nCompany, based in Boulder County, CO, on its 150th anniversary. Left \nHand Ditch Company was founded on February 27, 1866, 10 years before \nColorado became a State. It provides an essential resource for water in \nthe Boulder and Longmont region of the Northern Front Range.\n  Left Hand has played an important role in the history of water law in \nColorado and the American West. In the case of Coffin v. Left Hand \nDitch Company in 1882, the Colorado Supreme Court upheld Left Hand's \nright to continue its use of the water supply in the area. This \n``first-in, first-right'' decision became the basis for water law in \nthe West, known as the Doctrine of Prior Appropriation. As one \nhistorian\n\n[[Page S424]]\n\nhas said, ``The story of the Left Hand Ditch is the story of water in \nthe west.''\n  Water is a foundational aspect of Colorado's history and is a primary \ndriver for agriculture, commerce, and community development in the \nState. Left Hand's contributions have helped spur growth in this region \nand set an important precedent for our Nation's water laws. \nCongratulations to the Left Hand Ditch Company on reaching this \nsignificant milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/01/senate-section/article/S424-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/01/senate-section/article/S424-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/01/senate-section/article/S424-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  AGREEMENT ON SOCIAL SECURITY BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND HUNGARY, \nCONSISTING OF A PRINCIPAL AGREEMENT AND AN ADMINISTRATIVE AGREEMENT--PM \n                                   38\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to section 233(e)(1) of the Social Security Act, as amended \nby the Social Security Amendments of 1977 (Public Law 95-216, 42 U.S.C. \n433(e)(1)), I transmit herewith a social security totalization \nagreement with Hungary, titled, ``Agreement on Social Security between \nthe Government of the United States of America and the Government of \nHungary,'' and a related agreement titled, ``Administrative Arrangement \nfor the Implementation of the Agreement on Social Security between the \nUnited States of America and the Government of Hungary'' (collectively \nthe ``Agreements'').
