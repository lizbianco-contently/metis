Mr. President, yesterday the Supreme Court heard oral \narguments in the case of Fisher v. University of Texas. In that case \nthe plaintiff was challenging the affirmative action program the \nUniversity of Texas has.\n  During those oral arguments, conservative Justice Scalia asked \nwhether affirmative action harms minority students by placing them in \nenvironments that are too academically challenging for them. Justice \nScalia said the following about African-American students: ``There are \nthose who contend that it does not benefit African Americans to get \nthem into the University of Texas where they do not do well, as opposed \nto having them go to a less advanced school, a slower-track school \nwhere they do well.''\n  Justice Scalia further argued that African-American students ``come \nfrom lesser schools where they do not feel that they're . . . being \npushed ahead in . . . classes that are too . . . fast for them'' and \nthat the University of Texas should not take really qualified African-\nAmerican students because that means ``the number of . . . really \ncompetent blacks admitted to lesser schools turns out to be less.''\n  But that wasn't enough. This is what else he said: ``I don't think it \nstands to reason that it's a good thing for the University of Texas to \nadmit as many blacks as possible.''\n  It is stunning that a man of his intellect--and I have always \nacknowledged his intellect, but these ideas that he pronounced \nyesterday are racist in application if not intent. I don't know about \nhis intent, but it is deeply disturbing to hear a Supreme Court Justice \nendorse racist ideas from the bench of the Nation's highest Court. His \nendorsement of racist theories has frightening ramifications, not the \nleast of which is to undermine the academic achievements of Americans, \nAfrican Americans especially.\n  Earlier this week I spoke about the Republican platform, which has a \nlot of hate in it. As we speak, Donald Trump is proposing to ban Muslim \nimmigration. Other leading candidates are proposing religious tests, \ntossing around slurs on a daily basis.\n  The top two Republican leaders in the United States have said they \nwill support Donald Trump if he is nominated. And now a Republican-\nappointed Justice is endorsing racist ideas from the Supreme Court \nbench. The only difference between the ideas endorsed by Trump and \nScalia is that Scalia has a robe and a lifetime appointment. Ideas such \nas these don't belong on the Internet, let alone the mouths of the \nNation's leaders.\n  The idea that African-American students are somehow inherently \nintellectually inferior to other students is despicable. It is a \nthrowback to a time that America left behind half a century ago. The \nidea that we should be pushing well-qualified African-American students \nout of the top universities into lesser schools is unacceptable. That \nJustice Scalia could raise such an uninformed idea shows just how out \nof touch he is with the values of this Nation. It goes without saying \nthat an African-American student has the same potential to succeed in \nan academically challenging environment as any other student.\n  I firmly continue to believe the United States of America is the \ngreatest Nation in the world because of our ability to embrace men and \nwomen of diverse backgrounds and provide them with the opportunity to \nsucceed. Colleges and universities that welcome diversity provide their \nstudents with an opportunity many in the world can never hope to \nobtain. Learning with people from different backgrounds spurs \ncreativity and innovation. Research has shown that increased racial \ndiversity on campuses produces higher levels of academic achievement \nfor all students, and Fortune 500 companies agree that embracing \ndiversity is good for the bottom line.\n  The Supreme Court previously has acknowledged that diversity provides \na substantial and compelling contribution to our educational system. \nYet Justice Scalia's comments paint a picture of two disturbing \nrealities.\n  Despite the progress our Nation has made on diversity and inclusion, \nthere is still much work to do to ensure we are giving every American a \nfair shot regardless of race, ethnicity, or religion. As a nation, we \nstill have the responsibility to direct adequate resources to our \neducational system to prepare all students for higher education.\n  Generations of discrimination and legally sanctioned inequality have \nproduced racial disparities in our educational system--sad but true. \nThese disparities must be addressed by embracing diversity in our \nschools, workplaces, markets, and neighborhoods while investing in \nadequate resources for all students, from pre-K to higher education.\n  Our Nation was founded on the values of liberty, justice, and \nequality. Justice Scalia's distressing comments are a reminder that we \nmust remain vigilant to safeguard opportunity for all Americans. \nEmbracing diversity is not only the right thing to do, it is the \nAmerican way.\n  Lyndon Johnson said:\n\n       It is not enough just to open the gates of opportunity. All \n     our citizens must have the ability to walk through those \n     gates.\n\n  It is our responsibility as a nation to open the gates of opportunity \nfor all Americans, in spite of what Justice Scalia said yesterday.\n  Mr. President, has the Chair announced the business of the day?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has been announced.\n  Mr. REID. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, what a difference a new Senate can \nmake--what a difference.\n  Some may have thought Washington would never agree on a replacement \nfor No Child Left Behind. Years of inaction on the Senate floor gave \nample cause for doubt. Some may have been skeptical when a new Senate \nwith a new approach resolved to finally solve the problem--but no \nlonger.\n  Yesterday, the new Senate voted overwhelmingly to deliver the most \nsignificant K-12 education reform in well over a decade. The President \nwill sign the bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act later this morning.\n  Here is what this bipartisan law will do: replace a broken law with \nconservative reform that will help students succeed instead of helping \nWashington grow. That means swapping one-size-fits-all Federal mandates \nfor greater State and local flexibility. That means bringing an end to \nthe ability of faraway bureaucrats to impose common core. That means \nstrengthening charter schools. That means putting education back in the \nhands of those who know students' needs best--parents, teachers, \nStates, and school boards.\n  The Every Student Succeeds Act is conservative reform passed on a \nbipartisan basis. The Wall Street Journal calls it ``the largest \ndevolution of federal control to the states in a quarter-century,'' and \nit is an important achievement for our kids and for our country.\n  So I want to thank again the Senators who worked together to make \nthis possible--Senator Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee, and \nSenator Murray, a Democrat from Washington. They took advantage of the \nopportunities a new and more open Senate provided. They put good \nlegislation together and then placed personal stakes in its success. \nThey worked hard. They labored over many months, and they didn't lose \nsight of what a legislative exercise like this one should really be \nabout: good policy, better outcomes for our country, and, with the bill \nwe passed yesterday--the bill the President will sign today--greater \nopportunities for every student to succeed.\n  Senator Alexander was right when he said that ``this bill is just one \nmore example that Congress is back to work.'' It is worth noting a \npoint he made the other day as well: ``This has\n\n[[Page S8565]]\n\nbeen one of the most productive Senate years in a long time,'' he said. \n``The Republican Senate majority is making a real difference, \nparticularly [for] 100,000 public schools, [for] 3.5 million teachers, \nand [for] 50 million children.''\n  But perhaps the American people are wondering why. Perhaps they are \nwondering why the Senate is suddenly back to work this year. Perhaps \nthey are wondering why some issues are suddenly passing now when they \nweren't passing previously. Let me turn back to the rest of what \nSenator Alexander said, because I think the answer for a bill like ESSA \nis really quite simple. ``We're doing it,'' he said, ``by working in a \nbipartisan way with our colleagues, which is, I think, the way the \nAmerican people want us to govern.''\n  Here is the idea. Give Senators of both parties more of a say in the \nprocess, and Senators of both parties are likely to take more of a \nstake in the outcome. That is why, on this bill, we saw a more open \nprocess that started way back in the committee stage. Senator Alexander \nand Senator Murray, the top Republican and the top Democrat on the \neducation committee, understood that No Child Left Behind had to be \nfixed after years of inaction. So they worked together on a bipartisan \nbasis, and the Senate passed the most significant K-12 education reform \nin years.\n  Take another example. Senator Inhofe and Senator Boxer, the top \nRepublican and top Democrat on the public works committee, understood \nthat crumbling roads and bridges had to be fixed after years of \ninaction. So they worked together on a bipartisan basis, and the Senate \npassed the first long-term transportation bill in a decade.\n  How about this one: Senator Burr and Senator Feinstein, the top \nRepublican and top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, understood \nthat Americans' online privacy and financial transactions deserved some \nprotection after years of inaction. So they worked together on a \nbipartisan basis, and the Senate passed an important cyber security \nbill.\n  Across the new Congress, we saw several other stuck issues come \nunstuck too: a decisive end to Washington's annual doc fix drama, \nstrong action to help knock down foreign trade barriers, and extending \na hand of compassion to victims of modern slavery. All of it passed in \nthe new Congress, and all of it passed on a bipartisan basis.\n  Now, let me be clear. No one is saying that all of the Senate's \nchallenges have been ironed out. Of course we know that our work is \nongoing. Of course we know there will always be bumps along the way.\n  But here is what we can say for sure. The new Senate has taken \nserious steps to foster a more open atmosphere on many issues. The new \nSenate has seen real progress made for our country, often on a \nbipartisan basis, and we are proud of that. We are proud of that. \nWhether we are Republican or Democrat, I think that is something we can \nall take pride in as Americans.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to highlight the positive \nchange our new Republican majority has brought to the U.S. Senate in \n2015.\n  As a first-year Senator--and I will remind everybody that I spent a \nlot of time on the other side of the Capitol observing the Senate--I \ncame to the body looking to improve this institution that for far too \nlong was not working for American families. Not only did the Senate \nfail to pass legislation that would help our seniors, students, and \nworkers, it failed to even debate critical issues. Looking from the \nHouse side across the hall in the Capitol, we really couldn't \nunderstand that.\n  In 2014 the Senate only voted on 15 amendments. This year, under new \nleadership, we have taken hundreds of amendment votes and committees \nare hard at work. We debated issues, clearly stated our policy \npriorities, and broke the gridlock that defined the previous Congress.\n  Allowing Senators from both sides of the aisle to offer amendments, \nparticipate in the process, and take votes is the best way to achieve \nbipartisan legislation. It is common sense. Isn't that the way it is \nsupposed to be? It is kind of how I thought it should be, and I am glad \nto know that this year, that is what we are doing. Working together is \nthe only way to enact policies that will improve the lives of the \nAmerican people.\n  The new Senate work has borne tremendous fruit, particularly in the \npast week. We passed the first major overhaul of elementary and \nsecondary education in more than a decade, and the President is poised \nto sign this into law. Eighty-five Senators voted for it; that is a big \nbipartisan majority.\n  The Every Student Succeeds Act strikes the proper balance between \nflexibility and accountability. The bill ends education waivers and the \nFederal common core mandate that had turned Washington bureaucrats into \nbasically a national school board. No one cares more about a student's \nsuccess than a child's parents and their teachers, and those closest to \nour children should be the ones empowered to make those decisions. At \nthe same time, accountability matters.\n  I have three children who went through the school system, and testing \ndone properly is a good thing. A parent wants to know where their child \nstands. We want to know what their weaknesses and successes are, and we \nwant to know where the school stands. But under this bill, States will \nhave multiple measures of student achievement, not just testing. Test \nresults will just be a part of that evaluation, and States will have \nbroad discretion to measure other factors. High schools will now report \non the rate of graduates going on to higher education. Whether \ngraduates are prepared to continue education is, in my view, an \nimportant measure of success.\n\n  This bill also recognizes the importance of technology and education, \nnot just in the classroom but also at home. It includes language that \nSenator King and I introduced to study the homework gap. Students who \nlack access to fast and reliable broadband at home need to be able to \ncontinue learning outside the classroom.\n  If the teacher gives an assignment and students are given a device \nand they take it home, if they don't have the connectivity, they are \nbehind. But if they do have the connectivity--the access--they can \ncontinue their education at home and be prepared the next day.\n  States will now have flexibility to use Federal resources to improve \nthis access to technology. This is a significant step forward, I think, \nfor the education system that is outdated and out of step with the \nneeds of our students. It is particularly hard-hitting in rural \ncommunities.\n  Last week we passed and the President signed the first long-term \nhighway bill in 17 years. Since 2009, Congress has lurched from one \nshort-term patch to another, leaving officials across the country \nunable to plan future highway and transit projects.\n  The shameful inability to make a lasting investment in our \ninfrastructure came to an end last week. The FAST Act invests $2.5 \nbillion in West Virginia's roads and bridges over 5 years. I can say \nafter going home last weekend that the biggest issue raised to me in a \ncongratulatory way was this: Thank you for passing the highway bill. \nWith it, the completion of Route 35 in West Virginia and Corridor H \nwill bring economic potential to our State. Key projects such as the \nKing Coal Highway and the Coalfields Expressway will help isolated \ncommunities attract businesses and provide jobs. States will also now \nhave more flexibility, which is exactly what they want and need, to \nspend Federal dollars.\n  New permitting reforms will help taxpayer dollars go farther and \nenable projects to be completed more quickly. Time is money, and if we \ncan complete in a shorter time span and do the regulatory obligations \nat the same time--\n\n[[Page S8566]]\n\nconcurrently--it can save States, the Federal Government, and \nlocalities money.\n  This highway bill is truly a jobs bill not only for the workers who \nwill build and repair America's roads and bridges, but these \ninvestments will also bring broader economic benefits to our \ncommunities.\n  Another good thing this bill does that will help further job growth \nin West Virginia is it reauthorizes the Appalachian Regional \nCommission. This reauthorization includes bipartisan language to \nestablish a high-speed broadband development initiative for underserved \nareas in Appalachia.\n  Just this Sunday, the Charleston Gazette-Mail wrote about how the \nlack of broadband was hindering efforts to provide telemedicine in \nsmall West Virginia towns. The ARC reauthorization is a tangible step \ntowards getting this region connected. Broadband access can power these \ncommunities.\n  So passage of the education and highway bills are tremendous recent \nachievements, and they follow earlier bipartisan accomplishments this \nyear.\n  With our entitlement programs hurdling towards bankruptcy, it was \nimportant for Congress to act. In April, we permanently eliminated \nMedicare's sustainable growth rate, or SGR, putting an end to the long \nseries of temporary patches that had vexed our Nation's seniors and \ndoctors. These reforms will encourage competition, save taxpayer \ndollars, and provide a more reliable system for our seniors. We know \nthere is more to do, but this marks a good first step to preserve \nMedicare for future generations.\n  This same legislation extended funding for the Children's Health \nInsurance Program--a program I have been intimately involved with in \nWest Virginia since my early days as a member of the house of \ndelegates.\n  We passed legislation to help veterans heal from the unseen wounds of \nwar and to support victims of human trafficking.\n  We renewed trade promotion authority to facilitate new trade \nagreements that can expand American jobs. And we did all of this by \nworking together to find common ground on behalf of the people we \nserve.\n  Even when consensus cannot be achieved or the President chooses to go \nit alone, the Senate should debate the tough issues and show the \nAmerican people where we stand. We say where we stand when we are \nrunning for election. We should be saying where we stand now that we \nare elected. We shouldn't be shying away from that.\n  The President's relentless environmental campaign to expand \nWashington bureaucracy at the expense of our economy is an issue I have \nbeen deeply concerned about. Energy-producing States have been hit the \nhardest. My State of West Virginia now has the largest and highest \nunemployment rate after enduring thousands of layoffs and WARN notices. \nNationwide, coal mining employment has dropped by 30 percent since \n2011. When I was a Member of the House of Representatives, I took \naction to rein in the President's regulatory agenda, but often \nlegislation that passed the House could not garner enough support here \nin the Senate.\n  So as a newly elected Senator, I committed to change that and to lead \nthe legislative response to protect affordable, reliable energy. Just \nlast month, we succeeded. The Senate passed two resolutions to avoid \nthe Clean Power Plan that are now headed to the President's desk, \nincluding the one that I led. Under new leadership, the Senate strongly \nopposed policies that are devastating our energy economy and have \nnegligible environmental benefit.\n  ObamaCare is another costly disaster that has placed great burdens on \nthe American people. The new Republican-led Senate recently delivered \non its promise to pass legislation that repeals the broken law. \nBasically, ObamaCare is failing. Americans are facing skyrocketing \npremiums and deductibles. Countless people have lost access to the \ndoctor and health care plan of their choice. Even insurance companies \nare threatening to pull out of the system, and the Nation's largest one \nis one of those.\n  President Obama and the Democrats are fighting to use taxpayers' \ndollars to bail out the big insurance companies in a misguided attempt \nto save their failed health care policy.\n  The repeal legislation we passed last week would reduce taxes by more \nthan $1 trillion, strengthen Medicare, and provide significant \nresources for a problem plaguing our country--substance abuse and \nmental health treatment. We know the President will veto the bill, but \nnew leadership in the Senate has put a repeal bill on his desk for the \nfirst time. And this legislation will serve as a model for efforts to \nrepeal and replace ObamaCare in the next Congress.\n  This year, we have addressed the concerns of many Americans and the \nserious challenges that we face. We have solved problems and delivered \nreal results. And under Leader McConnell's management, we have been \nable to debate critical issues on behalf of the Americans we serve, \noffer new reforms and ideas through the amendment process, and enact \nimportant bipartisan legislation.\n  But this is just the beginning. While much has been accomplished, our \nwork is far from done, and I look forward to building on this record of \nbipartisan achievement in the year ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about an opportunity we \nhave in the midst of all the negotiations going on to do something \nincredibly meaningful, that has bipartisan support, and literally will \naddress a group of diseases that affect one out of four people every \nyear--one out of four people who work here, one out of four people in \nour families. A set of diseases right now for which less than 40 \npercent of those with the disease get the treatment they need, but when \nthey do, it is manageable and they can go on and lead productive lives. \nWhat I am talking about is mental illness. One out of four people every \nyear has some kind of mental illness which is treatable and with \nmedications and with treatment--just like any other disease--can allow \nsomeone to go on and live their life.\n  We have started the process in public policy of doing what we call \nmental health parity by saying now that insurance can't discriminate \nwhether it is a behavioral disease, mental health, substance abuse or \nphysical health, but we don't yet have the services in the community. \nSo what happens is we pay dearly. Not only do individuals pay with \ntheir lives, their livelihoods, their families, and communities pay, \nbut we pay as taxpayers.\n  It was interesting to me, speaking at a conference a couple of days \nago here in DC with law enforcement and mental health professionals \ncoming together, to hear about the Cook County Jail in Chicago, a huge \nfacility. The sheriff there now has appointed a psychiatrist as the \ndirector of the jail. Why? Because one-third of the people housed in \nthe jail have psychiatric problems. They shouldn't be in the jail. They \nmay have committed some minor infraction because they didn't have a job \nor maybe they were on the street. Maybe they were hearing voices in \ntheir head and didn't hear the police officer and didn't respond in a \nway--or where it was considered belligerent. We now know from papers \ntoday in Michigan that studies show that people who are mentally ill \nare 16 times more likely to be killed in a year by a police officer. I \nam not suggesting that it is at all on purpose but it is because of the \nnature of the behavioral problems and what ends up happening in the \nreal world when people aren't getting the treatments they need. We know \nwhat happens in terms of violence and people committing crimes, \nalthough someone who has a mental health disease is much more likely to \nbe a victim than a perpetrator.\n  We have people in the emergency rooms of our hospitals. I have talked \nto hospital administrators and doctors who say what we need is to make \nsure we have a 24-hour emergency psychiatric facility, a place where \nsomeone can go or family members can call or the police can use if they \nfind someone who needs help, not the hospital emergency room and \ncertainly not the jail.\n\n[[Page S8567]]\n\n  The good news is that we have started a bipartisan effort that can \nfix this. My partner and colleague in this, Senator Blunt, and I, over \na year ago, authored a provision that was passed by the House and \nSenate to begin something called the Excellence in Mental Health Act. \nWe now have in law a definition of quality behavioral health services. \nWe have federally qualified health centers in the community where \npeople without insurance can go and get preventive care and get the \nphysical health services they need, but the health clinics can't get \nreimbursed for mental health or substance abuse services. So we now \nhave a definition. We have standards for what quality behavioral health \ncare, mental health, and substance abuse care looks like. We have \nstandards. We begin to provide dollars so that communities can provide \nthose services if they meet the standards.\n  A couple of years ago when we put together money for the first step \nby saying we are going to provide money for 8 States to be able to meet \nthose standards--8 out of 50--the good news was that half the States in \nthe country responded and said: We want to be one of those eight \nStates. Twenty-four States across our country now have signed up. They \nhave received planning grants to assess their community mental health \nservices, what they are doing, and how they can meet these new high \nstandards, how they can make sure they include 24-hour psychiatric \nemergency services in their community so their citizens have the help \nthey need as well as ongoing help for families and individuals. Twenty-\nfour States have said: Sign me up. We are willing to do the work.\n\n  We have funding for eight of those States to actually be able to do \nit, to change lives; eight of those States to be able to provide \nservices, treatment, hope for individual families, help for the \nsheriff, and relief for the emergency room. What we are proposing now \nand what is under consideration is to fund the 24 States. We have 24 \nStates that have stepped forward. Let's provide them the resources. In \nthe context of what we are talking about in the budget, it is a very \nsmall amount of money. We could say to the communities across this \ncountry and virtually half of the States that we are going to give them \nthe resources to meet higher quality standards, to be able to provide \nthe services desperately needed for one out of four people every year \nwho have some kind of mental illness. The ramifications of doing \nnothing are severe in so many ways.\n  The reality is that we are at a point where we have the opportunity \nto say that as a country we are going to recognize and treat diseases \nabove the neck the same as diseases below the neck and support \ncommunities that step up with higher quality standards and services. In \nthe world in which we live, this would be a huge bipartisan victory.\n  I know this is under discussion, and I am hopeful that as the \nleadership moves forward, they will join us--the bipartisan coalition \nin the House and the Senate--in saying yes to give the people an \nopportunity to live their lives, be successful, work, and manage their \ndiseases in the community just like any other disease.\n  I wish to say in closing that if you are a diabetic, you check your \ninsulin every day. If you check your sugar and take your insulin, you \nmanage your disease. It is not debilitating. You can go out and live \nyour life. I imagine there are many people who work in the Senate who \nare managing diabetes. You can do the same thing if you are bipolar. It \nis a chemical imbalance of the brain. It is just a different organ, a \ndifferent part of the body. If, in fact, you have the medication to \nstabilize and you have the support and treatment you need, you can \nmanage that disease, go on with your life, be successful, work, have a \nfamily, and be able to live with dignity. That is what we are talking \nabout. We are talking about giving people who have diseases in the \nbrain the same opportunity for treatment and management of those \ndiseases to live healthy, hopeful, successful lives as we do for people \nwho have diseases in any other organ of the body. We have the \nopportunity to do that. At the end of next week, I deeply hope we will \nbe able to celebrate that we have done something incredibly important \nfor families across America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake).

Mr. President, this is the 29th time I have been on the \nfloor over this current session to address what is called, ``Waste of \nthe Week.'' Twenty-nine weeks of this year, I have been on the Senate \nfloor talking about examples of how the Federal Government wastes \ntaxpayers' money through waste, fraud, and abuse. I have laid out \nspecific examples.\n  Some changes have been made in programs as a result of the publicity \nit has received not just from me but from the accounting offices that \nare doing the checking and the inspectors general who are doing the \nchecking.\n  Sometimes I wonder if anybody is listening, but I am very encouraged \nby the fact that a number of us now, including the Presiding Officer, \nare talking about this issue. I hope every Member in this body, all 100 \nof us, start thinking about ways in which we can make our Federal \nGovernment more efficient and effective and stop wasting through fraud \nand abuse, stop wasting taxpayer dollars. I don't want to keep doing \nthis, but I am going to keep doing this until there is a majority and \nhopefully a unanimous clarion call saying: Let's clean up this \ngovernment. Let's go after this waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  In terms of examples, we have now totaled well over $100 billion. We \nare coming up with much higher numbers as we come down to the floor \nevery week. The Presiding Officer just issued a book, which I think \nevery Member of this body ought to read, collecting other examples of \nwaste, fraud, and abuse.\n  All of this is really in honor of a former Member, Senator Tom Coburn \nof Oklahoma, who really led the charge on this issue. I regret that Tom \nis not still a Member of the Senate. He had a way of digging out this \ninformation that was commendable. He would come to the floor and make a \npersuasive case through the illustration of various forms of abuse of \nthe taxpayers' dollars.\n  A number of my colleagues are picking up the clarion call. As I said, \nwe need all 100 of us to come to the conclusion that we don't have to \nstand here and say we are doing everything we possibly can to manage \nthe people's money when we know that is not true, when we know that \ninspectors general of virtually every agency in the government have \ncome up with reports that simply say ``Why in the world are you doing \nthis in the first place?'' or ``Look at this amount of fraud.''\n  One-hundred billion dollars or more is just a drop in the budget, so \nwe are going to continue to expose this waste. Today I had hoped this \n29th waste of the week would be the last one of this calendar year, but \nit looks as if we might be here 1 more week, so we will get the 30th in \nnext week if necessary.\n  Recently, the inspector general for the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development conducted a series of audits on HUD's multibillion-\ndollar portfolio. The results that have been printed are deeply \ntroubling. After reviewing HUD's books, the inspector general found \nthat the agency's finances are missing records, contain inaccurate \ninformation, and have even violated Federal laws. He acknowledged that \nHUD's accounting has lacked appropriate oversight for a long time. This \nhas been going on for a long time.\n  Let me quote from his report:\n\n       Multiple deficiencies existed in HUD's internal controls \n     over financial reporting, resulting in misstatements on \n     financial statements, noncompliance laws and regulations. We \n     have reported on HUD's administrative control of funds in our \n     audit reports and management reports since fiscal year 2005. \n     HUD continued to not have a fully implemented and complete \n     administrative control of funds system that provided \n     oversight of both obligations and disbursements.\n\n  This was exposed in 2005. Ten years later, they are still having the \nproblem. They still haven't cleaned up their act.\n  This is just one agency. Maybe this is the worst agency--I don't \nknow--in terms of being irresponsible and how they spend money, but I \ndoubt it. I suspect that this statement could have been made by a \nnumber of our agencies.\n\n[[Page S8568]]\n\n  I wish to highlight a couple of specific examples from the inspector \ngeneral's audits.\n  One audit examined HUD's Government National Mortgage Administration, \ncommonly known as Ginnie Mae. Ginnie Mae buys mortgages from banks and \ninstitutions, bundles those mortgages together, and then sells portions \nof those bundles to investors. These mortgage-backed securities are \nfully backed by U.S. Government guarantees.\n  The IG's audit bluntly noted that HUD's financial records are so bad \nthat it was not even possible to audit the entirety of Ginnie Mae's \n$25.2 billion portfolio. In other words, the recordkeeping for the \ntransactions that took place under HUD was in such disarray, so bad, \nthey couldn't even provide an audit that correctly addressed the \nproblem. From what the IG could review, it found Ginnie Mae's finances \ncontained nine material weaknesses, eight significant deficiencies in \ninternal controls, and six instances of noncompliance with applicable \nlaws and regulations. After reviewing Ginnie Mae's 2015 finances, the \ninspector general found over $1 billion in abuse and inefficiencies.\n  If this had happened to any business in America other than the \nFederal Government, either the business would be bankrupt, the \nstockholders would have depleted its value, or the board of trustees \nwould have fired its manager. They would have had to reorganize the \nentire--no way can you run a business this way. No way would it be \npossible to run it. This would happen only in the Federal Government \nbecause we can print money and we can keep it flowing into HUD and \nthese other agencies. And for the 10 years since it was disclosed, they \nhave continued the same practices that have gone on before that don't \neven allow us the ability to fully understand what they are even doing. \nThey have been warned about it, and they have been talked to about it. \nThey said they are going to clean it up, but it continues.\n  Let me give another example. The IG also found waste and fraud and \nmismanagement involving HUD's taxpayer-subsidized housing benefits. The \nlow-income housing program provides affordable housing for households \nwith incomes less than 80 percent of the median income for the area. \nThis program has helped many families put a roof over their head \nthrough the years. Unfortunately, because of a loophole in HUD's review \npolicies, households that have too high an income and thus are not \nqualified to receive Federal support have been able to remain in the \ntaxpayer-subsidized Federal housing program.\n  The inspector general of HUD found that more than 25,000 over-income \nfamilies were living in HUD taxpayer-subsidized housing in 2014 alone. \nSo over 25,000 people who don't qualify for the program any longer \nbecause their income has improved are still living under the subsidized \nhousing program, which is providing subsidies to them that they are no \nlonger qualified to receive.\n  One doesn't actually have to have a low income to participate in this \ntaxpayer-subsidized low-income housing; they simply had to have a low \nincome when they applied. But hopefully this helped them as they were \nhaving income problems and financial problems--those who are able to \ncome out of the system and who receive a larger income and therefore no \nlonger qualify retained the subsidies, and HUD never took action to \nbasically determine that they no longer qualify for this. There were \nover 25,000 specific incidents.\n  In a specific example in New York City, the program's income ceiling \nfor a four-person household is just a little over $67,000. Yet a New \nYork family was legally able to remain in public housing when their \nannual income was nearly $500,000. In fact, they owned real estate that \nproduced over $790,000 in rental income within only 4 years. So people \nwho had qualified for this had achieved tremendous financial success--\nfrom what source, I am not exactly sure. They have moved from a program \nthat said you have to have income below $67,000 to qualify. Their \nincome was over $500,000, and yet they still retained their \nqualification.\n\n  Let's look at a small town. In Oxford, NE, a single-person household \nearned over $65,000 annually and had assets of nearly $1.6 million--far \nhigher than the city's income cap of $33,500. In other words, to be in \nthe program you could not earn over $33,500. This individual was \nearning obviously extraordinarily more than that with a $1.6 million \nvalue of assets and yet still received subsidized housing.\n  If this was a one-off, if this was a few people here and there taking \nadvantage of the system and so forth--but we are talking tens of \nthousands of people on just this single program. Remember, the audit of \nHUD looked at a whole range of discrepancies. I am talking only about a \ncouple of specific programs.\n  It is not hard to agree that this waste of taxpayer dollars is \nsomething that can be addressed. I am encouraged that my colleagues are \nlooking at this in a number of ways--and the more the better. We do \nthis in respect and honor for what Senator Coburn started, and I am \nhappy to be a part of that. I know the Presiding Officer is also.\n  I will conclude by saying for just this one agency, I can give a lot \nmore examples of reckless disregard for use of taxpayer money that have \nbeen documented by the inspector general and that have been provided to \nthat agency, which has not been able to clean up its act since 2005. \nThey have had 10 years to do it, and it still continues. The inspector \ngeneral says it is such a mess, it is so disassembled, it is so poorly \nadministered that it can't even come to a conclusion of how bad it is. \nIt is impossible to fully audit the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment because of their financial ineptness and their financial \nincapability of keeping records on their very own programs.\n  Today we are going to add a modest amount. This could be tens of \nbillions. We took only a couple of examples here, and those examples \ntotal $1,174,000,000. That is not small change. Think about being about \nto send this back to the taxpayers who are working their hearts out and \nhaving taxes levied on them or think about how we can send this money \nto higher priorities--maybe to some things related to national security \nwhere we are scraping for funds to be able to provide the security this \ncountry needs. Whatever the reason, the waste continues to pile up. No \none coming down to this floor can say ``We can't cut a penny more of \nspending'' without addressing this first.\n  It appears that we will be down here for the 30th ``Waste of the \nWeek'' next week, which I regret. But we have plenty of waste lined up \nto be talking about.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/senate-section/article/S8568-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8568-S8570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SENATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it is December 10, and Congress is working \nits way through some final items of business, including a giant \nspending bill called an omnibus--some might call it an ``ominous''--\nbill because it is so big it takes all of the discretionary spending \nthat Congress makes for the entire year and wraps it up into one big \npackage. I have to say it did not have to be that way. It shouldn't \nhave been that way.\n  In the 114th Congress, under new leadership, we actually did \nsomething that hadn't been done in 6 years. We actually passed a \nbudget. The purpose of the budget in part is to set caps on spending \nlevels for the Appropriations Committee and for the 12 appropriations \nbills that should come out--and in fact did come out--of the \nAppropriations Committee. But the reason we find ourselves here at the \nend of the year with this ominous Omnibus appropriations process is \nthat our Democratic colleagues filibustered all of those individual \nappropriations bills.\n  It would have been so much better to take those up one at a time so \nthe American people and Members of the Senate could read them and \nunderstand them. We could debate them, we could offer amendments to try \nto improve them, and then we could finally pass them and send them on \nto the President. But because of the desire to force the majority to \nagree to higher spending levels, our colleagues across the aisle \nfilibustered those appropriations bills. So here we are, at the end of \nthe year, with a few huge pieces of legislation left to consider.\n  I think most people looking at Washington, DC, these days are tempted \nto\n\n[[Page S8569]]\n\nwant to look the other way because so much that happens here seems to \nbe so contentious and, frankly, a reflection of our polarized politics \nin America. But despite all of the challenges we have--and I know the \nDemocratic leader the other day actually claimed this was one of the \nmost unproductive Senates in recent memory, only to be given three \nPinocchios by the Fact Checker at The Washington Post. So I would like \nto remind the Democratic leader about some of the things we have \nactually done, working in a bipartisan fashion, to get legislation \nthrough the Senate, through the House, and to the President's desk.\n  Sometimes I think we need a bit of a refresher course on what the \nConstitution provides in terms of the division of responsibilities in \ngovernment. The Founders of our great Nation made it hard--not easy. \nThey made it hard to pass laws, and appropriately so, because they \nviewed the concentration of power and the ability to push through \nlegislation as a potential threat to their individual liberties. So not \nonly did they divide the legislative power between the House and the \nSenate, but they also created a Presidency that has the ability to veto \nthat legislation.\n  Sometimes in their enthusiasm for certain policies, some of our own \nconstituents get frustrated and they say: Why couldn't you pass this \nbill or that bill? Well, the truth is the only way this happens is when \nthere is, first of all, some leadership on the part of the majority \nparty because it is the majority leader and the Speaker, the majority \nleader in the House, who actually set the agenda. So that is pretty \nimportant. A lot of the legislation we considered this year would not \nhave even come up if our Democratic friends had been in charge. But \nonce we have the bill on the floor, it literally takes bipartisan \nconsensus building in order to actually get something done.\n  I would like to talk about a few of those things that we have been \nable to get done this year because I don't want them to get lost amidst \nall of the contentiousness that people read about and watch on their \ntelevision. It is important that the people we work for understand we \nhave actually been trying very hard to get some important things done.\n  After the House of Representatives passed the Every Student Succeeds \nAct with a strong bipartisan vote last week, yesterday the Senate \nfollowed suit by passing that legislation with 85 votes. It obviously \nwasn't perfect because 15 of our colleagues did not vote for it, but \nthat was about as strong a bipartisan vote as you get in the Senate \nthese days.\n  I think it is important to highlight the time and effort it took many \nMembers of this body to create and ultimately pass this bill. Of \ncourse, it took the leadership of Chairman Alexander of the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee. But the fact is--and I know \nhe would say this if he were standing here on the floor--he could not \nhave done it if it weren't for the partnership of the senior Senator \nfrom Washington, Mrs. Murray, a member of the other political party. \nWhat they showed us is how working together in a bipartisan way can \nachieve real reform and positive change for the American people. That \nis the way the process is supposed to work.\n  Sometimes, though, policies are so bad that the best response is \nsimply to stop it. I don't think we should diminish or deprecate the \nmerits of stopping bad legislation, but where there is an area of \ncommon interest, where consensus can be built on what the appropriate \nlegislative response is, that is how it is done--the way Senator \nAlexander and Senator Murray did.\n  Of course, we are in a political environment where people like to \nfocus on the partisan bickering and gridlock. But passage of this bill \nserves as just one example of a Senate that has been back to work under \nnew leadership since the last election about a year ago, and we \nappreciate the willingness of our friends on the other side of the \naisle to work with us on a number of areas to try to make those \naccomplishments a reality.\n  Another example is in the area of transportation funding. Last week, \nfor the first time in more than a decade, Congress passed a multiyear \ntransportation bill. I think it was more than 30 different times before \nthat Congress had passed short-term patches to those spending bills for \ntransportation, and you can imagine how difficult it was for States to \nactually plan and then to implement some of their construction projects \nto improve their transportation infrastructure. In that case, it was \nthe hard work of the senior Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, who \nchairs the Environment and Public Works Committee, as well as the \njunior Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, working together as a team; \nthen, of course, Senator Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, and Senator Wyden, the ranking member, a Democrat, working \ntogether to try to come up with some of the funding mechanisms. But as \nthe majority leader said last week, it would not have been possible to \npass this multiyear highway bill for the first time in a decade if it \nweren't for the bipartisan cooperation we saw and, particularly on the \nDemocratic side, the leadership of Senator Boxer.\n  Now, with this legislation, States like mine, Texas--growing States \ncan plan and build projects that strengthen our Nation's infrastructure \nand make our transportation system safer. They can avoid some of that \nchurning, uncertainty, and inefficiency that comes from temporary \npatches. President Obama signed that legislation last week, and now it \nis the law of the land.\n  Like the education bill I mentioned a moment ago, the transportation \nfunding bill, which was called the Fixing America's Surface \nTransportation, or FAST, Act, passed this Chamber with more than 80 \nvotes--80 votes. With 54 Republicans and 46 affiliated with the \nDemocrats, the minority, the Transportation bill got 80 votes. \nObviously this was a strong bipartisan vote and a testament to the \nbipartisan spirit this year in a Senate that has allowed us to make \nsome progress on long neglected and long overdue goals like \ntransportation funding.\n  Then I think about other topics we have worked together on, such as \ntrade. When the President said he wanted us to pass the Trade Promotion \nAuthority legislation, only 13 Democrats voted for it. So it was up to \nthe majority--the Republicans, the other party--to provide the votes to \npass Trade Promotion Authority.\n  Not everybody thought it was a good idea, sure. But in my State, one \nreason our economy continues to do better than most of the rest of the \ncountry is that we are the No. 1 exporting State in the Nation. We \nbelieve it is good for our economy and for job creation to be able to \nsell things that we make, agricultural goods we grow, and livestock we \nraise to markets around the world. That is what Trade Promotion \nAuthority will allow. It will help Texas farmers, ranchers, and \nmanufacturers get the best deal possible out of pending trade \nagreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is focused on \n40 percent of the world's gross domestic product in Asia. It is very \nimportant that we stay engaged in Asia because the default is for China \nto fill that void and set the rules.\n  The Trade Promotion Authority, which was an important priority for \nthe President, happened to be something that Republicans by and large \nagreed with and his own party disagreed with. As I said, only 13 \nDemocrats voted for it.\n  The trade promotion authority legislation is really the first step to \nopening up the doors of opportunity to our country's businesses \nworldwide, but particularly in Asia. Like the other bills I mentioned, \ntrade promotion authority was the result of the tireless effort of a \nbipartisan partnership. In this case, the senior Senator from Utah, Mr. \nHatch, chairman of the Finance Committee, and the ranking member of the \nFinance Committee, Ron Wyden, the Senator from Oregon, spent countless \nhours negotiating and renegotiating the legislation to bring it to the \nfloor and ultimately to be signed into law by the President.\n  Another example happened to be the way we pay physicians under the \nMedicare program that our seniors rely upon. Year after year, we would \ncome up with short-term patches to the so-called doc fix. But this year \nwe passed a permanent fix in a negotiation between Speaker Boehner and \nthe Democratic leader in the House, Congresswoman Pelosi, that actually \npreserves seniors' access to care under the Medicare program--a \nnoteworthy accomplishment.\n\n[[Page S8570]]\n\n  Another subject I am particularly proud of is that we passed the \nJustice for Victims of Trafficking Act, a bill this Chamber passed with \n99 votes. This law will help victims of modern-day slavery recover and \nrebuild their lives and will make sure these survivors--some of whom \nare children--are not treated like criminals but given the help they \nneed to heal and to get on with their lives.\n  We have also passed critical bills to protect our country from cyber \nattacks--something we saw happen at the IRS, where 100,000 records of \ntaxpayers was hacked in a cyber attack and stolen and compromised. We \nalso saw millions of people's records compromised at the Office of \nManagement and Budget.\n  Congress has passed legislation, which is now being reconciled with a \ndifferent House bill to be able to get that to the President, to \nprovide that security that we all need when we are online. And as I \nsaid, we passed the first budget that has been passed in 6 years. The \npoint I am trying to convey is that not everything up here is fighting \nlike cats and dogs. It is not the shirts versus the skins. It is not \nlike the Democrats and Republicans can never find anything that we \nagree on. Sure, there is there is a lot that we disagree on, and that \nis fine. It is fine to have policy differences. This is the forum where \nthose policy differences are debated and where, if possible, if common \nground can be found, we can find that common ground.\n  I have told this story, and I am going to conclude here since I see \nour colleague from Georgia waiting to speak. When I came to the Senate, \nTed Kennedy, from Massachusetts, the ``liberal lion of the Senate,'' \nwho had been here for so long, was working with one of the most \nconservative Members of the Senate, the Senator from Wyoming, on the \nHELP Committee--the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. I \nasked Mr. Enzi, the Senator from Wyoming: How is it that you and \nSenator Kennedy, who are polar opposites, can find common ground and \nactually work productively on the HELP Committee? I have never \nforgotten it. Senator Enzi told me: It is simple; it is the 80-20 rule. \nWe look for the 80 percent, if possible, that we can find common ground \nand agree on, and the 20 percent we can't agree on, we leave for \nanother fight another day.\n  That always stuck with me as a very constructive way to work in a \nhighly polarized environment where many of us share completely \ndifferent views about public policy. But we owe it to our constituents, \nto this institution, and to the American people to try to find common \nground where we can and offer them constructive solutions, as we have \ndone time and again this Congress.\n  While there are some who want to distract or misconstrue or deny the \nfact, the fact is there has been bipartisan accomplishment this year. \nBut it takes leadership, and it appeared to take a new majority and a \nnew majority leader after this last election to get the Senate back on \ntrack.\n  Even many of our Democratic friends who served in the majority \npreviously couldn't even get votes on amendments, on legislation they \nwanted to offer, because the Senate was basically shut down. But now we \nare back to work, and the Senate is functioning the way it should.\n  I wanted to say a few words to note these accomplishments but also to \nsay thank you to those who have worked together to make it possible, \nwho put the American people ahead of party to deliver real results in \nthe Senate this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/senate-section/article/S8570-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8570-S8571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             JOINT SURVEILLANCE TARGET ATTACK RADAR SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I have spoken at length about how our debt \ncrisis and our global crisis are interconnected. Before I speak today, \nthough, I want to thank the Senator from Texas for his leadership this \nyear, as we did get the Senate back to regular order. I know we have \nmuch to do, but I appreciate his leadership as whip and as a fellow \ncolleague. Thank you.\n  Today I rise to speak about how this overlap between our debt crisis \nand our global security crisis impacts the future of a vital Air Force \nasset: the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System, or JSTARS, as \nthey call it. I visited with Team JSTARS to hear about their critical \nrole. We made a visit. We talked about how their role affects our \nnational security and our national defense and countering the global \nsecurity crisis we face. I have also seen in Iraq and Afghanistan \nfirsthand how this platform is absolutely vital to protect our forces \non the ground in harm's way.\n  The global security crisis facing our Nation continues to grow. \nFirst, we face our traditional rivals--China and Russia--as they become \never more aggressive. The persistent threat of nuclear proliferation is \nnow exaggerated and increasing every day with Iran's efforts and, of \ncourse, we see what is going on in North Korea as well. Finally, we \nface threats from radical jihadist terror groups, not just in the \nMiddle East but here at home, unfortunately--and not just from ISIS. \nAQAP, Boko Haram, and al-Shabaab, to mention a few, are all thinking \nabout how to do harm here in our homeland.\n  As a result, we know that the need for American leadership in the \nworld isn't going to go away any time soon. Team JSTARS plays a \ncritical role in our response to these threats. JSTARS is an Air Force \nplatform that provides critical intelligence, surveillance, and \nreconnaissance, or ISR, and ground targeting capabilities in service to \nall branches of our military. Over the past 25 years, they have flown \nover 125,000 combat hours in 5 different combatant commands. As a \nmatter of fact, they have flown every day since 9/11.\n  The ``J'' in JSTARS stands for ``joint.'' Team JSTARS is a blended \nunit. The Air Force, Army, and National Guardsmen who work on the team, \neat, sleep, and deploy together. These men and women leave for days, \nweeks, and sometimes they deploy for months to protect our men in \nuniform around the world. Not only are they a joint mission with the \nArmy, but JSTARS also does several mission sets. JSTARS does command \nand control as well as providing intelligence, surveillance, and \nreconnaissance. From stakeout to shoot-out, JSTARS is capable of \nsupporting all missions in all phases, with full spectrum capability \nfrom low to high intensity conflict.\n  In the words of General Kelly, SOUTHCOM's commander, JSTARS is quite \nunique, ``a true force-multiplier, working seamlessly with both the DOD \nand interagency assets, generating impressive results in our asset-\naustere environment.'' What makes JSTARS unique from other \nintelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms is that on \neach JSTARS plane, we have unique manpower at the tactical edge to talk \nto our servicemembers on the ground with 22 radios, 7 data links, 3 \nInternets, and a secure telephone system. These are things we cannot \ntake for granted. Our men and women on the ground talk about this \nincessantly.\n  As I saw it in Iraq and Afghanistan, we could not fulfill our mission \nwithout this type of capability in the air, overseeing our men and \nwomen every day. As we see threats around us from an increasingly \naggressive Russia and China, the threat of electronic warfare is also a \ngrowing concern. If satellite communication radios are targeted--if \nthese systems are degraded by the enemy in any way--JSTARS can in turn \nprovide the same critical capability in theater. This is a redundant \ncapability we cannot do without. This platform has proven itself to be \ninvaluable and indispensable to our Armed Forces--not just in the Air \nForce and Army but in every service--the Marines, the Navy, the Coast \nGuard, and even in some counter-drug missions.\n  In the Pacific, JSTARS has been a key part of the Asia rebalance, \nhelping to maintain stability and assure allies by providing vital \ninsight to maritime forces as they push back against an expansive \nChina. In fact, as China continues to challenge freedom of navigation \nand asserts itself in the Asia-Pacific region, PACOM is asking for more \nand more JSTARS presence at a very time when their capability is \ndeclining.\n  Also in Asia, U.S. Forces Korea commander General Scaparrotti calls \nJSTARS ``very important to us'' as he deters an unpredictable North \nKorea. Here in this atmosphere, JSTARS has flown in support of homeland \ndefense, doing drug interdiction missions.\n\n[[Page S8571]]\n\n  General John Kelly, the SOUTHCOM commander, said: ``JSTARS is \nespecially important, providing a detailed maritime surveillance \ncapability that is unsurpassed.''\n  To give you a comparison, a single JSTARS sortie--a single plane--can \ncover the same search area as 10 maritime patrol aircraft sorties. But \nthe future of this platform is in jeopardy. As threats against our \nNation have evolved, JSTARS has too. But there are only 16 of these \nplanes covering our needs worldwide over the last 25 years. We have \nrelied on JSTARS for 25 years to protect our men and women whom we put \nin harm's way--to protect them while other people are trying to do them \nharm.\n  Unfortunately, in the last 25 years, these planes are beginning to \nwear out. They are reaching the end of their service life. These planes \nhave been in service since the early 90s. But even then, these planes \nweren't new when the Air Force acquired them. Each plane on average had \nover 50,000 hours when we bought them. The average age of the fleet is \n47 years.\n  If you look at just one example in the JSTARS fleet, there is one \naircraft that had 16 different owners or lessors over that time before \nit became a JSTARS, including Pakistani International Airlines and \nAfghan Airlines. I think it is very ironic that today that very plane \nflies oversight missions over those two countries.\n  As these planes near the end of their service life, they are spending \nmore and more time in depot maintenance. More maintains is more costly. \nDramatically increased maintenance time is threatening aircraft \navailability and mission readiness. This in turn impacts the number of \nJSTARS that can be put into mission at any one time and be out in the \ncombatant commands while doing their job, while day by day the demand \nfrom combatant commanders for JSTARS grows.\n  What is more concerning is that as JSTARS near the end of their \nservice life, as you can see on this chart, there is a gap. If we do \nnothing, we will have a gap of 10 years. The best we could do starting \ntoday is to shorten that gap to 4 years. This is a gap we cannot allow \nto happen.\n  This chart shows the declining availability of the current fleet down \nto zero by 2023. It also shows that under the current plan--pending DOD \napproval and funding--the replacement fleet does not even come online \nuntil 2023, meaning we will have a 10-year gap. They don't get back to \nfull strength until around 2027--again, the 10-year gap. Due to the \nincreased maintenance requirements of this aging fleet, JSTARS is \nalready at a point where we only have about half the fleet available to \nfly at any point in time. Even if we extend the service life of JSTARS \nand accelerate the replacement, we can only narrow the gap to 4 years. \nThis is unacceptable.\n  I have talked about the planes. Let me talk about the men and women \nwho man those planes, who service those planes, who keep those planes \nin the air. These are talented professionals. I have met with them. \nThey are dedicated professionals, protecting our soldiers on the \nground. They are committed to this mission, but they have to have our \nhelp. The men and women on the ground in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around \nthe world deserve our help. But when it happens to have a gap like \nthis, our irresponsibility as a Congress and as military leadership \nshows up.\n  We cannot allow this to happen. Recapitalization for the JSTARS fleet \nneeds to happen, and it needs to happen right now. As these aircraft \nage, depot maintenance is not only more costly but also keeps these \naircraft, which are in high demand for every combatant commander, from \nfulfilling their mission fully and putting our soldiers on the ground \nin mortal danger. This is precisely where we see the debt crisis and \nglobal security crisis intersect.\n\n  In the last 6 years, I have spoken about this before, but we borrowed \n40 percent of what we have spent as a Federal Government. This puts our \nability to support a strong foreign policy backed up by a strong \nmilitary in jeopardy. As Admiral Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, once said, the greatest threat to our national \nsecurity is our own national debt.\n  The JSTARS Program is an example of how our debt crisis is impacting \nour ability to fulfill our mission requirements. JSTARS \nrecapitalization, which would replace these planes over time, is the \nNo. 4 priority within the Air Force. The other three priorities ahead \nof it are very valid, but very expensive platforms.\n  Just last month, the Air Force acquisition chief, Assistant Secretary \nLaPlante, said that the JSTARS recap might get scrapped thanks to \nsequester and tight budget constraints. Again, this is a result of our \nfiscal intransigence and poor planning by military leaders. This \nprohibits us from meeting the very basic needs of our men and women on \nthe ground who depend on this critical platform to protect them and \nprovide overarching eyes and ears in the battle space. This should not \nhave happened. The intransigence of Congress over the last decade and \nthe intransigence of our military leadership and procurement planning \nare all at fault. We can fix this.\n  This week I am joining Senator Isakson and at least 11 other Senators \nin writing to Secretary of Defense Carter about the importance of \nfunding for the next fleet of JSTARS in next year's budget request.\n  I wish to thank the defense appropriators as well as the Armed \nServices Committee for their support for this critical platform and \nmission. I look forward to continuing to work with them to support \nJSTARS. Not only do we need to ensure the new JSTARS fleet is funded, \nbut this needs to be done fast. As I said, if we do nothing today, we \nhave at best a 4-year gap, not to mention the problem with the planes. \nWhat do we do with these professional military men and women who are \nirreplaceable--pilots, navigators, engineers, technicians, mechanics, \nschedulers, and computer experts. This is a capability we cannot do \nwithout.\n  Not only do we need to ensure that the new JSTARS fleet is funded, \nbut again this has to happen immediately if we are going to manage this \ngap. This gap in capability that we see on this chart will become a \nreality if the pace of recap doesn't change. We need a faster solution. \nThis chart shows why this recap needs to be a rapid acquisition program \nand we need to get on that immediately.\n  We need to ensure that this critical platform stays in theater. Our \ncombative commanders demand it, our troops on the ground depend on it, \nand they certainly deserve it. We cannot allow Washington's dysfunction \nto put our men and women in combat theaters in further danger. This \nneeds to get fixed, and it needs to get fixed right now.\n  I yield my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I mentioned to the Presiding Officer in \nour brief conversation before I came to the podium that one of the \nthings I try to do every month or so is come to the floor, usually when \nthings are slower and there is not a lot going on, to talk about some \nof the folks who work for us and serve our country in the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  Earlier this week, as my colleagues may recall, an outfit called the \nPartnership for Public Service released an annual report in which they \nrank the best places in which to work in the Federal Government. The \nreport is based on surveys that are conducted literally by hundreds of \nthousands of Federal employees. This year it showed an increase in \noverall employee morale for the first time, I think, in 4 or 5 years. \nThat is good news.\n  Despite the progress that appears to have been made in a number of \nFederal agencies, not all but many components of the Department of \nHomeland Security continue to struggle to make their employees feel \ngood about their work and what they do for the rest of us.\n  I know the Secretary of the Department, Jeh Johnson, and his team \nhave taken a number of significant steps to make the Department a \nbetter place to\n\n[[Page S8572]]\n\nwork for current and future employees. They do outreach and get input \nfrom their employees as to what needs to be done to enable them to feel \nbetter about the work for greater job satisfaction, to make them want \nto come to work. I would also say today that the Congress--those of us \nwho serve in the Senate and the House--also has a responsibility to \nhelp improve morale, not just at the Department of Homeland Security \nbut in the Federal Government at large.\n  Considering the fact that we began 2015 with a fight in this body \nright here over whether we should even fund the Department, I don't \nbelieve those of us in the Senate or in the House are doing all we can \ndo, that we are doing our part well. As I said earlier, that is why I \ncome to the Senate floor on a number of occasions throughout the year \nto highlight some of the extraordinary work done every day by the \ndedicated men and women at the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Today I rise to recognize no one individual. Usually I pick one or \ntwo people who have done extraordinary things with their lives, but \ntoday I am going to focus on a whole team of people who do important \nwork every day to defend our Nation from the growing and evolving \nthreat our country faces in cyber space.\n  It seems as though we don't go a week without hearing about another \nmajor breach at a business or a government agency. We are under \nunrelenting attack from all over the world--in some cases from \nsovereign nations, in other cases from criminal organizations, and in \nother cases just from pranksters. Over these past few years, we have \nseen major attacks on the Office of Personnel Management, on a great \nmany banks and other businesses, and even the email of the Director of \nthe Central Intelligence Agency. These attacks make clear that the \nthreats we face online are complex, and unfortunately we will be \nstruggling with how to deal with them for the foreseeable future.\n  Fortunately, in Congress we have been making some progress combating \nthese cyber threats through legislation. Last year we passed cyber \nsecurity legislation--four bills in fact--out of the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs. These four bills were aimed \nat strengthening the ability of the Department of Homeland Security to \nperform their cyber security mission.\n  Among those bills was one to update how our government protects its \nown networks. This bill includes language clarifying the role the \nDepartment plays in overseeing and enhancing security and other \nagencies. Two other bills gave the Department some of the tools it \nneeds to strengthen its cyber security workforce, and just last month \nthe Department of Homeland Security announced that it now seeks to hire \nup to 1,000 new cyber security employees over the next 6 months using \nthe new authorities we have given them.\n  We also passed legislation that codified the cyber operations center \nat the Department. It is called the National Cybersecurity and \nCommunications Integration Center, affectionately known as the NCCIC. \nOur legislation--which former Senator Dr. Tom Coburn and I coauthored, \nsupported by many in our committee and outside of our committee--gave \nthe NCCIC the strong legal foundation it needs, that it lacked, in \norder to do their job and engage with the private sector in a joint \neffort to better secure critical cyber networks.\n  I think we have made real progress on cyber security legislation this \nyear as well. I think we are maybe poised to do even more. I would like \nto use a football analogy. The team flips a coin and somebody receives \nand somebody kicks the ball. Receiving takes the ball maybe deep in \ntheir own territory, and then they march down the field across the 50-\nyard line into the other team's territory, then they get to the 20-yard \nline, and then moving closer to the other team's goal line, they would \nsay they are in the red zone. In terms of our march on cyber security \nlegislation here and in the House, thanks to the good work of the Intel \nCommittee here and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs as well, we are not just in the red zone, we are inside the 10-\nyard line and it is first down and goal to go.\n  Unfortunately, the clock is running out and we don't have forever to \nget the job done, but if we are smart and don't give up, we can have a \nreal success for the American people in strengthening our cyber \ndefenses in a real way.\n  The legislation we passed this fall was called the Cybersecurity \nInformation Sharing Act, and it represents a collaboration on a number \nof cyber security issues. In the bill the Department of Homeland \nSecurity plays a central role as they interface between industry and \nthe government. The bill also includes provisions to enhance the cyber \nsecurity program at the Department of Homeland Security known as \nEINSTEIN, which uses classified threat intelligence to protect all of \nour civilian agencies.\n  I am mentioning all of this legislation to show the critical role or \nunderline the critical role the Department of Homeland Security plays \nin security for our Nation. At the center of the Department's cyber \nsecurity operation is the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team, which \nis also known as US-CERT.\n  To my left is a picture of our President, and the handsome fellow he \nis speaking to is a fellow named Jeh Johnson, who is the Secretary of \nthe Department of Homeland Security, a role he has filled for I believe \nmost of 2 years now. I think he is doing a splendid job, with the great \nsupport of the Deputy Secretary there, Alejandro Mayorkas, and a couple \nof thousand people who are committed to defending our homeland.\n  This is a picture of the President addressing, along with Secretary \nJohnson, the employees at US-CERT. I think it was taken earlier this \nyear. Again, US-CERT--the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team--is \nthe main operational team within the NCCIC. It is the operational team \nwithin the NCCIC itself.\n  What do they do? They pool information and they share that \ninformation throughout the Federal Government. The US-CERT also shares \ninformation with our partners in the private sector across the country \nand with our allies around the world. It is an important job. It is not \na job that is done for 5 days a week, 8 hours a day. It is a 24-hour-a-\nday, 7-day-a-week operation, and these men and women work to stay ahead \nof the bad actors who are trying to steal our personal information and \ntrying to really harm our economy. In some cases they are plotting to \ndamage our critical infrastructure such as our electric grid, our \nfinancial systems, and our communications systems.\n  US-CERT was established 12 years ago as the Department of Homeland \nSecurity was first being stood up. The mission of US-CERT is simple, I \nthink: to make the Internet a safer place for everyone by helping to \nimprove cyber security across the country. I will say that again. The \nmission of US-CERT is very simple--not easy but simple. It is to make \nthe Internet a safer place for everyone by helping to improve cyber \nsecurity across our country. To do this, US-CERT operates a wide \nvariety of programs. These programs include several information sharing \ncollaboration programs, incident response teams that provide onsite \nassistance to attack victims, programs such as the EINSTEIN intrusion \ndetection and prevention system to protect Federal agencies, education \nand awareness programs, and deeply technical forensic analysis. The US-\nCERT partners with a wide variety of organizations. Among them, they \npartner with powerplants and utilities, they partner with financial \ninstitutions, they partner with software companies, with researchers, \nand they partner with certain teams in other countries and other cyber \noperation centers such as those over at NSA, the National Security \nAgency, and the FBI as well.\n  When a major attack occurs in the Federal Government or the private \nsector, the men and women at US-CERT mobilize to travel to the victim's \nlocation. They help mitigate the attack. They help to strengthen the \nvictim's cyber systems, and then they communicate with their partners \nso everyone can secure their systems against similar attacks. We \nlearned from that bad experience, and hopefully we can help reduce the \nlikelihood that someone else will suffer a similar fate.\n  Earlier this year, when the Office of Personnel Management discovered \na\n\n[[Page S8573]]\n\ndata breach of personal data belonging to millions of Federal \nemployees, they called the NCCIC and asked for its team of experts. US-\nCERT was deployed to play a central role in, first of all, \ninvestigating the attack but also in responding to that attack. For the \nnext 4 months, the team worked literally around the clock at OPM to \nassess and to monitor Federal networks and to develop new protections \nagainst this type of intrusion that OPM had experienced.\n  Now, once US-CERT realized that other Federal agencies were also \nvulnerable to this kind of a breach, they immediately shared the \nindicators of the attack with network analysts across the Federal \nGovernment. This allowed other Federal agencies to scan their systems \nand to make sure they had not been compromised by the same hacker and \nto be on alert for that hacker's attack.\n  Because of the scale and impact of the OPM breach, which I think \nactually ended up affecting more than 20 million people, the US-CERT \nteam worked long hours to make sure they could provide guidance to \nFederal agencies as quickly as possible so they could protect their \nnetworks from similar attacks and prevent the attacker from using the \ninformation they obtained against us. Their work not only strengthened \nthe Office of Personnel Management's cyber security posture, it also \nbolstered cyber security across the entire Federal Government.\n  US-CERT and all the cyber warriors at the NCCIC work tirelessly every \nday to out-think and out-innovate our cyber enemies. The legislation we \nenacted last year and the bill we are working hard to send to the \nPresident this year with great bipartisan support here in the Senate \nand the House as well puts the Department of Homeland Security in the \nspotlight and entrusts them with ever-greater responsibility for years \nto come. We in Congress recognize the critical role US-CERT plays in \nstrengthening our Nation's cyber security, and we must continue to \nsupport these hard-working men and women in their mission.\n  Mr. President, I will close by telling a story. I have told this \nstory before, but it is a good one, and it is certainly germane to what \nwe talked about here today.\n  A couple of years ago, I was listening to a radio station on my way \nto the train station in Delaware, and I caught NPR news right at 7 a.m. \nas I made my way to the train station in Wilmington. On the news that \nmorning, they gave a report about an international survey that was \ntaken where they asked thousands of people in different countries and \nhere: What is it about your work that you like? What is it about your \nwork that makes you like your job or not like your job?\n  Some of the people who were asked said: Well, the thing I like about \nmy job is I like getting paid--not that they are in it for the money, \nbut they like getting paid. Others said they like vacations. Some \npeople said they had health care. Others said they like the folks they \nwork with. Other people said they like the environment--a beautiful \nplace like this in which they work. But what most people said they \nliked were really two things: No. 1, they knew the work they were doing \nwas important, and No. 2, they felt as though they were making \nprogress. Think about that. They knew the work they were doing was \nimportant and they felt as though they were making progress.\n  Well, there is probably nobody in our country--at least working \nwithin the Federal Government--who does work more important than the \nfolks at the Department of Homeland Security. The House and the Senate \nhave worked in recent years to strengthen the ability of the Department \nof Homeland Security, including the US-CERT team, to be able to do \ntheir job even better.\n  My hope is that in years to come, as we hear these annual reports on \nbest places to work within the Federal Government, that we are going to \nfind that the people at the Department of Homeland Security, including \nNCCIC and US-CERT, will be saying more and more: I like working here \nbecause I know the work I do is important, and I feel as though we are \nmaking progress.\n  This Senator would just say to everyone at US-CERT, thank you for all \nthe good you do for us. Thank you for your service to this country. And \nto each of you, we wish you happy holidays and Merry Christmas. We \nwould also say, here is hoping that we will all have a more peaceful \nnew year. I think the American people are ready for that. I know the \nPresiding Officer is, and so am I.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer).

Madam President, next week we will mark the 3-year \nanniversary, for lack of a better word, of the massacre at Sandy Hook, \nCT. Senator Blumenthal will be joining me on the floor momentarily. I \nwanted to come to the floor to speak to our colleagues for a few \nmoments about what this week will mean to us in Connecticut and the \nchallenge it presents to all of us.\n  I want to open by speaking about one of the young men who perished \nthat day--a little first grader by the name of Daniel Barden. Daniel \nwas a really, really special kid. I talk about him a lot when I am \nspeaking on Sandy Hook because I have gotten to know his parents pretty \nwell over the years, so I feel like I know Daniel pretty well. Now that \nI have a little 7-year-old first grader at home, too, I, frankly, feel \ncloser than ever before to the families such as the Bardens who are \nstill grieving.\n  Daniel had this sense of uncanny empathy that, now as a father of a \n7-year-old, I know is, frankly, not normally visited upon children that \nage. Daniel just loved helping people in big and small ways; he was so \npreternaturally outward in his sympathy for others.\n  There is a story his dad likes to tell about the challenge of going \nto the supermarket with Daniel because when they would leave, Daniel \nalways liked to hold the door open for his family. But then he wouldn't \nstop holding the door open because he wanted to hold it open for all of \nthe rest of the people who were leaving the grocery store. So the \nfamily would get all the way to the car, and they would look back and \nthey wouldn't have Daniel because he was still holding the door open. \nIt was small things like that that made him such a special kid.\n  His father, Mark, wrote one day: ``I'm always one minute farther away \nfrom my life with Daniel, and that gulf keeps getting bigger.'' His \nmother, Jackie, in the months and years following Daniel's death, \ndeveloped a habit of what grief counselors call defensive mechanisms. \nShe would sometimes pretend that Daniel was at a friend's house for a \ncouple hours, simply in order to give herself the strength to do simple \nhousehold chores like cooking dinner or returning emails. The only way \nshe could do it is if she pretended for a small slice of time that \nDaniel was actually still alive.\n  It is hard to describe for my colleagues here today the grief that \nstill, frankly, drowns Sandy Hook parents and the community at large. \nIt is total, it is permanent, and it is all-consuming. But for many of \nthose parents and many of those community members, the grief now is \nmixed with a combination of anger and utter bewilderment, all of it \ndirected at us, in the Senate and in the House of Representatives.\n  On December 14, Adam Lanza walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School \narmed with a weapon that was designed for the military--designed to \nkill as many people as quickly as possible. He had 30-round magazines, \nnot designed for hunting or for sport shooting but to destroy as much \nlife as quickly as possible. Importantly, he left at home his lower \nround magazines. And the design of his weapons worked--to a tee. In \napproximately 4 minutes, he discharged\n\n[[Page S8574]]\n\n154 rounds, and he killed with ruthless efficiency: 27 people shot, 26 \ndead, including 20 first graders.\n  Here are their names: Rachel D'Avino, 29; Dawn Hochsprung, 47; Anne \nMarie Murphy, 52; Lauren Rousseau, 30; Mary Sherlach, 56; Victoria \nLeigh Soto, 27.\n  And the students: Charlotte Bacon, Daniel Barden, Olivia Engel, \nJosephine Gay, Dylan Hockley, Madeleine Hsu, Catherine Hubbard, Chase \nKowalski, Jesse Lewis, Ana Marquez-Greene, James Mattioli, Grace \nMcDonnell, Emilie Parker, Jack Pinto.\n  It keeps going: Noah Pozner, Caroline Previdi, Jessica Rekos, Avielle \nRichman, Benjamin Wheeler, and Allison Wyatt.\n  There are a handful of kids who aren't on that list, because there \nwere children in Victoria Soto's classroom who were able to escape, \nlikely--as investigators believe--when Adam Lanza had to reload his \nweapon to put another 30 bullets in it.\n  So 3 years later, as we grieve those 26, we are still having these \nawful, searing questions to ponder: What would have happened if Lanza \ndidn't have an assault rifle? Would he even have had the perverse \ncourage to walk into that school if not aided by the security of having \na high powered killing machine? Would less kids have died? What if his \ncartridges had six or 10 bullets instead of 30? Would more kids be \nalive if someone had been able to stop him while he fumbled with \nanother reload?\n  The facts of Sandy Hook are hard to hear over and over, but they are \nimportant because they should have educated us on ways that we could \ncome together to make another mass shooting less likely. But we ignored \nSandy Hook, and it happened again and again. This year, there have been \nmore mass shootings than there have been days in the year: 9 in \nCharleston, 5 in Chattanooga, 9 again in Roseburg, 14 in San \nBernardino.\n  As I sat at that firehouse with Senator Blumenthal that afternoon in \nSandy Hook, as the news rolled into those parents that the children \nthey loved wouldn't be coming home, if someone had told me that day \nthat we would do nothing--that our response as a Congress and as a \ncountry would be utter silence--I wouldn't have believed it--no way. \nBut if somebody then told me that it would happen again and again and \nagain and we still wouldn't do anything, I would have collapsed in \ndisbelief.\n  I am going to tell my colleagues, that is how the families feel. \nWhatever we think is the best way to stop this carnage--changing our \ngun laws, giving more resources to law enforcement, changing our mental \nhealth system to get more help to those who are becoming unhinged and \nthinking about settling their real or imagined grievances with \nviolence--do something to honor those children and adults. Do something \nto show there is an ounce of compassion as we sit here 3 years after \nthe bloody massacre at Sandy Hook.\n  Our mental health system is broken. We have closed down 4,000 \ninpatient beds since the recession began. It is harder than ever for \nfamilies to get the help they need. If you read the report on Adam \nLanza, you will see a very troubled young man who was utterly failed by \nthe behavioral health system that stood around him.\n  Stronger gun laws do work. They absolutely would have prevented some \nof those kids from dying. And the data is irrefutable. This mythology \nthat you are safer with more guns has zero basis in fact. The data \ntells us that in States that have tougher gun laws, they have less gun \ndeaths. In States that have higher rates of gun ownership, they have \nmore gun deaths. Stronger gun laws work.\n  To be honest, the burden is not just on us; it is also on the \nadministration. I have called, along with many of my colleagues, on the \nadministration to take some steps, if Congress won't, to make sure that \nthose who are truly gun dealers, though they might not have a brick-\nand-mortar store--those who are selling guns with frequency at places \nsuch as gun shows or on the Internet--have to do background checks, a \nrecognition that they are dealers just like people who have stores in \nyour downtown.\n  So my plea, 3 years after this tragedy that utterly transformed that \ncommunity, is for us to recognize that there is no other country in the \nworld that would live with this level of slaughter. There is no other \nnation in the world that would accept 80 people dying every day from \npreventible gun violence and mass shooting after mass shooting and not \neven try to fix it. That is what is so offensive to me, and 3 years \nlater that is what is so hard to understand for the families whom we \nrepresent in Sandy Hook, CT.\n  If you don't want to believe me, I am going to close the exact same \nway I closed 2 years ago on the 1-year anniversary. I am kind of \nashamed that I have to read this letter again because every single word \nof it still applies 2 years later, when the epidemic of mass shootings \nin this country hasn't abated but simply grown. It is from a mom whose \nchild survived, and I will close with it.\n\n       In addition to the tragic loss of her playmates, friends, \n     and teachers, my first grader suffers from PTSD. She was in \n     the first room by the entrance to the school. Her teacher was \n     able to gather the children into a tiny bathroom inside the \n     classroom. There she stood, with 14 of her classmates and her \n     teacher, all of them crying. You see, she heard what was \n     happening on the other side of the wall. She heard \n     everything. She was sure she was going to die that day and \n     did not want to die for Christmas. Imagine what this must \n     have been like. She struggles nightly with nightmares, \n     difficulty falling asleep, and being afraid to go anywhere in \n     her own home. At school she becomes withdrawn, crying daily, \n     covering her ears when it gets too loud and waiting for this \n     to happen again. She is 6.\n       And we are furious.\n       Furious that 26 families must suffer with grief so deep and \n     so wide that it is unimaginable.\n       Furious that the innocence and safety of my children's \n     lives has been taken.\n       Furious that someone had access to the type of weapon used \n     in this massacre.\n       Furious that gun makers make ammunition with such high \n     rounds and our government does nothing to stop them.\n       Furious that the ban on assault weapons was carelessly left \n     to expire.\n       Furious that lawmakers let the gun lobbyists have so much \n     control.\n       Furious that somehow, someone's right to own a gun is more \n     important than my children's rights to life.\n       Furious that lawmakers are too scared to take a stand.\n\n  She writes:\n\n       I ask you to think about your choices. Look at the pictures \n     of the 26 innocent lives taken so needlessly and wastefully, \n     using a weapon that never should have been in the hands of \n     civilians. Really think. Changing the laws may \n     ``inconvenience'' some gun owners, but it may also save a \n     life, perhaps a life that is dear to me or you. Are you \n     really willing to risk it? You--\n\n  Speaking to us--\n\n     have a responsibility and obligation to act now and change \n     the laws.\n       I hope and I pray that you do not fail.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I am honored to follow my colleague and friend Senator Murphy in an \neffort that has involved both of us, our minds and our hearts, from the \nday we stood together on December 14, 2012, in Newtown, Sandy Hook. We \nhave stood together and worked together with the families and community \nthat so inspired us with their strength and courage.\n  If I have one overriding image and message in my mind and heart, it \nis those families most directly affected by the deaths of 20 beautiful \nchildren and sixth grade educators, the families in the reverberating \ncircle of people so deeply touched, hurt, and harmed by the evil on \nthat day, and the people who exemplified the good of that day, the \nfirst responders, the firefighters and police, who saw things no human \nbeing should ever have to witness and emerged also deeply hurt and \nharmed. The courage and strength of Newtown, that community, and the \nfamilies will always inspire me.\n  I have worked on gun violence prevention for many years, a couple of \ndecades before December 14, 2012. I was the attorney general of the \nState of Connecticut and a State legislator advocating for the assault \nweapon ban and other gun violence prevention measures. Then, as \nattorney general, I defended the assault weapon ban when it was \nchallenged in court, tried the case, and we successfully argued it in \nthe State supreme court. So I knew intellectually and abstractly why we \nneed in this Nation and in Connecticut stronger measures to stop gun \nviolence. The experience of that day left a\n\n[[Page S8575]]\n\nsearing mark on my heart and on my conscience, so it became for me the \npassion and priority it is today, and I will not rest as a Member of \nthis body and as a human being until this Nation does better to make \nAmerica safer and to prevent the kind of tragedy we saw on that day.\n  I will never forget being at that firehouse on that afternoon, but I \nwill also never forget that evening at St. Rose of Lima Church when the \ncommunity came together to light a candle rather than curse the \ndarkness.\n  I had a conversation with one of the parents who lost a child. It was \neither that night or in the grief-filled days thereafter, when I said \nto her at some point: When you are ready, I would like to talk to you \nabout what we can do about this. She said to me: I am ready now.\n  That is the courage we have seen in the last 3 years from those \nfamilies. It is the courage we saw this morning at an event in the \nCapitol. It is the courage we have seen again and again from Newtown, \nfrom all over the country, loved ones and victims of all of the \nplaces--they become kind of landmarks that we recite. There are 30,000 \ndeaths every year from places whose names we could never recite here \nbecause it would be too long and because they are the mundane places \nthat all of us go.\n  As my colleague Senator Murphy said this morning, all of us are just \none second away from becoming victims. The fact is we are all touched \nby gun violence and we are all harmed and hurt by it.\n  I will never forget that evening. I will never forget also the day on \nthe floor of this House when the Senate failed to approve a commonsense \npackage of gun violence prevention measures, universal background \nchecks, banning illegal trafficking, a ban on assault weapons, the \nmental health initiative, and from the Gallery someone shouted down: \nShame. They may have said: Shame on you. There is no record of it \nbecause we record only what happens on the floor, but on that day the \nmost profound and eloquent comment was those three words: ``Shame on \nyou.''\n  Shame on us in the U.S. Senate. We are complicit by our inaction. \nCongress is complicit by its silence. Moments of silence have their \nplace, but silence by inaction here is complicity. It is not only the \nfailure to act, it is also the obstruction that has been placed in the \nway of knowledge and research. The so-called rider--nobody outside the \nU.S. Capitol would talk about riders, an amendment that stops the \ngovernment from doing research--literally research, fact gathering, \ninvestigation on gun violence. The cause of 30,000 deaths every year in \nthis country cannot be researched by the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention.\n  In fact, we face a public health crisis in this country. If it were \nEbola or influenza or polio, facing these kinds of epidemics or feared \nepidemics in this country, we would react with drastic and effective \nmeasures, including quarantine, that would mobilize this Nation. The \nresponse of the Congress to the epidemic of gun violence is to bar \nresearch by the CDC and other public health authorities. The very same \npublic health community that could help us understand and take action \nis gagged and straitjacketed by the U.S. Congress. Even the initial \nauthor of that amendment restricting research, former Congressman Jay \nDickey, a Republican from Arkansas, said he has regrets. ``I wish we \nhad started the proper research and kept it going all the time,'' he \nsaid.\n  The Congress owes the American people more, but this promise I can \nmake. We are not going away. We are not abandoning this effort. We will \nnot be silenced. We will not be inactive. We are not giving up.\n  Twelve years it took to pass the Brady bill, after the President of \nthe United States was almost assassinated just a few miles from here \nand his Press Secretary, Jim Brady, was paralyzed. It took 12 years to \npass, with the support of President Reagan, and we need to be prepared \nfor that kind of marathon.\n  President Reagan famously said: ``Facts are stubborn things.'' We \ncannot deny the facts that drive this debate because laws do work. We \ncome here every day with the presumption that what we do makes a \ndifference, that the laws we pass make a difference. Gun violence \nprevention laws do work.\n  When the shooter at Sandy Hook had to change magazines, children \nsucceeded in escaping. If he had been barred from having the assault \nweapon, had it been banned, unable to bring it to the site of that \nhorrific tragedy, it might have made a difference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for just 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. If the shooter in Charleston had been barred, as he \nshould have been because he was ineligible, rather than having the \nopportunity to purchase weapons as a result of the 72-hour rule \nloophole, it might have made a difference there. We can't say for \ncertain.\n  We know there is no panacea, no magic solution, but the loved ones of \nthe families of Sandy Hook, San Bernardino, Colorado Springs, Roseburg, \nRoanoke, Charleston, and Lafayette have to make a difference here. \nHonor them with action is what we should do; inaction is complicity. We \nowe the American people better. We need to keep faith with its values \nand keep faith with America.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/senate-section/article/S8575-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8575-S8576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO GOVERNOR TERRY BRANSTAD\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I wish to honor Iowa Governor Terry \nBranstad on a very historic milestone. On December 14 of this year, \nGovernor Branstad will become the longest serving Governor in the \nNation's history. He breaks a record set by Governor Clinton of New \nYork in the early days of our country, even before the Constitution of \nour country was established, between the Articles of Confederation into \nthe early years of New York as a State in the United States of America. \nThat is a very large feather in the cap of a farm kid from the town of \nLeland, population 289, in Winnebago County in northern Iowa.\n  In many ways, a smalltown farm background prepared Terry Branstad for \nhis success as a State house member, Lieutenant Governor, and then \nGovernor on two separate occasions. If he finishes this term--and he \nwill--it will add up to 24 years as Governor.\n  The farm crisis of the 1980s hit every farm State hard, and Iowa, at \nthe heart of the Nation's breadbasket, suffered deeply. All of us who \nlived in Iowa at that time saw friends and neighbors lose their family \nfarms and struggle with what to do next for a living. The State needed \nmen and women with vision and ambition to pull the economy out of the \ndoldrums. It needed people who could see the potential for farmers to \nadd value to their operations and for Iowa to diversify its economy, \nwhich it has now done.\n  Of all the people out there, Terry Branstad stood out as Governor. He \nwas at the forefront of creating a new environment to do business. He \nwelcomed and actively encouraged innovation that would capitalize on \nIowa's bedrock work ethic and our strong schools. As a result, \nagriculture was and continues to be a mainstream of Iowa's economy. But \nagriculture more than ever is an engine for many other employment \nsectors: renewable energy, manufacturing, crop research, insurance and \nfinancial services, and, of course, as we Iowans know, much more.\n  As Governor from 1983 to 1999, Terry Branstad took the helm during \nsome of the State's worst economic turmoil in decades and steered the \nship toward impressive economic growth. The unemployment rate went from \n8.5 percent to a record low of 2.5 percent. The Governor could have \nrested on those laurels and continued to work outside of State \ngovernment after he retired after those first 16 years, but he again \nanswered the call when the State needed him again in 2010. He put the \nState of Iowa's interests ahead of his own and went to work for Iowans \nthis second time, bringing his valuable leadership to the Governor's \noffice for another round. That, in a nutshell, tells you everything you \nneed to know about Terry Branstad.\n  The State of Iowa comes first for him. Iowans are well acquainted \nwith\n\n[[Page S8576]]\n\nTerry Branstad's accomplishments and work ethic. It is gratifying to \nsee those attributes get attention on a national scale and in the \nhistory books. He has earned his place in history.\n  Of course, First Lady Christine Branstad ought to be complimented \ntoo. We thank her for her public service and, most importantly, for \nsharing her family with all Iowans.\n  We are lucky to have had Governor Terry Branstad for these years as \nchief executive in Iowa, and, of course, I am lucky to call him a \nfriend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven).

Mr. President, I had the opportunity of heading a \ndelegation this past weekend of 10 Senators who went to Paris for the \nCOP21 talks, the climate change talks taking place in Paris. I was very \nproud of our delegation consisting of Senator Whitehouse, Senator \nFranken, Senator Markey, Senator Merkley, Senator Udall, Senator \nShaheen, Senator Coons, Senator Booker, and Senator Schatz. All of us \nparticipated in the meetings that took place in Paris. We were \nimpressed that 150 leaders of the world were in Paris at one time to \nshow their support for a successful outcome on climate change and to \nexpress their urgency for dealing with this issue. I think it was a \nstrong followup to the challenge Pope Francis gave all of us as to the \nmoral challenge of our time to protect our planet for future \ngenerations.\n  At the meeting in Paris, we recognized that our global health is at \nstake. Whether we are talking about our individual States--and I could \ntalk about the people on Smith Island, as their island is disappearing, \nor the health of the Chesapeake Bay, and my colleagues in the western \npart of this country could talk about the wildfires and what is \nhappening there. In Asia, we see climate migrants as a result of \nclimate change. In Greenland, we see the glaciers disappearing. Every \nnation is at risk as a result of global climate change, and that is why \n150 leaders went to Paris.\n  The objective is clear. We had a chance to talk to the Secretary \nGeneral of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon. He made it clear that our \ngoal at a minimum should be to reduce the increase in warming by 2 \ndegrees Celsius. That is doable. The scientists tell us we can do it. \nAnd if we do, we will have a healthier planet, we will create more \njobs, and not only America but the world will be more secure.\n  It was clear that U.S. leadership was critically important to that \nmoment in Paris. President Obama, in getting China and other countries \nto submit action plans, encouraged over 180 countries that are \nparticipating in the Paris talks to submit their own action plans to \nmitigate greenhouse gas emissions. That represents over 97 percent of \nthe world's emitters.\n  As I mentioned, we met with the Secretary General of the United \nNations, Ban Ki-moon. We all met with former Vice President Al Gore. I \nthink we all were inspired by his lifelong dedication to this issue. We \nhad a chance to meet with U.S. lead negotiator Todd Stern, who updated \nus on what was happening.\n  We were particularly impressed with Secretary Moniz, our Secretary of \nEnergy. He had earlier announced, with other world energy leaders, an \ninnovation initiative showing how we can use U.S. technology to make it \neasier for the world to meet their goals in reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions and at the same time create more jobs in America. It was an \nimpressive display.\n  We had a chance to meet with local leaders. Mayor Bloomberg convened \na summit of mayors. I was proud that my mayor from Baltimore City, \nStephanie Rawlings-Blake, was there.\n  My colleagues participated in bilateral meetings of other countries \nto encourage them to be aggressive in submitting their obligations and \nhow we could follow up and make sure we achieve our goals.\n  It was clear that Paris is heading toward a successful agreement, and \nit will have U.S. support. We mentioned our commitment to carry not \njust our individual commitment but to be part of the global agreements \nin Paris.\n  We pointed out that in 1992, the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change was ratified by the U.S. Senate. This is the legal \nbasis for moving forward. We also pointed out that our obligations to \ncomply with our own commitments are controlled by the Clean Air Act, \nwhich is the law of our country. We pointed out the actions taken by \nthe Obama administration. We also pointed out that 69 percent of \nAmericans agree that we should have a multilateral commitment to reduce \nour carbon emissions.\n  It was clear to us that by working together, we can have a healthier \nplanet for our children and our grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to Senator Udall, one of the great \nleaders on the environment and a very active member of our delegation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I wish to first say to Senator Cardin, who \nled our delegation--Senator Cardin is the ranking member on the Foreign \nRelations Committee. Foreign relations has a lot to do with this issue. \nHe showed great leadership, and I believe he is passionate about this \nissue and finding solutions.\n  So we were somewhat disappointed, the 10 of us who went--all \nDemocrats--that Republicans didn't join us. This is an issue that needs \nbipartisanship. We need to join--Republicans and Democrats--on an issue \nthat threatens our national security, threatens our economy, and \nthreatens our environment. It is an issue that is looming out there and \nneeds attention. So we look forward to working with our friends on the \nother side of the aisle to move forward on this issue.\n  As I looked over there and saw what was happening, I remembered many \nof the briefings we have had. Everyone who has looked at this challenge \nof global warming and climate change says that we need to do two \nthings. First, we need to drive capital to new energy sources, to clean \nenergy sources. We need to innovate is what they are talking about. If \nyou get the capital there and you get the private sector working, you \ncan come up with the solutions. Secondly, we need to put a signal in \nthe marketplace to invest in clean energy and renewable energy.\n  I was so proud of what happened over there in terms of the world \njoining together. More than 184 countries came together, and we are \ngoing to see the conclusion of their action this week. They have \nstepped forward and said: We are going to have targets, we are going to \nhave goals, and we are going to be transparent. We are going to let \npeople know we are moving in the direction of solutions and doing \nsomething about this immense problem.\n  So it was a major step forward to see those 184 countries step up and \ndecide to do something.\n  In addition, Bill Gates led a group of entrepreneurs over to Paris to \nannounce and to challenge the world about energy research and \ndevelopment. As everyone knows, Bill Gates is one of our great \nentrepreneurs. He and his wife are also philanthropists. He stepped up \nwith 27 other billionaires to say: We are going to put billions into \nresearch and development, and we are going to put it into \ninnovation. They called this project Mission Innovation, and they \nchallenged other countries around the world to do the same thing--\ndouble their energy research and budget.\n\n  So seeing 184 countries step up to the plate and say ``We are going \nto do this''--and I think we will see those announcements in the next \ncouple of days--and seeing these entrepreneurs step forward I think was \na signal--and a bold signal--to the marketplace that we are changing \nand moving in a new\n\n[[Page S8577]]\n\ndirection and that we are going to get this done.\n  I am very proud of my State of New Mexico because we have all sorts \nof energy--uranium, coal, oil, gas--and we have many renewable \nsources--wind, biomass, solar, geothermal, but we have taken a strong \nstep in New Mexico to push for renewable resources. In our State \nstatutes, we pushed for a renewable electricity standard of 10 percent \nby 2010. We met that early, so we put another standard in place of 20 \npercent by 2020.\n  We are really in the bull's-eye in terms of climate change in New \nMexico because of what we see and what we know happens in the \nSouthwest. The temperatures are twice as high. We have seen those \ntemperatures increase over the last 50 years. So we know there is a \ncrisis, we know there is an issue, we know we need to do something \nabout this, and we are very willing to step forward.\n  Mr. President, according to a study at Los Alamos National \nLaboratory, by 2050--not far away--we may not have any forests left in \nmy State. It will be as if New Mexico were dragged 300 miles to the \nsouth. Our climate will resemble land that is now in the middle of the \nChihuahuan desert.\n  Now, I am not a scientist. Neither are my colleagues. But the experts \nat LANL--and scientists all over the world--are clear. If we do \nnothing, global warming will only get worse.\n  The nations of the world know this. That is why over 190 nations are \nin Paris: To meet the challenge of climate change, and to do it \ntogether.\n  The Paris agreement will not solve the problem of global warming by \nitself, but it is a major step forward. It is what we need to ensure \nevery country does its part, and does its fair share on climate change.\n  The largest emitters in the developing world--China and India--are \nmaking serious commitments. They understand, they have to reduce their \nreliance on fossil fuels.\n  This is about their economy, and it is about a commitment to future \ngenerations.\n  Opponents of U.S. climate action have argued that other nations--\nespecially China--would never act to limit their emissions. Well, now \nthey are. This is encouraging--and something we need to encourage \nfurther. That is what the world's scientists tell us. That is what our \nown Department of Defense tells us. We can make progress now--or face \never greater instability later.\n  More than 180 nations are on board with individual commitments. They \nwill take concrete steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This is \nhistoric. This will slow global warming--and it must be done now, not \nlater. The world cannot afford to wait.\n  These nations see the threat. They see the mounting danger. A \nrepresentative from Bangladesh told me that in his country every day, \nthey face the threat of rising sea levels.\n  These countries came to Paris with a commitment to succeed.\n  And the work began before Paris--such as when the U.S. and China \nannounced major mitigation commitments last year.\n  Our task now is to keep up the momentum, to keep moving forward--both \nat home and abroad. I believe there are two things we can do right now:\n  No. 1, work to drive capital to new energy efficient technologies. We \nneed to renew the Production Tax Credit for renewables. Tax incentives \nhave been in place for decades for oil and gas.\n  Wind, solar and biofuels need that investment as well.\n  No. 2, send a positive signal to the markets. That means keeping our \nown climate goals on track, and stopping efforts that would turn back \nprogress. That means encouraging capital investment in sustainable \nenergy--not just in the U.S, but, throughout the world.\n  We are seeing a growing investment in new technologies with public \nand private resources. Last week, 28 of the world's billionaires \ncommitted to investing in energy research and innovation.\n  And we are seeing a major market signal that there is demand for \nthose technologies--here in the U.S. through the Clean Power Plan and \nother measures, and across the globe, especially in developing \ncountries, that have demonstrated a commitment to grow their economies \nin a cleaner, more sustainable way.\n  Now is the time for action. America must lead, because we cannot \nignore the danger--to our planet, to our economy, and to our security. \nThe science is clear, the threat is growing, and time is running out.\n  This is not news to people in my State. In New Mexico, temperatures \nare rising 50 percent faster than the global average--not just this \nyear or last year, but for decades.\n  We have seen historic droughts. When it does rain we have seen \nterrible flooding. And we have seen the worst wildfires in New Mexico's \nhistory. What we have not seen--what we have waited for--is for \nCongress to act.\n  It has not been for lack of trying. There have been many attempts--\nincluding bipartisan ones. But each and every time Congress failed to \nmake it to the finish line, failed to pass comprehensive legislation--\nin both Houses--to curb our greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Just this week, the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Science held a \nhearing focused on whether climate change is real. This is settled \nscience. The world has moved on. The United States Congress should, \ntoo.\n  So the President and the EPA have used their authority under the \nClean Air Act to lead. They have done what needs to be done, with the \nsupport of many of us here in Congress--and of the American people.\n  The Clean Power Plan is reasonable, and it will make a difference to \nrestrict emissions from new and existing power plants.\n  Mr. President, I hope that going forward Congress will work on \nsolutions--rather than wasting time on Resolutions of Disapproval, \nrather than wasting time on questioning science.\n  The American people do not want a science debate. They want action. \nThe world has come together in Paris. Nations are moving forward. The \nvery real question now is--how do we keep that going?\n  As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I will continue to fight \nagainst dangerous environmental riders.\n  I am encouraged by the conference in Paris, and I am confident that \nthe United States will continue to lead--even if our Republican \ncolleagues continue to block.\n  With increased U.S. leadership over the last 5 years we have made \ngreat international progress. The Paris conference is evidence of that.\n  Another sign of progress--the world's largest oil and gas companies \nare supporting a climate agreement.\n  BP, Shell--and the massive state oil companies of Saudi Arabia and \nMexico--are among the ten major oil companies making commitments.\n  The United States can help lead this effort--not only at the \nnegotiating table in Paris, but on the front lines in New Mexico and \nevery other State.\n  Because in this great challenge, there is also great opportunity. Our \ncountry can lead the world in a clean energy economy. We have the \ntechnology, we have the resources. We need the commitment.\n  That means finding solutions, developing technology, and not denying \nscientific reality; not wasting time on empty resolutions that come \nfrom nowhere and go nowhere.\n  There are now more solar jobs in the United States than coal jobs.\n  My state has every kind of energy resource: Coal, oil, gas, uranium, \nsolar, wind, algae biofuel and more. We are doing all we can to \ndiversify--and reduce carbon emissions. A clean energy economy protects \nour communities and creates jobs.\n  A renewable electricity standard--which I have long fought for--would \ncreate 300,000 jobs. Most of these jobs are high-paying, they are \nlocal, and they cannot be shipped overseas.\n  Support for renewable energy is strong. Nearly half of the U.S. \nSenate supported my amendment in January for a Renewable Electricity \nStandard that would mandate that 30 percent of our energy come from \nrenewable resources by 2030. Over half the States already have \nrenewable energy portfolios. Many of them are being met and exceeded.\n  In New Mexico, we are blessed with great natural resources and with \ngreat human resources as well. Researchers at Sandia and Los Alamos \nnational\n\n[[Page S8578]]\n\nlabs are studying climate change--not with an agenda, but with a \ncommitment--to tackling the problem, with real science and with real \ninnovation.\n  Together, we can meet this challenge. We can find a path forward that \nworks. We can work with the global community. We can protect our \nplanet. But, America must lead and help drive progress across the \nworld.\n  Mr. President, 48 national security and foreign policy leaders--\nDemocrats and Republicans alike--have sounded the alarm. From Chuck \nHagel to William Cohen, from Madeleine Albright to George Schultz, in a \njoint statement they urge us to fight climate change. They urge us to \n``think past tomorrow.''\n  The Paris agreement is a starting point and a historic opening for a \nglobal effort to address climate change. It is an opportunity, it is an \nobligation, and it is something that history will show was the right \nthing to do.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleagues have joined me on the floor. \nSenator Schatz, Senator Shaheen, and Senator Cory Booker are down here, \nand they have done excellent work. I yield at this time to Senator \nSchatz. I would just say by the way of introduction that I am so \nimpressed with his State and the leadership in his State. Hawaii is \ngoing to be a 100-percent renewable State in 2040. A lot of that is due \nto his leadership and his legislature and Governor stepping up to the \nplate.\n  With that, Senator Schatz.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from New Mexico \nfor his longtime leadership on climate and conservation issues.\n  I have been working on this for a long time, as many of us on the \nfloor have been working on this for a long time, and I have not been so \nhopeful in a very long time. I am reminded of the essential elements of \nsuccess when it comes to an international agreement, and that is \nAmerican leadership. We still remain the indispensable Nation, and we \nfinally reasserted ourselves and reclaimed the moral high ground and \nthe political high ground that put us in a position to stitch together \nan international agreement.\n  One observation I will offer from the Paris climate talks is how \npositive the response was. I think we anticipated that we were going to \nhave to do perhaps more troubleshooting, more allaying of concerns \nabout America's commitment to climate action than we ended up having to \ndo. That is because people understand that the President is committed, \nand people understand that the Clean Power Plan is going forward, and \nwe are making progress and there is no turning back.\n  I will offer seven very quick observations about the Paris climate \ntalks. The first is this: It is already a success. If you had told any \nknowledgeable observer that they were going to get 185 countries--\nrepresenting 97 percent of countries and 98 percent of emissions--and \n150 heads of State in the same place at the same time--the most in \nhistory--if you had said that 2 years ago, that would have sounded \nwildly optimistic. We really are making progress.\n  No. 2, this is not going to require Senate approval. There have been \nmore than 18,000 such agreements that our President and Presidents in \nthe past have entered into over time not requiring Senate approval.\n  No. 3--and this is important and can't be overstated--it is not \nenough. If we want to hit the 2-degree Celsius target, this only gets \nus about 40 percent there. But 40 percent there is 40 percent there. We \nwere at zero 3 weeks ago. So I think getting 40 percent there is very \nimportant.\n  I think the other thing we have learned from other states and other \ncountries and even in the private sector is that once you unleash the \npower of clean energy on the private sector, there is no turning back. \nSo we anticipate being able to ratchet up these agreements every 3 to 5 \nyears on an international basis.\n  No. 4, it is way more than expected and way more than ever before.\n  No. 5, I think we need to know that there are some pretty good \naccountability and transparency mechanisms in there. This was a key \nelement of the negotiations that Secretary Kerry and the President \nhimself have insisted upon. We need to know--the United States has a \nrobust reporting mechanism. At the public utilities commission level, \nat the regional level, we know exactly what our energy portfolio is. \nThat is a little bit more of a challenge in the developing world, so we \nhad to develop a matrix so we know that countries aren't cheating or \nthey are not getting their own data wrong. I feel satisfied that it is \nlikely to hit those marks.\n  No. 6, it is wildly popular in the United States. Two-thirds of \nAmericans support an international climate agreement. A bare majority \nof Republicans, a decisive majority of young Republicans, and decisive \nmajorities of Democrats and Independents support international climate \naction.\n  No. 7 is this: People are going to try to undo this. They are going \nto do it through the Congressional Review Act. They are going to try to \ndo it through the appropriations process. They are going to try to do \nit through the electoral process. That is the democratic process, and \nthat is OK. But there is no turning back either legislatively, \npolitically, or in terms of the momentum we have in the private sector.\n  I would like to introduce someone who has come at climate from a \ndifferent perspective, as he always does, who has become a leader on \nthese issues, and who was an incredible asset during the weekend we \nwere in Paris, and that is the junior Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Cory \nBooker.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, just a brief moment. First and foremost, I \nwant to thank the group of Senators who went over to Paris on the \ncodel. It was very important that the United States of America was well \nrepresented there and that this body was well represented there.\n  I especially thank Senator Cardin for leading that codel. His \nleadership was critical. As the ranking member of Foreign Relations, to \nhave him lead and understand that this is a critical issue not just in \nregard to the climate in general but also to our national defense, to \nour strength as a Nation, and to our economy--it was good to have him \nleading and understanding the breadth of these issues.\n  When I was over there, I was moved to see virtually all of the globe \nrepresented by leaders, heads of state, members of Parliament, NGOs, \ncorporations--major, global, dominant corporations. Everyone was there. \nThere was an array of the planet coming together, focused on this issue \nof the impacts of climate change. Conversations ranged from focusing on \nus being innovative and how we are dealing with renewable technology so \nthat technology can be a great pathway toward sustainability in the \nfuture, all the way to resiliency and making sure we were doing the \nthings to protect populations from the effect of climate change, \nespecially when it comes to poor populations who are disproportionately \naffected.\n  I had the chance, the honor while I was there of leading a bilateral \nconversation with Bangladesh, talking to peer leaders--the United \nStates sitting down at a table with and across the table from Ministry \nand Parliamentary members from Bangladesh.\n  By many estimates, Bangladesh is the most vulnerable country on the \nglobe to climate change--the most vulnerable large country to climate \nchange. It is about the size of Iowa. It faces serious challenges with \nmelting off the Himalayas as well as rising sea levels.\n  Due to climate change, right now Bangladesh is losing 1 percent of \nits arable land each year, and it is projected over the next decade or \nso--leading into 2030--to lose a large percentage of its land, \ndisplacing millions of Bangladeshis, literally creating climate \nrefugees. The sea level rising is predicted to inundate about 15 \npercent of the land area and create refugees, making it a reality for \nthem that is so urgent that they went there with a large degree of \nmission to join with other global actors.\n  I was proud to be able to sit with them and talk to them about New \nJersey--not only a State that has 75,000 people who are Bangladeshis \nbut also a State that knows that our economy and our strength as a \nState will be affected by climate change as well. We are already seeing \nwhat is happening with the warming of our oceans, the acidification of \nour oceans, how it is affecting the many jobs related to our\n\n[[Page S8579]]\n\nfishing industry. We are already seeing the challenges with our climate \nin terms of increased weather activity and severe storms.\n  This is an issue that affects America that we cannot solve without \njoining with the rest of the globe. We know that the injustices that \nare happening to our Nation in terms of increased fires, in terms of \ndespoliation of our seas, the challenges being faced with weather \nactivity internally in our country--we know these issues cannot be \nsolved locally unless we deal with them globally. That is why I am \ngrateful for all of those who understand that American leadership is \nincredibly needed.\n  I am proud to stand here with colleagues of mine and continue to send \na strong message to the rest of the globe that we are here in the \nUnited States strongly supporting the ambitious commitments of \nPresident Obama, the ones that he is making, and that we will defend \nthose communities that are facing this crisis in the immediate and long \nterm. We will be leaders.\n  One of my colleagues and someone whom I have come to respect quite a \nbit was an incredibly strong voice in Paris, someone who is committed \nto these issues not only in her home State but, as an American, across \nour country. I wish to now engage and acknowledge Senator Jeanne \nShaheen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here on the floor \nwith my colleagues--those of us who went to Paris, led by Senator \nCardin, for this climate summit.\n  At the conference in Paris, more than 180 countries accounting for \nover 90 percent of global emissions were there. They all submitted \ntheir plans for how they are going to reduce emissions, with the goal \nof keeping global warming below 2 degrees Centigrade by the end of this \ncentury.\n  One of the things I was impressed with in Paris was that the \ncountries that were there represented everybody from China to the \nMarshall Islands, and all of them understood that climate change is \nreal, that it is a threat to our planet, and that we have to do \nsomething about it. They understand that because they have seen it. \nThey have seen it in their home countries. They have seen rising sea \nlevels, extreme weather events, environmental changes--all linked to \nglobal warming.\n  Here in the United States, we see it too. According to a recent Pew \npoll, two-thirds of all Americans recognize that climate change is real \nand that action must be taken to address it. We see it in my home State \nof New Hampshire, where we are seeing a change in our wildlife \npopulation, a change in our snowpacks that affects our ski season, our \nfoliage season is affected, and it has an economic impact on our \nState. But the exciting thing is--and we saw this very clearly in \nParis--that at the local level, mayors, Governors, local leaders around \nthe world understand that we have to take action to address it, and \nthey were there in Paris urging the negotiators to come to some sort of \nan agreement.\n\n  In New Hampshire, we have taken action. With nine other Northeastern \nStates, we have been part of a regional cap-and-trade program called \nthe Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. As a result of that and other \nactions that we have taken, we are going to meet the goals of the Clean \nPower Plan 10 years early.\n  The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative has generated $1.6 billion in \nnet economic value. It has created more than 16,000 jobs across the \nregion. That is one of the benefits of the action we can take to \naddress climate change. As we all know here, it doesn't matter what we \ndo in New Hampshire. It doesn't matter what we do in this country. \nUnless we get a global agreement in Paris so we are all going to move \nforward together to address the harmful impacts of climate change, we \nare going to see the continued sea level rise, the continued extreme \nweather events, all of the continued negative impacts of that global \nwarming.\n  Finally, I want to say that for me one of the most exciting things \nabout meeting with people when we were in Paris was hearing that they \nwere cautiously optimistic that we will get an agreement, that we will \ntake action, and we will be able to make a difference for our planet \nand for future generations.\n  I was pleased to have Senator Chris Coons from Delaware with us on \nthis trip. I know he is going to talk about what he observed when we \nwere in Paris.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I wish to express my gratitude to Senator \nCardin for leading this great delegation of 10 Senators to the Paris \nConference of Parties--the COP21, the global climate change conference \nin Paris--and to Senator Shaheen of New Hampshire for her tireless \nleadership on energy efficiency. The least expensive, most powerful way \nwe can reduce our energy consumption is by investing in new \ntechnologies and new approaches that help create jobs and manufacturing \nin the United States and reduce our total energy consumption and \nfootprint.\n  I think the Paris conference has already been a success from the \noutset. As we heard directly from the head of the United Nations Ban \nKi-moon, 150 heads of state gathered at the very outset of that \nconference, and 184 countries made voluntary national commitments to \nreducing their greenhouse gas emissions, to reducing their carbon \nfootprint, and to working together to find sustainable solutions to \nthis very real challenge.\n  The other thing I found most encouraging about the many conversations \nwe had with governmental leaders, with advocates, with nonprofit \nleaders was a commitment to bring together developed countries such as \nthe United States and European and Asian allies of ours and the \ndeveloping world--the very large countries such as India and China \nwhich have become major emitters of greenhouse gases--to bring them all \ntogether in one common agreement.\n  One other comment I wish to make that comes out of what we saw going \nthrough an Innovation Fair that was hosted by Secretary Ernie Moniz of \nour Department of Energy was that governments alone can't solve climate \nchange. Global conferences, such as the one we attended, are \nimportant--they are critical--but making real and sustained impact on \nfighting climate change is also going to require new and innovative \napproaches, and that requires investment by the private sector and by \nthe Federal Government in clean energy and energy efficiency research \nand development.\n  Commitments made in Paris, such as the announced new mission \ninnovation and the breakthrough energy coalition, which are public-\nprivate partnerships to ramp up and accelerate our investment in \nresearch and development are more important than ever.\n  We also had a chance to attend a meeting of some national leaders, of \nmayors and county executives, of Governors, and folks who lead regions \nand provinces around the world where remarkable progress has been made. \nAt the same time that we are moving forward through this global \nconference as a group of nations, it is also important to recognize \nwhat subnational groups have done.\n  Senator Shaheen referenced the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, \nwhich New Hampshire and my home State of Delaware participate in. It \nhas been a remarkable and effective way for a whole group of Mid-\nAtlantic and Northeastern States to work together. The nine \nparticipating States have reduced our emissions by nearly 20 percent \nwhile also seeing stronger economic growth than the rest of the \ncountry, I think, suggesting it is possible for us to both reduce our \ngreenhouse gas emissions and continue to grow a strong economy.\n  In fact, my home State of Delaware has reduced its GHG emissions more \nthan any other State in the last 6 years. That is partly due to the \ngreat leadership of my Governor, Jack Markell, and partly due to the \ndeployment of a lot of new solar systems and a lot of investment in \nenergy efficiency.\n  If I might, let me mention one important piece of bipartisan \nlegislation that I think is part of solving this challenge of how do we \nachieve an ``all of the above'' energy future that has sustained long-\nterm investments in clean energy and energy efficiency research and \ndeployment; that is, the Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act. This \nis a very bipartisan bill that has long\n\n[[Page S8580]]\n\nhad the support of Republican Senators Murkowski, Moran, Collins, and \nGardner. Even Congressman Ted Poe, of Houston, TX, who represents a \ngreat deal of oil and gas in his district, is an advocate for this \nbill. I have been leading it, along with Senator Stabenow, Senator \nBennet, Senator King, and others in this Chamber. It is an important \nway that we can allow master limited partnerships, long available to \nthe oil and gas industry, to be opened up to all forms of energy to \nmake it a level playing field and to provide opportunities going \nforward to finance renewable energy products and energy efficiency \nprojects. This small tweak to our Tax Code could make a cumulative big \ndifference going forward.\n  In conclusion, let me renew my point that government alone can't \nsolve climate change, but it has a central role to play in bringing \ntogether the people who can. Let's pass the MLP Parity Act, and let's \nmake long-term, sustained investments in Federal R Let's bring \ntogether public, private, and nonprofit leaders because there is no \nlimit to what we can accomplish when our brightest scientific minds, \nbusiness leaders, and our diplomats working for us in Paris come \ntogether to lay out a positive, sustained goal.\n  I wish to yield the floor to my colleague, the junior Senator from \nthe State of Rhode Island, who has been a tremendous and tireless \nchampion for conservation and in particular for our oceans, which are \nsuch a vital part of our climate future.\n  I yield the floor to Mr. Whitehouse of Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, one of the features of our trip to \nParis was the presence of America's corporate leaders there urging us \non. We not only met with significant corporate leaders like people from \nCitigroup, PG, VF Industries, and others, but they were cheering us \non publicly in advertisements like this one taken out by the food and \nbeverage industry, calling on a strong Paris climate agreement. The \ncompanies who signed this include Mars--if you like M, you like \nMars--General Mills, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, Hershey and Nestle, \nKellogg, Unilever, and others.\n  The food and beverage industry was joined by an advertisement from \nsome of America's apparel leaders: VF Corporation, based in North \nCarolina, which produces North Face, Timberland, and a whole variety of \nother very well-known and popular brands--Adidas, the shoe \nmanufacturer; Levis, if you know jeans you know Levis; Gap, which has \nstores all over the country; and others from the apparel industry. \nPerhaps the biggest advertisement that the American business community \ntook out was this one: Companies like not only Johnson & Johnson, the \nbandaid people, but Johnson Controls, Colgate-Palmolive, Owens Corning, \nProcter & Gamble, Dupont, and utilities like National Grid and PG So \ncorporate America made a very strong statement in support of a strong \nParis climate deal.\n  The last one I will show is this one, which was taken out by \nAmerica's financial leaders--Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs, \nJPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo. There was a strong, \npowerful message from America's corporate leadership that I very much \nhope our colleagues on the other side will begin to listen to; that \nParis is a good thing, a strong agreement is a good thing, and we need \nto make progress together.\n  With that, I will turn over the floor to my terrific colleague \nSenator Merkley from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, a huge thanks to my colleagues who have \nbeen presenting so many important dimensions of this battle against a \nmajor threat to the health of our planet. Indeed, Henry David Thoreau \nasked, ``What's the use of a fine house if you haven't got a tolerable \nplanet to put it on?'' That was an excellent question decades ago but \nan even more important one today, when we have a significant threat \nthat endangers our forests, our farming, our fishing, and human \ncivilization on this planet. This is the challenge of our generation, \nto bring human civilization together to address carbon pollution and \nits impacts.\n  While in Paris something very exciting was going on--150 world \nleaders came together to kick off the final negotiations. That is \nunprecedented in human history. Why were so many leaders there? They \nwere there because they are seeing the impacts in their own individual \nnations that are coming from the rising temperatures. They came \ntogether not just with their voice but with their pledges. In fact, \nmore than 180 countries put forward pledges about how they were going \nto reduce the trajectory of their carbon pollution footprints. They \nknow what is at stake.\n  We certainly know in Oregon what is at stake. We see the pine beetle \ndevastating forests, creating a red zone of dying trees. We see the \nlonger forest fire season having a big impact, with more intense blazes \nand more of them over more months. We see the impact of the loss of \nsnowpack in the Cascades impacting our streams and impacting the water \nsupply for agriculture. The Klamath Basin, along with California, is \nlocked into a deep drought with devastating consequences. We see it \nover on our coast, where the more acidic Pacific Ocean is creating \nproblems for our shellfish industry because the baby oysters have \ntrouble making their shells. How is this connected? Because the carbon \npollution in the air is absorbed into the ocean via waves and creates \ncarbonic acid, and that more acidic water is eroding the ability of our \nshellfish to operate as they have for a millennium in making shells.\n  We know this is not just something in Oregon, not just something in \nMaryland, and not just something in this State or that State but \nworldwide, where 2014 was the warmest year on record. In fact, 14 of \nthe 15 warmest years on record have happened in this century. Now we \nsee 2015 on the trajectory, and it is going to be warmer than 2014.\n  There is nothing disputable about the facts: rising carbon dioxide \nand methane pollution, rising consequences for our States across \nAmerica, rising consequences for the world. Scientists tell us it will \nget worse. We have only had a 0.9-degree centigrade increase. If we get \nto 2 degrees, it is catastrophic. It is pretty bad now. We must come \ntogether as an international community and address that.\n  In Paris we know we need to have a more ambitious agenda than the one \nwe have laid out, even with these wonderful pledges, and we need to \ncome back every 5 years and keep driving the process forward. We know \nwe have to lower the costs for renewable energy so we can come back \ntogether and increase the pace at which we pivot from a fossil fuel \nenergy economy to a renewable energy economy.\n  We know we need to invest in solar deployment, and there is the \nInternational Solar Initiative that India is going to host a \nsecretariat for and work to deploy a trillion dollars in solar panels. \nWe know innovation matters, and mission innovation with the United \nStates and other nations doubling their investment over the next 5 \nyears will do a lot more to lower costs and increase the efficiency of \ntechnologies in clean power and clean power storage.\n  Well, it is a big challenge, and I am so delighted to be able to be \npart of a community of legislators. One of those legislators who has \nled on this in the House for decades, brought his expertise to the \nSenate, is my colleague from Massachusetts Senator Markey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon for his \nleadership, bringing the message of the harm being done to our natural \nworld, I thank Senator Cardin for taking this delegation of 10 Members \nto Paris, and I thank the Senator for having this session on the floor.\n  We are at an inflection point. We are at a point where the danger to \nthe planet is clear.\n  Mr. President, 2014 was the warmest year ever recorded. This past \nNovember was the warmest November ever recorded. October was the \nwarmest October ever recorded. There is now a warming of our planet \nthat is intensifying dangerously, and we have to act in order to avoid \nthe most catastrophic consequences, and that is what is happening in \nParis right now. The United States is leading the way. The rest of the \nworld is coming together, and we have a chance to have a very good \nagreement.\n  We are going to have the President's back because the 1992 treaty, \nunder\n\n[[Page S8581]]\n\nwhich he is negotiating, was ratified by this body. The Clean Air Act \nthat he is operating under was passed by this body. The clean power \nrules and increase in fuel economy standards----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n1 minute to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, this afternoon--and I think it will \ncontinue over the next week--the Republicans and the American petroleum \nindustry are going to try to lift the ban on the exportation of \nAmerican oil, which could lead to more drilling for millions of barrels \nof oil on our soil, while at the same time not giving a simultaneous, \nequal extension of wind and solar tax breaks so that we can continue \nthis revolution that we are bragging about in Paris right now to the \nrest of the world. These two things do not go together.\n  You cannot simultaneously drill for more oil that is not drilled for \ntoday and then have an ending of the wind and solar tax breaks as they \nare kicking in. You cannot preach temperance from a barstool. You \ncannot preach temperance as you are putting up new oil rigs and \nsimultaneously say that the wind and solar tax breaks are going to end \nand end soon. We have to have both if there is going to be a deal, and \nright now that is in question in this Chamber.

Mr. President, today I complete the series of floor \nspeeches on religious freedom that I began in September. My purpose in \nthis series is to present the full story of religious freedom in the \nhope that we may better understand and appreciate it and draw guidance \nfor the future. Charting a path forward requires understanding where we \nhave been and taking stock of where we are right now.\n  The story of religious freedom, as I have laid it out, shows that we \nmust choose between two starkly different paths. The story begins with \nreligious freedom itself and why it is uniquely important and requires \nspecial protection. I said in September:\n\n       No decision is more fundamental to human existence than the \n     decision we make regarding our relationship to the Divine. No \n     act of government can be more intrusive or more invasive of \n     individual autonomy and free will than the act of compelling \n     a person to violate his or her sincerely chosen religious \n     beliefs.\n\n  The story continues with the central place of religious freedom in \nAmerica's identity. At no time in world history has religious freedom \nbeen such an integral part of a nation's origin and character. The \nseeds were planted centuries before the actual founding of this country \nwith one religious community after another coming to these shores to \nfreely practice their faith.\n  When Congress enacted the International Religious Freedom Act less \nthan two decades ago, we declared that religious freedom ``undergirds \nthe very origin and existence of the United States.''\n  The story of religious freedom in America includes understanding both \nits status and its substance. In October, I explained how the status of \nreligious freedom can be summarized as both inalienable and preeminent. \nReligious freedom is inalienable because, as the Declaration of \nIndependence asserts, it comes from God, not from government. And \nbecause it is endowed, that is part of our very humanity. Religious \nfreedom is preeminent or, as James Madison put it, ``precedent, both in \norder of time and in degree of obligation to the claims of civil \nsociety.''\n  I also explained that the substance of religious freedom can be \nunderstood in terms of its depth, or what it includes, and its breadth, \nor to whom it applies. Religious freedom, for example, includes much \nmore than religious belief or speech. In fact, protecting in law both \nreligious belief and the exercise of that belief preceded the First \nAmendment by 150 years. Madison again gives us guidance to finding the \nexercise of religion as the freely chosen manner of discharging the \nduty an individual believes he or she owes to God. This includes both \nbelief and behavior in public and in private, individually and \ncollectively. The substance of religious freedom also includes its \nbreadth of application to all human beings.\n  The First Amendment protects not certain exercises of religion or the \nexercise of religion by certain persons, but the free exercise of \nreligion itself.\n  As I mentioned, Congress unanimously enacted the International \nReligious Freedom Act. The vote in this body was 98 to 0, and 21 \nSenators serving today--12 Republicans and 9 Democrats--voted for this \nlegislation, as did Vice President Biden and Secretary of State John \nKerry, who were serving here at that time. That law declares our \nreligious freedom to be a universal human right, a pillar of our \nNation, and a fundamental freedom. This is the path of religious \nfreedom on which we have traveled for three centuries, before a very \ndifferent path emerged.\n  In November, I outlined how the courts have begun to distort the \nFirst Amendment's protection for religious freedom. America's Founders \nincluded a narrow prohibition on government establishment of religion \nas a support for the broad individual freedom to exercise religion. \nSince the mid-20th century, however, courts have instead expanded the \nestablishment clause into a virtual ban on religion in public life and \nnarrowed the free exercise clause so that government may more easily \nrestrict the practice of religion itself.\n  I also examined how the courts, the Obama administration, and State \nlegislatures are contributing to attacks on religious freedom right \nhere in America. The common theme in these attacks is that far from \nbeing special, religious freedom must yield to other values or \npolitical objectives. Even worse, some are arguing that religious \nfreedom is actually something negative that should be limited or even \nsuppressed. These attacks not only target particular exercises of \nreligion but undermine religious freedom itself.\n  Rather than inalienable, these attacks would turn religious freedom \ninto something granted or restricted by the government at its whim. \nInstead of preeminent, these attacks would reduce religious freedom to \nsomething optional and subservient. Rather than something deep and \nbroad, these attacks would turn religious freedom into something \nshallow and narrow.\n\n  State courts, for example, have imposed heavy fines on business \nowners who decline, based on their religious beliefs, to provide \nservices such as photography, flowers or catering for same-sex \nmarriages. The decision by these business owners did not prevent anyone \nfrom getting married or from having the wedding they chose. Other \nphotographers, florists, and bakers gladly stepped up to do business. \nThe only real effect of these fines was to punish these individuals for \nexercising their religious beliefs. By punishing the exercise of \nreligion itself, these courts are saying that religious freedom must \nnecessarily yield to other political priorities.\n  ObamaCare made the same two-part attack on religious freedom but on a \nmuch larger scale. First, far from trying to accommodate religious \nfreedom in developing ObamaCare or its implementing regulations, \nneither Congress\n\n[[Page S8587]]\n\nnor the Obama administration gave religious freedom any consideration \nwhatsoever. This is appalling in several different ways. Not only does \nit reflect a callous attitude toward this fundamental right, but it \nignores the Religious Freedom Restoration Act's command that Federal \nlaw properly accommodate religious freedom. The only way to avoid that \nrequirement is for Congress explicitly to exempt a statute from RFRA's \nstandards. Congress did not do so.\n  But consider this. On January 15, 2010, President Obama issued his \nfirst Religious Freedom Day proclamation. He reaffirmed ``our nation's \nenduring commitment to the universal human right of religious \nfreedom.'' Just 2 months later, he signed into law the statute that so \nblatantly ignored and would be used to undermine that very universal \nhuman right.\n  The second way that ObamaCare undermines religious freedom is by \nimposing significant burdens on the actual exercise of religion. The \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, for example, tried to force \nbusiness owners to provide insurance coverage for methods of birth \ncontrol that violate their religious beliefs. Thankfully, last year the \nSupreme Court said the Obama administration should have more properly \naccommodated religious freedom.\n  Another case is now before the Supreme Court in which the Obama \nadministration is demanding that a religious organization be forced to \nparticipate in providing insurance coverage for practices that violate \ntheir religious beliefs. The Obama administration, with its army of \nsmart lawyers and deep well of taxpayer dollars, is fighting tooth and \nnail to make sure its political objectives quash religious freedom.\n  Last week, I outlined the benefits that religion and religious \nfreedom provide. It is essential to forming and securing our basic \nrights. Religion was the engine driving great social movements, such as \nabolition and civil rights. It motivates significantly greater \ncontributions by individuals to charities of all kinds and inspires \nmany of the largest charitable organizations in the country. But \nreligion is not simply beneficial to society; it is an indispensable \nfeature of any free government. Without religion and the moral \ninstruction it provides, freedom falters and democracy all too easily \ndissolves into tyranny.\n  In the 18th Century, the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780 declared \nthat ``the happiness of a people and the good order and preservation of \ncivil government essentially depend upon piety, religion, and \nmorality.''\n  In the 21st Century, Harvard professor Mary Ann Glendon argues \npersuasively that religious freedom reduces societal violence and \ncorrelates with democratic longevity.\n  The story of religious freedom that I have offered over the last few \nmonths presents a choice that we must make as we consider the way \nforward. On one path, religious freedom is an inalienable and \npreeminent right of all people; on the other path, it is an uncertain \nand optional possibility for some people. On one path the government \nmust accommodate religious freedom; on the other path religious freedom \nmust accommodate the government. One path is consistent with our \nhistory, founding, character, commitments, and an example to the rest \nof the world. The other path rejects that history, turns its back on \nour commitments, and abandons human rights in favor of shifting \npolitical agendas.\n  Here is how I put it in one of my speeches last month:\n\n       Subjugating religious freedom beliefs to government decrees \n     is not the price of citizenship. To the contrary, respecting \n     and honoring the fundamental rights of all Americans is the \n     price our government pays to enjoy the continued consent of \n     the American people.\n\n  We must decide whether we still believe what our Nation, our people, \nand our leaders have said and done. James Madison wrote that religious \nfreedom is an inalienable right that takes precedence over the claims \nof civil society.\n  Thomas Jefferson said that religious freedom is ``the most \ninalienable and sacred of all human rights.''\n  Franklin Roosevelt said that religious freedom is a fundamental and \nessential human freedom.\n  The United States voted for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \nin 1948, signed the Helsinki Accords in 1975, and ratified the \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1992.\n  Each of these identifies religious freedom as a fundamental human \nright that includes both belief and behavior in public and in private, \nindividually and collectively.\n  Congress enacted the Religious Freedom Restoration Act almost \nunanimously in 1994. I should know; I was the principal advocate for \nit. It sets a tough standard for allowing government interference with \nreligious freedom and offers this protection for all exercises of \nreligion by all people. Democrats and Republicans, liberals and \nconservatives, adherents of different faiths--everyone joined hands on \nthese basic principles. And I might add that Hatch and Kennedy joined \nhands as well.\n  In the 2013 Religious Freedom Day proclamation, President Obama said \nthat religious freedom is an essential part of human dignity. This is \nthe path on which America began, the path America's Founders embraced, \nthe path that all three branches of government have recognized, and the \npath we have reaffirmed countless times.\n  The burden is on those who believe that we should now leave this \npath. Those who no longer believe that religious freedom is an \ninalienable right and an essential human freedom should say so. Those \nwho no longer believe that, as our statutes and treaties assert, \nreligious freedom is a fundamental right and a pillar of our Nation \nshould be honest and up front about it. Those who believe that the \nshifting political priorities of the day trump religious freedom should \ncandidly make their case.\n  In the last week, since the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, we \nhave glimpsed some of the ugliness that is down the path where politics \ntrumps religious freedom. Many of our leaders expressed support and \noffered thoughts and prayers for the victims and their families. Those \nexpressions were met by some with disdain, ridicule, and scoffing.\n  Reporters, bloggers, activists, and even Members of Congress sent the \nmessage that thoughts and prayers are really not much of anything and \nin any event are legitimate only if they come from those who want more \ngun control.\n  Finally, I want to highlight for my colleagues another source of \nguidance in choosing the future path for religious freedom. In June \n1988, the most diverse group of leaders in American history presented \nthe Williamsburg Charter to the Nation. Its purpose was to reaffirm \nreligious freedom for all citizens, to set out the place of religious \nfreedom in American public life, and to offer guiding principles for \nthe future. Former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford and the \nchairmen of the two political parties signed it. The president of the \nAFL-CIO and the chairman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce signed it. \nPresidents of universities and bar associations signed it. Leaders of \nfaith communities, including the National Council of Churches and \nNational Association of Evangelicals, Seventh-day Adventists, the \nSynagogue Council of America, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-\nday Saints signed it.\n  What could possibly unite such a disparate group? It would have to be \nsomething too general to be useful--perhaps something like sunshine or \nfriendship--or something so profound that we simply must sit up and pay \nattention. The first principles of religious freedom affirmed by the \nWilliamsburg Charter are these:\n  First, religious freedom is an inalienable right that is ``premised \nupon the inviolable dignity of the human person. It is the foundation \nof, and is integrally related to, all other rights and freedoms secured \nby the Constitution.''\n  Second, the ``chief menace to religious liberty today is the \nexpanding power of government control over personal behavior and the \ninstitutions of society, when the government acts not so much in \ndeliberate hostility to, but in reckless disregard of, communal belief \nand personal conscience.''\n  Third, limiting religious liberty ``is allowable only where the State \nhas borne a heavy burden of proof that the limitation is justified--not \nby any ordinary public interest, but by a supreme\n\n[[Page S8588]]\n\npublic necessity--and that no less restrictive alternative to \nlimitation exists.''\n  These are the principles that should guide our way forward.\n  Religious freedom is inalienable. Religious freedom is threatened \nwhen government either directly burdens or fails to accommodate it. \nGovernment burdens on religious freedom must be the least restrictive \nmeans of achieving a compelling government purpose or supreme public \nnecessity.\n  These principles inform proper resolution of the challenges that \nreligious freedom will certainly face ahead.\n  Some are calling for government to revoke or deny such things as tax-\nexempt status, certifications, or licenses for religious organizations \nwith certain beliefs. I already mentioned how some courts are using \nanti-discrimination statutes to trump religious freedom.\n  Applying the principles I have discussed would require the government \nto make the case that such impositions are the least restrictive way to \nfurther a supreme public necessity.\n  Another challenge will be in the development, rather than the \nimplementation, of anti-discrimination laws. Applying the appropriate \nprinciples requires that such legislation properly accommodate \nreligious freedom.\n  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, for example, includes a \nreligious exemption. I supported the Employment Non-Discrimination Act \nin the 113th Congress because, in addition to incorporating that \nexemption, it also prohibited retaliation against those who qualify for \nthe exemption. My State of Utah this year enacted an anti-\ndiscrimination statute that similarly included a robust exemption for \nreligious organizations.\n  Earlier this year, however, Senators introduced the Equality Act, \nwhich would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation \nand gender identity across several areas such as employment, housing, \nand education. It not only fails to incorporate the existing title VII \nreligious exemption, it contains no accommodation for religious freedom \nat all.\n  This is an example of the path that rejects religious freedom as even \nworthy of consideration. Such legislation should not become law unless \nit properly accommodates religious freedom.\n  This is a time for choosing. The story of religious freedom is both \nan inspiring narrative and a cautionary tale. It brings to mind the \ninscription on a statue fronting the National Archives that ``eternal \nvigilance is the price of liberty.''\n  The heritage of religious freedom that took centuries to build could \nbe dismantled in a fraction of that time. The right path means balance \nof accommodation; the wrong path means exclusion and suppression. The \nway forward requires us to choose the right path to make sure our \nactions speak louder than our words.\n  Mr. President, I apologize for going over by 5 minutes.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/senate-section/article/S8588-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the President of the United States has \nfully refused to acknowledge the depth and prevalence of the savagery \nof Islamic terrorism, and he has refused to offer and implement a \nstrategy to permanently defeat it.\n  We are all too familiar with the consequences of Islamic terrorism: \nFort Hood, Boston, Oklahoma, Chattanooga, Ankara, Mali, Beirut, Paris, \nand more recently, San Bernardino.\n  While the President was in Paris recently, he lectured the American \npeople not on the moral necessity to destroy ISIS but instead on our \nsupposed lack of compassion and understanding regarding his latest plan \nto resettle 10,000 Middle Eastern refugees in America.\n  I represent the great State of North Carolina. It is a State that has \nprovided refuge to those who have fought and died on America's side--\nthe South Vietnamese, Laotians, Montagnards, and Cambodians. But the \nPresident's remarks were disingenuous, because what he didn't tell the \nAmerican people is that his own FBI Director has warned of America's \ninability to properly vet the refugees--an inability that only requires \na 1 in 10,000 chance to produce a catastrophic and tragic result.\n  Instead of acknowledging these well-founded concerns, the President \nhectored the critics of his plan--Republicans, Democrats, and everyone \nelse in between--even after French authorities told him several members \nof the terrorist cell got into France masquerading as Syrian refugees. \nSyrian refugees with fake passports were caught trying to reach America \nthrough Honduras, and Syrians have been arrested trying to cross into \nTexas.\n  Let me tell you why this administration's rebuke is indicative of a \nforeign policy that is completely detached from reality. On October 29, \n23 refugees died in a rocket attack at Camp Liberty in Iraq. Camp \nLiberty is a former U.S. military base outside of Baghdad that is home \nto more than 2,000 Iranian refugees who are members of the main \nopposition group to the ayatollahs in Tehran. The refugees at Camp \nLiberty have been fully vetted by American intelligence services. \nEighty Iranian-built rockets struck the camp that has been home to the \nPeople's Mojahedin, an organization that has tried to fight the mullahs \nin Tehran. The ayatollahs want the leaders and the families of these \ninhabitants at Camp Liberty eliminated, and their friends in Baghdad \nare doing their bidding.\n  The men, women, and children at Camp Liberty have suffered numerous \nattacks resulting in hundreds of casualties. Nor has Camp Liberty, \nwhich was supposed to be a temporary home before the refugees were \nsettled outside of Iraq, met the most basic humanitarian needs. They \nlack clean water, decent food, medical supplies, and decent living \nfacilities; and every single day they go to bed at night worried if it \nis their last day on Earth.\n  The Obama administration pledged to protect these refugees who put \ntheir lives and their children's lives on the line for freedom. Yet it \nhas done absolutely nothing to keep America's word. Why take in \nunvetted Syrian refugees and not a handful of refugees from Iran that \nare fully vetted? To curry favor with the same regime that killed \nAmerican soldiers during Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New \nDawn? I hope not.\n  President Obama has willfully ignored 40 years of hostility from \nTehran. If the President does not recognize that we are at war, the \nayatollahs certainly do. They are the chief sponsors of global terror. \nThey have imprisoned American journalists. They have tested long-range \nmissiles. They just completed another test in violation of \ninternational treaties over the last couple of weeks. They have never \nstepped back from their desire to obliterate Israel and to destroy the \nUnited States.\n  This is the Obama doctrine. The President sees American foreign \npolicy as the problem. He views Israel as an obstacle to peace, and \nIran is treated as another oppressed constituency with legitimate \ngrievances against the West, so much so that when millions of Iranians \ntook to the streets against the mullahs, President Obama did nothing \nand said nothing. The old American alliances are collapsing in \nconfusion and fear, and the only answer from the administration seems \nto be to clear Iran's path to a nuclear weapon.\n  Section 1227 of this year's National Defense Reauthorization Act \nmemorializes Congress's desire to see that our friends at Camp Liberty \nare protected and relocated outside of Iraq in accordance with \ninternational conventions.\n  The children of Camp Liberty are dying and the bad guys are watching.\n\n[[Page S8589]]\n\nThey are watching to see if the President of the United States tosses \naside another American friend, clearing the way for a new Persian \nempire--a tyrannical empire armed with nuclear weapons.\n  I will end with the thoughts of Natan Sharansky, a survivor of the \nSoviet Gulag. He said:\n\n       Today an American President has once again sought to \n     achieve stability by removing sanctions against a brutal \n     dictatorship without demanding anything in return. . . . We \n     are at a historic crossroads, the United States can either \n     appease a criminal regime--one that supports global terror, \n     relentlessly threatens to eliminate Israel and executes more \n     political prisoners than any other--or stand firm in \n     demanding change in its behavior.\n\n  I don't think a lot of people know about Camp Liberty, but I want you \nall to know that there are 2,000 people over there who were fighting \nfor freedom in Iran. The American people committed to protecting them \nand to getting them to a place where they can be safe. These are \nrefugees who are fully vetted. They have gone through all the processes \nthat we are wondering and worrying whether the Syrian refugees can. \nLet's show good faith by fulfilling our promise to the people at Camp \nLiberty and making sure that the American people know and the people at \nCamp Liberty know that we care about them and we wish them the very \nbest that they can achieve--and that is not in a camp somewhere in \nIraq.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor my good friend and \nthe Governor of Iowa, Terry Branstad. Monday marks his historic \nmilestone as the Nation's longest serving Governor with 7,642 days in \noffice working for our great State of Iowa. Our Governor has devoted \nhis life to public service and has worked tirelessly through his 99-\ncounty tour to ensure that Iowans' voices are heard.\n  I have also had the great honor of serving under the Governor during \nmy time in the Iowa Army National Guard. Through the years, Governor \nBranstad and I have had countless conversations about the military and \nour veterans. We both know these men and women are well trained and \nhave selflessly sacrificed in defense of our freedoms and our way of \nlife. That is why we must ensure that our veterans are properly \nprepared to transition back to civilian life.\n  As a veteran himself, Governor Branstad recognizes just that. It was \nGovernor Branstad who led significant efforts to help veterans find \nwork across Iowa, following their launch of the Home Base Iowa public-\nprivate initiative in November of 2013. Since then, Home Base Iowa has \nsucceeded in helping over 1,500 veterans in Iowa find work, getting 900 \nbusinesses to join the Home Base Iowa initiative. There are also 24 \nHome Base Iowa communities around the State, and we have 16 educational \ninstitutions that are working with the initiative and have been deemed \nCertified Higher Academic Military Partners. All that great \nparticipation and success is thanks to the Governor's leadership.\n  Through the years, our State has been incredibly fortunate to have a \nGovernor who truly cares about the people and our veterans. The fact \nthat he continues to wear his uniform for various veterans' events in \nIowa further illustrates his support, his leadership, and his \ncommitment to our men and women in uniform. Our Governor is someone who \ntruly cares about serving others, and we are incredibly fortunate to \nhave a leader such as he.\n  In light of his major and well-deserved milestone, we honor Governor \nBranstad's steadfast commitment and leadership to the people of Iowa.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to alert the Senate and all of my \ncolleagues to yet another--yes, yet another--egregious action by the \nInternal Revenue Service, one that will affect every charity, every \nchurch, every nonprofit, and the communities they work so hard to \nserve. I emphasize ``another'' because it seems that the IRS continues \na march toward regulations and practices that target and burden hard-\nworking Americans.\n  Let me just recap. First, we learned that the IRS had released \nconfidential tax return information on companies the IRS believed \nopposed the administration. Then we uncovered that the IRS had \nillegally targeted groups whose views differed from the White House, \nfollowed by an extensive effort to hide information on these actions--\ni.e., Lois Lerner, her so-called ``lost e-mails,'' which weren't ever \nreally lost. It was true injustice to law-abiding organizations and \nAmerican citizens, which is why I should not have been surprised--but I \nwas--to learn of the IRS's latest scheme.\n  Hot off the press is a new IRS proposed regulation that needlessly \ntargets charitable contributions. Right now, when you make a \ncontribution of $250 or more, charities will send you a ``written \nacknowledgement'' confirming the details of the donation, including the \namount of the donation. The taxpayer uses this acknowledgement to \ndocument his or her tax deductions should there be any question.\n  Most charities take the time to send out a written confirmation of \nthe donation as part of their thank-you to the donor. It is simple, it \nis inexpensive, and it builds good will. In short, it works for the \ntaxpayer and also for the charity. That is it--a straightforward, \ncommonsense method to confirm a donation was made, and no one, not even \nthe IRS, argues that it is not working well.\n  But now the IRS has proposed a new method to substantiate donations--\na method that could do great harm to the charitable sector and give the \nIRS more tools to go after taxpayers they may not like, as we know they \nhave done before. The IRS wants to set up a new, more formal system \nwhere the charity would have to gather information about its donors, \nkeep that information, and--here is the rub--report the information to \nthe IRS.\n  What type of information are we talking about? The return would \ninclude the charity's name and address, the donor's name and address \nand--here is the scary piece--the donor's Social Security number. \nAgain, all of this new information would have to be sent to the donor \nand the IRS and kept on file by the charity at considerable cost. Even \nmore disturbing, the IRS would store, maintain, and use this \ninformation in case the donor is audited.\n  Although this is described as an option, given the IRS's recent track \nrecord, do we really trust the agency to store this information and not \nuse it for other purposes? I, for one, do not. I don't think we can \ntrust them with a new source of data on donors. We must do all we can \nto prevent the IRS from gaining access to this sensitive data.\n  I am also alarmed at the thought of whether the IRS can properly \nsafeguard this information because the agency has demonstrated zero \ncapacity to keep similar data out of the hands of people who commit \nfraud, and thieves. Charities and churches that routinely receive \nthousands of dollars from their supporters now become greater targets \nfor people to commit fraud.\n  Earlier this year, the IRS admitted that it had been hacked and \nprivate taxpayer information had been compromised. If they can do it to \nthe IRS, you had better believe they can do it to your local nonprofit. \nAnd while the IRS today says this rule as proposed would simply be \nvoluntary, suffer no illusion: The IRS will eventually move to make \nthis a mandatory requirement.\n  Charitable organizations are also speaking out against the IRS \nproposal. They understand the chilling--chilling--effect this would \nhave on\n\n[[Page S8590]]\n\ntheir donors, but, more importantly, on the communities they serve.\n  Tim Delaney, president and CEO of the National Council of Nonprofits, \nrecently wrote:\n\n       The IRS proposal would open the door for scam artists. . . \n     . Nonprofits have neither the financial resources nor \n     sufficient staffing to combat hackers who will see an easy \n     source for Social Security information. This also creates a \n     liability nightmare for innocent nonprofits. . . . To be \n     asked to share their address, their credit card number and \n     their Social Security number all in the same place would be \n     enough to scare even the most committed donor to decline to \n     give.\n\n  Tim Delaney has aptly summarized this pending and serious problem. He \nposes very legitimate concerns, especially regarding how scam artists \nmight operate, explaining:\n\n       Imposters' phone scripts will go something like this: ``Hi \n     . . . I'm working for several nonprofits here in Kansas to \n     make sure that generous donors like you get full credit for \n     your wonderful contributions. . . . The nonprofits asked me \n     to thank you for your generosity and confirm your name and \n     address. . . . Also, the IRS has a new regulation that \n     nonprofits need your Social Security number so we can send \n     you a form confirming your contribution in case you get \n     audited. What's your Social Security number so we can send \n     you the form?''\n\n  Sadly, many people who want to be sure to support their charity will \ngive the scam artists exactly what they want.\n  To protect the mission of our nonprofit community and the taxpayers \nwho share their hard-earned dollars with those in need, I have \nintroduced legislation to block this regulation and to maintain current \nlaw. The Protecting Charitable Contributions Act would maintain current \nIRS rules governing the substantiation of charitable contributions, and \nprohibit the IRS from issuing, revising, or completing any new \nregulation that would alter the existing rules. This just makes sense. \nAnd I would think the IRS would agree when in their own description of \nthe proposal they state that the present system works effectively.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and to join me in \nstopping this dangerous and unneeded proposal from moving forward.\n  I urge all those who play a role in supporting nonprofits to go to \nthe IRS Web site before December 16 to provide written comments to the \nIRS about this proposal. Yep, the IRS would like to have your comments.\n  Let me repeat that. I would urge all those who play a role in \nsupporting nonprofits to go to the IRS Web site before December 16 to \nprovide written comments to the IRS about this proposal. The message \nshould be simple: No.\n  This is one Christmas greeting you had better send.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a couple of \nareas where I think we can make progress on legislation before the end \nof the year. This has been a legislative session in which we passed a \nnumber of important bills, and I think there is more we can do. \nSpecifically, I am going to talk about some legislative initiatives \nthat will give a leg up to American workers--Ohio workers--and also to \nhelp our families and help our students.\n  I will start with students. There is an opportunity over the next \ncouple of weeks for us to ensure that we reauthorize the Perkins Loan \nProgram. Perkins is an incredibly important program, particularly for \nlow-income students. In my view, of all the student loan programs out \nthere, Perkins is by far the most flexible. This is an urgent matter \nbecause if we don't pass an extension, new loans will not be rewarded, \neven in January as students start this next semester. Let's not allow \ncollege tuition to become even less affordable for low-income students. \nLet's ensure that they can get a college degree to pursue their dreams \nand that we do move forward with this Perkins reauthorization.\n  I spoke about this on the floor a month or so ago. I talked about it \nas a program that was incredibly important for students in my State. I \ntalked about the fact that there are 60 schools in the Buckeye State, \nin Ohio, that have received loans from this program. Over the last \nschool year, more than 25,000 Ohio students received financial aid \nthrough Perkins--including about 3,000 students at Kent State \nUniversity and about 1,700 students at the Ohio State University.\n  I was in Columbus last weekend and had a chance to meet with some \nOhio State students who care a lot about this. They want to ensure that \nthis Perkins is going to be there for them so they can stay in school. \nSome of them already have help from other programs, but they know that \nif they don't have the Perkins Loan Program, they can't afford to make \nends meet and to stay in school. It is very important.\n  I have also heard from our college Presidents from around the State--\nparticularly from Dr. Beverly Warren from Kent, who was here a couple \nof weeks ago to talk to me about this, and Dr. Michael Drake, whom I \nsaw last week at Ohio State. They want to ensure that their students \nhave this possibility.\n  One of the students I talked to is Keri Richmond. Keri is a junior at \nKent State, and she interned at my office this past summer. Keri was an \nincredible intern. She is a student who is working hard. She is at Kent \nState, likely to graduate a little bit early. She spent her teenage \nyears going from foster home to foster home. She fought the odds, and \nshe is now excelling in college. She is bright. She is ambitious. Even \nwith her Pell Grant, she has to have that Perkins loan in order to be \nable to stay in school, in order to make ends meet.\n  This is an important program, but it is not about a program. It is \nnot about numbers. It is about people. It is about Keri Richmond and \nothers like her. The impact goes well beyond Ohio. Over 1,7000 colleges \nand universities across the country participate in this program. Low-\nincome students everywhere rely on it. If it expires, it is only more \ndifficult to pay for school. Instead, what we should be doing in the \nSenate is making it easier, not harder, to afford to go to school. Some \nof these tuitions have gone up and up. We have to be sure every kid has \na chance to be able to get ahead by going to college or university.\n  If we don't move, students who previously received a Perkins loan \nwill lose their eligibility if they change institutions or academic \nprograms. It is a big deal for them. If we don't act soon, students who \nare seeking loans for the winter and spring semesters will be \nineligible. In total, it is possible that 150,000 freshmen will lose \ntheir eligibility this fall. We can't let that happen. Let's not allow \ncollege tuition to become this roadblock for low-income students who \nare looking for a college degree. Let's give them this chance. Let's \ngive them this opportunity. By the way, let's extend it but at the same \ntime work on ways to improve the program. I know there are some Members \non my side of the aisle--and I think on the other side as well but \ncertainly on my side of the aisle--who said they have concerns about \nsome of these student loan programs and would like to reform them to \nmake them work better. That is great. Let's take the time to do that.\n  In the meantime, let's not eliminate this program and have these kids \nfall between the cracks. I am there on the reforms. I would like to \nhelp on that. I think we can do better for all of our student loan \nprograms and help all of our kids be able to have a better chance to \nsucceed. Let's not create this terrible uncertainty for these students \nin the meantime. Let's extend this program and then work on those \nreforms.\n  I thank Senator Casey, Senator Baldwin, Senator Collins, and others \nfor their strong leadership on this. I want to ask my colleagues in the \nSenate to do simply what the House has done and do an extension of this \nprogram. The House has already passed this legislation. There is no \nreason it shouldn't be in the omnibus legislation, and there is no \nreason we shouldn't move forward with ensuring that these kids have the \ncertainty they need to be able to stay in school.\n\n[[Page S8591]]\n\n  Mr. President, the second issue I want to talk about is that while \nstudents get the education they need, we also have to ensure that the \ncommunities they are going back to are safe and make sure those \ncommunities can thrive and grow.\n\n  One of the issues we have in Ohio and unfortunately in too many \nneighborhoods all around this country is that you have a lot of blight, \na lot of homes that have been abandoned. Two things happen: One, when \nhomes are abandoned, they become a magnet for crime, for drugs, and for \nother criminal activity to the point that they are dangerous for the \ncommunity, but, second, they drive down the cost of the other houses--\nsometimes by as much as 80 percent. If you are in a community or you \nhave a beautiful home you are taking care of but your neighbor's house \nbecomes abandoned and becomes a magnet for crime and an eyesore, it \ndrives down all of the property values.\n  In Congress we have spent a lot of money, taxpayer money, on helping \npeople deal with their mortgages when they are underwater--particularly \nafter the financial crisis. In my view we ought to focus more on taking \ndown these abandoned homes and creating safer neighborhoods but also, \nthrough market forces, allowing the property values of all of these \nhomes to increase.\n  I think this is an honorable effort, and it is one that a lot of \npeople are focused on now around the country. I don't think we are \nquite caught up to where our neighborhoods are here in Washington, DC, \nbecause when I go home to Ohio I hear about this all the time. We have \nabout 80,000 of these dangerous abandoned homes in Ohio.\n  Again, to address public safety concerns and tumbling home values in \nthese struggling neighborhoods, one of the best alternatives is to \ndemolish these abandoned structures. Sometimes another structure can be \nrebuilt there. That is what we want. We want more economic development \nin these communities. In some cases, I have seen where there was an \nabandoned home, it was torn down and made into a community garden and \nthe community can all participate. The point is to get these homes down \nso we can have the redevelopment we all want.\n  I have walked the streets with local officials in Cleveland, Warren, \nLima, and Toledo, OH, and I have seen these problems firsthand. As I do \nthat, I talk to the residents. I ask them what they think. You can \nimagine the response I get. First, for them, it is an eyesore. It is a \ndanger for their kids, grandkids. Second, they are worried about their \nproperty values.\n  I had one occasion to speak to someone in Toledo, OH, that was \nparticularly concerning to me. This was a woman who had three kids. Her \nhome was right next to an abandoned home, literally feet away--6 or 7 \nfeet away, sort of like a row house. She said: Rob, every night I go to \nbed worrying that the home next to me, which is abandoned, is going to \nbe torched by arsonists. At that point in time--this was in Toledo, \nOH--there was about one arson a night, where these abandoned homes were \nnot just targets for crime but they were also being used by arsonists \nas practice for burning down a home. She was worried about her kids. \nShe was worried she couldn't go to sleep at night because if that home \ncaught fire next to her, her home could be next.\n  This is something we ought to focus on and we can focus on. Land \nbanks in some of our hardest hit areas of Ohio, Michigan, and other \nStates have gotten to work on attacking this problem. They have done a \ngreat job. They don't have the resources they need to demolish as many \nproperties as they would like to help some of these struggling \nneighborhoods. That is why these land banks have come to us and asked: \nCan you help us a little more?\n  After talking to them, after visiting these neighborhoods, we did \ntake action. We authored legislation called the Neighborhood Safety Act \nof 2013, which was a bipartisan effort and a bicameral effort. In the \nHouse, you had Members like Dave Joyce, Marcy Kaptur, and Marcia Fudge \nworking on this. Our legislation called for what is called the Hardest \nHit Fund to be used not just to help people pay down their mortgages \nbut also to help people be able to knock down these abandoned homes. We \npushed it aggressively, and this important change was made \nadministratively. It has provided nearly $66 million in Ohio and around \nthe country to deal with these thousands of abandoned homes in our \nState. Michigan also got funds, as did other States.\n  Now, in many of these States, these Hardest Hit Funds have run out. \nIn other words, there are more abandoned homes than there is money to \nbe able to deal with the problem. Given the success rate we have and \nthe fact that these land banks are doing a great job, we think it is \ntime to provide some more funding. That is what we proposed to do in \nthe Omnibus appropriations bill.\n  I am working with Senator Stabenow, Senator Brown, and others to \ntransfer funds from what is called the Home Affordable Modification \nProgram, which is a program that would be eliminated under our \nproposal, and shift some of those funds into the Hardest Hit Fund for \ndemolition purposes. I have repeatedly discussed this issue with our \nleadership, Senator McConnell and others, our leadership here on the \ncommittees in the Senate and in the House, and I am very hopeful this \ncan be done before year-end. It is the right thing to do. It is an \nopportunity for us to be able to shift some of these funds from a \nprogram that is not working as well into a program we know works and to \nmake progress in some of our struggling neighborhoods in Ohio and \naround the country.\n  I give special thanks to these land banks in Ohio that have taken the \nlead on this issue back home. Particularly, I want to thank the \ntireless efforts of Jim Rokakis, director of the Thriving Communities \nInitiative at the Western Reserve Land Conservancy. He has done \nexcellent work in helping to lead this effort and highlight this \nissue. I hope we can get this done, even in the next week here, to be \nable to help our communities in Ohio and around the country.\n\n  Mr. President, finally, when we talk about keeping our communities \nsafe and the need to help our students, we also have to be sure that we \nare helping our workers. We need to ensure we are protecting jobs in \nour States that are threatened by unfairly traded imports.\n  I am pleased that we will soon be voting to pass the conference \nreport for the Customs bill. It is my understanding that this may come \nup as early as Monday or Tuesday next week. I hope we can pass that \nhere in the Senate and send it to the President for his signature.\n  There are a number of aspects of the Customs bill I support, but one \naspect of it that I think is really important is legislation that is \ncalled the ENFORCE Act, to ensure that we are enforcing our laws \nproperly. This is on the heels of legislation we already passed as part \nof the trade promotion authority earlier this year. That legislation is \ncalled Level the Playing Field Act. Senator Sherrod Brown, my colleague \nfrom Ohio, and I offered this legislation, and it is now part of our \nlaw and ammunition we can use against unfairly traded imports. It is \nalready working because it has already been signed into law, and it is \nhelping to deal with dumping when people are selling below costs or \nwhen they unfairly subsidize imports. It is helping workers in Ohio. It \nis helping our tire workers, paper workers, and steel workers, and we \nare proud of that.\n  The problem is that although the legislation that we have already \npassed, the Level the Playing Field Act, helps with regard to taking on \ncountries that are sending their products here unfairly, sometimes \nthose countries then decide to try to evade the provisions we put in \nplace, the higher tariffs for their dumped products or their higher \ntariffs for their subsidized products. That is what the ENFORCE Act is \nabout. It is about ensuring that although we have this legislation in \nplace, countries and their companies don't go around those regulations \nand still try to get products here into the United States by illegally \nsending it through another country or relabeling the product so that it \ndoesn't fall under the tariffs that might be levied against them.\n  I am really hopeful that we will able to pass this additional \nlegislation. It is incredibly important, as I said, not only for Ohio, \nbut it is also important for the country. Time after time we\n\n[[Page S8592]]\n\nhave seen that once we put these protective orders in place against \nthese unfairly traded imports, these countries continue to illegally \nenter our country through illegal transshipments to other countries or \nthrough relabeling these products.\n  I think we have an opportunity to move forward on something that is \nreally important to help protect workers to ensure that we can closely \nexamine these schemes and stop them.\n  This effort, by the way, is backed by the National Association of \nManufacturers, the American Iron and Steel Institute, and the United \nSteelworkers. They have a common cause because they understand that it \nis so critical that we ensure that our workers get a fair shake.\n  I got an email last week from workers at Pennex Aluminum in Leetonia, \nOH, in the Mahoning Valley. They have 78 workers at their facility, and \nthey won an important case against aluminum extrusions from China. The \nemail said that this relief really helped us.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. These workers said: Senator Portman, ``this relief \nenabled our company to compete once again on a fair and level playing \nfield.'' That is the relief we helped to provide by enforcing our laws \nagainst this product coming in.\n  They then said:\n\n       As a result, we recently completed an investment of $38 \n     million to expand our facility in Leetonia and create \n     significant new jobs. Our great concern is that this trade \n     relief is now at risk due to the efforts by Chinese producers \n     to avoid paying duties by, among other schemes, manipulating \n     the alloy content of their extruded aluminum products and \n     shipping their products under a different name.\n\n  In other words, they were getting around the protections that are in \nplace by simply relabeling the product. Again, this also happens by \ngoing around to other countries. That is why the ENFORCE Act is so \nimportant. Those 78 workers at Pennex Aluminum know it is important, \nand they know this legislation will help them to be able to get a fair \nshake.\n  Finally, I wish to thank the members of the conference committee on \nthe customs bill for putting our BDS language into this legislation. It \nwill help to avoid boycotts and divestment in sanctions of Israel. This \nis a way that some countries around the world are trying to \ndelegitimize Israel. It is something that is important for us to take a \nstand on as a Congress, and we do that in this Customs legislation.\n  So again, I think there is some good legislation we can pass here in \nthe next week or so in the Senate. I hope we will do it.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for giving me the time tonight. We need \nto continue to stand up for our families, our students, and our workers \nand ensure that, indeed, we do give the people we represent a fair \nshake.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/senate-section/article/S8592-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8592-S8593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nHONORING INDIANA SERVICEMEMBERS AND ALL AMERICANS WHO SERVED IN VIETNAM\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the service and \nsacrifice of Indiana servicemembers and their families and of all \nAmericans who served during the Vietnam war, as this year marks the \n40th anniversary of the end of that war.\n  Here is picture from the Indiana Historical Society of some of the \namazing Americans who served during that time. Tens of thousands of \nHoosiers bravely answered the call when they volunteered or were \ndrafted to serve in Vietnam in almost every single capacity you could \nthink of.\n  Bravely, and sadly, 1,243 Hoosier soldiers gave their lives in \nservice to our country in Vietnam. In Vietnam, our vets endured 100-\nplus degree heat, monsoon rains, snake-infested rice paddy fields, \nstaggering conditions, and incredibly dangerous situations.\n  Our servicemembers would rather have been at home in Terre Haute, \nRichmond, Indy, Evansville or Fort Wayne, but they served because they \nloved our country and they answered when our Nation called them, and \ntheir answer was: Count on me.\n  At the end of the war, many of our Vietnam vets didn't receive the \nwelcome home or the recognition they deserved. Not all received huge \nhugs when they hit the tarmac back in America, but our Vietnam vets are \nheroes just like those who stormed the beaches in Normandy, trudged \nthrough frozen rivers in Korea, and went through the deserts of Iraq \nand the mountains of Afghanistan. Our Vietnam vets deserve to be held--\nand are held--in the same high regard as those who fought in World War \nI, World War II, Korea, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Our Vietnam vets are \npart of the seamless fabric that has saved our country and made it such \na blessed place.\n  Today, our Vietnam vets get amazing receptions everywhere they go. In \nmy home State of Indiana, a town in northern Indiana, LaPorte, IN, in \nLaPorte County, has their big parade every year on July 4. The streets \nare filled--5, 6, 7, 8 people deep for 2\\1/2\\ miles long--and every \nyear the parade is led off by the Vietnam veterans of LaPorte County, \nand it happens all over our State. When the parade starts off, everyone \ngets out of their chairs and stands up--even those who have challenges \nand have difficulties--to applaud our men and women who were in \nVietnam, and for 2\\1/2\\ miles they get an amazing standing applause the \nentire way. These vets are our parents, our brothers and sisters, our \naunts and uncles, our grandparents, friends, neighbors, and the folks \nwho are sitting next to us in church on Sunday.\n  Our Vietnam veterans support and lead our communities as public \nservants, teachers, lawyers, nurses, business owners, factory workers, \nand bankers. Just about anything you can imagine--that is what our \nVietnam vets are doing to make our country a greater place. They are a \ngeneration of veterans who have taught us about love of country and \nservice, and they deserve to be honored for their selflessness and \nsacrifice.\n  Today, Indiana is home to nearly 150,000 Vietnam war veterans. We \nhave a responsibility to provide them with the benefits and support \nthey have earned and to show them the same commitment they demonstrated \nwhile they fought to protect us and our freedoms more than 4 decades \nago.\n  We must ensure our veterans have access to timely and quality care at \nlocal VAs across our State and country, and that this care is delivered \nin a way that meets their needs. Expanding access to health care for \nour Hoosier vets has been and will continue to be a constant top \npriority of mine.\n  We recently broke ground in St. Joseph County, IN, on the new St. \nJoseph County Health Care Center. It will mean that many of our local \nvets in northern Indiana will be just a short ride away from the health \nservices they have worked so hard to earn and receive.\n  We must continue to expand options for care, for example, through the \nVeterans Choice Program, which is bipartisan legislation that is now \nlaw. Provisions from our bipartisan servicemember and veteran mental \nhealth care package were signed into law recently as part of the \nnational defense bill.\n  We are working every day to try to make sure our veterans have the \nchance to receive good physical health care and good mental health care \nand that we stand next to them and with them every step of the way. Our \nbipartisan Community Provider Readiness Recognition Act was included, \nand it helps connect Hoosier servicemembers and vets with local \nproviders who can deal with the unique challenges that folks who were \nin our military face.\n  The demand for care among our vets has never been greater and our \nobligation to them has never been greater. In recognition of their \nservice and sacrifice, we must deliver on our promise to care for all \nveterans long after their last day in uniform.\n  I have another picture here from the Indiana Historical Society. This \nis another group of our young soldiers. When they went off, as I said \nearlier, they didn't complain and didn't make excuses, and when our \nNation called, as I said before, they said: Count on me.\n  We must keep the promises we made to our vets. We must keep those \npromises for their entire lives. Our Vietnam vets and their families \nmade incredible sacrifices. We can do a better job of\n\n[[Page S8593]]\n\ngiving them the recognition and support they deserve. We must do so \nthrough words and action. In our everyday daily lives let us remember \nthose who have sacrificed so much to defend our Nation and our freedom. \nLet us preserve their legacy and follow their example of service to \nothers.\n  When you see someone wearing a ball cap that says Vietnam vet, World \nWar II vet, Korean vet, Iraq or Afghanistan vet, say thanks. My guess \nis they will say: Thank you; I was just doing my job. But they were \ndoing so much more than just their job. They were protecting our Nation \nand making sure that our children and our children's children had a \nchance to grow up in this most blessed of all places.\n  God bless every American and Hoosier veteran who served in Vietnam. \nGod bless their families. God bless Indiana, and God bless America.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Indiana for his \ngreat remarks. I thank him for making them today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/senate-section/article/S8593-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8593-S8594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PUERTO RICO\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor tonight to discuss \nPuerto Rico, a territory of the United States since 1898. Millions of \nresidents have been citizens since 1917, nearly 100 years. This \ncommunity of 3.5 million people is facing economic, fiscal, and \nliquidity problems. What are we doing about it here in Congress? We are \nnot doing anything. That needs to change, and it needs to change now.\n  We spent 10 years watching Puerto Rico suffer through a recession. We \nspent months here in Congress discussing what to do. There have been a \nlot of ideas--some popular, some controversial. I can say that, as the \nranking member on the Energy Committee, I have heard many ideas, but \nnow is the time to act.\n  We need to allow Puerto Rico to restructure. That is, we need to give \nthem the same opportunities that we gave to average American citizens \nand municipalities to restructure their debt--the same that we gave to \nWall Street when they were in a financial crisis, the same brink that \nwe were almost on when we had our own economic problems. Yet there are \nsome here in the halls of Congress who would rather listen to hedge \nfunds and make sure they are prioritized in a debt restructuring than \nactually putting in place debt restructuring.\n  I propose a two-part, no-cost approach that will be most effective \nand least controversial to help us out of this situation.\n  The Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which has jurisdiction \nover territories, has heard from experts from the Department of \nTreasury and other government officials about how dire this situation \nis now. Just yesterday, a group of six CEOs sent a letter to \ncongressional leaders urging swift legislative action on the Puerto \nRico situation.\n  I can tell my colleagues the whole issue of what to do about Puerto \nRico in the long term has many divergent views, but all those divergent \nviews in Puerto Rico are singing the same tune right now: Restructure \nbefore January 1 or they will face serious issues of default. Why do we \ncare? We care because the U.S. Government will have an impact of \nbetween $1 billion and $2 billion of more service demands if we do not \nallow them to restructure.\n  This year, the government and electric utilities failed to make their \npayments. Government workers are being cut to three days a week. \nPatients are now waiting months for medical care. Hospitals are going \nbankrupt. And the health care industry is threatened by a complete \ncollapse. Forty-five percent of the population is living in poverty--\nincluding 58 percent of them who are children--and the unemployment \nrate is stuck at 12.2 percent, more than double the highest State's \nunemployment rate.\n  So what does it cost us to act here in the United States? It costs \nthe U.S. taxpayers zero. It costs us zero because if we think about it, \nthis is about debt restructuring. This about setting up a process which \nthey are denied just because Puerto Rico is a territory; they cannot \nget the relief of restructuring. They tried. They tried to pass their \nown bankruptcy law. They tried, and then basically were told that it \ndidn't meet a Federal standard.\n  They are not like a municipality that has this authority. They are a \nterritory. They are our territory. If we want them to restructure \nsuccessfully and keep more debt from coming to the shores of the United \nStates because of--I would say that we have had a huge increase in \npopulation. So the cost of inaction is this acceleration of the Puerto \nRico population coming to the United States. In 2014, we see that the \nnumber jumped to almost 70,000 people in one year. The net migration \nhas been more than 500 percent in the last 10 years.\n  If we do nothing in the next week and don't act on this problem, more \nmigration of Puerto Ricans is going to come to the United States. When \nthey come, what will happen? They will be demanding more services, such \nas Head Start, SNAP, unemployment insurance, and Pell Grants. So \ndefault equals more Federal spending.\n  The notion that my colleagues think that somehow this inaction is the \nway out of this equation--they are just adding more responsibility to \nthe U.S. taxpayer. Why? Is it because they want to protect hedge funds \nin a bankruptcy process? Do they want to decide in the Halls of the \nU.S. Congress who gets in line first and who gets paid?\n  I will remind my colleagues, particularly since the Presiding Officer \nknows the Deepwater Horizon issue very well, we did not make decisions \nhere in the U.S. Congress--in the Senate and in the House of \nRepresentatives--as to who would get paid in the Deepwater accident \nimplosion. We appointed a receiver. They made the tough decisions. When \nit came to Detroit's bankruptcy, we did not make the decision.\n  I guarantee my colleagues that of 100 Members of the U.S. Senate, \nthere are probably 100 opinions in both of those cases as to how we \nthought each of those payments or restructurings should be done. But we \nare not the experts, and just because we have an opinion about what we \nwould like to see Puerto Rico do doesn't mean we should be writing that \ninto legislation and prejudging what should be an official, legal \nprocess of restructuring debt that we need to give Puerto Rico the \nauthority to have.\n  This is what newspapers across the United States are saying, \nincluding the Los Angeles Times, the Miami Herald, the Boston Globe, \nthe New York Times, and others: Give Puerto Rico the ability to \nrestructure their debt.\n  So why are people here failing to take up this mantle? People have \nbeen arguing for months about different ideas. Some of our colleagues \nwant to increase the Medicaid reimbursement rate. Some of our \ncolleagues want to have an EITC increase. Some of our colleagues want \nPuerto Rico to do away with their pensions before they go into a \nbankruptcy structure. Those are all political opinions by individuals \nthat one could say are worth debate.\n  Now we are at the point of default. Just as we need to make decisions \nbefore January 1, our colleagues are now trying to say that we can \ncontinue to discuss this issue. We don't have time to continue to \ndiscuss this issue. We have next week, and, as a member of the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee that oversees territories, I feel it is \nour responsibility to propose a policy and get it in place so that we \ncan find some resolution of this issue.\n  I think this two-part fix about making sure there is the ability to \nrestructure and a council to oversee it in coordination with Treasury \nis the best we can do at this point in time to save the U.S. Government \nfrom further costs and to give relief to Puerto Rico.\n  The notion that people here in the U.S. House of Representatives or \nthe U.S. Senate are trying to protect hedge funds so that they can \nmaximize their return is despicable. It is despicable. The notion that \nsomebody is trying to protect these fundamental questions that need to \nbe decided in a formal process of bankruptcy or reform, as we are \ncalling it within the territory, is the fair and even process that \nshould take place without prejudice.\n  We are going to, as a body, have a very robust discussion, I \nguarantee my colleagues, for years and years and years to come about \nwhat the United States is going to do about the territory of Puerto \nRico. Let's at least give\n\n[[Page S8594]]\n\nourselves the luxury of having that discussion when the territory is \nnot in default. Let's come together and pass some legislation for them \nto restructure their debt. Let a professional organization take the \npolitics out of this and make the best financial decisions that can be \nmade now to save the U.S. taxpayer from further expense.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/senate-section/article/S8594-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 BEING HONEST WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\n\n  Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, earlier today it was reported that the \nPresident's Deputy National Security Adviser was asked about my call \nthat the President and the administration speak clearly about the \nnature of the enemy we face--about my call that we be honest with the \nAmerican people and with ourselves about the fact that we are at war \nwith militant Islam, we are at war with jihadi Islam, and we are at war \nwith violent Islam.\n  In response, the White House was quoted in the World-Herald this \nmorning as saying this:\n\n       Our strong belief is to not treat these ISIL terrorists as \n     leaders of some religious movement. Even if you have a \n     derogatory adjective attached to it--radical Islam or Islamic \n     extremism--essentially you are saying they are the leaders of \n     a religious movement. And that is what they want. They want \n     to be seen not as terrorists and killers and thugs, as the \n     president said, but as leaders who speak on behalf of \n     religion. And that is why we have not identified them as the \n     enemy in this effort.\n\n  This is lunacy. First, while the White House is insisting that no one \nuse the word ``Islamic'' or note any connection between the war that we \nare facing and some subset of Islam--even as the White House insists \nthat no one use the word, their own preferred adjective, ``ISIL'' or \n``ISIS,'' begins with an ``I.'' Every fourth grader in America can \ndeduce without any assistance from Vanna White what the rest of the \nword that begins with an ``I'' is. Yet the White House insists that no \none should use the word.\n  They are dealing with a world they wish were so, as opposed to the \nworld with which we are called to struggle. The world in which we live \nis a world where we are going to be facing a decades-long battle with \nmilitant Islam, with jihadi Islam, with violent Islam. We are obviously \nnot at war with all Muslims, but we are at war with those who believe \nthey would kill in the name of religion, and the White House insists \nthat we muzzle ourselves and not tell the truth.\n  Second, the White House's logic for why we shouldn't tell the truth \nto the American people or to ourselves is because the leaders of ISIL \nsupposedly want to be identified with a religious movement. The leaders \nof the ISIL movement and the broader jihadi movement that is trying to \nkill Americans and all those who believe in freedom and in open \nsociety--the leaders of this movement also want to be martyred. Isn't \nthe President's position that we should not kill them because they \ndesire to be martyred? This is lunacy.\n  We have to speak the truth not because it alone will somehow diminish \nISIS or ISIL, but because speaking the truth is actually the only way \nwe can begin to develop policies that will not lead to more failed \nStates in the Middle East, which are producing the terror training \ncamps of next year.\n  Despite the fact that we are actually and obviously at war with \nmilitant Islam, there is a terrible leadership vacuum in this country. \nThe American people know this, and, frankly, those of us who are \ngetting our classified briefings and having to engage the leadership of \nour national security and intelligence communities know this leadership \nvacuum exists. Those who are trying to keep Americans safe--there are \nmany wonderful, freedom-loving civil servants fighting to protect our \nkids, and they know and experience this vacuum of leadership every day.\n  This vacuum is felt outside the beltway and everywhere in America, as \nis obvious in many of our towns. But even more dishearteningly and more \ndangerously, it is increasingly obvious to the professionals working in \nour intelligence community and in our national security structure that \nthis vacuum is harming our national security and our intelligence \ncommunity as they try to fight for our freedom.\n  Here is why this matters. This vacuum prevents them from doing their \njobs. They have no strategy to deploy, they have no rational policy to \nimplement, and they have been asked to defeat an enemy that their \nCommander in Chief refuses to name. This is lunacy, it is absurd, and \nit is unacceptable.\n  Mr. President: Please lead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I appreciate the words of the Senator from \nNebraska, Mr. Sasse, with whom I enjoy serving on the banking \ncommittee, and I appreciate his good work. I take a bit of issue with \nhis comments. I know there are more than two options. But I hear the \ngreatest criticisms of the President from those same people, urging--\nnot necessarily Senator Sasse in this case, but many of the leaders in \nthis body on the Republican side who were some of the strongest \nadvocates for the war in Iraq. Some of those same people are saying, \nback into the Middle East, sending combat troops.\n  Going back to war is something that the American people--we all come \nto the floor claiming to speak for the American people, perhaps, but we \nknow that is not good policy and that is not what most people in this \ncountry want to do. But I appreciate the comments of the Senator.\n  Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question? Do \nyou believe there is any connection between our enemy and Islam?\n  Mr. BROWN. Excuse me?\n  Mr. SASSE. Do you believe there is any connection between our enemy \nand Islam?\n  Mr. BROWN. I am not here to debate this. I don't know exactly what \nthat means: a connection between the enemy and Islam. I know that \nsemantics matter, and I know the criticism of the President in this \nbody is sort of front and center no matter what he does.\n  When he gave what I thought was a coherent speech, often with \nrestraint, where we have taken the--I think we have taken the fight to \nISIL in this country. I think we have done it domestically. I think the \nPresident wants to do it internationally, and this body doesn't seem to \nhave the courage to debate whether or not we actually look at an \nauthorization resolution--an authorization for use of force. The \nPresident is still forced to rely on a resolution that President Bush \npushed through that led to disastrous policies in Iraq. I don't think \nthat was right.\n\n  But I apologize. I want to speak on something else, Mr. President, \nand that is why I came to the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/senate-section/article/S8594-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8594-S8595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUPPORING OUR VETERANS\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago most of us went home to our \nfamilies to celebrate and give thanks for the many blessings we have in \nthis country. We all look forward to spending more time with family \nduring this holiday season, but for far too many Americans the holidays \nare just another time when they struggle to put food on the table or \neven to have a roof over their heads. This is sadly particularly true \nof our Nation's veterans.\n  Again, to go back 15 years, we take people into war in this country--\nsometimes for very good reason. Our sending troops to Afghanistan was \nexactly the right policy back in 2002 and 2003. Going into the war in \nIraq was something very different.\n  If we in this body are going to send people into war, it is time we \nthink about the costs of war, not come to the Senate floor and make \nspeeches about how tough we are as Senators, when most Senators don't \nhave children--some do, but most don't have children who go off to war. \nWe are willing to send people into combat, and then we too often turn \nour backs on those soldiers once they come home and become our Nation's \nveterans.\n  The suicide rate is too high among veterans, many of them suffering \nfrom PTSD or traumatic brain injury or a host of other illnesses or \nafflictions. The suicide rate is too high, the unemployment rate for \nveterans is too high, and the drug addiction rate is too high. Yet, how \noften our colleagues come and talk about, let's send combat troops, \nlet's go to war. How rarely they talk\n\n[[Page S8595]]\n\nabout what we do with these men and women when they come home, whose \nlives have been changed dramatically. These are the costs of war, and \nthey don't get nearly the attention on the Senate floor, in the media, \nor among policymakers as do the actually going to war and sending our \ntroops.\n  It is shameful that veterans have these rates of unemployment, \naddiction, suicide, and homelessness. We have made progress on \nhomelessness through a combination of increased Federal investments and \nimproved services. Over the past 5 years, homelessness among veterans \nhas declined 36 percent, but too many remain on the streets.\n  Veterans comprise 12 percent of the Nation's adult homeless \npopulation. According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, some 48,000 veterans were homeless--including 1,200 in my \nState of Ohio--on a given night in January when a census, if you will, \nwas taken about homelessness. That is 48,000 too many. It is a disgrace \nthat they serve our country with honor, and thousands are left without \na roof over their head. Think about that. We send them off to war. They \nare sometimes damaged by their time in combat or their time in the \nmilitary, and we don't care enough to find them places to live and find \nthem drug treatment and find them jobs and give the kind of help to \nthem that they gave to our country.\n  I met the veterans the organizations serve--organizations such as the \nVFW, American Legion, these groups and counties called veteran service \norganizations. My State is blessed to have one in each of our 88 \ncounties. I hear about their stories of perseverance. They are \ninspiring.\n  I visited the Joseph House in Cincinnati, where Nathan Pelletier and \nhis team of dedicated staff and volunteers provided addiction treatment \nand transitional housing to veterans. We heard from Britton Carter, who \nwas formerly homeless. He completed the treatment program at Joseph \nHouse. He now works as a case manager helping other struggling \nveterans. He spoke about the trials he has overcome. He said:\n\n       As a small youth I fell in love with playing army men. My \n     mom would buy me little army men, and I dreamed of one day \n     being a soldier.\n       God had given me the gift of being a pretty good basketball \n     player and as such I became the first freshman to play and \n     start on any varsity team. With success came fans and \n     countless people, many of whom had an agenda that didn't \n     necessarily have my best interest at stake.\n       From the early years of high school I found myself star \n     struck, and I would end up in the company of those who used \n     drugs--first pot and wine, later I was introduced to heroin \n     and cocaine.\n       With the grace of God, I was given the opportunity to \n     attend college at New Mexico Military Institution in Roswell, \n     NM. There were other offers from schools, but I was attracted \n     to the opportunity of being able to play army man once again.\n       I was caught with drugs and kicked out of school, and as a \n     result I lost the chance to become an officer in the United \n     States military. I went to another college--only to have my \n     drug addiction lead me to poor choices that brought my career \n     closer and closer to an end, where the only thing I felt I \n     had to hold onto would be a career in the Army.\n       I enlisted, and discovered that being away from home . . . \n     left me face-to-face with those old demons, and once again I \n     was being discharged. . . . It wasn't long after my return . \n     . . that I found myself in and out of trouble. Having no \n     insurance to pay for the treatment I truly needed to address \n     my addiction, and nearly a life sentence on the installment \n     plan and years of struggle. . . .\n\n  He goes on.\n\n       [The Joseph House] was the one place that believed in never \n     leaving any soldier behind--the Joseph House.\n       It was while at the Joseph House that I had the opportunity \n     to get the treatment I so badly needed. . . . Today, thanks \n     to God and his mercy. . . .\n\n  He goes on to talk about some of the things he has done. He has \nwritten a play. He has produced a play. He has done wonderful things, \nespecially for his fellow veterans. His story should serve as a \nreminder to all of us that we should not leave the men and women who \nserve this country.\n  There are so many stories like his. In October I was in Dayton, where \nI met with Robert White at the Homefull organization--Homefull as \nopposed to the homeless. He served 4 years in the Army Reserves and 1 \nyear on Active Duty. He was honorably discharged in 1980 and spent \nyears working, facing challenges that he said left him ``lower than \nlow.'' He said, ``As soon as I left for basic training, I was \nhomeless.'' He talked about his work, his time in shelters. He said the \nresult was always the same. He said, ``I entered homeless, and no \nmatter how good I did, I still left homeless.''\n  Then, on the July Fourth weekend 7 years ago, he entered Homefull's \nVA per diem transitional supportive housing program. He became a model \nguest at Homefull. He got a job in Trotwood, a community near Dayton. \nHe still has the same job. Homefull connected Mr. White with its \npartner organization, which helped him achieve home ownership. Today he \nhas gone from homeless veteran to owner of his own home. That is \nbecause of his community in Dayton, because of this organization \nHomefull, and it is because of the partnership with the Veterans' \nAdministration, whose funding is always under jeopardy because of many \nMembers of the Senate and House who simply don't put the same effort \ninto helping veterans as they do into funding the military.\n  Last month I was in Cleveland. I visited the Supportive Housing Home \nfor Veterans. I visited the Trumbull Metropolitan Housing Authority in \nYoungstown. These organizations are providing work that is so \nimportant. We owe them our support.\n  Even one veteran on the street means Congress isn't doing enough to \ntackle this problem. That is why I joined my colleagues in introducing \nthe Veteran Housing Stability Act of 2015, which would make meaningful \nimprovements to services for homeless veterans and give more veterans \naccess to housing opportunities.\n  President Kennedy, in his 1963 Thanksgiving proclamation--I believe \nthe week before he died--said, ``As we express our gratitude, we must \nnever forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but \nto live by them.''\n  Sure, we come to this floor. We send people off to battle. Surely we \nneed to do that sometimes. Sure, we come to the floor and talk about \nveterans, but so often we don't live up to the obligations to help \nthese veterans deal with their homelessness, to help veterans deal with \nsuicide, with the threat of suicide, the likelihood of suicide for some \nof them, help our veterans deal with drug addiction, help our veterans \ndeal with mental health issues. Often these are costs of war that we \nsimply don't discuss on the Senate floor. It is so important that we \ndo. I hope my colleagues will join me in ensuring every veteran has an \nopportunity to succeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/senate-section/article/S8595-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MEGHAN DUBYAK\n\n  Mr. BROWN.

Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a Kentucky \npolice officer who was tragically lost in the line of duty. Officer \nDaniel Ellis of the Richmond Police Department was shot while searching \nan apartment for a robbery suspect on November 4, 2015, and died from \nhis wounds 2 days later. He was 33 years old.\n  ``Our lives will never be the same again, the lives of his fellow \nofficers and of his family will never be the same,'' Richmond Police \nChief Larry Brock said during Officer Ellis's funeral. ``He turned out \nto be a great police officer. He was one of those guys that just got it \nand got it early.''\n  Officer Ellis started at the department on August 11, 2008. He was \nknown as a kindhearted man who treated others with dignity and respect. \nOne day\n\n[[Page S8596]]\n\nwhile on duty, he saw a man in business clothes carrying a tent and \nwalking down the street. When asked, the man told Officer Ellis that he \nhad a job interview the next morning and had nowhere to spend the \nnight. Officer Ellis paid to get him a room.\n  Daniel graduated from Eastern Kentucky University, where his funeral \nservice was held. Most of the school coliseum's 7,000 seats were full \nfor the service. Hundreds of fellow police officers from across \nKentucky and other States poured into Richmond to pay their respects.\n  Members of Officer Ellis's family who are suffering from this loss \ninclude his wife, Katie; his son, Luke, who is only 4 years old; his \nparents, Kelly and Nancy West Ellis; two brothers; a sister; and his \npaternal grandmother.\n  I know my colleagues in the United States Senate join me in wishing \nthe Ellis family our utmost condolences after their horrible loss. We \nare humbled and we are grateful for Officer Daniel Ellis's service and \nhis enormous sacrifice in the line of duty. I hold the deepest \nadmiration and respect for every brave police officer across the \nBluegrass State, all of whom put their lives in danger to protect us. \nKentucky is thankful these men and women have made a sacred pledge to \nprotect and defend.\n  Local news Web site WLKY.com published a moving article about Officer \nEllis and the outpouring of grief in the Richmond community after his \ndeath. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From WLKY.com, Nov. 12, 2015]\n\n  Thousands Say Goodbye to Slain Richmond Officer Daniel Ellis--Chief \n                 Says ``Grief Is Nearly Inconsolable''\n\n                 (By Carolyn Callahan and Emily Maher)\n\n       Richmond, Ky.--He lost his life doing the job he loved.\n       Thousands of people were in Richmond on Wednesday to say \n     goodbye to Officer Daniel Ellis.\n       The 33-year-old was shot a week ago during a robbery \n     investigation.\n       He died two days later.\n       The funeral service was held at Alumni Coliseum at Eastern \n     Kentucky University.\n       Both Daniel and his wife, Katie, graduated from the school.\n       For the first time since the deadly shooting, Richmond's \n     police chief spoke publicly.\n       ``We have lost our Daniel,'' Chief Larry Brock said. ``Our \n     collective grief is nearly inconsolable.''\n       Ellis started with the Richmond Police Department in 2008.\n       While Brock hoped Ellis would finish his career with the \n     department, he never imagined it would end the way it did.\n       ``Today we say goodbye to Officer Daniel Ellis. Our Daniel. \n     But we will never forget him, his service, or his \n     sacrifice,'' Brock said.\n       Ellis leaves behind a wife and young son.\n       ``Katie, I pledge to you and Luke that you will remain a \n     part of our family. That we will always be there for you, and \n     that you will never walk alone,'' Brock said.\n       The chief said it rained after Ellis died.\n       ``It was as if the angels themselves were crying at the \n     loss of this special young man,'' Brock said.\n       Then hours later, a rainbow appeared over the Richmond \n     Police Department. The chief takes that as a sign that Ellis \n     is still with them.\n       ``Rest easy, Daniel. You have left us too early,'' he said.\n       Shortly before he was killed, Ellis found out he was being \n     promoted to detective.\n       It's a job at which the chief said he would have excelled.\n       ``From the kindergarten classrooms that he visited, to the \n     courtrooms where his testimony could be counted on to be \n     straightforward and truthful, he will be greatly missed,'' \n     East End Church of Christ minister Phillip Shumake said.\n       Hundreds lined downtown Richmond streets as Ellis received \n     a hero's escort to his final resting place.\n       Residents in Richmond said they wanted to show their thanks \n     to the man who gave his life protecting theirs.\n       Black and blue pinwheels and white ribbons with Ellis's \n     badge number line the Eastern Bypass.\n       Hundreds of officers drove down the street, escorting Ellis \n     to his final resting place, while the community watched and \n     supported an officer who was loved.\n       ``Even though we wear a different badge, he is my \n     brother,'' Shane Allen with Richmond Rescue said.\n       ``You're grieving for someone that's not a family member, \n     but he feels like a family member,'' community member Shelley \n     Johnson said.\n       ``We were actually on shift the day it happened and we were \n     all trying to find out who it was. He is family,'' Allen \n     said.\n       A kind of family that is brought closer together in times \n     of loss.\n       ``And I was trying to explain to the kids, `Mommy, why do \n     you cry?' And it's like something unexplainable and maybe \n     they can understand that,'' Johnson said.\n       The community stood together to pay their final respects \n     holding signs calling Ellis a hero.\n       ``It's unbelievable. It's really touching to see the \n     support--that even though it's something tragic that has \n     brought this community together so tightly, to see the \n     support for somebody they might not even know. And to see \n     them come out on a day and support him as he goes by to lay \n     at rest,'' Allen said.\n       Hundreds of officers from across the state escorted Ellis \n     on a 100-mile journey to his final resting place.\n       ``We just wanted to show what his service has meant to \n     us,'' community member Sarah Roof said.\n       As he passed by, blue balloons were released into the air \n     as a final tribute to a man the community said will never be \n     forgotten.\n       ``He loved his job. He helped the community and that was \n     his job. And that's what he wanted to do,'' Allen said.\n       Ellis will be laid to rest in Adair County.\n       The family has asked for donations to be made to the \n     Kentucky Law Enforcement Memorial Foundation or Supporting \n     Heroes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/senate-section/article/S8596-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8596-S8597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EVERY STUDENT SUCCEEDS ACT\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the Every Student \nSucceeds Act that the President signed into law today.\n  I want to first congratulate my colleagues Senator Patty Murray and \nSenator Lamar Alexander, who have effectively been able to guide this \nbill through the Senate. It has been an honor to watch and participate \nin this process--a process that has served as a great example of the \nway the Senate is supposed to work.\n  When the original Senate version of the Every Child Achieves Act came \nto the floor for a vote on July 22, 2015, I could not support it \nbecause, while it made necessary changes to the No Child Left Behind \nlaw, I could not in good conscience support a bill that fell short of \ninvesting in the potential and promise of all of our children, \nespecially New Jersey's most vulnerable students. I stood resolute in \nthe belief that if Congress was truly going to invest in our children \nand grandchildren's future, it was vital that any legislation passed \nprovide support, access, and opportunity to equip the next generation \nto succeed, regardless of their socioeconomic status.\n  These needs were particularly poignant given the historic context of \nthe original Elementary and Secondary Education Act as a civil rights \nbill. Created the same year as the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and just \n11 years after the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision, \nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson's original piece of legislation intended to \naddress the gaping gulf in the quality of education received by low-\nincome students in an intensely segregated country. Indeed, this piece \nof legislation was a vital tool in President Johnson's arsenal on the \nWar on Poverty. It is undeniable that education is a cornerstone of the \nAmerican Dream to achieve success and financial security. We do our \nNation and our children a disservice if we do not do everything in our \npower to ensure that President Johnson's arsenal is not only \nmaintained, but honed and replenished with robust provisions to fight \nan evolving battle for educational equity in our schools.\n  Although I did not vote for the original Senate version of ESEA that \npassed the Senate in July, I am glad to see a conference report, the \nEvery Student Succeeds Act, ESSA, that takes elements from both the \nHouse and Senate bill and ultimately is a better bill for all children, \nteachers, and parents in our country.\n  Chief among provisions that I believed were problematic was the lack \nof accountability measures to ensure America's most vulnerable students \nhave access to a quality education. With regards to accountability, it \nwas critical not to be overly prescriptive while still acknowledging an \nintense need to identify and ask schools and districts to figure out \nspecific plans to turn things around in the lowest performing schools \nand high schools who fail to graduate one-third of their students. It \nis also critical to identify where there are groups of students who are \nconsistently performing worse than their peers. I do not believe these \nchanges should come from Washington. Local teachers, principals, and \nparents are best equipped to know how best to\n\n[[Page S8597]]\n\nturn around a failing school, and this bill gives them the arsenal to \ndo so. I believe the new accountability provisions empower local \nleaders, with State and Federal guidance, to pursue the improvement \nstrategies best suited to their local needs.\n  These accountability measures are vital if we are to guarantee that \nthe ideals our students pledge allegiance to every day, justice and \nliberty for all, are manifest in the education we provide for our \nyoungest Americans.\n  With this goal in mind, I am also pleased that ESSA includes my \namendment to support homeless and foster youth, by ensuring educators \nand the public are aware of how foster and homeless children and youth \nare performing on critical elements compared to their peers by adding \nreporting for these groups on graduation rates to the State and school \ndistrict report cards.\n  The role of teachers is also prioritized in ESSA, and I was \nespecially proud to see the amendment I authored that helps support \nteachers by asking school districts to identify opportunities to make \nworking conditions better and more sustainable.\n  With these improvements made and the spirit of the bill as an \nimportant piece of civil rights legislation maintained, I \nwholeheartedly support the reconciled version that has passed the House \nand Senate and that was signed by the President today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/senate-section/article/S8597-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO REAR ADMIRAL CHRISTOPHER J. PAUL\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the service of \nRADM Christopher J. Paul, Deputy Commander, Naval Surface Force, U.S. \nPacific Fleet, who is retiring from the United States Navy after more \nthan 38 years of faithful service to our Nation.\n  Having enlisted in the Navy in 1977, Rear Admiral Paul went on to \nattend the U.S. Naval Academy Preparatory School and U.S. Naval \nAcademy, where he distinguished himself as a valued leader of the \nvarsity cross country, indoor, and outdoor Track teams under famed \ncoach Al Cantello and a 10-time letterman. After graduating from the \nNaval Academy in 1982 with a Bachelor of Science degree in physical \nscience, RADM Paul served on USS KIDD, DDG 993, a destroyer homeported \nin Norfolk, VA, until 1987 and qualified as a surface warfare officer \nduring deployments to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans; the \nMediterranean, Black, North, Baltic, Red, and Caribbean Seas; and the \nArabian Gulf.\n  Rear Admiral Paul's Pentagon staff assignments included service on \nthe Joint Staff as an action officer in the Operations Directorate J-3 \nand U.S. Senate liaison officer and assistant surface warfare program \nofficer in the Secretary of the Navy's Office of legislative affairs \nfrom 1987 to 1991. During that assignment, Rear Admiral Paul had the \nopportunity to work on behalf of Members of Congress on the Senate \nArmed Services Committee and was subsequently assigned to serve in my \noffice to help write a $600 million package of veterans benefits for \nservicemembers and veterans of Operation Desert Storm. While working on \nthat legislative matter, I had the privilege of promoting then \nLieutenant Paul to the grade of lieutenant commander, when he \ntransitioned to the Navy Reserve, which allowed him to continue to \nserve on my staff in Washington, DC, while also serving at the \nPentagon's Navy Command Center as assistant operations department head.\n  Rear Admiral Paul went on to faithfully serve on my Senate \nlegislative staff for a total of 16 years, followed by 6 years as a \nprofessional staff member on the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed \nServices, while simultaneously serving in numerous Navy positions of \nincreasing responsibility over the course of more than 22 years. Those \nassignments included serving on the Chief of Naval Operations staff as \nexecutive officer of Reserve Component Augment Units to the director of \nSurface Warfare OPNAV N86 and the director of Expeditionary Warfare \nOPNAV N85 between 1997 and 1999.\n  Rear Admiral Paul's Navy Reserve unit command assignments included \nCVNE-0109, from 1999 to 2001, supporting AIRLANT aircraft carriers, \nduring which he was recognized with the Commander Naval Air Force \nReserve Robert I. Barto Award; Naval Surface Warfare Center Indian \nHead, from 2001 to 2003; and, rapid response to full unit-mobilization \nin support of Operation Noble Eagle, which was recognized by the \nSecretary of the Navy with the Meritorious Unit Commendation. His \ncommand assignments also included Navy Region, Mid-Atlantic, from 2003 \nto 2005, where he was mobilized in support of Joint Task Force Katrina \nas chief of staff, Joint Force Maritime Component Commander; U.S. \nForces, Japan from 2005 to 2007, where the unit received the Joint \nMeritorious Unit Award for its contingency and exercise support that \ngreatly enhanced the U.S.-Japan Security Alliance; and deputy regional \ncommander to Commandant, Naval District Washington, from 2007 to 2008, \nsupporting the Navy Total Force in the national capital area.\n  During Rear Admiral Paul's flag officer assignments, he led several \ntype commands responsible for manning, training, and equipping naval \nwarships and expeditionary forces. In his first flag assignment, Rear \nAdmiral Paul served as deputy commander, Navy Expeditionary Combat \nCommand from 2008 to 2011, receiving the Navy Unit Commendation for its \noutstanding success in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi \nFreedom; deputy commander, Naval Surface Forces Atlantic from 2011 to \n2012; and deputy commander, Naval Surface Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet \nfrom 2012 to 2015, where he culminated his Navy career. During his flag \nofficer positions, Rear Admiral Paul distinguished himself in the \nperformance of his duties while demonstrating a uniquely comprehensive \nknowledge of manpower, personnel, training, enlisted personnel \ndistribution, and surface warfare officer career management issues. His \neffective leadership and initiatives helped transform how surface \nforces are trained and prepared to fight in naval warships during a \nvital period of change in the surface warfare community.\n  As a loyal and dedicated member of my staff for over 22 years, Rear \nAdmiral Paul worked tirelessly as a valued legislative aide to me in my \nU.S. Senate office and on the professional staff of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. In that capacity, Rear Admiral Paul played an \nimportant role in policy matters affecting our Nation and the U.S. \nmilitary, helping to advance countless legislative initiatives enacted \ninto law that will have a lasting impact on U.S. policy, including the \nDetainee Treatment Act of 2005, which prohibits the inhumane treatment \nof prisoners of the United States; legislation that reauthorized the \nFAA in 1996, which is still recognized as the largest aviation reform \nlaw since the deregulation act of 1977; laws that help improve the \nlives of our servicemembers, veterans, and military families; and \nnumerous provisions that have improved the ability of the military to \nprocure needed combat capability, enhanced the readiness of ships, \nsubmarines, and aircraft, and maintained global superiority--all while \nensuring that the Department of Defense acts as a responsible steward \nof diminishing defense dollars.\n  As a determined Reserve Component surface warfare leader and \ndedicated public servant, it is fitting that we honor Rear Admiral \nPaul's service during the centennial of the U.S. Navy Reserve. Rear \nAdmiral Paul embodies the moral character and dedication of our \nNation's citizen-sailors who bring unique skill sets through their \nmilitary and civilian training and serve our country honorably by the \ncore values of the United States of America. I heartily thank Rear \nAdmiral Paul; his wife, Shannon; daughter, Catherine; and son, \nChristopher, for their honorable service to our Nation and the U.S. \nNavy; and wish Rear Admiral Paul fair winds and following seas as he \nconcludes a career in the U.S. Navy exemplary in honor and distinction.\n  Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/senate-section/article/S8597-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8597-S8598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO JIM SMITH\n\n Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, today I wish to honor a great South \nDakotan on his notable accomplishments and his career, starting as an \nelevator operator in the Senate. His career spanned seven decades, 10 \nPresidents, and 32 Congresses. To say Jim Smith is an institution in \nWashington, DC, would be an understatement.\n  Jim Smith was born in Aberdeen, SD, but spent the majority of his \nchildhood\n\n[[Page S8598]]\n\nin my hometown of Pierre, SD. After graduating from Pierre High School \nin 1948, Jim attended the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, \nwhere he was the quarterback for the Miners when they won a \nchampionship in 1951.\n  After graduating from SDM in 1952, Jim decided law school was the \nbest route for him, and this South Dakota boy moved to the big city to \nattend George Washington School of Law in Washington, DC. Like many \nhard-working South Dakotans, Jim worked his way through law school, \nstarting his career operating the very same Senate elevators we take \ntoday in the U.S. Capitol.\n  Jim's work ethic caught the eye of many, and he eventually moved on \nto work for his home State Senator, Karl Mundt. Jim worked as a \nlegislative assistant for Senator Mundt and went on to become minority \ncounsel on the Senate Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Intergovernmental \nRelations.\n  After his time working on Capitol Hill, Jim began a successful career \nin the banking sector until he was called back to government service, \nthis time with the U.S. Treasury where he served as Deputy \nUndersecretary. In 1973, Jim became the first South Dakotan appointed \nas Comptroller of the Currency, an office created by President Abraham \nLincoln in 1863.\n  Jim Smith served as Comptroller of the Currency under two Presidents \nand eventually left to rejoin the private sector in 1976. He went on to \nhave a successful career partnering with another government relations \nprofessional to establish their own firm, which will continue to bear \nhis name even after his retirement.\n  Jim Smith embodies the work ethic and attitude we are known for in \nour State. He has earned his place on the pages of South Dakota history \nbooks.\n  To Jim Smith and his wife of 37 years, Karen, I wish you the best on \nyour retirement, and I thank you for your years of dedicated public \nservice. Thank you for making South Dakota proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/senate-section/article/S8598-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DR. CARL ZULAUF\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I wish to honor today the \ndistinguished career of Dr. Carl Zulauf on the occasion of his \nretirement from the faculty of the Ohio State University.\n  Raised on a farm himself, Carl's passion for agriculture began at an \nearly age. His family's diversified farm raised livestock and crops. \nHis connection to the land has remained a common thread throughout his \nlife and career, and Carl hopes to use his retirement as an opportunity \nto refocus on his family's farm.\n  With the seeds of interest firmly planted, Carl pursued his education \nin what he knew best: agriculture. First, where he earned a degree in \nAgricultural Economics at the Ohio State University and later at \nStanford University where he obtained his PhD. Dr. Zulauf credits his \nupbringing on a farm as the foundation for his interest in \nstrengthening our Nation's domestic farming and the special \nappreciation he has for the issues facing American farmers and the \nagricultural sector.\n  Since 1980, Carl had been a pillar of OSU's College of food, \nagricultural, and environmental sciences. The depth and breadth of his \nresearch portfolio is impressive and includes dozens of peer-reviewed \njournal articles and over 1,000 articles developed for broader public \nconsumption. Not just a researcher, Carl is a dedicated educator. \nThousands of students have benefited from his teaching, leadership, and \nmentoring. Carl served as academic adviser to more than 200 students. \nFor over a decade, he has been a faculty adviser for Ohio State's \nSPHINX Senior Honorary--which each year pays tribute to 24 students who \n``embody the highest ideals of scholarship, leadership, camaraderie, \ncitizenship, and service at The Ohio State University.'' Additionally, \nhe has helped organize programs with students to travel to China and \nthe Czech Republic to study agriculture. As a professor, his interest \nin his students can be seen by the large number of farmers across my \nState that talk about their time in Dr. Zulauf's classroom. The dozens \nof accolades that have been awarded to him throughout his tenure at OSU \nserve as witness to his impact as both a teacher and scholar. Carl's \nmany contributions are a reminder that the values of the SPHINX--\nservice, camaraderie, leadership, and scholarship--are not solely the \ndomain of OSU's students.\n  Beyond his exemplary work as a researcher and educator, Carl has been \nan engaged member of both Ohio's and the broader agriculture community. \nHe has been a leader in the Ohio agribusiness community, taking part in \na number of strategic planning committees. He continues to be a regular \ncontributor to FarmDoc, a project of the University of Illinois at \nUrbana-Champaign, which serves as an online resources for farmers \nacross the country.\n  He inspired many students in his work at OSU, and one cannot fully \nunderstand Ohio's agricultural sector without knowing the name Carl \nZulauf. However, his most noteworthy contribution to agriculture in the \nUnited States must be his work on farm policy. In 1985, Carl joined \nSenator John Glenn's office to help with agriculture policy, an \nexperience he described as eye-opening. With his academic background \nand experience growing up on a farm, Carl brought an informed and \ndiverse perspective. Though he went back to teaching following his time \nin Washington, Carl's time in Senator Glenn's office left an indelible \nmark and would guide his work on agriculture policy in the decades to \ncome.\n  One pivotal example of Carl's work on agriculture policy was for the \n2008 farm bill with the development of the Average Crop Revenue \nElection, ACRE, program, which represented a novel approach to risk \nmanagement for our Nation's farmers. Carl worked with my office in \n2008, as well as the office of Senator Durbin, to draft legislation \nthat would become the ACRE program. ACRE was based on years of research \nand conversations with farmers and some of the best minds in our \nagriculture industry. My staff worked on ACRE which later became the \nARC, Average Risk Coverage, program--legislation that I worked on with \nSenator Thune and which we were able to include the 2014 farm bill. \nOver 90 percent of our Nation's corn and soybean farmers choose to \nenroll in the ARC program which will serve as a crucial safety net for \nfarmers at risk of low yields and was the first revenue-based rather \nthan fixed-price program. The overwhelming participation in these \nprograms serves as validation of Carl's work and cements his reputation \nas a key architect of our Nation's food and farm policy. Carl's \nfingerprints will be on agriculture policy for many future iterations \nof the farm bill.\n  From his tenure as a motivating and engaging professor at OSU to the \nrole and voice he continues to play in Ohio and across the Nation as a \nleading thinker on the future of our farm and food policy, Carl has \nserved as a resource guide and mentor for many. Thousands of students \nhave benefited from his teaching, and thousands of farmers will benefit \nfrom his work that has informed our Nation's agricultural policies. I \nwish him the best in his retirement and applaud his contributions to \nhis profession and thank him for his service to America's farmers, his \nuniversity, and our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/senate-section/article/S8598-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8598-S8599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN RIFLE CLUB\n\n Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the Rocky \nMountain Rifle Club, RMRC, for their efforts to support the Teton \nCounty 4-H Shooting Sports Air Rifle and Air Pistol clubs. I appreciate \nRMRC's efforts to honor Montana's strong hunting legacy and protect our \nSecond Amendment rights.\n  There are currently 20 Montana kids enrolled in the Teton program. \nThree students are among the top 10 Montana shooters for their age \ngroups: Berit Bedord, age 14; Ashley Pearson, age 13; and Luke Ostberg, \nage 12. These three have been the longest lasting members of the Teton \nclub and have steadily earned top scores in State competitions.\n  The aim of the Teton County 4-H program is to introduce young \nMontanans to shooting with a focus on safety and the proper and ethical \nuse of firearms. The shooting sports program is one of the most popular \n4-H programs in the country, according to Brian Bedord, the coordinator \nfor the Teton 4-H shooting program.\n  The Rocky Mounty Rifle Club has been a strong supporter of the Teton\n\n[[Page S8599]]\n\nCounty 4-H Shooting Sports Air Rifle and Air Pistol clubs and is \ncurrently raising funds to purchase top-of-the-line air rifles and air \npistols in addition to target equipment for the 4-H program.\n  It is my honor to thank the Rocky Mountain Rifle Club and all of its \nmembers and employees for continuing to work towards the responsible \neducation of firearms for young Montanans. The right to keep and bear \narms is an issue that is of upmost importance to me and the people of \nMontana. I am grateful for all of RMRC's hard work to educate Montanans \nand support our State's strong tradition of responsible firearm \nownership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/senate-section/article/S8599-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JULIO N.

Infiesta of Lynbrook, NY, who served in the \nSocial Security Administration for 42 years in the New York region. I \nask my colleagues to join me in thanking Mr. Infiesta for his years of \ndedication and public service and to congratulate him on his \nretirement.\n  In 1973, Julio began his career with the Social Security \nAdministration, serving in various local offices in the New York \nmetropolitan region, including in the South Bronx, where he was an \noperations supervisor, and in Long Beach, where he was selected as \nbranch manager. In 1976, he became a social insurance specialist in the \nNew York regional office in field operations. Mr. Infiesta also served \nas assistant district manager and district manager in the Jamaica and \nFlushing offices until 2001, when he entered the agency's Advanced \nLeadership Program. Mr. Infiesta was promoted to the position of deputy \nassistant regional commissioner for management and operations support \nand also served as the acting assistant regional commissioner for \nmanagement and operations support. As a member of the Senior Executive \nService Candidate Development Program, he served as an area director \nand as the director for disability in the office of the deputy \ncommissioner for operations. In 2003, Mr. Infiesta was selected as the \nregion's assistant regional commissioner for management and operations \nsupport and was elevated to deputy regional commissioner in 2014.\n  As Social Security's second senior ranking official in the New York \nmetropolitan region, Mr. Infiesta oversaw Social Security operations in \nNew York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. These \noperations included an annual administrative budget of $400 million for \nmore than 3,900 employees in 113 field offices, four teleservice \ncenters, four Social Security Card Centers, the Northeastern Program \nService Center, and the New York regional office. In the New York \nmetropolitan region, Social Security pays $7.3 billion in monthly cash \nbenefits to 6 million retirees, workers with disabilities and their \nfamilies, and the families of workers who have died. Social Security \npays an additional $461 million in monthly Supplemental Security Income \ncash benefits to 835,000 people aged 65 and older, as well as people \nwho are blind or disabled, regardless of age.\n  Mr. Infiesta and his wife, Joanne, are longtime residents of \nLynbrook, in Nassau County, Long Island.\n  Mr. President, I ask that we give tribute on December 10, 2015, to \nthe 42 years of service that Mr. Julio N.

Mr. President, after 7 and a half years of \nleadership educating the best and brightest minds not only in North \nDakota, but from around the world, University of North Dakota, UND, \npresident, Dr. Robert O. Kelley, is retiring. I want to take the time \nto thank him for his service and send my best wishes to President \nKelley, his wife, Marcia, and his family for their commitment to the \nstudents, faculty, and families served by the university.\n  President Kelley joined the University of North Dakota in 2008, \nserving as the school's 11th president and providing the university, \nits students, the city of Grand Forks, and the State of North Dakota \nthe steadfast direction needed to strengthen the legacy and leadership \nof the institution.\n  As an alumna, the University of North Dakota will always hold a \nspecial place in my heart. The University of North Dakota is where I \ngained knowledge and skills that helped me in both the private and \npublic sectors. So I am proud President Kelley similarly ensured that \nstudents continue to receive the skills they need to succeed. Under his \nsteady guidance, the University of North Dakota has grown \nsignificantly.\n  Nearly $225 million in building projects are underway at the \nuniversity, including the school of law building addition and \nrenovation and the new school of medicine and health sciences building, \nwhich will open in the fall of 2016. Each and every time I return to \nthe campus to visit with students and faculty, I see firsthand the \nexceptional college experience UND offers. I know these accomplishments \nare in large part attributed to Dr. Kelley's direction and will be an \nelement of his legacy for years to come.\n  Since the university's founding in 1883, it has been an academic \ncenter for North Dakota, where young minds have had the opportunity to \nlearn and grow to become the leaders of the State and the country. \nPresident Kelley's leadership has worked to navigate the university \nthrough sometimes controversial reforms including the process to change \nthe school's nickname and logo. Under his guidance, the school worked \nto ensure a smooth transition.\n  As UND looks to the future, I recognize that President Kelley's work \nover these last 7 and a half years has strengthened the institution's \nfoundation for excellence and will help those who follow in his stead \nto maintain the school's legacy. On behalf of the students, families, \nand citizens of North Dakota, I wish him and his family the best and \nthank them for their hard work and service to the University of North \nDakota and our great State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/senate-section/article/S8599-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8599-S8600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RECOGNIZING CARSON TAHOE HEALTH'S REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 10th \nanniversary of Carson Tahoe Health's, CTH, acclaimed regional medical \ncenter.\n  Over the past decade, this center has grown to be one of northern \nNevada's leading health care facilities. Most recently, the Carson \nTahoe Sierra Surgery department of the regional medical center received \nthe HealthInsight Hospital Quality Award for its top-tier care and \npatient satisfaction. The center has been recognized through a variety \nof accolades for its cutting-edge medical expertise and incredible \npatient care. I am proud to see this facility in Nevada recognized on a \nnational level for its high-quality medical treatment.\n  Since the Medical Center's opening, those working within the facility \nhave gone above and beyond to provide northern Nevadans with the best \nhealth care. The staff has spent countless hours further expanding \nhealth care services for Nevadans. The medical center has developed a \npremier open heart and endovascular surgery program and a women and \nchildren's center with a five-star rating. The facility has also \nsecured an affiliation with the University of Utah Health Care and \nHuntsman Cancer Institute, which significantly increases care options \nfor Nevadans. The center is acknowledged for its complete cancer \ntreatment, intervention, support, and aftercare and provides 153 beds \nfor Silver State residents. The staff is comprised of 240 board-\ncertified physicians that cover an array of 35 medical specialties. The \nnorthern Nevada community is fortunate to have this incredible Medical \nCenter ready to help with its medical needs.\n  For the past decade, CTH's regional medical center has provided \nresidents across northern Nevada with top-notch and innovative health \ncare options.

It gives me great pleasure to recognize this entity that does so \nmuch for Nevada's veterans, active military members, and their \nfamilies.\n  For half a century, the southern Nevada chapter has provided southern \nNevada's military community with an incredible support system to \naddress a diverse range of veterans and active military members' \nissues. The organization offers our Nation's brave men and women advice \nand guidance on compensation and benefits, as well as raises money to \nbenefit Wounded Warriors, ROTC scholarships, and other entities helping \nour heroes who have defended our freedoms. The southern Nevada chapter \nspearheaded the Veterans Court Program, which gives veterans a second \nchance and helps to expunge misdemeanors from their records, so long as \nthey participate in a rehabilitation program, perform community \nservice, and maintain a positive lifestyle.\n  Southern Nevada's military community is fortunate to have this \nchapter working as an ally to improve the lives of veterans. The \norganization also advocates on behalf of America's national defense, an \nissue I believe is crucial for our country. I am grateful to each and \nevery member of this organization for their service and sacrifice in \ndefending our Nation. There is no way to adequately thank the men and \nwomen who sacrifice their lives for our freedoms. Their service is \ninvaluable to our country.\n  As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have had no \ngreater honor than the opportunity to engage with the men and women who \nserved in our Nation's military. I recognize Congress has a \nresponsibility not only to honor the brave individuals who serve our \nNation, but also to ensure they are cared for when they return home. I \nremain committed to upholding this promise for our veterans and \nservicemembers in Nevada and throughout the Nation.

O'DONNELL BLATNIK\n\n Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of \na dear friend and a remarkable West Virginian who passed away on \nDecember 9th, 2015. Former West Virginia State senator and house of \ndelegates member, Thais F. O'Donnell Blatnik, was a dedicated public \nservant and an inspiring leader who was respected and admired by all \nwho knew her. She led an extraordinary life that will always be \nremembered in the hearts of the countless individuals whose lives she \ntouched.\n  Thais was a proud West Virginian from our State's northern panhandle. \nShe was born and raised in the town of Weirton, where she grew up with \nher loving parents and her two younger sisters, Eileen and Kay. It was \nthere in the small town of Weirton that Thais would plant her roots and \ncultivate an inherent love and commitment to her community, the \nnorthern panhandle region, and her entire State.\n  Thais went on to live a long and prosperous life, filled with immense \nsuccess. But she never strayed too far from her loved ones and friends \nin Weirton and the northern panhandle. After graduating from high \nschool, she attended and graduated from West Liberty University and \nlaunched a tireless career in journalism. After college, Thais returned \nto her beloved hometown to work for the Weirton Daily Times. She also \nspent part of her career working for the Wheeling Intelligencer and as \nan editor for the Dominion Post.\n  During her journalism career, Thais developed her inquisitive nature \nalong with her passion for asking the hard questions. She was a true \nforce, and she was tough but fair when it came to telling the news. She \ncovered all levels of politics, and she even had the opportunity to \ninterview three U.S. Presidents: President Kennedy, President Ford, and \nPresident Roosevelt. As a result of her work in journalism, she was \nemboldened to run for office herself and to stand up for the northern \npanhandle communities she loved so dearly.\n  Just as Thais was a fierce journalist, she became an equally strong \nand passionate public servant. Genuinely committed to improving the \nlives of all West Virginians, she represented Ohio County for 8 years \nin the house of delegates and another 8 years in the State senate. I \nwas proud to work alongside her and call her my colleague during my \ntime in the State senate. Thais spent her time at the statehouse \nfighting to improve the lives of all West Virginians, but specifically \nwomen and children and those struggling with mental health and \ndisabilities. She was honored for her great work and for her service as \nMental Health Directors Legislator of the Year and recognized by the \nWest Virginia Association for the Developmentally Disabled for her \nfaithful work helping children with exceptionalities. Thais also served \nas the executive director of the Wheeling Area Training Center for the \nHandicapped, WATCH.\n  Thais was not only reputable and accomplished in her public life, but \nshe was also an unparalleled example of a devoted wife, a proud mother, \nand a wonderful grandmother. She was married to the late Dr. Albert M. \nBlatnik for more than 48 years and paid tribute to him in a book she \nwrote titled ``Here's Al.'' Thais received love and support throughout \nher life from Al as well as her children--Floyd, Judy, and David--and \nher grandchildren--Katie, Jack, Joe, Maggie, and Sam--who lovingly \ncalled her ``Meme.'' During their lives, Thais and Al led their \ngrandchildren across the country introducing them to exciting new \nexperiences.\n  Anyone who knew Thais Blatnik can tell you about her incredible \npassion for her community and her State and her ability to inspire each \nperson she encountered. She made a difference throughout West Virginia \nand will be forever remembered for her many years of service. She was \ntruly a hero to so many in our State, and though she will be greatly \nmissed, her memory will always live on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/senate-section/article/S8600-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8600-S8601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING THE HENRY FORD HEALTH SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Henry \nFord Health System as it celebrates delivering a century of high-\nquality and innovative health care services to the metropolitan Detroit \ncommunity.\n  In 1909, Henry Ford, David Whitney, and a few other leading Detroit-\narea businessmen recognized the need for a major health care center in \nDetroit and set out to open Detroit General Hospital. After \nexperiencing several years of delays, Henry Ford took over the entire \nproject and renamed the facility ``Henry Ford Hospital'', which opened \nits doors to the public on October 1, 1915.\n  From the outset, Henry Ford was focused upon adapting the insights \nand innovations he pioneered in the automotive industry for use in the \ndelivery of health care services. Among his innovations were a first-\nin-the-Nation center for treating chemical dependency and an \naccountability system for promoting shorter patient waiting times. Over \nthe years, Henry Ford Health System's commitment to innovation saw \nbreakthroughs in the administration of electrocardiograms, improvements \nin the design of hospital beds, and advancements in medication \nregiments for treating bacterial infections.\n  Throughout its history, Henry Ford Health System has been committed \nto meet the evolving needs of the metro Detroit region. Recognizing the \nneed for access to low-cost health care services, Henry Ford Hospital \npartnered with the State of Michigan in 1970 to\n\n[[Page S8601]]\n\ncreate the Community Health and Social Services, CHASS, clinic in \nsouthwest Detroit. Around the same time, Henry Ford Health System also \nbegan partnering with the Detroit public schools to provide in-school \nhealth services to students.\n  With the growing population in Detroit's suburbs, Henry Ford Health \nSystem began to expand, opening new medical centers in Troy, Dearborn, \nand West Bloomfield. Today Henry Ford Health System has grown from a \nsingle facility with 48 beds into a regional health care provider which \nadmits around 89,000 patients each year and delivers approximately 3.5 \nmillion clinic visits. The staff has also grown to more than 23,000 \nemployees, making Henry Ford Health System the fifth largest employer \nin the Metro Detroit region.\n  In recognition of its outstanding commitment to delivering world-\nclass health care services in a novel and effective manner, Henry Ford \nHealth System is the only organization to receive all five major health \ncare quality awards: the Foster G. McGaw Prize in 2004, the Joint \nCommission's Ernest Amory Codman and John M. Eisenberg Awards in 2006 \nand 2011, the American Hospital Association's McKesson Quest for \nQuality Prize in 2010, and the Malcolm Baldrige Award in 2011. As a \nrecipient of the Baldrige Award, Henry Ford Health System joins an \nelite group of organizations who have been recognized for outstanding \ninnovations in their respective fields.\n  I am honored to ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing \nHenry Ford Health System's 100th anniversary. This significant \nmilestone is a great opportunity to reflect upon its century-long \nrecord of fostering innovations in the development and delivery of \nhealth care services, its commitment to providing the best possible \noutcomes for its patients, and the transformative effect it continues \nto make, both in the health care field and metro Detroit. Henry Ford \nHealth System has made a remarkable impact in southeast Michigan over \nthe last century, and I wish its leadership, medical professionals, and \nstaff well in continuing to fulfill its mission in the years and \ndecades ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/senate-section/article/S8601-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO JUDGE HAIGANUSH R. BEDROSIAN\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, as this year draws to a close, \nso too does a long and accomplished legal career for Rhode Island \nFamily Court Chief Judge Haiganush R. Bedrosian. She will retire from \nthe bench at the end of December after serving on the family court for \nover 35 years. Judge Bedrosian is a trailblazer and a skilled leader in \nthe Rhode Island legal community. She will be missed.\n  Judge Bedrosian, the daughter of Armenian immigrants, is a lifelong \nRhode Islander who grew up in Cranston. She attended Cranston East High \nSchool and then Brown University's Pembroke College, where she \ngraduated with a degree in political science in 1965.\n  She says that when she graduated from Pembroke, she was told ``women \ndon't go to law school'' and she had best look for work elsewhere. That \ndidn't sound right to her.\n  Judge Bedrosian enrolled at Suffolk Law School, where she excelled. \nShe earned a clerkship with Rhode Island Supreme Court Justice Thomas \nPaolino. After her clerkship, she rose quickly in the legal profession, \nserving as an assistant general counsel for the Providence & Worcester \nRailroad, representing children in private practice and serving as a \nspecial assistant to the Rhode Island Attorney General in the Criminal \nDivision.\n  In 1980, Rhode Island Governor J. Joseph Garrahy nominated her to \nserve on Rhode Island's family court, making her the first woman to sit \non the family court bench. Over the course of her tenure, she has built \na reputation for fairness, compassion, and thorough command of the law. \nShe has deftly handled some of the most complex and difficult cases to \ncome before the Court.\n  She rose to the position of chief judge on the family court in 2010--\nanother first for a woman in Rhode Island--where she has proven herself \nan able leader. She has promoted mediation as a way to resolve \nchallenging family disputes more quickly and with less stress on the \nparties involved. She has advocated for improvements to the way \njuveniles are treated in our justice system, both at the State and \nFederal levels. She has worked to combat human trafficking and sexual \nviolence. And she has expanded the family treatment drug court, a smart \nand effective program to address drug offenses that involve youth and \nfamilies.\n  In addition to her good work in the courtroom, Judge Bedrosian has \ncontributed a great deal to her community. She remains a committed \nmember of the congregation of Saints Vartanantz Armenian Apostolic \nChurch in Providence where she is a frequent volunteer. She has also \nfounded and served as president of the Rhode Island Trial Judges \nAssociation.\n  We will miss Judge Bedrosian's steady hand and compassionate, \nreasoned rulings on the bench. But we wish her well in the next chapter \nof her life. Best of luck, Your Honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/senate-section/article/S8601-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered by \nMr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2130.

INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Brown, Mr. Whitehouse, Mrs. \n        Gillibrand, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren, and Mr. \n        Merkley):\n  S. 2387. A bill to restore protections for Social Security, Railroad \nretirement, and Black Lung benefits from administrative offset; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, every day, Social Security provides vital \nbenefits to millions of Americans who worked and paid into the system. \nTo ensure workers would receive full access to these fundamental \nlifeline benefits, for many years, the law protected these earned \nbenefits from attempts to recover debts. However, 20 years ago, \nCongress suddenly reversed course, and made a change to the law that \nallowed the government to cut Social Security and other hard-earned \nbenefit payments in order to collect student loan and other Federal \ndebts, like home loans owed to the Veterans Administration, and food \nstamp overpayments.\n  Now more than ever, the loss of these protections is creating a major \nhardship for American Citizens who rely on Social Security and other \nearned benefits to make ends meet. Student loan debt is becoming an \nincreasingly serious problem in in Oregon and across the nation, with \nstudents and their families burdened by crushing student loan debt. \nEven in the best circumstances, many families will struggle to pay off \ncrippling loans for years to come. However, for people who rely on \nbenefits like Social Security after retirement, disability, or the \ndeath of a family member, making payments on student loans or other \nfederal debts can become an insurmountable hardship.\n  Because of the lifeline nature of these earned benefits, for more \nthan 40 years the law prevented all creditors from collecting hard-\nearned Social Security, Railroad Retirement, and Black Lung benefits to \nrecoup debts. The only exceptions included unpaid Federal taxes, child \nsupport or alimony payments, and court-ordered victim restitution. \nThese protections helped ensure that our social safety net programs \nwere functioning as intended--something I think we can all agree is \nessential to preserving Social Security and other earned benefits.\n  Astonishingly, when the law changed as part of a 1996 omnibus budget \nbill, these changes were never fully debated in Congress. This means \nMembers of Congress never had the chance to really explore how this \npolicy would affect beneficiaries. The legislation ultimately included \nsome protections for the most vulnerable, but even those protections \nhave not been updated in 20 years.\n  We now realize what a profound effect the loss of these protections \nhas had on retirees and individuals with disabilities, who often live \non fixed incomes. More and more seniors and people with disabilities \nare having their Social Security and other lifeline benefits taken away \nto pay federal debts. For example, according to a September 2014 GAO \nreport, the number of individuals whose Social Security benefits were \noffset to pay student loan debt increased significantly between 2002 \nand 2013, from about 31,000 to 155,000. For individuals 65 and older \nwith student loan-related Social Security garnishments, the number grew \nfrom about 6,000 to about 36,000 over the same period. Congress should \nrestore sanity to the system, and reestablish the protections that \nthese beneficiaries deserve.\n  That is why I, along with Senators Brown, Whitehouse, Gillibrand, \nKlobuchar, Sanders and Warren are introducing the Protection of Social \nSecurity Benefits Restoration Act. The bill would restore the strong \nprotections in the law that prevented the government from taking away \nearned benefits to pay Federal debts, and guarantee beneficiaries will \nbe able to maintain a basic standard of living by receiving the \nbenefits they have earned. The bill is supported by Social Security \nWorks, The Strengthen Social Security Coalition, AFL-CIO, Justice in \nAging, Campaign for America's Future, Global Policy Solutions, Student \nDebt Crisis, the National Organization for Women, RootsAction.org, \nProject Springboard, The Alliance for a Just Society, the Economic \nOpportunity Institute, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, The \nArc of the United States, The Public Higher Education Network of \nMassachusetts, the American Federation of Government Employees, and the \nNational Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2387\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nextend the rural add-on payment in the Medicare home health benefit, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nWashington, Senator Cantwell, to introduce the Preserve Access to \nMedicare Rural Home Health Services Act of 2015. This legislation would \nextend the modest increase in payments for home health services in \nrural areas that otherwise will expire on January 1 of 2018.\n  Home health has become an increasingly important part of our health \ncare system. The kinds of highly skilled--and often technically \ncomplex--services that our nation's home health caregivers provide have \nenabled millions of our most frail and vulnerable older and disabled \ncitizens to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and stay just where they \nwant to be--in the comfort, privacy, and security of their own homes. I \nhave accompanied several of Maine's caring home health nurses on their \nvisits to patients and have seen first hand the difference that they \nare making for patients and their families.\n  Surveys have shown that the delivery of home health services in rural \nareas can be as much as 12 to 15 percent more costly because of the \nextra travel time\n\n[[Page S8605]]\n\nrequired to cover long distances between patients, higher \ntransportation expenses, and other factors. Because of the longer \ntravel times, rural caregivers are unable to make as many visits in a \nday as their urban counterparts. For example, home health care agencies \nin Aroostook County in Northern Maine, where I am from, cover almost \n6,700 square miles, with an average population of fewer than 11 persons \nper square mile. These agencies' costs are understandably much higher \nthan other agencies located in more urban areas due to the long \ndistances the staff must drive to see clients. Moreover, the staff is \nnot able to see as many patients due to time on the road.\n  Agencies serving rural areas are also frequently smaller than their \nurban counterparts, which means that their relative costs are higher. \nSmaller agencies with fewer patients and fewer visits mean that fixed \ncosts, particularly those associated with meeting regulatory \nrequirements, are spread over a much smaller number of patients and \nvisits, increasing overall per-patient and per-visit costs.\n  Moreover, in many rural areas, home health agencies are the primary \ncaregivers for homebound beneficiaries with limited access to \ntransportation. These rural patients often require more time and care \nthan their urban counterparts and are understandably more expensive for \nagencies to serve. If the extra three per cent rural payment is not \nextended, agencies may be forced to decide not to accept rural patients \nwith greater care needs. That could translate into less access to \nhealth care for ill, homebound seniors. The result would likely be that \nthese seniors would be hospitalized more frequently and would have to \nseek care in nursing homes, adding considerable cost to the system.\n  Failure to extend the rural add-on payment would only put more \npressure on rural home health agencies that are already operating on \nvery narrow margins and could force some of the agencies to close their \ndoors altogether. If any of these agencies were forced to close, the \nMedicare patients in that region could lose all of their access to home \ncare.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will extend the rural add-on \nfor 5 years and help to ensure that Medicare patients in rural areas \ncontinue to have access to the home health services they need. \nMoreover, we would offset costs of the bill by reducing the home health \noutlier fund by .25 percent over the same 5 years. I urge our \ncolleagues to join us as cosponsors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 2390. A bill to provide adequate protections for whistleblowers at \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in his 2013 confirmation hearing, FBI \nDirector James Comey called whistleblowers ``a critical element of a \nfunctioning democracy.''\n  That is what I have been saying for years. Whistleblowers expose \nwaste, fraud, and abuse. They help keep Government honest and make sure \ntaxpayer dollars are spent wisely. By pointing out problems, \nwhistleblowers foster transparency and make it possible for an \norganization to do better.\n  Agencies should value their contributions. Instead, agencies often \nignore whistleblower complaints or worse--retaliate against \nwhistleblowers for bringing wrongdoing to light.\n  Across the Federal Government, whistleblowers are treated like skunks \nat a picnic, instead of the dedicated public servants they are. \nUnfortunately, the Federal Bureau of Investigation is no exception on \nthat point. However, the FBI is the exception when it comes to legal \nprotections for whistleblowers.\n  Unlike every other federal agency, the FBI is the only agency where \nemployees are not protected for reporting wrongdoing to their direct \nsupervisors or others within their chain-of-command. This makes no \nsense.\n  Studies show the great majority of whistleblowers first make \ndisclosures to their supervisors. The FBI's own policy encourages \nreports to supervisors within the chain-of-command. Nevertheless, an \nFBI employee who makes a disclosure of waste, fraud, or abuse to their \nsupervisor has no protection under law if the supervisor retaliates.\n  It is no surprise, then, that a 2015 report by the Government \nAccountability Office found that, of the 54 closed FBI whistleblower \ncomplaints it reviewed where documentation showed the reason for \nclosing the case, at least 17 cases were dismissed in part because an \nemployee made a disclosure to someone in their chain-of-command or \nmanagement.\n  Why is there this gaping hole in FBI whistleblower protections? \nBecause, unlike every other federal law enforcement agency, the FBI is \nstatutorily exempt from government-wide whistleblower protection laws. \nAs a result, it lives under its own unique regulatory scheme conceived, \ncreated, and controlled entirely within the Department of Justice. \nThere is no independent review.\n  This unique exemption for the FBI has led to outrageous delays in the \nadjudication of FBI whistleblower complaints due to endless internal \nappeals and the low priority that FBI whistleblower cases receive at \nthe Justice Department.\n  Currently, FBI whistleblower cases are adjudicated by the \nDepartment's Office of Attorney Recruitment and Management--an office \nwhose very name clearly shows it was not designed to address reprisal \ncases. Appeals are considered by the Deputy Attorney General's office. \nThat office has made clear that it has other priorities that render it \nincapable of even minimal communications with whistleblowers to inform \nthem of their case status. Clearly, we need to do better.\n  I have worked with many FBI whistleblowers over the years who put \neverything on the line just to tell the truth. In exchange for their \ncourage, they faced delays of up to a decade in adjudicating their \ncases, a deaf ear from the highest levels of the Justice Department, \nand in many cases, no protection at all.\n  Consider the case of Michael German. Michael testified at our hearing \nin March this year where we examined the effectiveness--or lack \nthereof--of the Justice Department's FBI whistleblower regulations.\n  Before he resigned from the FBI in 2004, Michael German was a \ndecorated undercover special agent who successfully risked his life to \ninfiltrate white supremacist and neo-Nazi hate groups across the United \nStates, some with ties to foreign terrorist groups. He discovered that \na portion of a meeting between two such groups had been illegally \nrecorded by mistake.\n  Rather than following the rules and documenting the error, as he \nsuggested, a supervisor told him to ``pretend it didn't happen.'' But \nhe refused to back down. He reported the wrongdoing to his Assistant \nSpecial Agent in Charge. Then the FBI ``froze him out and made him a \n`pariah.' ''\n  Because Special Agent German disclosed wrongdoing to his ASAC instead \nof one of the nine specifically designated entities in the Justice \nDepartment regulations, he was not protected. His case was not even \ninvestigated ``in earnest,'' according to him, until he resigned from \nthe FBI and reported the matter to Congress.\n  This is the tragedy of weak FBI whistleblower protections: If this \nbill had been law when Michael German first blew the whistle, this \ncountry might still have the benefit of this decorated FBI Special \nAgent in our fight against terrorism. He is by far not the only FBI \nwhistleblower sidelined and ostracized by the failures of current law \nand policy.\n  In today's world, we cannot afford to lose public servants like \nMichael German. That is why today, with my cosponsor Senator Leahy, I \nam introducing this hi-partisan legislation, the FBI Whistleblower \nProtection Enhancement Act of 2015.\n  Among other things, this bill will for the first time provide legal \nprotection to FBI employees who report wrongdoing to their supervisors, \nprovide a more independent process for whistleblowers who have suffered \nreprisal, and increase oversight and transparency of the FBI \nwhistleblower complaint process.\n  This bill is a long time coming. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S8606]]\n\n  \n\n\n                                S. 2390\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, whistleblowers serve an essential role in \nproviding transparency and accountability in the Federal Government. It \nis important that all government employees are provided with strong and \neffective avenues to come forward with evidence of government abuse and \nmisuse. To ensure that whistleblowers feel comfortable speaking up when \nthey discover wrongdoing, it is also imperative that they are afforded \nprotections from retaliation. That is why Senator Grassley and I are \njoining together to introduce the Federal Bureau of Investigation, \n``FBI'', Whistleblower Protection Enhancements Act of 2015.\n  Current FBI policies do not go far enough to protect whistleblowers. \nIn March, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing that highlighted a \nnumber of serious problems facing whistleblowers at the FBI. We \nreceived testimony about the lack of protections for employees who \nreport waste, fraud, or abuse to their direct supervisors. We also \nheard instances of the FBI failing to comply with regulatory \nrequirements when conducting retaliation investigations, and that \nadjudication of contested cases can take years. One former employee, \nMichael German, testified in detail about how he was forced to end his \ndistinguished career at the FBI after he disclosed to Congress serious \ndeficiencies in the agency's handling of counterterrorism \ninvestigations. He chose to do this after making a protected \nwhistleblower disclosure at the FBI that went nowhere while the \nretaliation continued.\n  The concerns expressed at the hearing echo concerns that were \nidentified in two recent reports on the FBI whistleblower framework, \none by the Department of Justice and the other by Government \nAccountability Office. Clearly the status quo is unacceptable. Congress \nshould extend to FBI whistleblowers the same level of protection that \nis afforded other Federal employees who speak out about waste, fraud, \nor abuse. That is what Senator Grassley and I seek to do today with \nthis bill.\n  Our legislation closely tracks the protections contained in the \nWhistleblower Protection Act. Importantly, we extend whistleblower \nprotections to FBI employees who blow the whistle to supervisors in \ntheir chain of command. This common sense fix is crucial to protect \nthose employees who dare to speak up and report concerns to their \nsuperiors. The bill also provides clear guidance on the investigation \nand adjudication of retaliation claims. Investigations will now be \nhandled solely by the Office of Inspector General, rather than sharing \nthis responsibility with the Office of Professional Responsibility. \nThis will provide much needed clarity and consistency in the process. \nContested cases will now be adjudicated by Administrative Law Judges \ninstead of by the Office of Attorney Recruitment and Management. Under \nthis new process the Administrative Procedures Act will apply, ensuring \na hearing on the record and strong procedural protections for all \nparties.\n  This bipartisan bill will help to ensure that FBI employees are able \nto blow the whistle on waste, fraud, or abuse at the FBI and not face \npersonal repercussions for doing so. I urge the Senate to act quickly \nto take up and pass this important bipartisan legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANDERS (for himself, Mr. Markey, and Mr. Merkley):\n  S. 2391. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \npermanently extend certain energy tax provisions; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, one of the great moral issues of our time \nis the global crisis of climate change. Let me be very clear about \nclimate change. Climate change is not a Democratic issue or a \nprogressive issue. It is not a Republican issue or a conservative \nissue. What it is, is an issue that has everything to do with physics. \nIt is an issue of physics. What we know beyond a shadow of a doubt is \nthat the debate is over, and that is that the vast majority of the \nscientists who have studied the issues are quite clear. What they tell \nus over and over again is that climate change is real, climate change \nis caused by human activity, and climate change is already causing \ndevastating problems throughout our country and, in fact, throughout \nthe world.\n  What the scientists also tell us is that we have a relatively short \nwindow of opportunity to bring about the fundamental changes we need in \nour global energy system to transform our energy system from fossil \nfuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. We have a limited \nwindow of opportunity. What the scientists are telling us very clearly \nis if we do not seize that opportunity, if we do not lead the world--\nworking with China, Russia, India and other countries--in transforming \nthe global energy system, the planet we leave to our children and our \ngrandchildren will be significantly less habitable than the planet we \nenjoy.\n  My nightmare is that 20, 30, 40 years from now our kids and our \ngrandchildren will look Members of the Senate and the House in the eye, \nand they will say: The scientists told you what would happen and you \ndid nothing. Why did you not react? How hard was it to stand up to the \nfossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from coal and \noil into energy efficiency and wind, solar, geothermal, and other \nsustainable energies?\n  Pope Francis recently made what I thought to be a very profound \nstatement. He said that our planet is on a suicidal direction--a \nsuicidal direction--in terms of climate change. What a frightening and \nhorrible thought. How irresponsible can we be to ignore what the entire \nscientific community is saying?\n  I know there are many of my colleagues who refuse to acknowledge the \nreality. As perhaps the most progressive Member of the U.S. Senate let \nme simply say this: I have differences with my Republican colleagues on \nvirtually every issue. That goes without saying, but there is something \nvery different about this issue. I have been in hearings with my \nRepublican colleagues where I heard doctors and scientists talk about \ncancer, about Alzheimer's, about diabetes, about all kinds of \nillnesses, and I may disagree with my Republican colleagues about how \nwe go forward, how much we should fund NIH, but I have never heard my \nRepublican colleagues attack doctors or researchers or scientists for \ntheir views on cancer research or Alzheimer's research. As I do, they \nrespect that research. But somehow or another, when it comes to the \nissue of climate change, at best what we are seeing Republicans do--\nmany Republicans, most Republicans--is ignore the issue or claim they \nare not scientists or, at worst, attack those scientists who are doing \nthe research.\n  Why is that? Why is it that my Republican colleagues accept the \nresearch\n\n[[Page S8608]]\n\non cancer, on Alzheimer's, on all kinds of illnesses, and they respect \nscientists who are working in all kinds of areas. But somehow or \nanother when it comes to the issue of climate change, my Republican \nfriends are in denial? What I will say is that this has nothing to do \nwith science, and it has sadly and tragically everything to do with our \ncorrupt campaign finance laws, which allow large corporations and \nbillionaires to contribute as much money as they want into the \npolitical process. In my view, the reality is that any Republican--and \nI happen to believe that many Republicans understand the truth about \nclimate change. But I also believe that any Republican who stood up and \nsaid ``You know what, I just talked to some scientists'' or ``I just \nread some of the literature, and this climate change is real, it is \ndangerous, and we have to do something about it''--I believe that on \nthat day when that Republican stands up, the money will stop flowing \nfrom the fossil fuel industry, from the Koch brothers, and there will \nbe a strong likelihood that Republican would be primaried in the next \nelection.\n  According to the Center for Responsive Politics, at the national \nlevel where companies have to report what they spend on lobbying and \ncampaign contributions, the oil companies, coal companies, and electric \nutilities have spent a staggering $2.2 billion in Federal lobbying \nsince 2009 and another $330 million in Federal campaign contributions. \nThat is just at the Federal level--over $2.5 billion in lobbying and \ncampaign contributions in just 6 years. Even in Washington, DC, that is \na lot of money, and that is just the money that we know about.\n  That is not all of it. That is not the end of it. As a result of the \ndisastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, which allowed \ncorporations and billionaires to spend unlimited sums of money, we know \nthat the Koch brothers, who make most of their money in the fossil fuel \nindustry, and a handful of their friends will be spending some $900 \nmillion--$900 million--from one family and a few of their friends in \nthe 2016 election cycle. Clearly, one of the reasons they are investing \nso much in this election cycle is that they intend to continue doing \neverything they can to make sure Congress does not go forward to \nprotect our kids and our grandchildren against the ravages of climate \nchange.\n  According to an 8-month investigation by journalists at Inside \nClimate News, Exxon--now ExxonMobil--may have conducted extensive \nresearch on climate change as early as 1977, leading top Exxon \nscientists to conclude both that climate change is real and that it was \ncaused, in part, by the carbon pollution resulting from the use of \nExxon's petroleum-based products. In addition, the purported internal \nbusiness memoranda accompanying the reporting asserted that Exxon's \nclimate science program was launched in response to a perceived \nexistential threat to its business model. In other words, the \nscientists at ExxonMobil, who are scientists, discovered the truth, and \nupon hearing the truth, ExxonMobil poured millions of dollars into \norganizations whose main function was to deny the reality of climate \nchange.\n  The efforts to transform our energy system are taking place not only \nhere in Washington, the Nation's Capital, but at the State and local \nlevel as well. In States such as Arizona and Florida, roadblocks are \nbeing put up to stop people from gaining access to renewable energy \nsources such as wind and especially rooftop solar. In States such as \nArizona and Florida and many of our Southern States with huge solar \nexposure, there is huge potential for solar. Yet we are now seeing \npoliticians, at the behest of the fossil fuel industry, put up \nroadblock after roadblock to make it harder for people to move to solar \nor wind.\n  I have heard a lot of the arguments from the fossil fuel industry as \nto why we should not transform our energy system, and many of those \narguments are repeated here on the floor by some of my colleagues. But \nthe truth is that it turns out that transforming our energy system away \nfrom fossil fuel and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy will \ncreate a significant number of new and decent-paying jobs, and it will \nlower energy bills in communities all across this country.\n  My own State of Vermont participates in a regional greenhouse gas \ninitiative cap-and-trade program for the power sector. Since 2009, the \nprogram has created over 14,000 net jobs, and carbon pollution levels \ndropped by 15 percent at the same time consumers, businesses, and other \nenergy users saw their electricity and heating bills go down by $459 \nmillion. The majority of those savings came from energy efficiency. All \nthe while, jobs were created, not exported, and we relied on clean \ndomestic energy instead of oil from the Middle East.\n  Energy efficiency clearly makes an enormous amount of sense. It is \nclearly the low-hanging fruit as we transform our energy system.\n  I have been in homes in Vermont that have been effectively \nweatherized, and they are seeing heating bills drop by 50 percent. \nPeople in those homes are living in more comfort, and jobs are being \ncreated by those people who install the insulation and other energy-\nefficient tools, not to mention all of the folks who are manufacturing \nthe insulation, windows, and efficient roofing.\n  According to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, \nenergy efficiency provides a larger return on investment than any \nindividual energy source because for every $1 invested in energy \nefficiency, we see $4 in total benefits for all consumers. For every $1 \nbillion invested in efficiency upgrades, we see a creation of 19,000 \ndirect and indirect jobs.\n  These numbers are great and speak for themselves, but acting on \nclimate change is also a moral obligation. While we will all suffer--\nall over our country and all over the world--the impacts of climate \nchange, the sad truth is that climate impacts fall especially hard upon \nthe most vulnerable people in our society. Minority and low-income \ncommunities in the United States are disproportionately impacted by the \ncauses of climate change. According to a 2012 study by the National \nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People, the NAACP, the \nnearly 6 million people in the United States who live within 3 miles of \na coal-burning powerplant have an average per capita annual income of \njust over $18,000 a year. Among the people who live within 3 miles of a \ncoal powerplant, 39 percent are people of color, while people of color \ncompromise only 36 percent of the total population of the United \nStates.\n  The bottom line is that when we talk about climate change and its \nimpact upon our planet and all the people, we should bear in mind that \nthis is happening not only in the United States but all over the world. \nThe people who will suffer the most are low-income people and people \nliving in poverty.\n  I am introducing legislation called the American Clean Energy \nInvestment Act of 2015. This legislation is built upon the fact that \nthe prices for wind and solar power have plummeted over the last \ndecade, cutting carbon pollution and creating tens of thousands of new \njobs in the process. Meanwhile, the fossil fuel industry benefits from \npermanent subsidies worth tens of billions of dollars each year. \nIncentives for renewable energy and energy efficiency are temporary and \nare too often allowed to elapse entirely.\n  My legislation permanently extends and makes refundable some of our \nmost important renewable energy tax credits for energy efficiency and \nsustainable energy, including sources such as solar, wind, and \ngeothermal. Permanently extending these incentives will drive over $500 \nbillion in clean energy investments between now and 2030 and are an \nintegral part of putting us on a pathway to more than doubling the size \nof our clean energy workforce to 10 million American workers. The costs \nfor these incentives are completely offset by repealing the special \ninterest corporate welfare in the Tax Code for the fossil fuel \nindustries.\n  If we are going to be serious about dealing with the threat of \nclimate change, we need to end the polluter welfare that subsidizes \nincreased pollution from fossil fuels and instead invest those \nresources in clean energy solutions that reduce pollution. Doing this \nwill save lives, protect our economy, and reduce the threats from \nclimate change at the same time we are creating millions of good-paying \njobs here in the United States.\n  Our legislation is supported by the Solar Energy Industries \nAssociation,\n\n[[Page S8609]]\n\nthe American Wind Energy Association, 350.org, and cosponsored by \nSenators Merkley and Markey.\n  We have a national responsibility to protect the livelihoods of the \nworking families and communities who help power and build this country. \nWe must act now to reenergize our manufacturing base, bolster our clean \nenergy economy, and protect the livelihoods of energy workers and the \ncommunities they support.\n  As a result of these concerns, this bill provides up to 3 years of \nunemployment insurance, health care, and pensions for workers who lose \ntheir jobs due to our transition to a clean energy economy. In other \nwords, we understand--as was very much the case with our moving away \nfrom tobacco farming in this country--that the people who do the work \nin coal, oil, and other fossil fuels are not to blame for the fact that \nthe product they produce is causing so many problems in our country. \nOur job is to protect and transition them to other decent-paying jobs, \nand the government has a responsibility to help with that transition.\n  Based on what the scientists are telling us, we need to make very \nsignificant cuts in carbon pollution emissions and we need to do it as \nsoon as possible. It is absolutely vital that we do what many \neconomists tell us we must do, and that is to put a price on carbon. It \nis the simplest and most direct way to make the kinds of cuts in carbon \npollution that we have to make if we are going to successfully \ntransition from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable \nenergy. That is why within the Climate Protection and Justice Act that \nI am introducing, there will be a tax on carbon. Directly pricing \ncarbon is a key part of the solution of transforming our energy system. \nMany experts support a fee on carbon pollution emissions, including \nliberal, moderates, and even prominent conservatives such as George \nShultz, Nobel laureate economist Gary Becker, Mitt Romney's former \nadviser Gregory Mankiw, former Reagan adviser Art Laffer, former \nRepublican Bob Inglis, and many others. The idea of a price on carbon \nis not just a progressive concept, it is one that is being supported by \neconomists throughout the political spectrum.\n  The Nation's leading corporations, including the Nation's five \nbiggest oil giants, are already planning their future budgets with the \nassumptions that there will be a cost applied to carbon emissions. In \nother words, some of the very companies that have strongly opposed \naction to address climate change are recognizing the reality in front \nof them, and that is that the United States is going to--hopefully \nsooner rather than later--address the crisis of climate change and that \nthere will be a tax on carbon. This tax works by setting enforceable \npollution-reduction targets for each decade, including a 40-percent \nreduction below 1990 levels by 2030 and a more than 80-percent \nreduction level by 2050.\n  This legislation sets a price on carbon pollution for fossil fuel \nproducers or importers. Proceeds from the carbon pollution fee are \nreturned to the bottom 80 percent of households making less than \n$100,000 a year to offset them for any increase they might experience \nin increased energy costs as a result of this transition. For an \naverage family of four, this will amount to a rebate of roughly $900 in \n2017 and will grow to an annual rebate of $1,900 in 2030. It would only \napply upstream, meaning at the oil refinery, coal mine, natural gas \nprocessing plant, or point of importation. It would apply to fewer than \n3,000 of the largest fossil fuel polluters in this country.\n\n  EPA's existing authority to regulate carbon pollution, sources from \npowerplants, vehicles, and other sources is reaffirmed, and if the \nUnited States is not on track to meet its emissions reduction targets, \nthe EPA shall issue new regulations to ensure that it does.\n  Importantly, based on lessons learned from the cap-and-trade law in \nCalifornia, a Federal interagency council will oversee the creation and \ndistribution of a climate justice resiliency fund block grant program \nto States, territories, tribes, municipalities, counties, localities, \nand nonprofit community organizations. The council will provide $20 \nbillion annually for these grants in communities that are vulnerable to \nthe impacts of climate change for important programs they are running.\n  This legislation strengthens our manufacturing sector through a \nborder tariff adjustment mechanism which shields energy-intensive, \ntrade-exposed industries such as steel, aluminum, glass, pulp and \npaper, from unfair international trade policies. The monies raised by \nthe green tariff are used to help improve industrial energy efficiency.\n  Farmers receive dedicated funding through the USDA's Rural Energy for \nAmerica Program to improve on farm energy efficiency and to adopt \nonsite renewable energy. The bill includes incentives for farmers to \nadopt no-till practices and creates an incentive program to encourage \nthe adoption of sustainable fertilizer application practices.\n  Finally, the bill includes Federal electricity market reforms that \nreduce pollution, increase efficiency, and reduce costs by ensuring \nequitable grid access for demand response programs.\n  At the end of the day, the Congress of the United States is going to \nhave to make some very important and fundamental decisions, and the \nmost important is whether we believe in science. We can have many \ndisagreements on many issues, but we should not have a disagreement \nabout whether we base public policy on science rather than campaign \ncontributions. That really is the issue we are dealing with right now.\n  We are in a critical moment in world history. Our planet is becoming \nwarmer, sea levels are rising, and communities all over the world that \nare on seacoasts are being threatened. The ocean is being acidified to \nan unprecedented level, which has huge impacts in so many areas, \nincluding the ability of people to fish and gain nutrients from the \nocean.\n  We are looking at unprecedented levels of heat waves in India, \nPakistan, and Europe that have killed thousands of people. We are \nlooking at forest fires on the west coast of that country that are \nunprecedented in terms of their duration and their ferocity.\n  So we have to make a decision about whether we stand with our \nchildren and our grandchildren or whether we stand with campaign \ncontributors from the fossil fuel industry.\n  Climate change is real. Climate change is caused by human activity. \nClimate change is already causing devastating damage on this planet. \nOur job is now to stand with our children, to stand with our \ngrandchildren, and to make certain that they have a planet that is \nhealthy and that is habitable. That is what the legislation I am \nintroducing will do.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Franken, Mr. Tester, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Booker, Ms. Baldwin, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 2397.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) An estimated 2,000,000 individuals with serious mental \n     illnesses are booked into jails each year, resulting in \n     prevalence rates of serious mental illness in jails that are \n     3 to 6 times higher than in the general population. An even \n     greater number of individuals who are detained in jails each \n     year have mental health problems that do not rise to the \n     level of a serious mental illness but may still require a \n     resource-intensive response.\n       (2) Adults with mental illnesses cycle through jails more \n     often than individuals without mental illnesses, and tend to \n     stay longer (including before trial, during trial, and after \n     sentencing).\n       (3) According to estimates, almost \\3/4\\ of jail detainees \n     with serious mental illnesses have co-occurring substance use \n     disorders, and individuals with mental illnesses are also \n     much more likely to have serious physical health needs.\n       (4) Among individuals under probation supervision, \n     individuals with mental disorders are nearly twice as likely \n     as other individuals to have their community sentence \n     revoked, furthering their involvement in the criminal justice \n     system. Reasons for revocation may be directly or indirectly \n     related to an individual's mental disorder.\n\n     SEC. 4.

CHURCH PLAN CLARIFICATION.\n\n       (a) Application of Controlled Group Rules to Church \n     Plans.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 414(c) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 is amended--\n       (A) by striking ``For purposes'' and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), for \n     purposes'', and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(2) Special rules relating to church plans.--\n       ``(A) General rule.--Except as provided in subparagraphs \n     (B) and (C), for purposes of this subsection and subsection \n     (m), an organization that is otherwise eligible to \n     participate in a church plan shall not be aggregated with \n     another such organization and treated as a single employer \n     with such other organization for a plan year beginning in a \n     taxable year unless--\n       ``(i) one such organization provides (directly or \n     indirectly) at least 80 percent of the operating funds for \n     the other organization during the preceding tax year of the \n     recipient organization, and\n       ``(ii) there is a degree of common management or \n     supervision between the organizations such that the \n     organization providing the operating funds is directly \n     involved in the day-to-day operations of the other \n     organization.\n       ``(B) Nonqualified church-controlled organizations.--\n     Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), for purposes of this \n     subsection and subsection (m), an organization that is a \n     nonqualified church-controlled organization shall be \n     aggregated with 1 or more other nonqualified church-\n     controlled organizations, or with an organization that is not \n     exempt from tax under section 501, and treated as a single \n     employer with such other organization, if at least 80 percent \n     of the directors or trustees of such other organization are \n     either representatives of, or directly or indirectly \n     controlled by, such nonqualified church-controlled \n     organization. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term \n     `nonqualified church-controlled organization' means a church-\n     controlled tax-exempt organization described in section \n     501(c)(3) that is not a qualified church-controlled \n     organization (as defined in section 3121(w)(3)(B)).\n       ``(C) Permissive aggregation among church-related \n     organizations.--The church or convention or association of \n     churches with which an organization described in subparagraph \n     (A) is associated (within the meaning of subsection \n     (e)(3)(D)), or an organization designated by such church or \n     convention or association of churches, may elect to treat \n     such organizations as a single employer for a plan year.

of this Act.\n       (b) Application of Contribution and Funding Limitations to \n     403(b) Grandfathered Defined Benefit Plans.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 251(e)(5) of the Tax Equity and \n     Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (Public Law 97-248), is \n     amended--\n       (A) by striking ``403(b)(2)'' and inserting ``403(b)'', and\n       (B) by inserting before the period at the end the \n     following: ``, and shall be subject to the applicable \n     limitations of section 415(b) of such Code as if it were a \n     defined benefit plan under section 401(a) of such Code (and \n     not to the limitations of section 415(c) of such Code).''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendments made by this subsection \n     shall apply to years beginning before, on, or after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Automatic Enrollment by Church Plans.--\n       (1) In general.--This subsection shall supersede any law of \n     a State that relates to wage, salary, or payroll payment, \n     collection, deduction, garnishment, assignment, or\n\n[[Page S8618]]\n\n     withholding which would directly or indirectly prohibit or \n     restrict the inclusion in any church plan (as defined in \n     section 414(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) of an \n     automatic contribution arrangement.\n       (2) Definition of automatic contribution arrangement.--For \n     purposes of this subsection, the term ``automatic \n     contribution arrangement'' means an arrangement--\n       (A) under which a participant may elect to have the plan \n     sponsor or the employer make payments as contributions under \n     the plan on behalf of the participant, or to the participant \n     directly in cash,\n       (B) under which a participant is treated as having elected \n     to have the plan sponsor or the employer make such \n     contributions in an amount equal to a uniform percentage of \n     compensation provided under the plan until the participant \n     specifically elects not to have such contributions made (or \n     specifically elects to have such contributions made at a \n     different percentage), and\n       (C) under which the notice and election requirements of \n     paragraph (3), and the investment requirements of paragraph \n     (4), are satisfied.\n       (3) Notice requirements.--\n       (A) In general.--The plan sponsor of, or plan administrator \n     or employer maintaining, an automatic contribution \n     arrangement shall, within a reasonable period before the \n     first day of each plan year, provide to each participant to \n     whom the arrangement applies for such plan year notice of the \n     participant's rights and obligations under the arrangement \n     which--\n       (i) is sufficiently accurate and comprehensive to apprise \n     the participant of such rights and obligations, and\n       (ii) is written in a manner calculated to be understood by \n     the average participant to whom the arrangement applies.\n       (B) Election requirements.--A notice shall not be treated \n     as meeting the requirements of subparagraph (A) with respect \n     to a participant unless--\n       (i) the notice includes an explanation of the participant's \n     right under the arrangement not to have elective \n     contributions made on the participant's behalf (or to elect \n     to have such contributions made at a different percentage),\n       (ii) the participant has a reasonable period of time, after \n     receipt of the explanation described in clause (i) and before \n     the first elective contribution is made, to make such \n     election, and\n       (iii) the notice explains how contributions made under the \n     arrangement will be invested in the absence of any investment \n     election by the participant.\n       (4) Default investment.--If no affirmative investment \n     election has been made with respect to any automatic \n     contribution arrangement, contributions to such arrangement \n     shall be invested in a default investment selected with the \n     care, skill, prudence, and diligence that a prudent person \n     selecting an investment option would use.\n       (5) Effective date.--This subsection shall take effect on \n     the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Allow Certain Plan Transfers and Mergers.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 414 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(z) Certain Plan Transfers and Mergers.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Under rules prescribed by the Secretary, \n     except as provided in paragraph (2), no amount shall be \n     includible in gross income by reason of--\n       ``(A) a transfer of all or a portion of the accrued benefit \n     of a participant or beneficiary, whether or not vested, from \n     a church plan that is a plan described in section 401(a) or \n     an annuity contract described in section 403(b) to an annuity \n     contract described in section 403(b), if such plan and \n     annuity contract are both maintained by the same church or \n     convention or association of churches,\n       ``(B) a transfer of all or a portion of the accrued benefit \n     of a participant or beneficiary from an annuity contract \n     described in section 403(b) to a church plan that is a plan \n     described in section 401(a) or an annuity contract described \n     in section 403(b), if such plan and annuity contract are both \n     maintained by the same church or convention or association of \n     churches, or\n       ``(C) a merger of a church plan that is a plan described in \n     section 401(a), or an annuity contract described in section \n     403(b) with an annuity contract described in section 403(b), \n     if such plan and annuity contract are both maintained by the \n     same church or convention or association of churches.\n       ``(2) Limitation.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a \n     transfer or merger unless the participant's or beneficiary's \n     total accrued benefit immediately after the transfer or \n     merger is equal to or greater than the participant's or \n     beneficiary's total accrued benefit immediately before the \n     transfer or merger, and such total accrued benefit is \n     nonforfeitable after the transfer or merger.\n       ``(3) Qualification.--A plan or annuity contract shall not \n     fail to be considered to be described in sections 401(a) or \n     403(b) merely because such plan or annuity contract engages \n     in a transfer or merger described in this subsection.\n       ``(4) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection:\n       ``(A) Church or convention or association of churches.--The \n     term `church or convention or association of churches' \n     includes an organization described in subparagraph (A) or \n     (B)(ii) of subsection (e)(3).\n       ``(B) Annuity contract.--The term `annuity contract' \n     includes a custodial account described in section 403(b)(7) \n     and a retirement income account described in section \n     403(b)(9).\n       ``(C) Accrued benefit.--The term `accrued benefit' means--\n       ``(i) in the case of a defined benefit plan, the employee's \n     accrued benefit determined under the plan, and\n       ``(ii) in the case of a plan other than a defined benefit \n     plan, the balance of the employee's account under the \n     plan.''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by this subsection \n     shall apply to transfers or mergers occurring after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act.\n       (e) Investments by Church Plans in Collective Trusts.--\n       (1) In general.--In the case of--\n       (A) a church plan (as defined in section 414(e) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986), including a plan described in \n     section 401(a) of such Code and a retirement income account \n     described in section 403(b)(9) of such Code, and\n       (B) an organization described in section 414(e)(3)(A) of \n     such Code the principal purpose or function of which is the \n     administration of such a plan or account,\n\n     the assets of such plan, account, or organization (including \n     any assets otherwise permitted to be commingled for \n     investment purposes with the assets of such a plan, account, \n     or organization) may be invested in a group trust otherwise \n     described in Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 81-100 \n     (as modified by Internal Revenue Service Revenue Rulings \n     2004-67, 2011-1, and 2014-24), or any subsequent revenue \n     ruling that supersedes or modifies such revenue ruling, \n

date.--This subsection shall apply to \n     investments made after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url":

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 333, submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 333) to direct the Senate Legal \n     Counsel to appear as amicus curiae in the name of the Senate \n     in Bank Markazi, The Central Bank of Iran v. Deborah D. \n     Peterson, et al. (S. Ct.)\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Supreme Court has taken up a case \npresenting the question whether a provision of the Iran Threat \nReduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, which provides terrorism \nvictims in the case of Peterson v. Islamic Republic of Iran, Case No. \n10 Civ. 4518, filed in the Southern District of New York, with the \nright, notwithstanding any other law, to obtain money damages for \nexisting judgments against Iran from certain Iranian bonds held in the \nUnited States, violates the separation of powers.\n  The plaintiffs here are victims and families of victims of Iran-\nsponsored terrorist attacks, including the 1983 Beirut Marine barracks \nbombing and the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing, who hold billions of \ndollars in unpaid compensatory damages judgments against Iran. In 2010, \nthey initiated an action in Federal court seeking turnover of $1.75 \nbillion in bond assets held by Citibank in New York, which through two \nforeign intermediary banks were ultimately owned by Bank Markazi, the \nCentral Bank of Iran, which is wholly owned by the Iranian Government.\n  Plaintiffs argued they were entitled to the assets under the \nTerrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, TRIA, which permits the \nsatisfaction of terrorism judgments from ``the blocked assets of any \nagency or instrumentality of th[e] terrorist party.'' Pub. L. No. 107-\n297, Sec. 201(a), 116 Stat. 2322, 2337. Bank Markazi argued the assets \nwere not subject to execution under TRIA because they were held on \nbehalf of intermediaries and therefore, under controlling state law, \nthose assets could not be considered Iran's property.\n  Against that backdrop and with plaintiffs' motion for seeking \nexecution pending, Congress enacted section 502 of the Iran Threat \nReduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012. 22 U.S.C. Sec. 8772. That \nstatute identified plaintiffs' case by name and docket number and \ndirected that, ``notwithstanding any other provision of law'' the \nassets ``shall be subject to execution or attachment in aid of \nexecution in order to satisfy any judgment to the extent of any \ncompensatory damages awarded against Iran.'' 22 U.S.C. Sec. 8772(a)(1), \n(b). It also expressly disclaimed any effect on ``any [other] \nproceedings.'' 22 U.S.C. Sec. 8772(c)(1). Before permitting execution \nagainst the assets, the statute required the court to determine both \nwhether Iran holds title or interest in the assets and whether any \n``other person possesses a constitutionally protected interest in the \nassets.'' 22 U.S.C. Sec. 8772(a)(2).\n  Bank Markazi challenged section 502 as unconstitutional for violating \nthe separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches \nexplicated in United States v. Klein, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 128 (1871), by \neffectively dictating the outcome of a single case. After making the \nstatutory determinations that Iran and only Iran held a beneficial \ninterest in the assets, the district court rejected Bank Markazi's \nconstitutional challenge. Peterson v. Islamic Republic of Iran, slip op \n(S.D.N.Y. March 13, 2013), 2013 WL 1155576. The court, noting it was \nrequired to determine whether Iran holds title or interest in the \nassets, as well as whether any other party holds a protected interest \nin the assets, held that ``[t]he statute does not itself `find' \nturnover required; such determination is specifically left to the \nCourt.'' Id. at 31.\n  On appeal, a unanimous Second Circuit panel affirmed. Peterson v. \nIslamic Republic of Iran, 758 F.3d 185 (2d Cir. 2014). The appellate \ncourt noted that ``while Klein illustrates that Congress may not \n`usurp[] the adjudicative function assigned to the federal courts,' \nlater cases have explained that Congress may `chang[e] the law \napplicable to pending cases,' even when the result under the revised \nlaw is clear.'' Id. at 191 (citations omitted).\n  Bank Markazi filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court. \nAfter calling for and receiving the views of the United States \nSolicitor General, who filed an opposition to certiorari defending the \nconstitutionality of section 502, the Supreme Court granted certiorari.\n  Title VII of the Ethics in Government Act authorizes the Senate to \nappear as an amicus curiae in any legal action in which the powers and \nresponsibilities of the Congress under the Constitution are placed in \nissue. Appearance as an amicus curiae in this case would enable the \nSenate to respond to Bank Markazi's contention that this law infringes \non the judiciary's constitutional power to decide cases and \ncontroversies and to present to the Court the basis for the Senate's \nconviction that the law is consistent with the Constitution.\n  This resolution would authorize the Senate legal counsel to appear in \nthis case in the Senate's name as amicus curiae to support the \nconstitutionality of the statute.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 333) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/senate-section/article/S8619-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR MONDAY, DECEMBER 14, 2015\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
