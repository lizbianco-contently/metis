Mr. President, as the Republican leader mentioned, last \nnight the Senate and House leaders finalized a bipartisan compromise \nthat keeps our government open and funded and extends important tax \npolicies for American families and businesses.\n  I said last night--define ``last night.'' The last email I got was \n2:45 this morning from my chief of staff, who was one of the \nnegotiators. Sometime in the darkness, the bill was finalized. When I \nsay ``the bill,'' it is really two bills--a bipartisan compromise keeps \nour doors opened and funded and extends important tax policies for \nAmerican businesses.\n  This was not an easy process. Members and our staffs worked intensely \nfor weeks to craft this agreement. As I mentioned yesterday and I say \nagain today, I appreciate the cooperation, expertise, and all the good \nwork done by Speaker Ryan, Leader Pelosi, Senator McConnell, and their \nstaffs. They were, I am told--and in all my dealings with them, I \nunderscore and underline what my chief of staff Drew Willison, chief \nnegotiator, said of the staff. They were a pleasure to work with. They \nwere professional and did exceptional work on the agreement that we \nreached.\n  It is a good compromise. The Presiding Officer, not being a longtime \nMember of Congress but a longtime legislator, knows that no legislation \nis perfect, but this is good legislation. This is truly a fine \ndefinition of legislation--the art of compromise. When we say \n``compromise,'' it doesn't mean anyone is doing away with their \nprinciples; what it simply means is that people can't be bullheaded and \nunreasonable in what they are doing to accomplish their goals.\n  In spite of Republican majorities in the Senate and the House, we \nDemocrats were able to ensure that this legislation creates and saves \nmiddle-class jobs, protects the environment, and invests in renewable \nenergy sources. For example, by extending tax incentives for wind, \nsolar, geothermal, and other technologies, the omnibus spending bill \nwill create and protect over 100,000 jobs in the clean energy sector. A \n5-year extension of wind and solar credits will promote growth and help \ncurb carbon emission by roughly 25 percent by the year 2020. And to \nthose who will argue that lifting the oil export ban will counteract \nthese important steps to limit pollution, that is simply not the case. \nIt is not true. Extending the wind and solar tax incentives will \neliminate over 10 times more carbon emissions than lifting the oil \nexport ban will create.\n  The omnibus spending bill is good for jobs, and good for clean energy \nand the environment. It also helps American families by including a \nprovision that will lower health insurance premiums.\n  To fully appreciate the compromise, we can't simply tick off the many \nbeneficial policies the agreement includes. We must also consider that \nmany troublesome provisions the Democrats fought to exclude didn't wind \nup in the legislation. When this matter came from the House, there were \nmore than 200 so-called riders, and they didn't wind up in the bill. \nMany of these riders represented the worst of legislative priorities: \nweaken Dodd-Frank banking regulations; undermine the Department of \nLabor's fiduciary rule; roll back the National Labor Relations Board's \njoint employer standard; eliminate protections for clean air, water, \nland, and climate; weaken the consumer protection bureau's ability to \nprotect consumers; curb the President's powers under the Antiquities \nAct to create national monuments; and destroy the candidate \ncontribution limits. These are only a few of the many special riders \nthat were sent to us from the House, and we did not allow 99 percent of \nthese to be included because they are harmful policies.\n  I say again, this compromise isn't perfect, but it is good. It is \ngood for the American people. And if it weren't for Democratic efforts, \nit would have been a lot worse.\n  I also extend my appreciation to the great staff of the White House--\nfirst of all, the President's Chief of Staff, Denis McDonough. He is a \nformer college football player, he is a strong man emotionally and \nphysically, and he is very forthright, which I appreciate in the \npositions that he takes with everybody. He helped guide this \nlegislation through.\n  We have a number of people who work at the White House with whom we \nworked intensely. All the Cabinet officers--we had a very good \nrelationship with Brian Deese, who is a jack-of-all-trades at the White \nHouse and does so much in many different areas. I appreciate very much \nhis involvement in many different ways.\n  Longtime Senate employee Katie Beirne Fallon has been available \nanytime we needed her, and this has been very difficult for her because \nshe is a new mom to two little twins. She was always available. We were \ndisappointed when she went to the White House from the Senate, but her \nknowledge of the Senate has been helpful in our being able to move this \nbill as far as it has been.\n  A longtime staffer who operated on the floor here for many, many \nyears was Marty Paone, who was available whenever we needed him. He is \na fine man. We still miss him here in the Senate. He does such a great \njob for the country and the Senate.\n  We must pass the legislation, as the Republican leader said, as \nquickly as we can. Christmas is fast approaching. I hope Republicans in \nthe House and the Senate will move quickly to move this legislation to \nthe floor so we can vote on it and give the American people every \nconfidence their government will remain open.\n  Would the Presiding Officer state what the Senate will be doing the \nrest of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/senate-section/article/S8690-5", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Through all these challenges, though, our \npublic servants, particularly our Federal employees, with little \nrecognition and less fanfare work through these ups and downs to \nimprove Americans' lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/senate-section/article/S8691-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO FEDERAL EMPLOYEES\n\n\n                            Kevin Stricklin\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, since 2010, I have come to the Senate \nfloor on an occasional basis to honor exemplary Federal employees, a \ntradition started by my friend, the former Senator from Delaware Ted \nKaufman. Today I am going to continue that tradition as we get to the \nclose of this year.\n  I am pleased to honor a great Federal employee, Kevin Stricklin, who \nalso happens to be a Virginian. As the administrator for coal at the \nMine Safety and Health Administration, Mr. Stricklin leads a team that \nenforces safety rules, improves industry compliance, and executes \nrescue and recovery operations.\n  On his watch, the number of coal miners who died in accidents last \nyear, 16, while still too high, was the lowest ever recorded in the \nhistory of the United States. In addition, the number of mines with \nchronic violations dropped from 51 in 2010 to 12 in 2014, and the \nnumber of citations against mines fell from more than 96,000 in 2010 to \nless than 63,000 in 2014, even as inspections increased.\n  After the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster in 2010, Mr. Stricklin was \nat the frontlines of implementing reforms to improve mine safety, \nincluding quarterly inspections, surprise inspections for repeat \nviolators, and a program that identifies habitual safety lapses.\n  When accidents have occurred, Mr. Stricklin's creativity and calm \nunder pressure have saved countless lives. In a 2002 accident, a \nPennsylvania coal mine flooded, trapping nine miners. Mr. Stricklin and \nhis team devised a plan to drill a 6\\1/2\\-inch hole and inject \ncompressed air into it. Their plan provided oxygen to the miners and \nprevented the water level from rising any further. The miners survived \nand were hoisted to the surface using a capsule the team helped design.\n  Following a 2006 accident in West Virginia, rescuers' efforts were \nimpeded by limitations in communicating over long distances. The \nprotocol at that time was 1,000 feet. The team's solution was to \ndevelop a wireless fiber-optic system that extended communication up to \n5 miles. Mr. Stricklin and his team improved the standard by more than \n26 times.\n  Like so many other Federal employees, they went above and beyond \nbecause it was in the country's best interest, not because they \nexpected praise or recognition. Mr. Stricklin, whose two grandfathers \nand father were all coal miners, describes his objective as being ``for \neach miner to go home as safe and as healthy at the end of the day as \nthey started at the beginning of the day.''\n  I am proud to rise today to recognize Mr. Stricklin's dedication to \npublic safety and commitment to public service. I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in thanking him, his team, and, frankly, during the \nholiday season, all Federal Government employees at all levels of \nservice to our country for their contributions and hard work.\n  As we go through these final days of debate--and hopefully, as I said \nat the outset, we will get a chance to spend time with our families \nover the holidays--I do think it is important that we also take a \nmoment to reflect on the close to 2 million civilian Federal employees \nwho serve our Nation in so many ways each and every day without \nfanfare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to complete two sets of remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last night after months of discussion and \nseveral weeks of intense negotiations, bipartisan leaders from both the \nHouse and the Senate reached an agreement on both the substance and a \nprocedural path forward for legislation that will provide millions of \nAmerican families and businesses with much needed tax relief and set \nthe stage for comprehensive tax reform in the future.\n  The bill, which we are calling the Protecting Americans from Tax \nHikes Act--or PATH Act--of 2015, would make a number of temporary tax \nprovisions permanent, putting an end to the repeated tax extenders \nexercise that has plagued Congress for decades and giving greater \ncertainty to U.S. taxpayers across the board.\n  There are no two ways about it; this is a historic bill. It is \nactually the latest in a long line of historic bills we have considered \nin the Senate this year, and it has quite a bit in common with some of \nthe other efforts we have tackled in 2015.\n  For example, for many years now, much of what we have done in \nCongress has been dictated by the next deadline, cliff or crisis around \nthe corner. More often than not, the tendency has been to simply kick \nevery can down the road and then give speeches about why we shouldn't \ndo that anymore. This year the Senate has worked to end the practice of \ngoverning by crisis.\n  Among other things, we have passed bipartisan legislation to repeal \nand replace the Medicare sustainable growth rate, or SGR, formula and \nto provide long-term funding for highway and infrastructure projects. \nBoth of these issues had plagued Congress for decades, with permanent \nor long-term fixes seemingly always out of reach, regularly \ndemonstrating that Congress was too divided and too ineffective to \nreach any meaningful solutions.\n  The same could be said for tax extenders, which has been an almost \nyearly exercise in relative futility, characterized by partisan \nbickering as the deadlines approach, with short-term extensions enacted \nat the last minute, leaving no one--certainly not American taxpayers--\nfeeling better in the end. Yet, with the PATH Act, as with the SGR and \nhighway funding bills, we have been able to reach a bipartisan \nagreement that would effectively end this cycle.\n  We have to pass it. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, 52 \nseparate tax provisions--what we typically refer to as extenders--\nexpired at the end of 2014. That is 52 separate provisions that, on a \nrelatively frequent basis, face expiration and require us to reach \nagreements on further extensions. Our bill would reduce that number \ndown to 33 provisions--still far too many--but a significant relief in \nterms of ongoing extenders pressure.\n  Most importantly, the bill makes permanent many of the most \nconsequential extenders provisions, the ones that tend to drive the \ncrisis-and-cliff mentality when it comes to tax extenders, further \nrelieving the pressure and allowing Congress to function more \neffectively.\n  By adding more permanence to the Tax Code, we will allow families and \nbusinesses to better plan for the future. In addition, we will adjust \nthe tax and revenue baseline to make conditions vastly more favorable \nfor comprehensive tax reform in the future, a major priority for \nmembers of both parties.\n  Most importantly, passing this legislation and making more tax \npolicies permanent will provide significant tax relief for hardworking \ntaxpayers in every walk of American life, from the middle class to \nmilitary families to the working poor. It will do the same for \nbusinesses and job creators throughout our country, resulting in a \nhealthier U.S. economy, increased growth, and more American jobs.\n  Put simply, more permanence in the Tax Code will be a good thing for \nour\n\n[[Page S8692]]\n\ncountry, and the PATH Act will provide just the kind of permanence we \nneed.\n  Let's take a few minutes to look at some of the key provisions of \nthis legislation. I will start by talking about some of the biggest \npriorities that my friends on the other side of the aisle brought into \nthe recent negotiations.\n  As we all remember, President Obama's so-called stimulus included \nprovisions that made some of the biggest refundable tax credits in the \nTax Code even more refundable, including the earned-income tax credit, \nor EITC, and the child tax credit, or CTC. These increased credits--\nwhich, when boiled down, are essentially additional cash payments made \ndirectly from the government to an individual filing a tax return--were \noriginally designed to be temporary and have had to be extended a \nnumber of times over the years.\n  Going into these negotiations, Democrats essentially demanded that \nthe enhancements for the EITC and CTC, along with a partially \nrefundable college tax credit that was also created in the stimulus, be \nmade permanent.\n  As you might expect, Republicans were reluctant to go down that road, \nnot because we don't want to help families who benefit from these \ncredits but because we know refundable credits are particularly \nsusceptible to error, fraud, and overpayment. These types of improper \npayments are well documented, particularly with regard to the EITC, \nwhere every year we lose tens of billions of dollars to either \ndeception or bureaucratic mistakes. However, we opted to accept making \nthese credits permanent because doing so allowed the negotiations to \nmove forward. But we did demand--and the Democrats agreed--to include \nsignificant provisions to improve the program's integrity with regard \nto these credits in order to reduce improper payments going forward. In \nfact, if enacted, the program integrity provisions in this bill will be \nthe most robust improvements to address waste, fraud, and abuse of the \nTax Code in nearly 20 years. Essentially, this compromise of refundable \ncredits was the very definition of a win-win situation, particularly \nwhen you consider the other provisions that have been included in this \nlegislation as a result, and we really never did this before. We all \nknew there was fraud.\n\n  With this bill, we will be able to secure key incentives for economic \ngrowth. For example, the bill makes permanent section 179, small \nbusiness expensing, which allows small businesses--the drivers of \nAmerican job creation--to grow and invest with more immediate tax \nbenefits. This has been a top priority for many Members of Congress, \nnot to mention virtually everyone in the business community.\n  The PATH Act will also improve and make permanent the research and \ndevelopment tax credit, the vital tax provision for companies and \nindustries that thrive on innovation and research--areas where the \nUnited States continues to lead the world. This has been something I \nhave fought for every year--year after year after year. We have always \ngotten it, but it has never really worked as well as it should because \nthere was no permanence to it. Now it will be permanent, and that is a \ngreat step forward.\n  Our bill also extends the term for bonus depreciation, giving more \ncompanies greater incentives to invest in assets that will help their \nbusinesses grow and expand. This, too, has been a longtime priority for \nthe business community and many Members of Congress. While we were not \nable to make it permanent, we did improve and extend this important tax \nincentive.\n  The bill will also make key improvements to make America more \ncompetitive on the world stage. For example, it permanently extends the \nactive financing exception, or AFE, from subpart F income, and it \nprovides a 5-year extension for the controlled foreign corporation, or \nCFC, look-through provision. Both of these tax provisions give American \ncompanies owned by American stockholders and employing American workers \na greater ability to compete internationally. This is important if, \nlike me, you want to see U.S. companies remain U.S. companies.\n  In addition to these top priorities for businesses and job creators \nin the United States, the PATH Act would provide significant tax relief \nfor families. The bill makes permanent the deduction for State and \nlocal sales taxes. It makes permanent the low-income military housing \ncredit and the employer wage credit for Active-Duty military employees. \nIt provides a long-term extension and an expansion of eligibility for \nwork opportunity tax credits. All of these provisions benefit American \nfamilies in various regions under a number of different circumstances. \nOur legislation will ensure that millions of Americans who benefit from \nthese tax provisions will be able to rely on and plan around them well \ninto the future--not a bad result, if you can ask me.\n  I am not done yet. In addition to the many benefits we will provide \nto families and businesses, the PATH Act will also give significant tax \nrelief to charities. It would, for example, make sure that charitable \ndistributions from IRAs remain tax-free on a permanent basis, and the \ncharitable deduction for contributions of food inventory would also be \nmade permanent under the bill, as would the provision that incentivizes \nS corporations to make charitable contributions of property.\n  I have covered quite a bit of ground here, and I am really only going \nthrough the highlights. I haven't even gotten to the ObamaCare \nprovisions yet.\n  As we negotiated this legislation, the most difficult part was \nprobably dealing with the rumor mill, which I suppose was not \nunexpected. Most of the really outrageous rumors we heard during this \nprocess dealt with provisions of the so-called Affordable Care Act. \nPeople were claiming that Senate Republicans had agreed to bail out the \nObamaCare Risk Corridor Program in order to get a deal. We heard that \nthere was an agreement to provide tax relief to prop up the failing \nObamaCare exchanges. But, of course, none of these rumors were true. \nThis exercise in tax permanence was never going to be used to solidify \nObamaCare, and Republicans never for a second considered allowing that \nto happen.\n  However, because many Democrats have begun to recognize some of the \nmore problematic elements of the President's health law, we agreed on \nthe need to suspend one of the more harmful taxes imposed under \nObamaCare. The bill includes a 2-year moratorium on the medical device \ntax--one of the more unpopular and poorly drafted taxes included in the \nhealth law that has in recent years drawn the ire of Republicans and \nDemocrats alike. This moratorium is important not only because it \ndemonstrates the bipartisan opposition to the tax, but because it will \nhelp patients and consumers throughout the country who have seen their \nhealth care costs go up because of the medical device tax. I have been \na particular advocate to get rid of that lousy tax, and we are \nultimately going to get rid of it, but at least we are rid of it for \nthe next 2 years. We will see what happens in those 2 years.\n  When all is said and done, this legislation provides roughly $650 \nbillion in tax relief over the next 10 years for families, job \ncreators, and others. That is real money that will help millions of \npeople and provide real growth for our economy. That is the real value \nof greater permanence in our Tax Code and is the biggest reason we need \nto pass this legislation.\n  Don't get me wrong: I don't believe this is a perfect bill by any \nmeans. It is not even close to perfect. As I have grown fond of saying, \nif we were living in the United States of Orrin Hatch, this legislation \nwould look a lot different. Although it pains me to admit sometimes, \nthat is not where we live. Here in the real world, any undertaking \nworth the effort is going to require compromise. I know I say that a \nlot. In fact, I probably said something about the importance of \ncompromise and learning the art of the doable every time we have \nconsidered a high-profile piece of legislation this year, but that does \nnot make my arguments any less true.\n  This is a good bill, period. Anyone, if they are so inclined, could \ncling to the parts they don't like and make excuses to vote no. Taken \nas a whole, both parties should be able to support the overall package \nwe put together, and without question, every one of us should welcome \nthe positive impact this bill will have on our economy and our future \nlegislative efforts here in the Congress.\n\n[[Page S8693]]\n\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support the PATH Act and provide real \ntax relief at this critical time.\n  Before I close, I just have to note that a lot of work has gone into \nthis legislation. Every provision of this bill has had a number of \nchampions in the Congress who have worked for years to preserve and \nenhance these provisions in the hopes of eventually making them \npermanent. I want to acknowledge some of those efforts here today, \nparticularly those of my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee. \nFor example, the deduction for State and local sales taxes, which this \nbill makes permanent, has had a number of champions on both sides of \nthe aisle. In our committee, Senators Enzi, Cornyn, Thune, and Heller \nhave all made this issue a priority, and our legislation will ensure \nthat their work pays off.\n\n  Another one of the more significant tax provisions this bill would \nmake permanent is the research and development tax credit. This has \nbeen a top priority of mine for many years, and Senators Cornyn, Crapo, \nand Roberts have also played leading rolls in this effort over the \nyears.\n  Section 179, small business expensing, will also be made permanent \nunder this bill, and Senators Toomey, Roberts, Thune, Portman, and \nIsakson have all been leaders on this issue for many years.\n  The bill would also make permanent the accelerated 15-year \ndepreciation for restaurants and retail, a provision that Senators \nBurr, Cornyn, Crapo, Heller, Isakson, Roberts, and Portman have all \nworked long and hard to keep in place. Of course, I could always add my \nown name to every one of these.\n  In addition, Senator Enzi has been a big supporter of making the \nactive financing exception, or AFE, permanent. Our bill, once again, \naccomplishes this goal.\n  On the charitable side, Senator Roberts has been a strong supporter \nof the S corporation basis adjustment for charitable contributions and \nthe charitable deduction for food inventory contributions, both of \nwhich will be made permanent by passing this bill.\n  Senator Thune has also been a leader with regard to the food \ninventory deduction, and he has also worked to ensure that charitable \ndistributions from IRAs remain tax-free--another permanent provision in \nthe PATH Act and something all Republicans support.\n  Senator Heller has championed the special rules for real property \ncontributions made for conservation purposes--yet another item our bill \nmakes permanent.\n  The deduction for teacher classroom expenses is also made permanent \nin this bill. Senator Burr has been a strong supporter of that \nprovision and deserves a lot of credit for it.\n  In addition, the PATH Act will make the low-income housing tax credit \npermanent--something both Senator Roberts and Senator Crapo have worked \non for some time.\n  All of the people I have mentioned have been very active Members on \nthe Republican side.\n  Senator Portman has pushed to extend the work opportunity tax credit \nand to expand it to include the long-term unemployed. His proposed \nmodification is included in our bill, as is an unprecedented 5-year \nextension for this credit.\n  Thanks, Senator Portman. We appreciate your work on this.\n  We have seen him work so hard on so many of these issues. We are \ngrateful for him, and I am really grateful to have all of these people \non my committee helping out.\n  Of course, this is not an exhaustive list. Right now I am focusing \nmainly on temporary provisions that we will make permanent by passing \nthe PATH Act. If I start talking about my various colleagues' efforts \non shorter term extensions in the bill, we would be here all day.\n  I do, however, also want to give credit where it is due on the \nObamaCare provisions. For years now, opposition to the misguided \nmedical device tax--that is the most charitable description of that tax \nyou will ever hear from me--has been gaining momentum. Throughout that \ntime, Senators Toomey, Burr, and Coats have worked very hard on the \nFinance Committee to push for a repeal. As I noted earlier, our bill \nwould take a significant step forward in this effort by imposing a 2-\nyear moratorium on this job-killing tax.\n  I might add that I haven't mentioned my colleagues on the other side, \nbut certainly Amy Klobuchar has stood right with me, as have so many on \nthe other side of the aisle as well, in getting rid of that tax. It is \nonly for 2 years, but ultimately we are going to get rid of it \ncompletely, and we have to do that.\n  Let me just say that it is a pleasure for me to work with Senator \nWyden, the ranking member. He has worked with us on many of these \nissues, and so have others on the Democratic side of the aisle, but the \nleadership on many of these issues has come from these people I have \nmentioned, and I want to make sure the people who are listening will \nunderstand this.\n  As one can see, the PATH Act reflects the efforts and priorities of \nmany Members of the Senate--not just members of the Finance Committee \nbut Members on both sides on some of these very important issues, as \nthey would have to be. I thank my Democratic friends for helping.\n  As the debate on this important bill begins in earnest, I am \nparticularly grateful for the work my colleagues on the Finance \nCommittee have put in to advance the interests of their constituents. \nEach of our Members has put a huge stamp on this legislation, and with \na little luck and a handful more votes, their work will be permanently \nenshrined in the Tax Code, and that is no small achievement after all \nof these years of trying to make some of these provisions permanent.\n  There are, of course, others who have also worked hard on various \nparts of this bill. Virtually every Senator--or at the very least every \nSenator's constituents--has high-priority items included in this bill. \nThat is a big reason why it is important that we get this done for the \nAmerican people.\n  Again, I am happy to bring together both Democrats and Republicans on \nthis important set of tax changes that is long overdue. I am very \npleased to work with my Democratic colleagues as well, many of whom \ndeserve credit. Being in the majority, we had to have the efforts of \nthese Republican people whom I have been praising here today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/senate-section/article/S8693-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8693-S8694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING NATHAN GRAHAM\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a beloved Utahn \nwho was taken years before his time--Nathan Graham. Nate was not only a \ncelebrated member of the tightly knit community of Utahns here in \nWashington but was also a well-respected former staffer of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Tragically, at the young age of 37, Nate was struck by a random \ninfection and passed away unexpectedly while on a business trip to \nChina last week. Although he is no longer with us, the great love he \nshared with others remains in our hearts.\n  Born in Layton, UT, Nate graduated from Northridge High School before \nstudying political science at Weber State University and moving to \nWashington, DC. From 2003 to 2009, he served as a legislative assistant \nfor my friend and former colleague Senator Robert F. Bennett. Nate was \nSenator Bennett's key staffer on the Transatlantic Policy Network--a \ngroup that includes U.S. and European elected officials as well as \nbusiness, policy, and academic leaders in Europe and the United States.\n  As a military legislative assistant, Nate also worked closely with \ncombat leaders at Utah's military installations, including Hill Air \nForce Base, the Dugway Proving Ground, and the Utah Test and Training \nRange. In this capacity, he also advanced Senator Bennett's priorities \non the Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and \nRelated Programs. The Senator's agenda included increasing funding for \nmicrofinance programs, strengthening the Millennium Challenge \nCorporation, and working to acquire the F-35 aircraft at Hill Air Force \nBase. As Senator Bennett's trusted adviser, he accompanied the Senator \nto Europe several times for TPN business and meetings. He also traveled \nto Egypt, Taiwan, and China in support of Senator Bennett's work on \nforeign policy.\n  Nate's trademark humility endeared him to all. He never thought \nhimself above anyone else, and he was always helpful and kind to \neveryone, regardless of status or position. Nate even\n\n[[Page S8694]]\n\nhad a special reputation as a mentor to Senator Bennett's junior staff. \nHe looked out for young staffers just starting their careers and \nactively searched out new experiences for their professional \ndevelopment.\n  Following his time in the Senate, Nate entered the private sector, \naccepting a position with Procter & Gamble as their senior manager for \nglobal government relations and public policy.\n  Although Nate never worked for me directly, he was a gifted public \nservant whose contributions were highly regarded across the entire Utah \ndelegation and by me personally. Speaking to Nate's character, Senator \nBennett--who is going through his own personal battle with cancer right \nnow--sent me the following note over the weekend:\n\n       Nate Graham was a valued and much-loved member of my staff \n     who was on track for great success in life, both \n     professionally and with his beautiful family. This is a \n     terrible tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers are with his \n     family. We will miss him terribly.\n\n  While Nate was working for Senator Bennett, he met and fell in love \nwith his sweetheart and eternal companion, Melanie Mickelson. I know \nBob was delighted when he could be a matchmaker for some of his \nstaffers.\n  In addition to Melanie, Nate is survived by their four sons: Rowen, \nJames, Lincoln, and Griffin--who was born just 2 months ago. Nate was \nan active member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, \nhaving served an LDS mission in Honduras and Belize. Just 6 weeks \nbefore he passed away, he was released as the bishop of a local \ncongregation in Arlington, VA, where he built a reputation for \nfostering a community of love and friendship.\n  A tidal wave of support has washed over the Graham family in the wake \nof Nate's passing. In just a few days, friends and neighbors have \nalready raised nearly $100,000 in a crowdfunding effort to support this \nfamily.\n  I wish to close with the words of the Scottish poet Henry Francis \nLyte, from his hymn, ``Abide With Me,'' which he wrote on his deathbed \nin 1847. This song is well beloved across the LDS community. It offers \ncomfort and peace amid the sadness of loss:\n\n     I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;\n     Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness;\n     Where is death's sting?\n     Where, grave, thy victory?\n     I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.\n\n  We believe Nate now abides in a holier place. His family is in our \nthoughts just as they are in our prayers. May God comfort them, and may \nHe comfort all of us as we mourn the loss of an exceptional friend, \nfather, and husband.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/senate-section/article/S8694-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8694-S8697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RUSSIAN ROCKET ENGINES POLICY PROVISION\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to call attention, sadly, to the \ntriumph of pork-barrel parochialism in this year's Omnibus \nappropriations bill--in particular, a policy provision that was \nairdropped into this bill, in direct contravention to the National \nDefense Authorization Act, which will have U.S. taxpayers subsidize \nRussian aggression and ``comrade'' capitalism.\n  Nearly 2 years ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin, furious that \nthe Ukrainian people had ousted a pro-Moscow stooge, invaded Ukraine \nand annexed Crimea. It is the first time since the days of Hitler and \nStalin that brute force has been projected across an internationally \nrecognized border to dismember a sovereign state on the European \nContinent. More than 8,000 people have died in this conflict, including \n298 innocent people aboard Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 who were \nmurdered by Vladimir Putin's loyal supporters with weapons that \nVladimir Putin had supplied them.\n  Putin's imperialist campaign in Eastern Europe forced a recognition, \nfor anyone who was not yet convinced, that we are confronting a \nchallenge that many had assumed was resigned to the history books: a \nstrong, militarily capable Russian Government that is hostile to our \ninterests and our values and seeks to challenge the international order \nthat American leaders of both parties have sought to maintain since the \nend of World War II.\n  That is why the Congress imposed tough sanctions against Russia, \nespecially against Putin's cronies and their enormously corrupt \nbusiness empire. As part of that effort, Congress passed the National \nDefense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2015, which restricted the Air \nForce from using Russian-made RD-180 rocket engines for national \nsecurity space launches--engines that are manufactured by a Russian \ncompany controlled by some of Putin's top cronies. We did so not only \nbecause our Nation should not rely on Russia to access space but \nbecause it is simply immoral to help subsidize Russia's intervention in \nUkraine and line the pockets of Putin's gang of thugs who profit from \nthe sale of Russian rocket engines.\n  Last year the Defense authorization bill exempted five of the engines \nthat United Launch Alliance purchased before the invasion of Ukraine. \nThis allowed ULA, the space launch company that for years has enjoyed a \nmonopoly on launching military satellites, to use those Russian rocket \nengines if the Secretary of Defense determined it was necessitated by \nnational security.\n  Since the passage of the act in the Senate 89 to 11, Russia has \ncontinued--as we all know--to destabilize Ukraine and menace our NATO \nallies in Europe with aggressive military behavior. Putin has sent \nadvanced weapons to Iran, violated the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear \nForce Treaty. In a profound echo of the Cold War, Russia has intervened \nmilitarily in Syria on behalf of the murderous regime of Bashar Assad. \nClearly, Russian behavior has only gotten worse.\n  That is why a few weeks ago Congress acted again and passed the \nNational Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2016. The NDAA \nauthorized $300 million in security assistance and intelligence support \nfor Ukraine to resist Russian aggression. At the same time, the bill \nrecognized that a small number of Russian engines could be needed--\ncould be needed to maintain competition in the National Security Space \nLaunch Program and facilitate a smooth transition to rockets with \nengines made in the United States. Therefore, the legislation allowed \nULA to use a total of nine Russian engines. The fiscal year 2016 \nDefense authorization bill, including its provision limiting the use of \nRussian rocket engines, was debated for months. For months the issue \nwas debated. The Committee on Armed Services had a vigorous debate on \nthis important issue. An amendment was offered to maintain the \nrestriction on the Air Force's use of Russian rocket engines. In a \npositive vote of the committee, the amendment was adopted.\n  We then considered hundreds of amendments to this bill on the Senate \nfloor over a period of 2 weeks. For 2 weeks we literally considered \nhundreds of amendments, and we did so transparently, with an open \nprocess which was a credit, frankly, to both sides. There was not one \namendment that was called up to change the provision of that \nauthorization bill concerning the RD-180 rocket engines. The \nlegislation passed with 71 votes.\n  Then, because of a misguided Presidential veto, this defense \nlegislation was actually considered a second time on the floor and it \npassed 91 to 3. I want to reemphasize, one of the things I was proud of \nfor years is that we do debate the Senate Armed Services national \ndefense authorization bill. We have done so every year for some 43 \nyears, and passed it, and had the President sign it. We open it to all \namendments, but there was no amendment on rocket engines proposed on \nthe floor of the Senate. Why wasn't it? If there were Members of the \nSenate who did not like the provisions in the bill, we had an open \nprocess to amend it, but they didn't. They didn't because they knew \nthey could not pass an amendment that would remove that provision in \nthe Defense Authorization Act. So now in the dead of night we just \nfound out, hours before we are supposed to vote, that they put in a \nrestriction which dramatically changes that provision that was done in \nan open and transparent process. To their everlasting shame, in the \ndark of night, not\n\n[[Page S8695]]\n\na vote--not a vote--no one consulted on the Armed Services Committee.\n  The fiscal year 2016 bill, including its provision limiting the use \nof Russian rocket engines, was debated for months. The committee had a \nvigorous debate, as I mentioned. Here is my point. The Senate had this \ndebate. We had ample time and opportunity to have this debate. Through \nmonths of this fulsome debate, no Senator came to the Senate floor to \nmake the case that we needed to buy more Russian rocket engines, no \nSenator introduced an amendment on the floor to lift the restriction on \nbuying more Russian rocket engines. To the contrary, the Senate and the \nfull Congress, including the House of Representatives, voted \noverwhelmingly and repeatedly to maintain this restriction. This is a \npolicy issue, not a money issue--nowhere in the realm of the \nAppropriations Committee. It was resolved, as it should have been, on \nthe defense policy bill.\n  Here we stand with a 2,000-page Omnibus appropriations bill crafted \nin secret. Members outside of the Appropriations Committee were not \nbrought into the formulation of this legislation. There was no debate. \nMost of us are seeing this bill for the first time this morning, and \nburied within it is a policy provision that would effectively allow \nunlimited purchases and use of--guess what--Russian rocket engines.\n  What is going on here? ULA wants more Russian engines, plain and \nsimple. That is why ULA recently asked the Defense Department to waive \nthe NDAA's previous restriction on the basis of national security and \nlet it use a Russian engine for the first competitive national security \nspace launch. The Defense Department declined.\n  So what did ULA do when it couldn't get its way? It manufactured a \ncrisis. Though the Department of Defense is restricted in using these \nRussian rocket engines, there is no similar restriction on NASA or \ncommercial space launches. So ULA rushed to assign the RD-180s--the \nrocket engines--that it had in its inventory to these nonnational \nsecurity launches, despite the fact that there is no restriction on the \nuse of Russian engines for those launches. This artificial crisis has \nnow been seized on by ULA's Capitol Hill leading sponsors; namely, the \nsenior Senator from Alabama, Senator Shelby, and the senior Senator \nfrom Illinois, Senator Durbin, to overturn the NDAA's restriction, and \nthat is exactly what they have done--again, secretly, nontransparently, \nas part of this massive 2,000-page Omnibus appropriations bill.\n  As I said, neither Senator Shelby nor Senator Durbin, nor any other \nSenator, raised objections to the provisions of the bill or offered any \nalternative during the authorization process on the Senate floor. That \nis a repudiation of the rights of every single Senator in this body who \nis not a Member of the Appropriations Committee.\n  In fact, as I have said, when this issue was debated and voted on in \nthe Committee on Armed Services, the authorizing committee of \njurisdiction voted in favor of maintaining the restriction. Instead, my \ncolleagues on the Appropriations Committee crafted a provision in \nsecret, with no debate, to overturn the will of the Senate as expressed \nin two National Defense Authorization Acts. The result will enable a \nmonopolistic corporation to send potentially hundreds of millions of \ndollars to Vladimir Putin and his corrupt cronies and deepen America's \nreliance on these thugs for our military's access to space.\n  This is outrageous and it is shameful. It is the height of hypocrisy, \nespecially from my colleagues who claim to care about the plight of \nUkraine and the need to punish Russia for its aggression.\n  How can our government tell European countries and governments that \nthey need to hold the line on maintaining sanctions on Russia, which is \nfar harder for them to do than for us, when we are getting our own \npolicy in this way? We are gutting our own policy. How can we tell our \nFrench allies, in particular, that they should not sell Vladimir Putin \namphibious assault ships, as we have, and then turn around and try to \nbuy rocket engines from Putin's cronies? Again, this is the height of \nhypocrisy. Since March of 2014, my colleagues in the Senate have tried \nto do everything we can to give our friends in Ukraine the tools they \nneed to defend themselves and their country from Russian aggression. \nRather than furthering that noble cause, Senator Shelby and Senator \nDurbin have chosen to reward Vladimir Putin and his cronies with a \nwindfall of hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  A rocket factory in Alabama may benefit from this provision. Boeing, \nheadquartered in Illinois, may benefit from this decision. But have no \ndoubt, the real winners today are Vladimir Putin and his gang of thugs \nrunning the Russian military industrial complex. I wish that Senator \nShelby and Senator Durbin would explain to the American taxpayer \nexactly whom we are doing business with. They will not. But my \ncolleagues need to know.\n  Let me explain. At least one news organization has investigated how \nmuch the Air Force pays for these RD-180 rocket engines, how much the \nRussians receive, and whether members of the elite in Putin's Russia \nhave secretly profited by inflating the price. In an investigative \nseries entitled ``Comrade Capitalism,'' Reuters exposed the role that \nsenior Russian politicians and Putin's close friends, including persons \nsanctioned over Ukraine, have played in the company called NPO \nEnergomash, which manufactures the RD-180. According to Reuters, a \nRussian audit of that company found that it had been operating at a \nloss because funds were, ``being captured by unnamed offshore \nintermediary companies.''\n  In addition, the Reuters investigation also reported that NPO \nEnergomash sells its rocket engines to ULA through another company \ncalled RD Amross, a tiny five-person outfit that stood to collect about \n$93 million in cost markups under a multiyear deal to supply these \nengines. The Defense Contract Management Agency found that in one \ncontract alone, RD Amross did ``no or negligible'' work but still \ncollected $80 million in ``unallowable excessive pass-through \ncharges.''\n  Now, remember my friends, that is a five-person outfit--five persons. \nThe Defense Contract Management Agency found that in one contract they \ncollected $80 million in unallowable, excessive passthrough charges. My \nfriends, thanks to this amendment, that is who is going to continue to \nreceive this money.\n  According to University of Baltimore School of Law professor Charles \nTiefer, who reviewed Reuters documents, ``The bottom line is that the \njoint venture between the Russians and Americans is taking us to the \ncleaners.'' He said that he had reviewed Pentagon audits critical of \nIraq war contracts, but those ``didn't come anywhere near to how \nstrongly negative'' the RD Amross audit was.\n  My colleagues, we have to do better. We have to do better than this. \nSome may say that we need to buy rocket engines from Putin's cronies in \nRussia. In particular, they will cite a letter from the Department of \nDefense, in response to a list of leading questions from the \nAppropriations Committee just a few days ago, which they will claim as \nconfirmation that the Department believes the United States will not \nhave a domestically manufactured replacement engine for defense space \nlaunches before 2022.\n  Of course, that is nonsense. When the Department of Defense starts \nmaking predictions beyond its 5-year budget plan, what I hear is ``This \nisn't a priority'' or ``We don't really know.'' Either way, this is \nunacceptable. Both the authorizers and the appropriators have ramped up \nfunding for the development of a new domestically manufactured engine. \nThe Pentagon needs to do what it has failed to do for 8 years: Make \nthis a priority.\n  Indeed, American companies have already said that they could have a \nreplacement engine ready before 2022. Our money and attention should be \nfocused on meeting this goal, not on subsidizing Putin's defense \nindustry. Proponents of more Russian rocket engines will also cite \nclaims by the Air Force that ULA needs at least 18 RD-180 engines to \ncreate a bridge between now and 2022 when a domestically manufactured \nengine becomes available. This, too, is false.\n  Today, we have two space launch providers--ULA and SpaceX--that, no \nmatter what happens with the Russian RD-180, will be able to provide \nfully redundant capabilities with ULA's Delta IV and SpaceX's Falcon 9 \nand, eventually, the Falcon Heavy space launch\n\n[[Page S8696]]\n\nvehicles. There will be no capability gap. The Atlas V is not going \nanywhere anytime soon. ULA has enough Atlas Vs to get them through at \nleast 2019, if not later. As I alluded a moment ago, the Pentagon \nagrees that no action is required today to address a risk for assured \naccess to space.\n  In declining ULA's recent request for a waiver from the Defense \nauthorization bill's restriction, the Deputy Secretary of Defense \nconcluded that they ``do not believe any immediate action is required \nto address the further risk of having only one source of space launch \nservices.'' Indeed, in its recent letter, the Department of Defense \neven confirmed that ULA has enough engines to compete for each of the \nnine upcoming competitions and that the number they will pursue is \n``dependent upon ULA's business management strategy.''\n  So I ask Senator Shelby and Senator Durbin: What are your priorities? \nAs we speak, Ukrainians are resisting Russian aggression and fighting \nto keep their country whole and free. Yet this Omnibus appropriations \nbill sends hundreds of millions of dollars to Vladimir Putin, his \ncronies, and Russia's military industrial base as Russia continues to \noccupy Crimea and to destabilize Ukraine and their neighbors in the \nregion. What kind of message does that send to Ukrainians who have been \nfighting and dying to protect their country? How can we do this when \nPutin is menacing our NATO allies in Europe? How can we do this when \nRussia continues to send weapons to Iran? How can we do this when Putin \ncontinues to violate the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty? \nHow can we do this when Putin is bombing U.S.-backed forces in Syria \nfighting the murderous Assad regime?\n  I understand that some constituents of Senator Shelby and Senator \nDurbin believe they would benefit from this provision, but as the New \nYork Times editorial board stated earlier this year:\n\n       When sanctions are necessary, the countries that impose \n     them must be willing to pay a cost, too. After leaning on \n     France to cancel the sale of two ships to Russia because of \n     the invasion of Ukraine, the United States can hardly insist \n     on continuing to buy national security hardware from one of \n     Mr. Putin's cronies.\n\n  I repeat; that is from the New York Times, an editorial dated June 5, \n2015, titled ``Don't Back Down on Russian Sanctions.'' I also refer to \nan article from Reuters, dated November 18, 2014, titled ``In murky \nPentagon deal with Russia, big profit for a tiny Florida firm.''\n  On the record, I make this promise: If this language undermining the \nNational Defense Authorization Act is not removed from the omnibus, I \nassure my colleagues that this issue will not go unaddressed in the \nfiscal year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act. Up to this point, \nwe have sought to manage this issue on an annual basis. We have always \nmaintained that if a genuine crisis emerged, we would not compromise \nour national security interests in space. We have sought to be flexible \nand open to new information. But if this is how our efforts are repaid, \nthen perhaps we need to look at a complete and indefinite restriction \non Putin's rocket engine.\n  I take no pleasure in saying that. I believe that avoiding the year-\nover-year conflict over this matter between our authorizing and \nAppropriations Committees is in our Nation's best interests. Such back-\nand-forth only delays our shared desire to end our reliance on Russian \ntechnology from our space launch supply chain, while injecting \ninstability into our national security space launch program.\n  That instability threatens the reliable launch of our most sensitive \nnational security satellites and the stability of the fragile \nindustrial base that supports them. But I cannot allow--I cannot allow \nthe Appropriations Committee or any other Member of this body to craft \na ``take it or leave it'' omnibus spending bill that allows a \nmonopolistic corporation to do business with Russia's oligarchs to buy \noverpriced rocket engines that fund Russia's belligerence in Crimea and \nUkraine, its support for Assad in Syria, and its neoimperial ambitions.\n  I would like to address this issue in a larger context. The way the \nCongress is supposed to work is that authorizing committees authorize, \nwhether it be in domestic or international or, in this case, defense \nprograms. The responsibility of the authorizing committee is to make \nsure, in the case of defense--the training, equipping, the authorizing, \nthe funding, the policies--that all falls under the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  The Appropriations Committee is required in their responsibilities to \ndecide the funding for these programs. It is within their authority to \nzero out a program if they do not think the funding is called for or \nnecessary. They can add funding if they want to for various programs. \nBut this--this is a complete violation, a complete and total violation.\n  This issue was raised in the subcommittee and addressed in the \nsubcommittee of the Armed Services Committee. It was in the full \ncommittee. It was addressed on the floor where there were hundreds of \namendments that were proposed. Yet what was decided by the Armed \nServices Committee remained intact until, in the dark of the night, \nuntil 10 or 11 or 12 or whatever time it was this morning, up pops a \ndirect contradiction, a direct dismembering, a direct cancellation of a \nprovision in the law where we are talking about hundreds of millions of \ndollars that have no bearing whatsoever on the authority and \nresponsibility of the Appropriations Committee.\n  So there are two problems here: One, it was done in the dark of \nnight--in the middle of the night. No one knew. Second of all, it is in \ndirect violation of the relationship between the authorizing committees \nand the Appropriations Committee. So I say to my colleagues who are not \non the Appropriations Committee: If you let this go, then maybe you are \nnext. Maybe it is an amendment or a program that you have supported \nthrough debate and discussion and authorizing the committee and votes \non amendments on the floor of the Senate. Then in the middle of the \nnight, in December, when we are going out of session in 48 hours or \nso--or 72 hours--then up pops a provision that negates the entire work \nof the authorizing committee over days and weeks and months.\n  I say to my colleagues: You could be next. You could be next. That is \nwhy this in itself--subsidizing Vladimir Putin--is outrageous enough. \nBut if we are going to allow this kind of middle-of-the-night \nairdropping, fundamental changes in programs and proposals and policies \nthat have been debated in the open, that have been voted on in the \nopen, completely negated, then we are destroying the very fundamental \nstructure of how the Senate and the Congress are supposed to work.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter I sent to the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, dated November 19, 2015, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 19, 2015.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Cochran: As you finalize the appropriations \n     bills for fiscal year 2016, I am concerned to hear that your \n     Committee may be considering authorization language that \n     would undermine sanctions on Russian rocket engines in \n     connection with the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) \n     program, as approved in the recently enacted Fiscal Year 2016 \n     National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) on November 10, \n     2015, by a vote of 91-3. That provision, which was reviewed \n     at length by the Armed Services Committee and subject to a \n     fulsome amendment process on the Senate Floor, achieves a \n     delicate balance that facilitates competition by allowing for \n     nine Russian rocket engines to be used as the incumbent space \n     launch provider transitions its launch vehicles to non-\n     Russian propulsion systems.\n       I know you share my concerns about our continued use of \n     Russian rocket engines in connection with military space \n     launch and I ask you to respect the well-informed work my \n     Committee took in crafting our legislation. Recent attempts \n     by the incumbent contractor to manufacture a crisis by \n     prematurely diminishing its stockpile of engines purchased \n     prior to the Russian invasion of Crimea should be viewed with \n     skepticism and scrutinized heavily. Such efforts should not \n     be misconstrued as a compelling reason to undermine any \n     sanctions on Russia while they occupy Crimea, destabilize \n     Ukraine, bolster Assad in Syria, send weapons to Iran, and \n     violate the 1987 Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.\n       We welcome your Committee's views and look forward to \n     working with your Committee on ensuring that Department of \n     Defense resources are not unwisely allocated to\n\n[[Page S8697]]\n\n     benefit the Russian military industrial base or its \n     beneficiaries. I believe avoiding the year-over-year re-\n     litigation of this matter between our authorizing and \n     appropriations committees is in our best interest, inasmuch \n     as such back-and-forth only delay our shared desire to \n     eliminate Russian technology from our space launch supply \n     chain and injects instability into the EELV program--not \n     conducive to its success in ensuring the reliable launch of \n     our most sensitive national security satellites or the \n     stability of the fragile industrial base that supports them.\n       Thank you for consideration of this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John McCain,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to celebrate the \nsuccessful climate negotiations that were just wrapped up in Paris.\n  This past Saturday, 196 countries came together to reduce harmful \ngreenhouse gas emissions, taking a very important step in the fight \nagainst climate change. This historic agreement is a recognition that \nwe cannot afford to ignore the negative impacts of climate change and \nthat we must work together globally to put the planet on a safer path \nforward.\n  The agreement does not simply take countries at their word, but it \nrequires transparent measurement and verification to ensure that they \nlive up to their promises. Crucially, the deal requires countries to \nrevisit their emission reduction targets every 5 years. That way \ncountries can factor in new technologies and new policies in order to \nkeep global warming under 2 degrees Celsius.\n  This truly historic deal has been nearly 25 years in the making. \nInternational climate efforts date back to 1992, when governments \naround the world met in Rio de Janeiro with the objective of \nstabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations. Nations have met every year \nsince to further the goal. While some meetings have been more \nsuccessful than others, most have been met with disappointment and lack \nof action. After all, climate change is a complex issue, and bringing \nabout a consensus action for any international issue is no small feat. \nThat is why this agreement is truly, truly impressive.\n  Two weeks ago I traveled to Paris with nine of my colleagues. We met \nwith U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, with U.S. Energy Secretary \nErnest Moniz, and with our top U.S. climate change negotiator, Todd \nStern. I congratulate all of them for their fine work.\n  Part of the purpose of our trip was to demonstrate to the world that \nthere is a strong coalition in the U.S. Congress that supports the \nPresident's efforts on climate change, a message we conveyed to other \nnations, including Bangladesh. It is a country that has contributed \nlittle to industrial air pollution, but it is one of the most \nvulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change. It is estimated \nthat unless we act, rising sea level will inundate some 17 percent of \nBangladesh, displacing about 18 million people in this low-lying \nnation. They will be uprooted and turned into climate refugees without \na home.\n  But, of course, climate change isn't something that will just impact \nBangladesh and other low-lying nations. It is already impacting us \nright here at home.\n  While we cannot attribute any single extreme weather event to climate \nchange, we do know that climate change impacts the frequency, duration, \nand severity of extreme weather events. Just look at the damage caused \nby Superstorm Sandy. The storm surges caused by Sandy along the eastern \nseaboard were far more damaging because of climate-induced sea level \nrise. May I remind you that the damage caused by Sandy cost taxpayers \n$60 billion.\n  We are also seeing climate impacts to our forests. When Forest \nService Chief Tom Tidwell testified before the Senate energy committee \na few years ago, he told us that throughout the country we are seeing \nfar longer fire seasons and that wildfires are also larger and more \nintense. I asked Chief Tidwell whether scientists at the Forest Service \nhave concluded that climate change has been exacerbating the intensity, \nthe size, and duration of wildfires in the wildfire season. Without \nhesitation, he said yes. As a result, the Forest Service is spending \nmore and more of their budget fighting fires--now more than half of \ntheir entire budget.\n  We are seeing more intense droughts. Unless we act, these droughts \nwill have a major impact on food security around the world. That is why \nI recently penned an op-ed in the Minneapolis StarTribune with Dave \nMacLennan, the CEO of Cargill, the Nation's largest privately held \ncorporation.\n  As the CEO of a company focused on agriculture, Dave is concerned \nabout what climate change is going to do to our food supply in a world \nthat is expected to go from 7 billion to 9.5 billion inhabitants by \nmidcentury. That is why Cargill called for a strong outcome at the \nglobal climate negotiations.\n  So you can see that Cargill has a strong business case to make on why \nwe have to deal with climate change. But, of course, that business case \nisn't just confined to the agriculture sector. Addressing climate \nchange presents a tremendous opportunity to transform the energy \nsector.\n  For the very first time just this last week, Beijing issued its most \nsevere warning to alert citizens of intense smog and local air \npollution levels. Officials ordered half of the city's private vehicles \nto stay off the road, halted all operation at outdoor construction \nsites, and advised schools to temporarily close their doors. Citizens \nwere encouraged to limit outdoor activities and recommended to wear a \nmask when outside.\n  China is choking on its own fumes from fossil fuels. As China and \nothers recognize that they have to race toward clean energy, I want to \nmake sure that our nation leads that race. I want to make sure that our \nstartups are innovating tomorrow's solutions, that our companies are \nthe ones that are developing and deploying clean energy technologies \nhere and around the world. Again, I want to reiterate that. Addressing \nclimate change head on would not only mitigate unprecedented damage to \nour economy but spur growth and innovation in a world that is hungry \nfor advancements in clean energy.\n  My State of Minnesota recognized this opportunity in 2007 when it \nestablished a renewable energy standard and an energy efficiency \nstandard. These kinds of policies send a strong signal to the private \nsector to develop and deploy clean energy solutions, and major \ninvestors are catching on to the opportunities. Just this month, Bill \nGates launched the Breakthrough Energy Coalition to develop \ntransformative energy solutions. The Coalition of nearly 30 \nbillionaires from 10 different countries will invest in early stage \nenergy companies to help them bridge the gap between government-funded \nlab research and the marketplace. According to Gates, the ``primary \ngoal with the Coalition is as much to accelerate progress on clean \nenergy as it is to make a profit.'' To back up this statement, Gates \nalone plans to invest $1 billion in clean energy in the next 5 years.\n  So you can see that the very serious threat of climate change \npresents a ``Sputnik moment'' for our Nation, an opportunity to rise to \nthe challenge and defeat that threat. In response to Sputnik, we ended \nup not just winning the space race and sending a man to the Moon, but \nwe did all sorts of great things for the American economy and for our \nsociety. We did it once, and we can do it again. By rising to the \nchallenge of climate change, we will not just clean up our air but also \ndrive innovation and create jobs--and not only in the clean energy \nsector--just as the space program created economic growth in so many \neconomic sectors.\n  The Obama administration deserves a lot of credit for its leadership \non climate change. Our domestic commitment through the Clean Power \nPlan, which builds on the work of my State and others, has established \na Federal plan for reducing emissions. This important policy has \nprovided American innovators and businesses the confidence to take on \nnew risks and to drive new technologies forward.\n\n[[Page S8698]]\n\n  After dragging our feet for so many years, I am proud that the United \nStates is acting domestically and leading internationally.\n  But our job is not done. The agreement in Paris puts the planet on a \nsafer trajectory than the one we have been on, but we have to remain \nvigilant and build upon that success. Internationally, we have to hold \nother nations accountable, ensure that they commit to stronger emission \nreduction targets over time, and make sure that those reductions are \ntransparent and verifiable. Domestically, we have to build on the \nsuccess of our cities and our States, and we have to work to make sure \nthat the Clean Power Plan and other emissions reduction policies are \neffective. As a member of the Senate energy committee, I intend to do \njust that.\n  Two years ago, my first grandchild was born, and I am expecting my \nsecond grandchild in January. God willing, they will live through this \ncentury and into the next. I want them to know that when we had the \nopportunity to put Earth on a safer path, we seized the moment.\n  So let's celebrate this agreement because it is an important \nmilestone, and then let's build on it to make the planet a safer and \nmore habitable place for our grandchildren and their children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/senate-section/article/S8698-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8698-S8699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I am here today to talk a little about \nthe bill we saw posted late last night--a bill that I think has better \nresults than the process itself would have suggested we might have.\n  There is no question that we have to get back to the process of \nbringing these bills to the floor. Bring them to the floor one at a \ntime and let everybody challenge every penny of spending, to spend it \nin a different way or don't spend it at all. I am disappointed, as \nevery citizen in the country should be, that we didn't do it that way. \nI hope we have the opportunity next year to get back to where these \nbills are dealt with one at a time.\n  The other area I am disappointed in is the inability to use this bill \nto have the kinds of policy victories I would like to see. The rule on \nthe waters of the United States--the courts consistently appear to be \nsaying the EPA absolutely doesn't have the authority to do what they \nare trying to do. In my State, the fourth most dependent State on coal-\npowered utilities, the rule on electricity will double our utility bill \nsometime between now and 2030, and for some Missourians, their utility \nbill will more than double. There is the rule that makes it difficult \nfor financial advisers to give advice to small investors and people \nwith small savings, small retirement accounts. If this financial \nadviser's rule--the so-called fiduciary rule--is allowed to go into \neffect, it will have dramatic impact. The joint employer rule upends \nthe franchise model of doing business--a model of doing business which \nis around the world now but is uniquely American in its capacity to \nbring people into the middle class and allow them to rise into the \nmiddle class.\n  So I am disappointed about all of those things. But when we look at \nthe bill as a spending bill, when we look at the bill as a bill that is \nsupposed to do what this bill does, which is to decide how to spend the \ncountry's money, there is a significant reprioritization here.\n  One of the things I have seen even more in recent years than I think \nused to be the case is that when so many of our friends in the House \nand the Senate--and maybe even more so in the Senate--talk about how \nimportant it is to fund our priorities, what they are really staying is \nthat it is important to fund anything any of us are for. That is not \nthe way to set priorities. The way to set priorities is to decide what \nis important for the government to do, decide what the government can \ndo better than people can do for themselves or maybe couldn't possibly \ndo for themselves, and then set those priorities. In that case, I think \nthis bill makes significant steps in the right direction, with dramatic \nchanges in areas that had been a problem for several years now, at \nleast the last 5 or 6 years, and in the case I want to talk about \nfirst, the last dozen years, but nobody has been able to do anything \nabout it. Nobody has ever said those aren't our priorities; they just \nsaid: Well, we have all of these priorities--which meant every line in \nthe appropriations bill, the best I can tell.\n  Let's talk about the Labor-HHS bill. It is about 32 percent of all \nthe money after defense. If I have any time, I might talk about the \nDefense bill because it does great things for veterans, great things \nfor cyber security, great things that support those who serve, and one \nof those things is encouraging our allies on the frontlines in the War \non Terror.\n  In Labor and Education and particularly in Health and Human Services, \nthe National Institutes of Health, where so much of our health care \nresearch is generated--a little of it is done in every State. Some \nStates have great institutions. Certainly Missouri does--the University \nof Missouri, Columbia, Washington University, Children's Hospital. \nHospitals all over our State have unique opportunities to do research. \nHealth care research is something that, frankly, just isn't going to \nhappen the way it should happen unless the government steps forward and \nsays: We are going to be a leader here.\n  From about 1996 until 2003, the Federal Government doubled NIH \nresearch--in less than a decade, doubled NIH research. Since 2003, \nthere has been no increase. There has been no increase in over a \ndecade. As that money didn't increase, the buying power of the money \ndecreased. We can certainly argue there is somewhere in the \nneighborhood of 20 to 25 percent less buying power, so really in terms \nof what they are getting for research, there is less buying power by \nabout 20 percent to 25 percent. Young researchers are frustrated at \nnever getting that first grant, never getting the truly experimental \ngrant to see if something will work that nobody may have thought of \nbefore.\n  This bill increases NIH research by almost 7 percent. It takes that \n$30 billion Federal commitment to research and makes it a $32 billion \ncommitment. It begins the process of catching up. Why do we need to do \nthat? What are the reasons we need to do that besides the fact that the \ngovernment has done research of all kinds for a long time, from ag \nresearch, which I support, to health research, which I support? I can \nthink right offhand of about three critical reasons we should be \nconcerned about health research.\n  One is the individual impact that the failure to do this has had. As \npeople live longer, more and more people die from Alzheimer's and its \ncomplications or cancer and its complications. Fewer people die from a \nheart attack because we have done great things there and can still do \nmore through treatment and prevention to make heart attacks even less \nlikely. But as people survive heart attack and stroke, they are more \nlikely to die from Alzheimer's or cancer. This creates great stress for \nfamilies, particularly Alzheimer's, which can create years and maybe \ndecades of stress for families. So to try to prevent or postpone that, \nto work with families--I would say that is priority reason No. 1.\n  To save money for taxpayers would be priority reason No. 2. The \nprojection is that by 2050, through Medicare, the Federal Government \nwill be spending $1 trillion a year on Alzheimer's and Alzheimer's-\nrelated health care. That is about as big as this discretionary budget. \nI think this budget is about $1.15 trillion. So take all the money we \nare spending today on discretionary spending, and suddenly, in just a \nfew decades, that is the same amount of money we will be spending \nbecause of Alzheimer's. So that is a good second reason.\n  A third reason is that health care is about to revolutionize \neverything from smart phone technology to the individual health care \nthat is possible now that we know what we know about the human genome, \nthe things we know about that make me as an individual different from \neverybody else and everybody else who is hearing this different from \neverybody else. What kind\n\n[[Page S8699]]\n\nof unique cure can we find? What kind of designer medicine cure can we \nfind to solve a problem for you, and then how do we make that scalable \nso that, with minor variations, we can make the same thing possible and \naffordable for other people as well? And where that research is done--\nthe smart phone technology applications, the focus on the brain, the \nfocus on designer medicines--where that is done is likely to be where \nmany of those jobs turn out to be. So certainly health care is and will \ncontinue to be a big economic driver. The multiplication of economic \nimpact in a positive way with what we invest in health care is pretty \ndramatic. So that is a big increase.\n  Fighting opioid abuse--this is where people take prescription \nmedicines. The Presiding Officer is a veteran, having just retired from \nher long military service. Many of those who serve are the most likely \nto have this problem because of injuries they sustained, accidents they \nwere part of, attacks they were a victim of which create pain. So they \ntake heavy amounts of appropriate things to ease that pain but then get \naddicted to it. This is an area people weren't talking about at all \nlong ago, but deaths from prescription opioids have quadrupled since \n1999--actually, more than that because they quadrupled between 1999 and \n2013.\n  Overdose of prescription drugs costs the economy an estimated $20 \nbillion in work loss and health care costs every single year. The lives \nof families are impacted when a successful person, a responsible \nperson, or someone who has not achieved either of those things yet but \nis a loved part of your family, becomes a victim of opioid abuse. We \nhave a commitment in this budget to $91 million. It is not the biggest \nline item in the budget, but it is almost three times what we have been \nspending.\n  Many of our Members have been real leaders in talking about this. \nSenator Ayotte from New Hampshire, Senator Portman from Ohio, and \nSenator Shaheen from New Hampshire are all very focused on this \nproblem.\n  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act benefits here as we \nmove toward hopefully less Federal control on education but more \nability to help local schools deal with people who have individual \nchallenges.\n  Rural health is a big issue in my State and a big issue in the \nPresiding Officer's State. It is handled here in a different way.\n  Job training is an important thing we do.\n  But what do we not do here? This is my final addition to this: What \nare we not doing? We would have liked to have not funded over 40 \nprograms, which was the bill that the Appropriations Committee sent to \nthe floor months ago that was never debated. That would have been the \nchance to debate all 40 of those programs. I think there were 43 \nprograms that cost about $2.5 billion. Debate all 43 of those programs \nand decide if the committee is right or not--we can't do that if we \ndon't get it here on the floor. But we still eliminate 18 programs. \nThose programs currently were more than a quarter of a billion dollars \nof spending.\n  The President asked for 23 new programs that were $1.16 billion of \nspending that were not done in this bill.\n  The Independent Payment Advisory Board under ObamaCare, where there \nwould be a board rather than you and your doctor who decided what your \nhealth care is going to look like--that is not funded, so that won't \noccur. And there won't be a big transfer from other accounts with some \nother label to insurance companies, because all of the expectations \nfrom ObamaCare have turned out not to produce the kinds of results its \nsupporters thought it would.\n  Hopefully we have made a big difference in how we prioritize the \nspending of the people's money, of the taxpayers' money, and hopefully \nwe have also made a renewed commitment to do this the right way. We \nhave done it this way since, frankly, the control of the Senate changed \nhalf a dozen years ago. The new majority was totally committed to \ngetting these bills to the floor. They were all ready--all 12 bills--\nfor first time in 6 years, most of them ready about the end of May, the \nfirst of June, but with only a couple of exceptions were they allowed \nto come to the floor, and that was at the very last minute when it was \ntoo late for this process to work the way it should.\n  Let's hope for more transparency, more debate, and more challenges. I \nam chair of this one committee I have been talking about today, but \ncertainly there have to be other ideas that other Members who aren't on \nthis subcommittee have, who aren't on the Appropriations Committee \nhave. They do their best to get those ideas in by talking, in this late \nprocess and during the year, about what should happen.\n  Let's do our best to make this happen the way the Constitution \nenvisions and the way people have every right to expect. I hope for a \nbetter process but realize that this process does significantly change \nthe priorities the Federal Government has been stuck with for the last \n6 years and heads in a new direction.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey).

Mr. President, the senior Senator from Arizona came to \nthe floor this morning and raised a question about a provision in the \nOmnibus appropriations bill, particularly the aspect of it that related \nto the Department of Defense. During the course of raising the issue, \nthe senior Senator from Arizona used my name on the floor repeatedly. \nIt was refreshing and I am relieved. The senior Senator from Arizona \nhas not attacked me on the floor for 3 weeks, and I was fearful he was \nfeeling under the weather, but clearly he is in fine form and feels \ngood, and I welcome him back to the floor for another attack on me \npersonally.\n  Let's talk about the issue he raised because it is complicated but \nextremely important when it comes to the defense of the United States. \nHere is what it boils down to: In the early 2000s, there were two \ncompanies making rockets that launched satellites. The two companies \nwere Boeing and Lockheed, and they competed with one another, but in \nthe early 2000s--and I don't understand why--they made an argument to \nthe Department of Defense that the Nation would be better off if they \nmerged the two companies into one company and then provided the rockets \nto launch satellites to defend the United States and collect \ninformation. They argued that if they worked together, it would cost \nless, and they merged. With the approval of the Department of Defense, \nthey continued to bid on satellite launches.\n  What happened was a good thing and a thing that was not so good. What \nwas good was that their product was very reliable. They launched \nsatellites with great reliability, and that is of course what America \nand its national defense requires. The bad part is that the costs went \nthrough the roof. The costs went up about 65 percent over this period \nof time since they created United Launch Alliance, costing the Federal \ntaxpayers about $3 billion more for launches than it did in the past. \nThey argued that they would eliminate competition and provide \nreliability, and they did, but the costs went up dramatically.\n  A new player arrived on the scene--SpaceX. SpaceX is associated with \nElon Musk, a name that is well known in America. They decided to get \ninto the business. They were going to build rockets and launch \nsatellites too. Naturally, the United States of America said: Be my \nguest but prove you can do it in a way that we can count on you, \nbecause when we need a satellite launched to collect information, we \nwant to make sure it is successful.\n  Over the years, SpaceX improved, evolved, and developed the capacity \nto launch satellites to the point where NASA, for example--the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration--used SpaceX rockets successfully. \nIt reached a point where the Department of Defense said to SpaceX: You \nare capable and will be certified to now compete for Department of \nDefense business. It is to the credit of SpaceX that they reached that \npoint.\n  I thought this was an exciting development because, once again, we \nwere going to have competition between the United Launch Alliance, the \nold Boeing-Lockheed merger, and SpaceX, the\n\n[[Page S8700]]\n\nnew company. The owner of SpaceX said to me as well as publicly: We can \ndo this for a fraction of the cost to American taxpayers. What I did \nwas invite the CEOs of both companies to come to my subcommittee--when \nI then chaired the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee--in March of \n2014. No one had quite seen a hearing like this before. We put the CEOs \nof both companies at the table at the same time, and we asked them \nquestions about their operations, reliability, costs, and projections \nfor the future.\n  At the end of this hearing, I said to the CEOs of each of these \ncompanies: I want to do something that is a little unusual. I want to \noffer each of you the opportunity, if you wish, to submit 10 questions \nto the other CEO that you think should have been asked and perhaps we \ndidn't--and so they did. It was a complete record and a good one. For \nthe first time, it really showed me that we were moving to a new stage \nin rocket science and capacity that could serve the United States by \nkeeping us safe and keeping the costs down, and that of course should \nbe our goal.\n  Then there was a complication. Vladimir Putin of Russia decided to \ntake aggressive action by invading Georgia and Ukraine, and other \nactions by him that we considered confrontational tended to freeze up \nthe relationship between the United States and Russia. Why is that \nimportant? It is important because the engine being used by United \nLaunch Alliance to launch America's defense satellites was an engine \nbuilt in Russia.\n  People started saying: Why in the world are we giving Russia and \nVladimir Putin the opportunity to sell rocket engines to the United \nStates? Secondly, why would we want to be dependent on Russia for \nrocket engines? So the debate started moving forward. How do we exclude \nthe Russians from building engines and still have competition between \nthese two companies? That is what brings me here today.\n  We were trying to find the right combination to bring competition and \nreliability without engaging the Russians. Everyone in Congress knows \nwe have authorizing committees and appropriations committees. The \nsenior Senator from Arizona is the chair of the defense authorizing \ncommittee, the Armed Services Committee, and I have been chair and am \nnow the vice chair of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  The senior Senator from Arizona started including provisions in the \nauthorizing bill which said that ULA, United Launch Alliance, could not \nuse Russian engines to launch satellites and compete for business using \nthose engines in the United States. As a result, the Air Force came to \nsee me. First, I might add, a letter was sent when this provision was \nadded to the Defense authorization bill. The letter was sent in May of \nthis year, signed by Ash Carter, the Secretary of Defense, and James \nClapper, the Director of National Intelligence, suggesting that \nexcluding Russian engines so quickly could cause a problem in terms of \nthe availability of missiles to launch satellites as we need them. The \nlimitation that was put in by the defense authorization committee as to \nthe number of engines that could be used would be quickly depleted, and \nthe Air Force, the Department of Defense, and our intelligence agency \nsaid that may leave us vulnerable, so they asked the Senator from \nArizona to reconsider that provision. He did not. If anything, the \nlanguage that came out of conference on this provision made it even \nmore difficult for the United Launch Alliance to consider using a \ndifferent type of engine. I might add, they don't have an alternative \nengine to the Russian engine. United Launch Alliance uses it now. We \ntold them to develop an American engine, and I stand behind that. They \ntold us it will take anywhere from 5 to 7 years for that to happen.\n\n  I understand this is a complex assignment, and we want them to get it \nright. It seems like a long time, but it points to the dilemma we face. \nIf United Launch Alliance cannot bid for work with the Department of \nDefense using a Russian engine, they don't have an alternative engine \nto bid with. At that point, SpaceX becomes the sole bidder and the \nmonopoly source for engines. We tried to move from ULA as a monopoly \nsource or sole bidder to competition, and now by injecting this \nprohibition against Russian engines beyond a certain number, we are \nagain getting back to the days of a sole bidder.\n  What we have allowed in this Omnibus appropriations bill is language \nwhich gives 1 year of flexibility to the Department of Defense when it \ncomes to bidding for these satellite launches, and of course it means \nUnited Launch Alliance will be using Russian engines for that bidding.\n  The Senator from Arizona came to the floor and spent most of his time \ntalking about the aggression of Russia and Vladimir Putin and how we \nneed to be strong with our response. Back in the day, when our \nrelationship was more constructive, the Senator from Arizona and I \nactually traveled to Ukraine. I agree with him about the aggression of \nRussia and Mr. Putin and why the United States needs to be strong in \nresponse, but we have to be careful that we don't cut off our nose to \nspite our face. If we reach a point where we don't allow ULA to use a \nRussian engine to compete, we could endanger and jeopardize the \nopportunities the United States needs to keep us safe, and that is \nexactly what the Secretary of Defense and Mr. Clapper said in writing \nto Senator McCain.\n  My message is that there is nothing, incidentally, in this omnibus \nbill that was not discussed in the original bill as marked up. There is \nno airdrop of language. It is a slightly different version of the \nlanguage but says the same thing--that we think there should be some \nflexibility as ULA moves to develop their new engine.\n  The Department of Defense has convinced me that it would be \nshortsighted of us to make it impossible for ULA to even bid on future \nsatellite launches. God forbid something happens to SpaceX where they \ncan't launch satellites. At that point then, we would be in a terrible \nsituation. We wouldn't be able to keep our country safe when we should. \nNone of us wants that to happen.\n  The provision in the omnibus bill gives 1 year for the Department of \nDefense and the Air Force to continue to work with ULA to have a launch \nand have competitive bidding. If SpaceX performs as promised and comes \nin with a lower bid for those launches, they deserve to win, and they \nwill. In the meantime, we want to make sure we have the availability of \nsourcing beyond just one company--beyond SpaceX.\n  I am impressed with all of these companies. The Senator from Arizona \nraised the point that Boeing has its headquarters in my home State, and \nI am very proud of that. I have worked with them in the past. I think \nit is an excellent company and does great work. My initial premise in \nstarting this conversation in the Appropriations subcommittee was that \nwe should have competition, and Boeing should face competition. The \ninsertion of the Russian engine issue has made this more complex, and \nit will take us some time to reach what should be our ultimate goal: \nquality and reliable engines in these rockets to launch satellites to \nkeep America safe and the certainty that if one company fails to be \nable to meet our defense needs, there is an alternative supplier. That, \nto me, is the best outcome possible.\n  This section 8045 of the Department of Defense appropriations is \ncritical to our national security and launching satellites into space. \nWe have to assure the Department of Defense and our intelligence \nagencies that we can put critical satellites into orbit when we need \nit. We have to make certain that the costs of these launches is \ncompetitive so taxpayers end up getting the best outcome for the \ndollars they put into our national defense. We have to generate \ncompetition to drive down costs, and we have to bring to an end our \nreliance on Russian-manufactured rocket engines. I wish that were not \nthe case. I wish our relationship with Russia was positive in every \naspect, but it is not, and I join with virtually all of my colleagues \nin believing that the sooner we move away from Russian-made engines to \nAmerican-made engines in competition, the better for us and the better \nfor our Nation.\n  There is no doubt that our Omnibus appropriations bill recognizes the \nneed to end our reliance on Russian engines, and we actually put our \nmoney where our mouth is. We added $143.6 million on top of the $84.4 \nmillion requested by the President to accelerate the development of a \nnew rocket engine. This amount is $43.6 million more than the\n\n[[Page S8701]]\n\n$100 million authorized by the defense authorization committee, so we \nare making certain we are going to end this reliance on Russian \nengines. The question is how we manage the space launch through the \nseveral years of launches before we have that engine. We need to do it \nwithout jeopardizing our national security.\n\n  The general provision I referred to allows for space launch \ncompetition in 2016 without regard to the source of an engine. It will \npermit real competition on four missions in 2016, and it will avoid \ntrading one monopoly for another. I think I have explained how we have \nreached this point.\n  I think there is good faith on both sides. I don't question the \nmotives of the senior Senator from Arizona. I hope he doesn't question \nmine. What we need to make certain of is that we move toward a day when \nAmerica is safe and that the money spent by taxpayers is well spent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are going back into space with \nAmericans on American rockets, and we are going to Mars. We are on the \ncusp of the next big breakthrough in space exploration.\n  It is interesting that this is at the very time that in our culture \nhere on Earth, the movie that is harkening back--``Star Wars''--is \ncoming out again, and it is going to be such a blockbuster at the box \noffice. What is fictional in ``Star Trek'' and ``Star Wars'' is now \nbecoming factual.\n  In large part, it is what has been done in the Nation's space program \nsince the shutdown of the space shuttle back in 2011 and in the \npreparation of the new vehicles--the new rockets, the new spacecraft, \nthe new satellites, the new exploratory missions that have gone on.\n  Who among us, merely three decades ago, would have thought the Hubble \nSpace Telescope would look back into the far reaches of the universe--\nclose to the beginning of that universe--and start to unlock secrets \nthrough this telescope that is orbiting the Earth that was put up by \nhumans in the U.S. space shuttle? Who among us would believe that we \nnow are going to launch a telescope in 2018 that will look back in time \nto the very beginning of the source of light in the universe--the big \nbang--and understand this universe all the more and how it evolved in \nthis magnificent creation that we earthlings observe of the heavens? \nWho among us, over four decades ago when we landed on the Moon, were \nnot impatient to escape the bounds of Earth's gravity once again to get \nout and explore the heavens?\n  That is now becoming a reality. It is becoming a reality in large \npart because of the budget that will be presented to the Congress, \nwhich we will pass--an appropriation that just in this present fiscal \nyear that we find ourselves in right now will increase NASA's budget \n$1.3 billion over what NASA was appropriated last year. Getting \nAmericans and American rockets back into space, since we haven't had \nAmericans on American rockets since we shut down the space shuttle, had \nto be done. That was an essentially extraordinary creative flying \nmachine, but its design had inherent flaws that were risky for human \nbeings. Indeed, in over 135 flights of the space shuttle, we lost two \ncrews--14 souls--because of its design. There was a malfunction where \nthere was no escaping for the crew. But now we have new rockets that \nwill have the crew in a capsule on the top of the rocket so that if \nthere is an explosion on the pad, an explosion in ascent all the way \ninto orbit, we can still save the crew because we can separate them by \nthe escape rockets from the main vehicle and save the crew, ultimately \nhaving them land or by parachute--powered landing or a parachute \nlanding.\n  These rockets are almost ready to fly. Indeed, some of them have been \nflying for quite a while. Two companies, SpaceX and Boeing, will have \nthe spacecraft. SpaceX, its capsule and spacecraft called Dragon, is \nsitting on top of a rocket that has flown many times called the Falcon \n9. Boeing, with a spacecraft called the Starliner, will sit upon the \nvery proven Atlas V. Which one will fly first? We do not know. But the \nfact is that is only 2 years away--2017. They will fly with the first \ncrews to and from the space station so that we no longer have to rely \nupon a very reliable partner that indeed helped us build the \nInternational Space Station to which we go and return not only with \ncrew but with cargo as well. We won't have to rely on the Soyuz \nanymore. We will be flying on American rockets. That is going to happen \nin a short 2 years.\n  The assurance of that is this. It is the Omnibus appropriations bill \nthat is coming forth that has appropriated the amount NASA needs to \nkeep this competition between SpaceX and Boeing going for developing, \nhopefully, two spacecraft that will be launching Americans on American \nrockets to and from our International Space Station.\n  By the way, we have six human beings on the space station. It is an \ninternational crew. They are doing all kinds of experiments. At another \ntime and another day, I can tell my colleagues about some of those \nexciting things.\n  We are going to Mars. We are going to Mars because we are developing \na spacecraft called Orion that we have already test-flown out to 3,600 \nmiles to check its structural integrity on a ballistic reentry. That \nwas done a year ago. Now we are building the largest, most powerful \nrocket ever on Earth, called the Space Launch System, or SLS. Orion and \nSLS have also been given a boost in this appropriations bill. So we are \nwell on our way for the first test of this full-up rocket with capsule \nin September of 2018. That is less than 3 years away, with the first \ncrewed vehicle after the first test in 2021.\n  That is the forerunner to building the spacecraft and the \ntechnologies that can take human beings and keep them alive all the way \nfrom Earth to Mars, land on Mars, stay on Mars for a while, and return \nsafely to the Earth. ``Star Wars,'' ``Star Trek,'' is fiction. It is \nexciting, but it's fiction. This is space fact. It is happening in \nfront of our eyes.\n  Now, there are other things that are happening with this \nappropriations bill. We think, in this solar system, if there is a \nchance for life besides Mars, or life that was there and we want to \nknow what happened--there is a moon around Jupiter called Europa. \nEuropa is so cold that it has an exterior that is ice. But the \ngravitational pull of Jupiter, as Europa goes around and around \nJupiter, is such that it causes the friction from an inner core that \nalready has heat and heats up from the inside. So under this crust of \nice on Europa is water. In our experience as earthlings, wherever we \nhave found water, we have found life. So is not Europa one of the best \nchances of there being life as we understand it in those oceans? It is \na smaller body than Earth--Europa--and yet has oceans that are twice \nthe volume of the oceans on planet Earth. That is a real possibility.\n  So in this appropriations bill, there is $1.6 billion to proceed on a \nplan for taking us to Europa to see if there is other life in our solar \nsystem.\n  There is also something that is very important to us earthlings, and \nthat is that we need to know what is happening to the planet and we \nneed to be able to predict and we need to be able to foretell, because \nif a big storm is coming here, we want precise measurements to let us, \nbound on the face of terra firma, know what is that storm that is \ncoming and what are the weather conditions. That accuracy is so \nimportant for us in our daily lives here on Earth, not even to speak of \nour national security.\n  You could go through the rest of the NASA budget and you can see that \nit indeed sets us on a course for extraordinary space exploration as \nwell as taking care of the aeronautical research, which is the other \n``A'' in NASA--aeronautics. That has a plus-up from the President's \nrequest--aeronautics--giving all the research on the technology to make \nsure that our aviation industry is at the absolute cutting edge.\n  We are going to Mars, and we are beginning this journey as we did \nwith the\n\n[[Page S8702]]\n\ntest of the spacecraft a year ago. That journey is going to accelerate, \nand in the lifetimes of many of those within the sound of my voice, \nthey will witness a human crew of Americans and possibly an \ninternational crew that will go all the way to the planet Mars and \nreturn. Indeed what was science fiction based on science facts--the \nMatt Damon movie ``The Martian''--really is right within our grasp. It \nis an exciting time as we bring our space exploration back to life so \nthat the American people can see that there is a viable space program \nand that we have a goal and that goal is the planet Mars.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/senate-section/article/S8702-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8702-S8703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COAST GUARD LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I want to take advantage of this \nopportunity to also share with the Senate that we have a very important \nCoast Guard bill on which we are going to try to get unanimous consent \nso that we can send it on to the House. There are parts that have been \ncontroversial and those parts generally have been worked out. There are \none or two others.\n  This Senator thinks the American people--unless they get in trouble \nout on the high seas--don't really have an understanding of what a \nprofessional military organization the U.S. Coast Guard is. We have the \nCoast Guard participating with our Defense Department over in the war \nzones--the area of responsibility over in Central Command. We have the \nCoast Guard basically doing the job for the U.S. Navy in the waters off \nof Alaska. We have a Coast Guard that is patrolling the waters off of \nthe continental United States, as well as the island State of Hawaii. \nThe Coast Guard is always there when Americans get in trouble, and \nindeed when mariners who are not Americans get into trouble. The Coast \nGuard is an incredible professional organization that is doing the job.\n  Down in the waters off of my State of Florida, the Coast Guard does \nthis incredible job working with the U.S. Navy on the interdiction of \ndrugs. When the drug smugglers have to be interdicted, the Navy, if \nthey are tracking them, hands that over to the Coast Guard because the \nCoast Guard, in fact, has the law enforcement capability to go in and \ntake down the smugglers.\n  The Coast Guard can shoot the motors out of these go-fast boats to \ninterdict smugglers--even going after submerged vehicles--to stop them. \nThe Coast Guard does that from not only their boats but also from the \nair. The Coast Guard stands tall. We in the Congress now need to stand \ntall for the Coast Guard.\n  Earlier this month the majority leader offered a unanimous consent to \ndischarge from the Senate commerce committee and pass the Coast Guard \nAuthorization Act, giving the Coast Guard the resources it needs to \ncarry out its mission. It cannot be overstated.\n  It is a small, very agile service of 42,000 Active-Duty members. It \nplays a vital role in protecting the Nation from narcoterrorism, human \nsmuggling, environmental disasters, and from the loss of life and \nproperty at sea.\n  So what is in this bill? It is the result of several months of \nnegotiations between the House and the Senate. The chairman of our \nSenate commerce committee, John Thune, and I, as the ranking member of \nthe commerce committee, have worked with our colleagues to craft a bill \nthat will authorize a total of $9.1 billion in each of the fiscal years \n2016 and 2017. It is a $380 million per year increase over the amount \nauthorized last year, and it enhances the Coast Guard and its \ncapability to do a number of the things that I have listed, which \ninclude cracking down on the drug trade and the destruction of \nevidence, including the destruction of illegal drugs. It enhances the \nCoast Guard capabilities to stop the smuggling of drug money across our \nmaritime borders. The Coast Guard's Western Hemisphere strategy is to \ncombat the criminal networks, secure the borders, and safeguard \nAmerican commerce. So to meet all that, this legislation's increased \nfunding is going to support the Coast Guard's ongoing fleet \nrecapitalization program, including the design and construction of a \nnew offshore patrol cutter and continued production of a fast response \ncutter.\n  I have ridden in these fast response cutters. I have ridden in the \ngo-fast boats as they simulated a drug smuggler that was trying to \navoid us. This boat can do the hairpin turns and the sudden 180-degree \nturns at top speed, and that is how these guys can't get away. If for \nsome reason they were not able to interdict them at sea, we have them \nfrom the air.\n  I have watched the Coast Guard sharpshooters blow out the motors on a \ngo-fast drug smuggling boat. But we have to recapitalize a lot of these \nold boats. The average age of a Coast Guard high endurance cutter is 45 \nyears old. The average age of the Coast Guard's 210-foot medium \nendurance cutter is 48 years old. These are two of the primary ships \nthat are used for interdiction and rescue worldwide. So new offshore \npatrol cutters, fast response cutters, will give our Coast Guard an \neffective coastal and offshore interdiction capability in order to meet \nits objectives.\n  You think of the Coast Guard off the coast. They are in Washington. I \nam not talking about the ones onshore. They are out there protecting \nnational security assets in and around the Potomac and the Anacostia \nRivers.\n  In addition to this recapitalization, the bill allows the Coast Guard \nto begin updating its fleet of polar icebreakers, allowing the service \nto pay an estimated $1 billion needed for the acquisition of a new \nstate-of-the-art heavy polar icebreaker. Why do we need that?\n  Have you noticed recently what the Chinese have been doing in the \nArctic? Especially, have you noticed what the Russians are doing in the \nArctic? Have you noticed that the Russians have 19 icebreakers and we \nhave just a few? Have you noticed that China is funding and building \nicebreakers for the Arctic?\n  Part of our icebreakers, the Polar Star and the Healy were built in \nthe 1970s and 1990s. The Polar Star is now well beyond its intended 30-\nyear service life. It is vital that we enable the Coast Guard to begin \nbringing these new vessels online to support the Coast Guard's Arctic \nstrategy and cooperative maritime strategy and to meet the President's \nstated intent for increased American presence and capabilities in the \nArctic.\n  I went with the Coast Guard to Alaska. As I said a moment ago, the \nNavy has really ceded the Alaskan waters to the Coast Guard to protect \nmaritime shipping--a huge fishing fleet up there. But also on the North \nSlope of Alaska, which is the beginning of those Arctic waters, there \nis a lot of activity up there--not only fishing but exploring for oil. \nAt times of the year when it is totally incapable of a seaworthy vessel \nto crack the ice, you have to have an icebreaker to do it. The Russians \nhave 19. They are getting very aggressive in the Arctic. Just ask the \nPrime Minister of Norway, with all of his teams, how concerned they are \nwith what the former Soviets are doing up in the Arctic. Thus, this \nbill enhances and speeds up our capability of getting another \nicebreaker--a modernized icebreaker.\n  So this legislation is also going to provide the Coast Guard parity \nwith our Department of Defense sister services with respect to \npersonnel policies such as parental leave and eligibility for combat-\nrelated special compensation. If they are out there on the frontlines, \nthey should have parity with our sister men and women in uniform.\n  This legislation will ensure that the Coast Guard is properly \nequipped to protect our national and homeland security interests in our \nports, on our coastal and inland waters, such as Washington, and on the \nhigh seas around the world.\n  This Senator believes that we will be able to do this by unanimous \nconsent, if we work through a few more things. So I urge our colleagues \nin the Senate: Let's get this up and get it passed before the Christmas \nrecess so the House will have it the first part of next year so we can \nget on about the process of getting this bill authorized, completed, \nand sent down to the President for signature into law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n[[Page S8703]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/senate-section/article/S8703-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8703-S8704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n       ERIC WILLIAMS CORRECTIONAL OFFICER PROTECTION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I am going make a unanimous consent \nrequest, but first I want to say a few words about the legislation \nabout which the request pertains. I want to thank my colleague Senator \nBob Casey for joining me on this.\n  It was back in 2014 that Senator Casey and I introduced the Eric \nWilliams Correctional Officer Protection Act. It is a bipartisan bill, \nand it is a simple idea. The idea is to better enable these men and \nwomen who protect us every day by working as corrections officers--to \nbetter enable them to protect themselves in the very dangerous \nenvironments in which they go to work every day.\n  Amazingly enough, under the Bureau of Prisons policy, prison guards \nare often placed on duty, guarding large numbers of inmates by \nthemselves, unarmed, and with no meaningful way to defend themselves. \nOfficer Eric Williams of Wayne County, PA, paid the price for this \npolicy. In February of 2013, Eric Williams was working alone in a \nhousing unit of a Federal prison, a unit of 125 inmates. Carrying only \na radio, handcuffs, and a set of keys, he had no means of self-defense \nand no one with him to provide back-up. A gang member serving a life \nsentence for first-degree murder savagely attacked and killed Officer \nWilliams. The inmate used a homemade weapon to stab Eric Williams 129 \ntimes. He beat Eric so badly that his skull was crushed. The damage was \nso severe that Eric Williams' father stated: ``I didn't even recognize \nmy boy laying in that casket.'' Eric was just 34 years old.\n  This Bureau of Prisons policy is very misguided. We send our law \nenforcement officers alone, without defensive gear, to guard large \nnumbers that include convicted killers. So, working with Senator Casey \nand with Eric Williams' parents, Don and Jean Williams, we introduced \nthe Eric Williams Correctional Officer Protection Act. I should point \nout that Don and Jean Williams have been absolutely heroic advocates in \ninsisting that correctional officers have this tool at their disposal.\n  This is a bill that would require the Bureau of Prisons to issue \nnonlethal pepper spray to guards at high- and medium-security prisons \nso that these guards will have some means to protect themselves, some \nmeans of self-defense. We know this works. We know this works because \nthere are many, many documented cases where a violent attack is \nimmediately ended by deploying pepper spray. The fact is, pepper spray \ncompletely and immediately incapacitates an attacker. It does so while \ndoing no permanent damage.\n  Well, it is too late for Eric Williams, but there are thousands of \ncorrectional officers across America who are working in dangerous \nenvironments every day. If we pass this legislation, we are probably \ngoing to save some of their lives over time.\n  The bill is bipartisan, as I pointed out. It has been endorsed by the \nAmerican Federation of Government Employees, by the Federal Law \nEnforcement Officers Association, by the Council of Prisons Local 33. I \nam pleased to announce that thanks to the concerted and, as I said, \nheroic efforts of Eric's parents, Don and Jean Williams, and many law \nenforcement and correction officers across the country, I believe that \ntoday the Senate is ready to enact this legislation.\n  I also thank my cosponsors, Senators Manchin, McConnell, Cornyn, \nInhofe, Capito, Lankford, Kirk, and Vitter.\n  Before I make the formal unanimous consent request, I yield to the \nsenior Senator from Pennsylvania who has joined me in this effort, Mr. \nCasey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Toomey for his work \non this legislation--our work together. As Senator Toomey did, I \nespecially want to commend Don and Jean Williams, the parents of \ncorrections officer Eric Williams. I will not reiterate the horrific \nnature of his death; Senator Toomey outlined that. I cannot imagine \nmore of a nightmare for a corrections officer and for his or her \nfamily.\n  We can bring some measure of protection to these officers by making \nsure that every possible circumstance is one in which the officer has \npepper spray to be able to prevent an attack or to slow an attack down \nenough until that corrections officer gets help.\n  I want to say how much we appreciate the fact that this is \nbipartisan. This is one of those issues that should not have any kind \nof political division. Senator Toomey outlined the challenge and also \nthe solution for this problem.\n  This is not a guarantee, but it means that if a corrections officer--\nand they are always outnumbered, by the way. If they are outnumbered, \nthey will have some measure of protection.\n  I want to emphasize one thing I certainly forgot about or maybe never \nfully understood until I was in a line at corrections officer Eric \nWilliams' viewing before his funeral. The line was full of law \nenforcement officers. I think sometimes we forget--and it was made \nclear to me that night--that these individuals are part of law \nenforcement, just like police officers at the local level or State \npolice officers or other law enforcement personnel. When you work in a \nFederal prison and you are a corrections officer, you are part of law \nenforcement.\n  Those of us who work hard to provide resources for law enforcement \nshould once again support legislation like this. I want to thank \nSenator Toomey for his work. I want to thank those who made this \npossible. I hope we can have this legislation pass through the Senate \nbefore we leave by the end of this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, again, I want to thank Senator Casey for \nhis excellent work on this. At this time, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration \nof S. 238 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 238) to amend title 18, United States Code, to \n     authorize the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to issue \n     oleoresin capsicum spray to officers and employees of the \n     Bureau of Prisons.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 238) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 238\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to enter into a colloquy with Senators Ayotte, Baldwin, Casey, \nand Portman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If it is agreeable to Senators, I will make a few \nremarks introducing the subject of the colloquy, and then the Senators \nwill speak in that order. I am here today to talk about the Federal \nPerkins Loan Program Extension Act of 2015, which is a substitute to \nH.R. 3594. I have a bill which has been taken to the desk.\n  The original sponsors of the bill, which I will ask to be considered \nat the conclusion of the colloquy, are Senators Ayotte, Baldwin, \nJohnson, Casey, Cochran, Boozman, and me. We have debated the Perkins \nloan several times on the floor of the Senate. Twice, I have objected \nto the House bill to extend the Perkins Loan Program. This is a program \nthat was set to expire in 2012, since the 1998 reauthorization of the \nHigher Education Act.\n  That date was not extended the last time we reauthorized the Higher \nEducation Act. This is a program that, in 1998, the Congress and the \nPresident decided would expire in 2012. The expiration of the loan \nprogram should not have been a surprise to anybody. It has not received \nappropriations since 2004.\n  The Department of Education reminded institutions that the program \nwas expiring earlier this year. I objected to the extension on the \ngrounds that the current Federal loan program--one that all students, \nnot select students, are able to use--has a lower interest late and \nbetter repayment options than the Perkins Loan Program. I objected \nbecause I believed there should only be one Federal loan program for \nundergraduate students, as well as one for graduate students, and one \nfor parents.\n  That was the testimony we received in our education committee, the \nHELP Committee. Senator Bennet and I and a bipartisan group of Senators \nhave introduced something called the FAST Act, which would, in a \nvariety of ways, simplify the ability of students to apply for Federal \nstudent aid. One of those ways is to simplify the maze of student loans \nthat are available to students today.\n  Sometimes students end up with more loans than they even know they \nhave. Then they have trouble paying them back. However, in recent \nweeks, I have had many conversations with Senators. Some of them are on \nthe floor today and are Members of this colloquy, who have suggested to \nme they would like to have the Perkins Loan Program extended until we \ncan address it in the Higher Education Reauthorization Act.\n  Senator Ayotte, Senator Baldwin, Senator Collins, Senator Casey, \nSenator Johnson, Senator Portman, and Senator Blumenthal are some of \nthe Senators who have eloquently made that case on the floor of the \nSenate. They came and argued the merits of the Perkins Loan Program. \nMost of the arguments relied on the use of these loans by students to \nprovide for financing up to a student's full cost of attendance to meet \na gap in funding that is above their direct Federal loan limits for the \nvery neediest students; or they argued it was an important resource to \nstudents in urgent circumstances such as when a student's parent loses \na job.\n  I listened to these Senators. I have listened to university \npresidents and others who have talked with me about it. As a result, \ntoday I come here with what I believe is a fair compromise, cosponsored \nby the Senators that I mentioned, to address the specific issues \nraised.\n  We propose a 2-year extension of the Perkins Loan Program while we \nwork on a long-term solution for simplifying the student aid program. \nThis extension will give us time to move forward on the Higher \nEducation Act reauthorization next year, and come to a consensus on how \nto simplify the Federal student aid program, which has become so \ncomplicated that many students will not even apply for loans, and many \nof those who do don't realize the opportunities they have to pay the \nloans back according to very generous terms.\n  That being said, I think it is important for me to say that I am \nstill, frankly, skeptical of the merits of this duplicative loan \nprogram, which only serves 5 percent of all student loan borrowers and \namounts to a little over one-half of 1 percent of all the outstanding \nfederal student loans we have in the country today. The program \nprovides an average loan of about $2,000 and illustrates the \ncomplicated mess our student loan system is in today.\n  My colleagues, cosponsors, and I have worked on this compromise to \nextend the Perkins Loan Program for 2 years for all eligible \nundergraduates and 1 year for current graduate students who have \nalready received a Perkins loan for the graduate degree they are \npursuing.\n  This is what the substitute does. It extends the Perkins Loan Program \nuntil September 30, 2017, for all eligible undergraduates. It provides \n1 year of additional Perkins loans to graduate students who have \nalready received a Perkins loan.\n  Under the Direct Grad PLUS Loan Program, graduate students have the \nability to borrow up to the cost of attendance annually and have no \naggregate or lifetime loan limits. In other words, you don't need the \nPerkins loan as a graduate student to meet costs because you can get as \nmuch money as you would need under the regular direct loan system.\n  The bill requires that the institutions award the maximum annual \nlimit of subsidized direct loans prior to awarding a Perkins loan for \ncurrent undergraduate Perkins loan borrowers.\n  It requires that institutions award the maximum annual limit of both \nsubsidized and unsubsidized direct loans prior to awarding a Perkins \nloan for new undergraduate Perkins loan borrowers.\n  It requires the institution to disclose to Perkins loan borrowers the \nfollowing: that the program is ending; next, that this loan is not \neligible for certain repayment and forgiveness benefits available to \nborrowers utilizing the Direct Loan Program.\n  For an undergraduate, the interest rate is lower in the Direct Loan \nProgram and they have a more generous way to repay the loan than under \nthe\n\n[[Page S8705]]\n\nPerkins loan. We want the Perkins loan borrowers to know that.\n  We want them to know they may consolidate their Perkins loan into a \nFederal direct loan to receive the benefits of the Direct Loan Program; \nthat is, the more generous repayment terms.\n  We want them to know that Federal direct loans and Perkins loans have \ndifferent interest rates.\n  We want them to know that if they are receiving a Perkins loan as an \nundergraduate today and they have received one in the past, that their \ninstitution has already awarded all subsidized Federal direct loans for \nwhich they may be eligible for that year. In other words, the Perkins \nloan is their second loan.\n  Many students borrow more than they should and then have trouble \npaying it back. We want them to know that if they are receiving a \nPerkins loan for the first time, their institution has already awarded \nall subsidized and unsubsidized Federal direct loans for which they \nwere eligible that year and that this is their third loan.\n  If this whole Federal student aid system sounds complicated, it is.\n  There are millions of students across our country who take advantage \nof generous Federal grants and loans--more than $30 billion in grants \nthat they don't have to pay back every year. There is a total \noutstanding debt of federal student loans of $1.2 trillion, almost $100 \nbillion in new loans every year. However, it is such a maze and so \ncomplicated that many students don't understand how much they are \nborrowing. So that was my purpose in objecting to an automatic \nextension of the Perkins loan without thinking about it in terms of how \nwe simplify it and make it easier for students to understand the \ntangled maze of loans in the Federal student aid system.\n  I thank my colleagues who are here today for being so eloquent and so \naggressive in pointing out the benefits of the Perkins Loan Program and \nfor coming up with the suggestion that we find a fair compromise so \nthat over the next 2 years the Perkins Loan Program will continue but \nthat during that time, both our education committee and the full Senate \nand the House will have a chance to review and make simpler the Federal \nsystem of grants and loans for students who attend our 6,000 colleges \nand universities in the country.\n  At this point, I recognize Senator Ayotte of New Hampshire, who was \none of the first to come to the floor and very persuasively argue about \nthe importance of some continuation of the Perkins Loan Program.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee. The \nPerkins loan is a very important loan program to people in New \nHampshire and to 5,000 students in New Hampshire who are current \nrecipients.\n  While I know my colleagues who are on the floor who have fought so \nhard for this--Senator Baldwin, Senator Casey, and Senator Portman--\nwould have preferred that the Senate take up and pass the House's \nHigher Education Extension Act prior to Perkins expiring, because all \nof us were on the floor on September 29 as well, I do very much \nappreciate the spirit of compromise that the Senator from Tennessee has \nshown in working with us to extend this very important loan program for \n2 years, and I thank him for that and for not letting this expire.\n  I thank my colleagues on the floor who have fought so hard for the \nstudents in their States who, like the students in New Hampshire, the \n5,000 students who received a Perkins loan during the last academic \nyear--this is very important to those students. I have heard from them, \nthe colleges, universities, and financial aid administrators in New \nHampshire, who have urged that it is very important, especially before \nwe end the year with the Perkins Loan Program expired, that we pass \nthis extension.\n  Certainly I look forward to continuing to work to make sure that all \nof our student loan programs are easier for people to use; that they \nare simpler; and that we make sure young people in this country and \nthose who are returning to education as well--perhaps in a change of \ncareer or a new course in their life--that they get the opportunity, no \nmatter where they come from or their economic background, to reach \ntheir full potential in this country because that is the essence of the \nAmerican dream.\n  Again, this program is very important to my home State. This program \nis also important to half a million students across the country. It \nhits a lot of students.\n  Unfortunately, in my home State of New Hampshire, we have the \ndistinction of having the highest average student loan debt in the \ncountry. So every bit helps students. These 5,000 students in New \nHampshire--I want them to know this program will continue, and I want \nto make sure the people of New Hampshire understand that I am going to \ncontinue to fight for access for all of our students in New Hampshire \nand those who want to have better educational opportunities to better \ntheir lives and reach their full potential.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee, and certainly I thank the other \nSenators who are on the floor on a bipartisan basis who fought so hard \nfor the Perkins loan extension.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire. \nShe has been a passionate advocate for the Perkins loan recipients in \nNew Hampshire and across this country and played a major role in \ndeveloping this 2-year compromise that permits us to continue the \nprogram while we look at the future.\n  Senator Baldwin of Wisconsin was one of the first on the floor to \npoint out the importance of passing the House bill and dealing with \nthis issue. She is a member of the Senate's education committee, what \nwe call the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Both she \nand her colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Johnson, have vigorously \nadvocated for an extension of the Perkins Loan Program. I thank Senator \nBaldwin for her hard work and look forward to working with her not just \non passing this bill but working in the committee to come to a proper \nresolution on student aid.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. I thank the chairman for this colloquy and for the \nmoment at which we have now arrived.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Perkins Loan Program--a \nvital investment in students that has been successful in helping \nAmericans access affordable higher education and pursue their dreams.\n  Due to Senate inaction, the Perkins Loan Program lapsed at the end of \nSeptember. I have twice come to the floor to urge my colleagues to take \naction and extend this critical student loan program which has helped \nliterally millions of America's low-income students for more than half \na century.\n  I am proud to have earned the support of a strong bipartisan majority \nin the Senate to continue this investment. Since the program's \nexpiration, a growing chorus of advocates, students, and colleges and \nuniversities have joined our bipartisan coalition in calling on the \nSenate to act.\n  As has been well documented, my friend Chairman Alexander and I have \nhad our differences on this issue. As he just shared, he has objected \nto my previous efforts to revive the Perkins Loan Program due to his \nconcerns with the program that he wanted to address as a part of the \ndiscussion about reauthorizing the Higher Education Act--a discussion, \nby the way, I very much look forward to. But despite his prior \nobjections, I have certainly remained firm in the belief that we must \nact now to help students, even as we look toward that future \nconversation on higher education starting at the education committee \nand then proceeding through the Congress.\n  I continue to work with my Republican colleagues and Democratic \ncolleagues--especially those Republican colleagues who had concerns \nwith the program--in order to find an interim path forward.\n  I am so pleased that we are here today with a bipartisan compromise \nthat provides a 2-year extension of the Perkins Loan Program. The \ncompromise before us today is not perfect, and this is not the \nlegislation I would have written on my own. However, today we have \nfound a bipartisan solution that breaks the gridlock and will revive \nthe Perkins Loan Program, providing critical support to students across \nAmerica who were left in the lurch when the program expired this fall.\n  This extension provides current and new undergraduate borrowers with \naccess to Perkins loans through September 30 of the year 2017, allowing\n\n[[Page S8706]]\n\nthem to complete both the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 academic years with \nthe support of this important program. In addition, it provides current \ngraduate students with a Perkins loan an additional year of eligibility \nthrough September 30, 2016, allowing them to complete the 2016-2017 \nacademic year with the support of Perkins. Like the 1-year extension \nmeasure which the House adopted by voice vote earlier this fall, this \n2-year extension is fully paid for.\n  I thank Chairman Alexander for working with me and Ranking Member \nMurray to address his concerns and to reach this compromise which we \nexpect the Senate to pass in short order.\n  I also thank my strong allies in this fight: Senator Murray, Senator \nCasey, Senator Portman, Senator Ayotte, Senator Collins, and many other \nsupporters of the Perkins Loan Program in the Senate.\n  I also thank our partners on the House Education and the Workforce \nCommittee, Chairman Kline and Ranking Member Scott, who supported \nextending the Perkins Program. I am hopeful they will push this \nlegislation across the finish line before Congress leaves for the year.\n  Since 1958, the Federal Perkins Loan Program has been successfully \nhelping Americans access affordable higher education with low-interest \nloans for students who cannot borrow or afford more expensive private \nstudent loans.\n  In Wisconsin, the program provides more than 20,000 low-income \nstudents with more than $41 million in aid, students such as Andrew, a \ncurrent student at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point campus. \nWithout the support of his Perkins loan, Andrew said he would not have \nhad the means to attend college with the little to no income at his \ndisposal. Today, not only is Andrew making the dean's list every \nsemester, but he also has his sights set on attending the law school at \nthe University of Wisconsin. Andrew said: ``Without the assistance I \nget from the Perkins Loan I would be forced to either take out other \nhigh-interest loans, delay my graduation rate, or drop out--which is \nthe last thing I want to do.''\n  I am pleased that we have reached an agreement to extend this program \nfor 2 years to help students just like Andrew. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on the HELP Committee to ensure that campus-\nbased programs like Perkins are a part of the future of Federal support \nfor higher education.\n  Again, I thank the chairman for his colloquy and his hard work on \nreaching this resolution for the moment and look forward to the larger \ndebate in the Education Committee when we reconvene next year.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin. \nThis is the second time in 2 weeks that she has played a role in an \nimportant bipartisan decision on the floor of the Senate regarding \neducation. She has made a major contribution to our Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, and through her willingness to work in a \nbipartisan way with other Senators who she mentioned, we have been able \nto get a bipartisan result. Hopefully, it will be passed by the end of \nthe year, and then we will work together in committee to find the right \nsolution.\n  No Member came more quickly to me to talk about the Perkins Loan \nProgram than did the Senator from Ohio, Rob Portman, who has an eye for \nthe budget with his broad experience as Director of the budget and with \na large number of colleges and universities in Ohio. He is here today \nto discuss the Perkins Loan Program, along with Senator Baldwin, \nSenator Ayotte, and Senator Casey.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee. I \nappreciate his work and help to ensure these kids are not going to be \nleft in the lurch. There are kids in the State of Ohio who are \nexpecting to get their Perkins loans this January as they go into the \nnext semester, and there were certainly thousands of young people who \nwere hoping in the fall that they were going to be able to take \nadvantage of it, and they were very uncertain.\n  It is a big program in Ohio. We actually have over 25,000 Ohio \nstudents who receive financial aid through Perkins. In one school \nalone, Kent State, 3,000 students.\n  By the way, I got lobbied on this very directly. A young woman named \nKeri Richmond interned in my office last summer. Keri is a classic \nexample of someone who needs Perkins because it fills in the gaps for \nher. In her case, she has a Pell. Yet as a young woman who has been in \nand out of foster homes her entire life--and, by the way, is a \nwonderful advocate and spokesperson for that program and how it helps \nfoster kids to get on their feet--she does not have the help at home \nthat many students do. So even for the small things, she needs that \nPerkins loan. She is very grateful today that we are extending this \nprogram, of course; but, more importantly, she is grateful for all her \nother colleagues at Kent State and around the State of Ohio.\n  I was with some Ohio State students a couple weeks ago for a holiday \nparty with the president of Ohio State, who is very pleased this has \nbeen finally handled because he was trying to plan. As we know, schools \nplay a big role in Perkins. It is essentially like a revolving loan \nprogram. With the interest, they are able to come up with new loans for \nthe next year. So the colleges and universities in Ohio are very \ninvolved. We have 1,700 students at Ohio State; overall, we have 60 \nschools in the Buckeye State--colleges and universities--taking \nadvantage of this. So this is a big deal for us.\n  I appreciate the fact that the chairman has been willing to sit down \nand work with us on this and come up with a way for us to move forward \nto give these young people the certainty that they need at a time when \nit is more expensive to go to college. This is a barrier for a lot of \nyoung people to be able to get that degree, to get the experience, to \nhave the ability to be able to go out in this tough job market and be \nable to find work and find their place in the workforce. I am happy we \nhave come to this point.\n  I will say I am very eager to work with the chairman, Ranking Member \nMurray, and others over the next period of time while we extend this \nprogram to come up with a better way to deal with our student loan \nprogram generally. I think the chairman makes a good point about the \ncomplexity. I think he is probably right that it is so complex that \nsome parents and students are turned off by it, and we can simplify it. \nCertainly, we can, but I also want to make it clear that we need to be \nsure that we are providing maximum flexibility for students who might \notherwise get left behind and wouldn't be able to take advantage of the \nopportunity to go to college and get a degree. We should be doing \neverything in our power to provide more students in my home State of \nOhio and around the country the chance to get the tools they need in \norder to be able to be successful.\n  I thank Senator Ayotte, Senator Casey, and Senator Baldwin. We have \nbeen at this for a while. We have been out here on the floor a few \ntimes talking about this. I think this is a result that lets us say to \nthe people we represent back home: We are going to give you that \ncertainty, that confidence to know this is not going to be pulled away.\n  On the other hand, we are going to work hard over the next couple of \nyears to ensure that this program is viable for the longer term--along \nwith other programs--and simplify these programs so they do work better \nfor all the parents and all the students whom we represent.\n  I thank the chairman. This is one of the good results at the end of \nthe year. In a way, going into the Christmas season, it is appropriate \nthat we have this little package that is now wrapped up and has a \nribbon on it. But it does expire, so our work is not done, and we will \nonly redouble our efforts to ensure that we can come up with a program \nthat does provide the flexibility and important safety net that Perkins \ndoes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio. He is \nexactly right. I know of no State that has more small colleges of the \nkind that would take advantage of Perkins loan probably than the State \nof Ohio. It is important to say that Senator Baldwin, Senator Casey, \nand Senator Ayotte have been urgently making their case on the floor \nover the last several weeks and have done so in such an effective way \nthat we have been able to come up with a bipartisan compromise. The \nmore of that we are able to do, I think the more confidence the\n\n[[Page S8707]]\n\nAmerican people will have in their Senators. So I appreciate his \nleadership in making this possible.\n  Another Senator who is a member of the Senate's committee that \noversees education is the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Casey. He, \ntoo, has just completed work on the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct, which many people thought we had no chance of passing this year \nand which we passed by a very large margin. I thank him, as I did \nSenator Baldwin, for working in such a constructive way.\n  Some people look at the Senate and say: Well, you all are always \narguing. Of course we are. That is what we do. That is like looking at \nthe Grand Ole Opry and saying: You all are always singing. We have \ndifferent points of view--and we do on the Perkins loan. But once we \nmake our points of view known, we then do our jobs and we say: OK. Now \nwe need to get a result. If all we wanted to do was to make a speech or \nmake a point, we could stay home or get our own radio show. But we are \nSenators, and our job, having had our say, is to get a result.\n  So I thank Senator Casey, the Senator from Pennsylvania not only for \nhis work on this compromise on Perkins loans but also for his work on \nour efforts to fix No Child Left Behind. I look forward to his \ncomments.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his work in \nhelping us get to this point today. It is an important moment at the \nend of an important year, and we are grateful for his leadership. Even \nwhen we have had a basic disagreement to get this compromise worked \nout, it would not have happened, it could not have happened without his \nleadership and working with Democrats on our side of the aisle, Senator \nMurray, as the ranking member of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee, working with Chairman Alexander. I thank Senator \nBaldwin for her work in leading this effort on our side and leading our \nteam.\n  This is a compromise, which, as Senator Alexander noted, some people \ndon't think we do enough of. I think it is an important example of why \nwe must work together.\n  When we consider the compromise that I worked on and the other \nSenators who are here and others who are not here, along with our \nstaffs--I mentioned Jared and Lauren on my staff, who did a lot of work \non this, and we are grateful for that.\n  But we can report today some good news for more than 150,000 current \nfreshmen Perkins loan recipients whose eligibility was cut off when the \nprogram expired on the 30th of September of this year. This bipartisan \nagreement provides for a 2-year extension of the Perkins Loan Program \nand provides some certainty for students and their families as we \ndebate a longer term solution. We have more to do. Simply put, what \nstudents tell us they need is that basic certainty.\n  One of the reasons we are happy we have reached a compromise at this \nstage is that I think most of us believe what have I often said--that \nearly education applies to higher education. If young people learn more \nwhen they are in their college years, they are going to earn more \nlater. One of the ways to learn more when you are at that age is to \nhave the resources and help of a loan program such as Perkins.\n  Perkins loans are critically important in a State such as \nPennsylvania. Forty thousand students in Pennsylvania receive these \nloans at more than 100 schools. As many people know, these loans are \nfixed rate and they are low interest. Unlike traditional subsidized \nloans, they don't accrue interest when the student is in school. They \nhave significant robust forgiveness opportunities for borrowers who, \nfor example, become high school teachers or first responders or \nlibrarians or nurses or Peace Corps volunteers, among so many other \nprofessions. The loans can be consolidated to qualify for income-based \nrepayment and other loan-forgiveness options.\n  This agreement ensures that those with the least financial resources \nwill be able to continue to receive this important source of financial \naid. Because of this compromise, freshmen and students across the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania will not have to choose between dropping \nout and taking out unaffordable, high-interest private loans in order \nto secure their degree.\n  I would like to give two examples before I conclude.\n  Abigail Anderson, a freshman at Immaculata University, currently \nreceives a Perkins loan of $2,000. She said she had it all figured out, \nbut with this program expiring on September 30, she said: It changes \neverything. She said she didn't know how she was going to pay for \nschool next year because her parents couldn't afford to pay any more. \nAbout the Perkins Loans, Abigail Anderson said, ``Every little amount \ncounts. It makes a difference.''\n  Here is another example. Amber Gunn, a freshman at Temple University, \nis from Hazelton, PA, near my hometown of Scranton. Amber did not have \nenough money to pay her tuition bill even for this year. Her mother \nwasn't able to cosign her loans, but she was able to get a Perkins loan \nin the amount of $5,000 from the help of Temple University's financial \naid office. Amber Gunn said as follows:\n\n       Without the Perkins Loan I probably wouldn't have been able \n     to enroll for my first semester of school. I'm not sure what \n     I'll do next year without the loan, I'm kind of in a \n     predicament.\n\n  For some, that might be an understatement.\n  So now, with this bipartisan agreement, neither Abigail nor Amber and \nso many others will have to worry. They can focus their attention on \nthe end of the semester, their exams--and whatever else they are having \nto focus on--instead of wondering whether they will be able to afford \nto return to campus for their sophomore years.\n  Even with this compromise, we have lots of work to do--more work to \ndo to come together on reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. But \nthis is a good moment for the Senate, and it is especially a good \nmoment for students and families across the country, and in my case for \nthe some 40,000 in the State of Pennsylvania.\n  I thank the chairman for his leadership and again thank Senator \nBaldwin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I once again thank the Senator from \nPennsylvania for being both a passionate advocate and skilled \nlegislator in helping us come to a result here that meets most of the \ngoals of the Senators who spoke about this, at least for the next 2 \nyears, and gives us a chance in our committee to continue to work on \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/senate-section/article/S8707-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8707-S8709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGETARY REVISIONS\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

I \nknow Senator Blumenthal was here on a day when I was here as well \nmaking his case for students in Connecticut. I know the Senator from \nWisconsin, Mr. Johnson, was here making a vigorous case for the \nstudents from Wisconsin, as did Senator Baldwin. Senator Boozman of \nArkansas and Senator Cochran of Mississippi have also been advocates as \nwell as those who participated in the colloquy.\n  We have had a broad group of Senators involved both on the floor and \nin the negotiations.

Mr. President, I rise again to raise the case for lifting \nthe 40-year-old ban on exporting crude oil. Lifting the ban will not \nonly benefit my home State of North Dakota, but it will also benefit \nour Nation and our allies in a host of different ways, and that is why \nI worked hard to include legislation to repeal the ban in the year-end \nlegislation that Congress now has under consideration.\n  Importantly, this is must-pass legislation, meaning it will be very \nhard for the President to veto lifting the ban on exporting crude oil. \nWhen taken together, the reasons for lifting the oil export ban are \nvery powerful. Doing so will encourage more domestic production, \nincrease the global supply of crude oil, thereby reducing the cost at \nthe pump for our consumers, particularly over the long term, and it \nwill grow our economy and create good-paying jobs for our citizens.\n  The last reason for lifting the ban is vitally important as well, \nparticularly now as we work on making sure our Nation is secure. \nNational security through energy security helps to keep our people \nsafer. I will take a few minutes and go through those benefits one by \none.\n  Let's start with the American consumer. The price of oil is based on \nsupply and demand. The more oil on the market, the lower the price. It \nis a matter of simple economics--supply and demand. The volatility and \nglobal price of crude oil is felt right down to the consumer \nlevel. More global supply means lower prices at the pump for gasoline, \nbenefiting our consumers and small businesses across the country. That \nmeans more money in consumers' pockets. Those facts are backed up by \nstudies at both the U.S. Energy Information Administration--the EIA--\nwhich is part of the Department of Energy, as well as the nonpartisan \nBrookings Institute.\n\n  This spring, EIA Administrator Adam Sieminski confirmed that finding \nin testimony before our Energy and Natural Resources Committee, of \nwhich I am a member. In September, the EIA released a new report that \nreaffirms the benefits to consumers and businesses that would result \nfrom lifting the decades-old crude oil export ban. It stands to reason \nif we just think about it for a minute. Oil is a global commodity, \nright? The global price is based on North Sea oil, or Brent crude, so \nthat is the global price. Because we are not allowed to export oil, the \ndomestic price is different. That is based on WTI--West Texas \nIntermediate--crude. So the West Texas Intermediate crude price \ntypically simply runs somewhere between $5 and $8 a barrel lower than \nBrent crude, the international price. So here we are producing oil--my \nState of Texas and others--we produce some of the lightest, sweetest \ncrude in the world. Yet when our producers sell that, they are getting \n$5 to $8 less per barrel than people who are producing internationally. \nSo we are talking about OPEC, Russia, Venezuela, our competitors--they \nprice off Brent. They are getting $5 to $8 more for every barrel they \nsell.\n  Now, think about that. Let's say you are a store or a business of any \nkind. For selling the same product or selling a better product, you are \ngoing to get less money than your competitor. Which of you stays in \nbusiness? Which of you grows and produces more of that product? Which \nof you goes out of business?\n  So what is going on in the world right now? We have OPEC flooding the \nmarket. Why are they doing that? They are doing that to capture market \nshare and to reassert their dominance. Once they put us out of \nbusiness, then they are back in the driver's seat and prices will go \nright back up for the consumer. We don't want to let that happen. We \nwant a robust oil and gas industry that will make sure that we have \ncompetition, that we have energy security, and that consumers have \nlower prices at the pump.\n  Second, in addition to benefiting consumers, crude oil exports \nbenefit our economy here at home. Crude oil exports will increase \nrevenues and boost overall economic growth. It will help increase \nwages, create jobs, and improve our balance of trade. One area of our \neconomy that currently enjoys a favorable balance of trade is \nagriculture. That is because our farmers and our ranchers successfully \nmarket their products around the globe. Our crude oil producers can do \nthe same if they are given the opportunity. Local economies also \nbenefit. Service industries, retail, and other businesses and \ncommunities centered on oil development will see more economic activity \nand growth if this antiquated ban is lifted. Also, crude oil exports \nwill benefit our domestic industry, our energy industry, obviously.\n  The EIA's latest study concluded that lifting the ban will reduce the \ndiscount for light sweet crude oil produced in States such as North \nDakota, Texas, and others and encourage investment to expand domestic \nenergy production.\n  The drop in the price of oil this year has slowed domestic \nproduction. In our State of North Dakota, we continue to produce oil. \nIn fact, our State increased production in October to almost 1.17 \nmillion barrels a day. That is up a little bit from last month when we \nproduced about 1.16, but we are already down from our peak earlier this \nyear of 1.2 million barrels a day.\n  This goes back to what I am saying. We are in a fight to determine \nwho is going to produce oil and gas globally. Do we want that to be \nAmerica or would we prefer that to be OPEC, Russia, Venezuela, and some \nof our other adversaries?\n  Our producers are resilient, innovative, and highly competitive. They \nare developing new technologies and techniques to become more cost-\neffective and more efficient all the time. Allowing them to compete in \nthe global market will not only make us more inventive, more creative, \nand deploy better technologies but grow our economy and grow our \ndomestic oil and gas industry.\n  Of course, that means high-paying jobs for our people. According to a \nstudy by IHS, a global provider of industry data and analysis, lifting \nthe ban will attract an estimated $750 billion in new investments and \ncreate nearly 400,000 additional jobs in the United States between 2016 \nand 2030. I have seen studies that are actually higher. That is $750 \nbillion in private investment--not government spending, in private \ninvestment--to stimulate and grow our economy and 400,000 additional \njobs. Again, those are jobs in the private sector--not more \ngovernment--private sector jobs, economic growth, more revenue to help \nreduce the deficit and the debt without raising taxes. We know that \nfrom experience in North Dakota, where in recent years per capita \npersonal income has been growing faster than any other State in the \ncountry, not solely but in large part because of oil and gas \nproduction.\n  On a national level, crude oil exports will help to bring our energy \npolicy into the 21st century. The crude oil export ban is an economic \nstrategy that was implemented in the 1970s, and the world has changed \ndramatically since then. Back then, the conventional wisdom was that \nthere was a finite amount of oil in the world, and we pretty much knew \nwhere it was, and there were even alarms at that time that we were \ngoing to run out of oil. Barton Hinkle pointed out in Reason magazine \nthat as recently as 2005, the BBC asked: ``Is global oil production \nreaching a peak?''\n  In 2008, the Houston Chronicle declared: ``We are approaching peak \noil sooner than many people would have thought.''\n  Two years later, the New York Times reported on a group of \nenvironmentalists who ``argue that oil supplies peaked as early as 2008 \nand will decline rapidly, taking the economy with them.''\n\n[[Page S8710]]\n\n  Yet here we are. Nobody envisioned the kind of energy revolution we \nare seeing in the United States--in North Dakota, in Texas, and in \nother oil-and-gas-producing States--with new and creative technologies \nthat produce more energy with better environmental stewardship.\n  Back in 2011 I asked then-Interior Secretary Salazar to have the U.S. \nGeological Survey do a new study to update estimates of recoverable \nreserves in the Williston Basin. In April of 2013, the results came in \nand they were profound. The USGS found that there are approximately 7.4 \nbillion barrels of technically recoverable oil in the Williston Basin, \nwhich is more than twice the previous estimate. The upper end of that \nestimate is 11.4 billion barrels of recoverable oil. It is about twice \nthe USGS estimate made in April of 2008, which projected about 3.65 \nbillion recoverable barrels in the Bakken formation.\n  So my point is, in less than 5 years' time, with the new technology \nand development, we have more than doubled the amount of recovery oil \njust in the Williston Basin, in the North Dakota-Montana area, from \n3.65 billion barrels to 7.4 billion barrels, and we are just scratching \nthe surface.\n  The report also estimates there to be about 6.7 trillion cubic feet \nof undiscovered, technically recoverable natural gas, nearly three \ntimes the estimate 5 years earlier.\n  So again my point: We don't even drill for natural gas. We are \ndrilling for oil and we produce natural gas as a byproduct. And the \namount available is going up dramatically. As I say, the most recent \nestimate for natural gas, 3.67 trillion cubic feet, is more than double \nthe amount just 5 years earlier. That is what technology is doing with \nthe resource. This is the opportunity we have.\n  Recoverable oil projections to date may be as little as several \npercentages of what is actually in the ground. That is the kind of \npotential we have. That is the kind of potential we have to depend on \nourselves for energy, not OPEC or anyone else.\n  I recently asked the USGS Director, Suzette M. Kimball, to update the \nmost recent assessments to provide more information on a new formation \nthat we are producing in North Dakota--the Tyler. That is because \nindustry advances in directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing have \ngreatly expanded the ability to access formerly difficult areas. As I \nsaid, the industry is working on a new formation--the Tyler formation.\n  I want to make one other point, too, and this goes to environmental \nstewardship. We are actually producing less greenhouse gas in the \ncountry today than we have in prior years. A big part of the reason is \nsomething called hydraulic fracturing because now, with hydraulic \nfracturing, we are producing so much more natural gas that we have low-\npriced, abundant natural gas, and as we use more of it we are actually \nreducing carbon emissions in the United States. So isn't it ironic that \nas we develop and deploy the new technologies to produce oil and gas \nmore efficiently, more economically, and more dependably, at the same \ntime, through hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling, we are \nalso doing so with better environmental stewardship.\n  Isn't that what American innovation and ingenuity is all about? Isn't \nthat the creativity that we unleash in the private sector, when we \ncreate a good business climate and we empower investment, rather than \nblock it with regulation and taxation and roadblocks and redtape that \ndoesn't make any sense? That is how we create that rising tide that \nlifts all boats. That is how we become the most powerful and dynamic \neconomy in the history of the world. That is how we create more jobs \nand opportunity for our people.\n  So now, just 10 years after some were lamenting the depletion of the \nworld's oil reserves, the model has shifted from scarcity to abundance, \nand we will need additional investments in technology, transportation, \nand energy infrastructure, such as pipelines, rail, roads, and other \nindustry needs to produce that energy. The good news is that the \nindustry will build the infrastructure, create the jobs, and produce \nthe energy we need if we just provide them with that good business \nclimate and that opportunity to do it. As I said, as they deploy those \nadvanced technologies, as they make that investment, they produce jobs, \neconomic growth, more tax revenue, without raising taxes, to help with \nthe debt and deficit, and they do so with better environmental \nstewardship. That is how we lead the world forward with better \nenvironmental stewardship, with American ingenuity, creativity, and \ninnovation.\n  Lifting the ban will create more domestic production and energy \ninfrastructure, which holds two key benefits. First, more domestic \nproduction and infrastructure means that in a national emergency, \nAmericans will not be dependent on the need for oil from elsewhere in \nthe world--places like OPEC. Americans do not want to return to \ndepending on OPEC for our energy.\n  The second benefit is that U.S. crude oil will provide strategic \ngeopolitical benefits for us and for our allies around the world. It \nwill provide our friends with alternative sources of oil and reduce \ntheir reliance on Russia, Venezuela, Iran, and other unstable parts of \nthe world for their vital energy needs.\n  As a further security advantage, adding more domestic supply will \nprovide a buffer against shortages going to volatile conflicts in the \nMiddle East and elsewhere around the globe. We finally have an \nopportunity to curb the disproportionate influence OPEC has had on the \nworld oil markets for almost half a century, and we need to capitalize \non it.\n  One final point on national security. We must recognize the \nimplications of the President's deal with Iran, which lifts sanctions \nagainst Iranian oil. That agreement will put 1 million barrels a day of \nIran's oil on the global market and billions of dollars in their \nTreasury. Does it make any sense at all to maintain a ban on U.S. oil \nexports while the President lifts a ban on Iranian oil exports? Of \ncourse not. Clearly, it does not. In fact, we should be maintaining the \nsanctions on Iran even as we lift the oil export ban on our producers.\n  The consensus among lawmakers and experts in the field of energy and \nnational security is evident: Lifting the ban on U.S. oil exports will \ncreate jobs, boost our economy, and bolster our national defense. It is \nsupported by studies done by the U.S. Energy Information \nAdministration, EIA--part of the Department of Energy--the nonpartisan \nBrookings Institute, and Harvard Business School.\n  Last week we held an Energy and Natural Resources Committee meeting \nto examine the link between terrorism and the global oil and gas \nmarket. The results were telling. Expert witnesses from such highly \nregarded, nonpartisan think tanks as the Center for a New American \nSecurity and IHS, a global provider of data and analysis, affirmed that \nlifting the oil export ban will enhance national \nsecurity. Representative of the general opinion in the hearing was \ntestimony by Dr. Sara Vakhshouri, a nonresident senior fellow at the \nAtlantic Council, who said that with the Middle East in turmoil and \nconfronting terrorist attacks and threats, it is important to have \nalternative resources and ``especially from the U.S.''\n\n  Jamie Webster, senior director at IHS, capped the issue, saying: ``We \nhave put out a couple of studies on the crude export issue and our \nfinding is that this is a clear win for the U.S. economy and also for \nenergy security. It's difficult to find a case where this is not a \npositive.''\n  The ban on crude oil exports is an anachronism, a solution to a \nproblem that no longer exists owing to the innovation of the American \nenergy industry. At this time in our history, all the circumstances \nargue for lifting the ban. Americans need jobs, the economy needs a \nfree market boost, and the American people deserve the security of \nknowing that in an emergency, we have a reliable and abundant source of \nenergy as well as the infrastructure to deliver it. Lifting the ban on \ncrude exports is an idea whose time has come. Let's get it done.\n  I am very pleased to see my esteemed colleague from the great State \nof Texas, the only State that produces more oil than my home State of \nNorth Dakota, but we are working hard, and you know when you are in \nsecond position, you always run a little harder, work a little harder. \nWe are hot after them, but I must say they do an amazing job down \nthere. His leadership on\n\n[[Page S8711]]\n\nthis issue has been tremendous because he understands it is not only \nimportant for the Lone Star State, but it is important for our country.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, while the Senator from North Dakota is \nstill here, let me just say that he gave a speech that I wish I could \nhave given. I couldn't say it any better than he did, but I will just \nmake one point as he is preparing to leave the floor.\n  Some people wonder why is it that the Texas economy is doing so well \nrelative to the rest of the country. Last year, 2014, our economy grew \nat 5.2 percent. The U.S. economy grew at 2.2 percent. Now the fact that \nwe are producing energy using the techniques the Senator from North \nDakota talked about--fracking and horizontal drilling--fracking, by the \nway, has been around for 70 years or more--that has helped contribute \nto job creation and our economic growth. This is something we would \nlike to see expand across the country.\n  We have been blessed, as has the Senator from North Dakota, with \nabundant natural resources. What we are asking to be able to do is to \nsell those to willing buyers overseas. Many of them are some of our \nclosest allies, who are being terrorized by thugs such as Vladimir \nPutin, who uses energy as a weapon. Think about how powerful this would \nbe in our national security toolbox to be able to sell natural gas and \ncrude oil to some of our closest allies so they don't have to rely on \npeople like Mr. Putin.\n  I congratulate the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Hoeven, for his \nleadership on this issue. We have all worked together on it, and it has \nbeen a team effort, and we are close to getting it done.\n  The final point I want to make is that this is not just about energy-\nproducing States, this is a net positive for the United States and for \nour allies abroad.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Will the Senator from Texas yield for just a minute?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I want to pick up on that last point. It is particularly \nimportant when you consider this legislation that this bill just \ndoesn't benefit the oil-and-gas-producing States, it really benefits \neverybody when you think about all of the infrastructure and the \nmaterials, the equipment that goes into producing that energy. When you \ntalk about drilling down 10,000 feet, 2 miles underground, and drilling \nout 3 miles in multiple directions; when you talk about the equipment \nthat is needed to do that, the tanks, the transportation; when you talk \nabout all the things--the research, development, engineering--that go \ninto it, I doubt there is a State in the Union that isn't touched by \nthis energy industry. That is something I think all of our Members have \nto keep in mind when we look at this legislation. It is not just about \nenergy-producing States, it is about all of us in terms of the economy, \nand it is about all of us in terms of national security. We are the \nones leading forward with the newest technology that will leave the \nenvironment with better stewardship.\n  I am glad the Senator actually brought up that point, and I hope our \ncolleagues will keep that in mind as we bring forward this legislation.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, there is another benefit that spreads \nevenly among Americans, and that is low gasoline prices. The single \ndriver for low gasoline prices is the supply of oil. Because of the \nabundant supply of oil due to innovation and these techniques the \nSenator from North Dakota talked about, oil prices are lower than they \nhave been in a long time.\n  You can buy a gallon of gasoline in Texas for well under $2. I think \nI saw it as cheap as $1.80 or maybe lower than that in some places. \nThat has a direct impact on the pocketbook of working families. That is \nanother reason why this legislation needs to be passed on Friday of \nthis week in the House and in the Senate. I thank the Senator from \nNorth Dakota for this brief discussion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/senate-section/article/S8711-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8711-S8712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WORKING TOGETHER IN THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor and talk \nabout what we have been able to accomplish this year because sometimes \nI think people, when they hear us talk, think we are somehow claiming \ncredit where credit is not entirely due or whether we are trying to \nmake this purely a partisan matter. It is not, but it does require good \nleadership.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, having been speaker of the house in \nNorth Carolina, the people who set the agenda--that is a pretty \nimportant power. All of the legislation that has passed this year would \nnot have passed if it weren't for the majority leader, Senator \nMcConnell, under the new majority scheduling it for a vote in the \nSenate and chairmen in the relevant committees processing that \nlegislation at the committee level and making it available for floor \nconsideration.\n  It is not just the Republican majority. Time after time, we have seen \nRepublicans and Democrats working together hand in glove to try to pass \nlegislation that is good for the American people. We saw that on the \nEducation reform bill, where Senator Murray and Senator Alexander \nworked so closely together. We saw it on the highway bill--the first \nmultiyear highway bill in a decade--where the Senator from California, \nMrs. Boxer, working together with Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma and the \nmajority leader, worked to really turn things around in the House of \nRepresentatives, to give them the space and time to pass a multiyear \nhighway bill and to work with us to reconcile the differences and get \nit to the President. That is pretty important.\n  I was on the phone earlier today talking with some of the folks at \nthe Austin American-Statesman about the impact on the traffic situation \nwe have on I-35. It is a veritable parking lot during many times of the \nday. People understand the importance of taking care of infrastructure \nand maintaining it but also expanding it so people can get from point A \nto point B, but more importantly, what that means in terms of the \nenvironment and their quality of life.\n  So my simple point is that there is a big difference to the way this \nChamber operated under the Democratic leader, when Senator Reid was \nmajority leader, back when our friends across the aisle were in the \nmajority. The statistic has been mentioned that there were 15 rollcall \nvotes on amendments. We have had more than 200 so far this year alone. \nFrankly, I think our Democratic friends like the way the Senate has \nbeen operating under the current majority more than they did when they \nwere in the majority because under the dysfunction of the previous \nmajority, even Democrats in the majority weren't able to get votes on \nthe amendments. When they stood before the voters, people asked ``What \nhave you done?'' and they didn't have much to show except dysfunction.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, whether it is North Carolina or other \nplaces around the country, we got a number of new Senators as a result \nof that misguided dysfunction, which was calculated but I think proved \nto be a miscalculation.\n  It is a good thing to see the Senate operating again in the interests \nof the American people. We have had a pretty busy session. I am not \nclaiming it was perfect. Frustrations abound. It is in the nature of \ndivided government.\n  The legislative process was designed by our Founding Fathers in the \nConstitution to be hard because they actually saw the concentration of \npower as a threat to their freedom and their liberty, and they didn't \nwant an efficient Federal Government. They wanted checks and balances. \nThey wanted checks between the various branches, between the two \nbranches of the legislature, and also checks and balances with regard \nto the allocation of power to the Federal Government relative to the \nStates and individuals. All of that separation of power was designed to \nrequire deliberation and to require transparency and the building of \nconsensus before legislation was passed that would have an impact on \ntheir lives.\n  It has been a good thing to see the Senate working again, and I think \nall of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, can be proud of some of the \nwork we have done.\n  One of the things I am most proud of this year is the fact that we \nwere able to pass a bill called the Justice for Victims of Trafficking \nAct by 99 to 0. This\n\n[[Page S8712]]\n\nwas the first legislation that actually provided a crime victims \ncompensation fund to help provide grants to victims of human \ntrafficking. As I have described before on this floor, the typical \nprofile of a victim of human trafficking is a young girl between the \nages of 12 and 14. We need to have resources available for people with \nbig hearts in communities all across this country to help rescue these \nvictims of trafficking and help them recover their lives and get on \nwith their lives in a more productive and safe manner. This is one of \nthe things we have done together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/senate-section/article/S8712-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PARIS CLIMATE CHANGE AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Now, Mr. President, I want to spend a few minutes talking \nabout some of the things on which I don't think we are going to be able \nto find political consensus. That has to do with the President's moving \nup his list of priorities. Among all the other things that are going on \nin the world, he seems to be saying that climate change is the most \nurgent challenge facing the United States and the world. I worry a \nlittle bit any time I hear a politician--or anybody, for that matter--\nmaking sort of messianic claims. The President characterized the \nagreement in Paris--and I will talk more about the nature of that \nagreement--``a turning point for the world.'' It strikes me that it \ntakes quite a bit of hubris and really arrogance to be claiming that \nyes, this is going to be a turning point for the world. As a matter of \nfact, the Wall Street Journal said that it pays to be skeptical of a \npolitician who claims to be saving the planet.\n  I don't share the President's priorities when it comes to climate \nchange because I think there are actually more urgent priorities, such \nas fighting terrorism both abroad and here at home. That would be a \nmore urgent priority. Some of the other more prosaic work we do here is \npretty important to the quality of lives of the American people and to \nthe economy, our ability to create an environment where they can find \nwork and provide for their families. I think those needs are more \nurgent.\n  Nevertheless, the President seems to be once again exaggerating what \nhis authority is under our Constitution. Of course, the President has \nno legal authority to bind his successor. What he seems to be saying is \n``This is an agreement between me and the 140-some-odd nations,'' and \nit won't last beyond his Presidency. Last time I checked, the President \nwill be leaving the White House sometime in January 2017. What he has \npurported to do is enter into an agreement that would somehow bind his \nsuccessor and would somehow bind the Congress and the American people. \nBut under our Constitution, this President--no President has any \nauthority to do anything like that.\n  So it is clear that this agreement has been crafted in a way that \ngives some of the countries that are parties to the agreement more \nleeway than others. Some major economies don't have to play by the same \nrules that the United States would.\n  This agreement represents the President once again trying to claim \nauthority he simply does not have. We don't have a king. In America, we \nmade that decision a long time ago. I think it was 1787 when we decided \nwe would not have a king, but the President seems to act like a monarch \nand claim authorities from some source other than the Constitution. It \nseems unbelievable that after the Obama administration has failed to \nfind support for so many of the President's overreaching regulations \nhere at home--not in the Congress, not in the State houses, not in the \ncourts--his response was to sign on to an agreement with the United \nNations that seeks to tax our use of energy. It is another attempt to \ndo an end run around the Constitution and around the American people.\n\n  What really frustrates me is the President's willingness to sacrifice \nour economy--job creation and the ability of people to find work and to \nprovide for their family--to promote a cause that offers no guarantee \nof a more resilient climate or a clean environment.\n  The President and some of his supporters frequently like to say: \nWell, people who don't regard climate change as a priority are anti-\nscience. I actually think people who think agreements such as this are \ngoing to provide the answer are anti-science.\n  First, if you start looking at some of the models that are used to \npredict temperatures decades and perhaps centuries out, this is not \nwhat you would call science, this is more like an economic projection \nor model, and we know how reliable they have been in the past.\n  I couldn't help but think about growing up and a book that I remember \nreading called ``The Population Bomb,'' which was written by a Stanford \nprofessor named Paul R. Ehrlich. The thesis of ``The Population Bomb'' \nwas that unless we did something to control population, millions of \npeople were going to starve to death because we were going to outstrip \nour food supply.\n  Well, obviously that didn't happen. One of the reasons it didn't \nhappen is because of a man by the name of Norman Borlaug, a Nobel Prize \nwinner, and now considered the father of the Green Revolution. By the \nway, he did spend a little bit of time at Texas A in Bryan College \nStation. But he was a very heroic figure who used science to help \nfigure out how to increase production of the food supply in a way that \nmade Paul Ehrlich's prediction a pipe dream. It just didn't happen.\n  I think that by predicting all these dire consequences, it is the \npredictors--it is the people who are embracing this sort of climate \nchange theology--who don't have any confidence in our ability to \ninnovate our way out of these problems.\n  I will use one more anecdote to try to make the point. At the start \nof the 20th century, horses in New York City were producing about 5 \nmillion pounds of manure a day. Can you imagine what an environmental \nhazard this would be with manure piled on vacant lots with rats? I will \nnot go into all the details; it is pretty repulsive to think about. But \nthere is a book called ``SuperFreakanomics,'' which uses this great \nexample. They said: Well, what happened to that? Instead of some \ngrandiose government policy or instead of some new tax or regulation \nthat government issued, what happened to that and the environmental \nhazard that presented was the internal combustion engine. So not \novernight, but apparently in short order, that manure was disposed of. \nHorses were replaced by cars.\n  Again, it is just another example of how American innovation, \ncreativity, and entrepreneurialism can take care of many of these \nproblems that some of our friends worry so much about and think should \nbe such an important priority for us. America's entrepreneurs have \nshown time and again that they are simply more adaptive and genius than \ngovernment regulators and bureaucrats.\n  By bypassing the American people and signing our country up for a bad \ninternational agreement that doesn't put our country first, we should \ninstead focus on finding innovative solutions that fit the diverse \nneeds of consumers, businesses, and a growing economy alike.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Across the United States this year, 118 law \nenforcement officers have paid the ultimate sacrifice.\n  In Colorado, we honor our four fallen officers: Sergeant Sean Renfro \nwith the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office, whose care and concern for \nothers did not end when he was off duty; Trooper Taylor Thyfault with \nthe Colorado State Patrol, an Army veteran and a cadet training to \nbecome a trooper and due to his bravery was honored as a trooper before \nbeing laid to rest; Jaimie Jursevics with the Colorado State Patrol, a \nnew mom and the victim of the careless actions of another; and Officer \nGarrett Swasey with the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs \nPolice Department, our most recent loss, as he responded to the \nsenseless attack in Colorado Springs.\n  Each of their legacies reflects an extraordinary Colorado spirit, \neach a cherished member of their community, leaving behind loved ones \nas they\n\n[[Page S8713]]\n\nworked to uphold the law and care for those around them. These heroes \nrisked their lives, and they showed the highest courage. And as we \nprepare our hearts and our homes for the holiday season, I hope we can \nall take a few moments to express our sincere gratitude for their \nservice and protection. In the best of times, patrolling the roadways, \nbeing present in our neighborhoods, and maintaining order can be a \ndifficult and dangerous duty. I am proud of the work the men and women \nwho make up each law enforcement office in Colorado carry out each and \nevery day. On watch in precincts, correctional facilities, and along \nour highways, they diligently fight to safeguard our State.\n  Colorado families, including mine, from the Eastern Plains to the \nWestern Slope remain safe in large part because of the work and valor \nof our law enforcement personnel. As the guardians of our communities, \nthey prepare to respond to things that most of society simply hope will \nnever happen to them. Lt. Col. Dave Grossman wrote that American law \nenforcement is the loyal and brave sheepdog, always standing watch for \nthe wolf that lurks in the dark.\n  With the recent events at home and abroad, we are reminded of the \nthreats that are hiding in the shadows and the dangers that police \nofficers confront each and every day. Yet they remain steadfast in \ntheir commitment to stand against evil.\n  I am personally grateful for the sacrifices they make and the \ncommitment they demonstrate to protect our State and our country. Their \ncourage and selfless service were exemplified in the recent tragedy in \nColorado Springs. As first responders, they are the first to encounter \nthe fear, the calls for help, and the danger, but in that fear and \ndanger, they provide hope and safety. Driven by courage and the desire \nto serve, they fulfill a great need throughout our communities. They \ncarry these values as they begin their watch each and every day when \nthey leave their family to protect mine and every other American. Their \nbadge identifies them as a source of help in vulnerable times, and \nbehind each badge of police officers, sheriff deputies, correctional \nofficers, and patrolmen and patrolwomen is a heart that extends beyond \nits own bounds.\n  Calling Colorado home rings truer when you also have the honor to \nsafeguard it. I am thankful for their service and thankful to the \nfamilies for their continued sacrifice. They are constantly in my \nfamily's thoughts and prayers, and we wish them each a safe and happy \nholiday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/senate-section/article/S8713-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8713-S8715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TAX BREAK EQUALITY\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, today is a great day to be an oil company \nin America. Not since August 27, 1859, when Edwin Drake drilled that \nfirst oil well in Titusville, PA, has there been a day as good for the \noil industry in our country as today.\n  Why is today a great day for Big Oil? Well, I will tell you. Last \nnight at 2 a.m., the Republican leadership released its spending bill. \nTucked into that bill on page 1,865 is a provision that would massively \nreshape our Nation's energy policy. Tucked into that bill is language \nthat would roll back longstanding U.S. law and allow the oil industry \nto sell American crude oil overseas for the first time in more than 40 \nyears.\n  If this becomes law, it means potentially $175 billion in new revenue \nfor the oil industry over the next decade, up to $500 billion in new \nrevenues for the oil industry over the next 20 years. That is why this \nprovision is in there. It is corporate welfare for the most profitable \nindustry in the history of the world, the oil industry.\n  What does this mean for the American people? Lifting the ban on the \nexportation of American oil so it goes overseas rather than staying \nhere in America. It will be a disaster for our economy, for our \nclimate, for our national security, and for our consumers. Do you \nremember the old mantra of the Republican Party, ``Drill here, drill \nnow, pay less''? Now they have changed it. Their new mantra is ``Drill \nhere, export there, pay more.''\n  The oil industry push to export American oil isn't about helping \nconsumers at the pump; it is about pumping up Big Oil's profits. When \nhas the oil industry ever pushed for policies that would drive down \nprices and their profits? These are for-profit corporations, not \ncharitable institutions. They are looking to make lots of new money off \nof selling oil around the world but not here in the United States.\n  If we allow this to happen, it will be a disaster for consumers in \nmany regions of the country--for example, the Northeast. The Department \nof Energy has said that losing our refineries on the east coast, which \ncould easily happen because of this new law, will lead to ``higher \nprices,'' ``higher price volatility,'' and the potential for \n``temporary [supply] disruptions'' in our region.\n  Right now consumers across America in 2015 are saving $700 because \ngasoline prices are so low and $500 on home heating oil because prices \nare so low. That is a stimulus, almost like a tax break in the pockets \nof working-class and poor Americans all across our country.\n  Exports would wipe out this economic stimulus for average Americans. \nIt would begin to lead to the higher prices that the oil industry \nwants, both on the global market and here in the United States of \nAmerica. And the new revenue the oil industry collects from exports is \nnot magically created out of thin air; it will be transferred from \nAmerican consumers and our domestic refiners into the pockets of the \nBig Oil companies in our country. This could amount to one of the \nlargest single energy taxes in the history of the world.\n  Remember, Saudi Arabia and their OPEC allies control the global oil \ntrade. They control the price that is paid on the global market, and \nrecently OPEC suggested oil prices may rise again next year, putting in \njeopardy the economic benefits that low gasoline prices and the low \nhome-heating oil prices have provided for average Americans.\n  Second, national security. Importing our oil while we export our \nyoung men and women abroad--that is what we have right now. We are \nimporting oil from Saudi Arabia, from Nigeria, from Algeria, from \nKuwait, and from Iraq. That is what happens every day. That is a big \nreason we have so many young men and women over in the Middle East \nprotecting those cargo ships of oil coming into our country. We still \nimport 5 million barrels of oil a day. China and the United States are \nthe largest importers.\n  We don't have oil to export. We are still importing 25 percent of our \noil into our country right now, and we are importing it from countries \nwe should not be importing that oil from. If we have a chance to back \nout that oil, to tell those countries we don't need their oil any more \nthan we need their sand, we are doing a big favor for our young men and \nwomen in uniform. We are allowing ourselves to step back and be more \ndispassionate in the decisions we make about our relationships with all \nof those countries.\n  What this decision says is we are going to export our own oil even as \nwe continue to import oil from the Middle East. This will only heighten \nour dependence upon oil coming in from countries that we should not be \nimporting oil from if we have a chance to back it out. That is what is \nwrong with this decision at its heart--oil. It is not like a widget. It \nis not like a computer chip. You don't fight wars over that. You fight \nwars over oil. That is why ISIS targets the part of Syria that it does. \nThat is why the part of Saudi Arabia that has the oil is the one now \nbeing jeopardized by rebels. That is why Libya is so valuable and being \nfought over--oil, oil, oil--and the revenues that they produce in order \nto then create that instability, create that jihadism that we are \ndealing with. We should be backing out all the oil we are importing \nfrom that region if we have a chance to do so, and we do, but not after \nthis bill passes. We are going to be in a situation where we basically \nare saying we are going to be permanently dependent upon that oil being \nimported from that region.\n  I listened last night to all the Republican candidates for President \ndebating in Las Vegas about national security. Well, that is what this \nis all about--this is all about that oil. This is all about that oil \nrevenue that goes into the pockets of people who should not\n\n[[Page S8714]]\n\nhave our money, who spend it in ways we don't feel good about.\n  In my opinion, this decision will dramatically weaken our national \nsecurity position, weaken our ability to be stronger in the Middle East \nbecause we are less dependent upon pretty much the only product they \nmake--oil--and would be able to deal with the national security issues \nin a much better way, being much more clear-eyed, dispassionate, and \nprotective of American interests and the interests of those we are \nallied with over the world.\n  Third, this is a tale of two tax breaks. One tax break is for Big \nOil. They get $7 to $8 billion a year in tax breaks, and it is \npermanent--permanent. What happened in this bill is that the $7 to $8 \nbillion for tax breaks for wind and solar are now going to be phased \nout. We hear constantly from Republicans out here on the floor that \nthey believe in ``all of the above.'' Well, you can't have ``all of the \nabove'' competing fairly if one industry--the oil industry--gets their \n$7 to $8 billion in tax breaks every year, and wind and solar--the \ntechnologies of the 21st century--are going to have their tax breaks \nphased out over the next 4 to 5 years. That is in this bill.\n  So the oil industry gets $500 billion in new revenues over the next \n20 years, $140 billion worth of tax breaks over the next 20 years, and \nwind and solar watch their tax breaks evaporate over the next 4 to 5 \nyears. Is that a good deal for America, for the climate, for our job \ncreation in America with jobs that are here in America? That is not a \ngood deal. By the way, Big Oil wants their tax breaks so they can \nexport the oil out of our country. Is that a good deal? It absolutely \nis not.\n  For the offshore wind industry, which has yet to be born, we need the \ntax breaks to incentivize companies--wind companies from around the \nworld--to come to the Northeast, to come to this incredible place which \nhas been called the Saudi Arabia of wind. Those tax breaks are going to \nphase out before an industry is even born--the offshore wind industry. \nDoes that make any sense? If we are going to give tax breaks to oil, we \nshould give tax breaks to the offshore wind industry. We should give \ntax breaks to all these renewable industries on a predictable basis for \nyears to come. That is not happening in this bill. It is just the \nopposite.\n  For national security, for equality, in terms of all energy resources \nbut especially those nonpolluting energy resources, there should be \nequality, but there is not. There is not. We could have an America with \n40 percent of all electricity being wind and solar by the year 2030, if \nwe kept the same tax breaks between now and 2030--40 percent. The 7 \npercent we would add in from hydropower and then the power that comes \nfrom nuclear power in our country, over 60 to 65 percent of all \nelectricity in America would be noncarbon polluting by the year 2030, \nbut the tax breaks for wind and solar are going away in 4 to 5 years. \nDoes that make any sense? No, not at all. That is what this bill does, \nand that is why this bill has that provision that was inserted late at \nnight a couple of nights ago that is on page 1,865 in this omnibus \nbill.\n  The Koch brothers wrote a letter to all Republicans a couple of days \nago. They said: Lift the ban on exportation of oil out of our country, \neven as we still import from the Middle East, and reduce and kill solar \nand wind tax breaks.\n  Good. We understand the agenda. It is in this bill, and it is not \ngood for America. It is not who we are. It is not this innovation \neconomy which we know is going to have the capacity, like we did with \ncell phones, to very briefly in history just move from this kind of a \nphone in 1996, when it never really existed in people's pockets \nanywhere on the planet, to this kind of phone and now 600 million \npeople in Africa have it today. We did that--America. We can do the \nsame thing with renewable energy, but we need to ensure that those tax \nbreaks are equal to oil's, for oil is the technology of the 19th \ncentury, the oil of the 20th century. We have to have a vision of what \nis possible here in the 21st century. This bill does not include that.\n  That is why it is being added to a must-pass bill. It could not pass \nif it was not in a must-pass bill with unrelated issues, unrelated \nappropriations. They needed it to carry it through because they could \nnot do it standing alone down here on the floor of the Senate.\n  So whether it be the impact on our economy, which is going to drive \nprices higher, or whether it be on our national security, it is going \nto increase our dependence upon imports from the Middle East. Whether \nit be the impact on consumers, where they are going to be paying higher \nprices, or whether it be the environment, where, believe it or not, by \nthe year 2025 this is going to lead to upward of 2 to 3 million new \nbarrels of oil per day being exported out of our country--that is the \nequivalent of building 150 coal-burning plants in our country \nand sending those emissions up into the sky.\n\n  Having a bill pass on the floor of the Senate in the same week that \nthe whole world came together in Paris and signed an agreement saying \nwe were going to have less greenhouse gases going up into the \natmosphere and that the United States was going to be the leader--we \ncannot tell the rest of the world to reduce their dependence on fossil \nfuels while we announce in the next week we are going to change our \npolicy and start drilling for 2 to 3 million new barrels just to export \nit out of our country and phase out the tax breaks for wind and solar \nas we tell the rest of the world they should be moving to wind and \nsolar. That does not work. You cannot preach temperance from a bar \nstool. You cannot preach temperance from an oil rig and tell other \ncountries to move to renewables. It just doesn't work that way. It \ndoesn't work that way. They might nod. They might say: Oh, don't worry. \nWe are still going to honor our commitments. But you know behind your \nback as a country they are just going to be saying: I see what they are \ndoing. We will start doing the same stuff. We will build a few more \ncoal-burning ones. We will burn more fossil fuels over here. If they \nare not sincere, why should we be sincere? If they can preach \ntemperance on Sunday and then on Wednesday say ``bingo'' in the church \nhall, we can do the same thing.\n  So I am just afraid that on every one of these lines this bill fails: \nenvironment, national security, consumers, and the economy. It is bad \nfor America. It is bad policy. We should feel better about our capacity \nto innovate.\n  I am especially concerned about wind. I am especially concerned about \noffshore wind. There is a reason we call ourselves the Saudi Arabia of \nwind. It is because we have the potential to back out the oil from \nSaudi Arabia. That is why. That is our metaphor because we know how \nmuch oil they have and how they have controlled the price of oil in the \nworld every single day since 40 years ago, when they decided to have \ntheir first oil embargo. That is when we put this law on the books that \nwe would never export our oil again. We would keep it here.\n  It is 40 years later. The Middle East is in chaos. It is hard for \nanyone to even describe what the future for the Middle East is going to \nbe. How many of these leaders are actually even going to be in place in \n5 years? No one in the world knows, but we do have one thing. We have \nour own domestic energy source, wind--natural gas, wind, and solar. We \nshould keep it here to protect ourselves. It will make us a better \npartner with the rest of the world. If we are totally strong, we can \nproject our power diplomatically, economically much better than we are.\n  So for me this is a historic day. I understand what Big Oil wants to \ndo. I understand what the Republicans want to do. Our leader Harry Reid \ndid his absolute best to get the best deal he could for the renewable \nenergy sources that we have, to stand up as long as he could these tax \nbreaks. He did a good job, but the pressure was on him from the \nRepublicans. Unfortunately, in this agreement, the wind and solar tax \nbreaks will expire. Wind tax breaks expire very soon.\n  From my perspective, we should have this debate out here soon. We \nshould have a debate about the Middle East. We should have a debate \nabout oil, about our national security, about our role in the future. \nIt is time for us to have the big debates out here, the big debates in \nprime time, with everyone participating and everyone understanding that \nthe rest of this century is going to be about the United States over in \nthe Middle East. Whether we\n\n[[Page S8715]]\n\nlike it or not, from the day we invaded Iraq, that was our destiny. So \nlet's have those big debates. In the center of that has to be oil and \nthe revenues that are fueling so much of what is happening over there.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for giving me the opportunity to speak \ntoday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner).

Mr. President, I couldn't help overhearing my friend from \nMassachusetts talking about something really good that is going to \nhappen; that is, we are going to lift the caps off our exports on oil \nand gas.\n  I just can't understand why we ever had caps on exports. It seems \nlike this administration is perfectly willing not just to approve of \nbut to encourage countries like Iran and Russia to export their oil and \nhelp them and yet preclude us from doing the same thing. Right now one \nof the problems we have with Russia is they have a hand up on us \nbecause there are so many countries over there dependent on them for \ntheir ability to have energy. It is just pretty amazing that is going \non.\n  So I am really glad. Hopefully, this will go through. I know in my \nState of Oklahoma it has cost literally hundreds of jobs in just three \ncompanies because they could no longer afford to drill here.\n  That is a big issue. I remember I was invited to Lithuania back when \nthe President of Lithuania wanted to dedicate and open their first \nterminal so that they would be able to import gas and oil, some of that \nbeing from us. Everyone there was so joyous of the fact that they were \nnot going to have to rely on Russia any longer, that they could rely \nmore on us. We do have friends out there whom we want to be able to \ntake care of.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/senate-section/article/S8715-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8715-S8716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PARIS CLIMATE CHANGE AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this past weekend, the officials from the \nadministration traveled 3,800 miles to Paris to attend the \ninternational climate negotiations in Paris. As a reminder, this is a \nprogram that has been going on now for 21 years. The ones who started \nthis whole idea that the world is coming to an end because of global \nwarming came from the United Nations.\n  I have gone to several of these meetings. I didn't go to this one \nbecause even John Kerry, our Secretary of State, said publicly that \nthere is not going to be anything binding. If there is nothing binding, \nthen why are they even there? In fact, it was interesting because when \nhe made that statement, President Hollande of France was outraged. He \nsaid: He must have been confused when he said that. But that changed \nthe whole thing. It was on November 11 that he made that statement.\n  Anyway, they went ahead and they had their 21st annual conference. I \nremember one of them I went to. I ran into a friend of mine from a West \nAfrican country.\n  I said: Luke, what are you doing here? Why are you over here? You \ndon't believe all this stuff, do you, on global warming?\n  He said: No, but we stand to be able to bring back literally billions \nof dollars to Benin, West Africa. Besides that, this is the biggest \nparty of the year.\n  The worst thing they said happened at the South America meeting 3 \nyears ago was they ran out of caviar. Anyway, we are paying for all \nthat stuff. When they went over and said that wonderful things were \ngoing to happen in Paris, we knew it wasn't going to happen.\n  The COP21 conference has nothing do with saving the environment. With \nno means of enforcement and no guarantee of funding as developed \ncountries had hoped, the deal will not reduce emissions and it will \nhave no impact on global temperatures.\n  When they say they had this historic meeting, everyone was scratching \ntheir heads wondering: What happened? Did they win anything at all?\n  James Hansen is the scientist who is credited with being the father \nof global warming. I can remember when I got involved with the issue \nwhen they came back from Kyoto and wanted to ratify a treaty, and that \nwas at the turn of the century, 1998. James Hansen has been working on \nglobal warming--he is a NASA scientist--for years. It goes all the way \nback to the eighties. He characterized what happened in an interview he \nhad with the British newspaper the Guardian. He said the agreement is a \nfraud. Here is the guy who is the father of global warming, and he said \nit is a fraud and it doesn't accomplish anything. This is likely \nbecause the only guaranteed outcome from the Paris agreement is \ncontinued growth in emissions.\n  According to a study from the MIT Joint Program on the Science and \nPolicy of Global Change, global emissions will increase by 63 percent \nthrough--that is assuming that everyone complies with their \ncommitments, which obviously they will not and they can't--global \nemissions will increase by 63 percent through 2050 compared to the year \n2010. By the end of this century, the MIT study projects, \ntemperatures--if they were successful--would only be reduced by 0.2 \ndegrees Celsius.\n  Even the 26 to 28 percent greenhouse gas emission reductions which \nPresident Obama committed to on this agreement is really a fraud. There \nis an environmentalist witness who came before our committee. He was \nthe Sierra Club's former general counsel, and his name is David \nBookbinder. He testified before the Senate Environment and Public Works \ncommittee--the one that I chair--this year saying that the President's \npower plan does not add up to the 26 to 28 percent target; it is \ntotally unattainable.\n  When asked to explain the targets in corresponding regulatory actions \nto Congress, the key administration officials refused to do that.\n  In fact, something happened. It may be the first time this has \nhappened. People wonder how the unelected bureaucracies go off and do \nthings that are not in keeping with the majority of the American \npeople, and we see this all the time. To preclude that from happening, \nevery bureaucracy has a committee in the Senate and in the House that \nis supposed to be watching what they are doing and they are supposed to \nbe overseeing. They have jurisdiction, just like my committee has \njurisdiction over the EPA. I tried to get them to come in and tell us \nwhen it was announced by President Obama that they were going to \npropose the 26 to 28 percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2025, and \nthey refused to testify.\n  I would ask the Chair, in the years you have been here, have you ever \nseen a bureaucracy refuse to come before the committee that has the \njurisdiction? They did. We are the authority in Congress to approve \nsuch--it has not only not pledged the money that has been committed as \nour price to pay, we haven't actually appropriated any money at all.\n  So while proclaimed as historic, this agreement did little to \novercome the longstanding obstacle that has plagued international \nclimate agreements from the start where responsibility is unequally \ndivided between the developed and the developing world.\n  I can remember back in about 1999, I guess it was, around the Kyoto \ntime, we had a vote here, and I was involved in that vote. It was \ncalled the Chuck Hagel and Bob Byrd vote. It said that if you come back \nfrom any of these places where you are putting this together with a \ntreaty--whether it is Kyoto or another treaty--we will not vote to \nratify a treaty that either is bad for the economy of America or \ndoesn't treat China and the developing countries the same as it treats \nus. That passed 95 to 0. So when they go over and come back, it is dead \non arrival. The thing is, everyone knows it except for the 192 \ncountries that were over there. So we can't figure out why they would \ncall this a historic event.\n\n  While the administration is pushing forward with economically \ndisastrous climate regulations before the end of his Presidency, China \ngets to continue business as usual, including emissions growth through \n2030--each year. That is about 15 years of increase. They\n\n[[Page S8716]]\n\ncame back saying: Well, we have to increase our CO2 \nemissions for 15 more years.\n  Yesterday morning, just 3 days after India signed off on the final \nParis agreement, the Guardian--that is the big newspaper in London--\nreported that India is targeting to more than double its output of 1.5 \nbillion tons through 2020 because ``coal provides the cheapest energy \nfor rapid industrialization that would lift millions out of poverty.''\n  At the historic meeting they had, the top official from India's Coal \nMinistry said:\n\n       Our dependence on coal will continue. There are no other \n     alternatives available.\n\n  India is not alone; there are numerous other countries that will \ncontinue to do that.\n  Even though the temperature level set is misleading, a 1.5-degree cap \non global temperature increase is no more realistic or technologically \nfeasible than the 2 degrees they used before this.\n  The fine print remains the same. For any agreement to have legal \nsignificance within the United States, it has to be ratified by the \nSenate. People in other countries don't know that. They think someone, \nparticularly a very strong President like President Obama--that he can \njust pretty much mandate anything he wants. It doesn't work that way in \nthe United States.\n  In what was literally the final hour--this is very interesting--they \nhad to delay the announcement of their agreement by 2 hours because \nthey wanted to make one change in the agreement. They had language that \nsaid ``developed country''--that is us, the United States--``parties \nshall continue taking the lead by undertaking economy-wide. . . .'' and \nthen explained how to do it. They wanted to replace the ``shall'' with \n``should'' because they discovered in their discussions that if they \nleft ``shall'' in there, it would have to come to the U.S. Senate for \nratification, and they would all be embarrassed because we would know \nwhat the results of that would be.\n  Missing from the administration's top 21 celebratory speeches is the \nfact that neither the American people nor the U.S. Senate supports the \ninternational agreement and that the centerpiece regulatory \ncommitment--the so-called Clean Power Plan--faces significant legal \nobstacles in the Congress--in fact, not just obstacles, but it has \nalready been voted on. There is a CRA--that is the Congressional Review \nAct--and the Congressional Review Act is saying that we are going to \nreject the Clean Power Plan, and it passed with an overwhelming \nmajority of Democrats and Republicans in the House. What they agreed on \nhas already been rejected.\n  Missing from almost all of the Paris agreement coverage before and \nafter is that the basis for this agreement is not scientific but \npolitical. Ninety percent of the scientists do not believe the world is \ncoming to an end because of global warming, as environmental NGOs and \nthe U.S. administration officials claim.\n  A Wall Street Journal op-ed examined what constituted this \nmisrepresentation of 97 percent. We always hear that 97 percent of the \nscientists say that this is true; it must be true. Anytime you have \nsomething that is unpopular, if you keep saying over and over again \nthat the science is settled, a lot of people out there believes it is. \nBut when they did the analysis of the 97 percent consensus and \nexplained it, it was simply based on fractions of respondents. For \nexample, in a commonly cited 2009 survey of over 3,100 respondents, \nonly 79 were counted because they claimed their expertise was solely \nclimate-related.\n  Well, the 97 percent consensus was reviewed just a few weeks ago by \none of the news stations in their poll----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The poll found that 97 percent of Americans don't care \nabout global warming when stacked against issues such as terrorism, \nimmigration, health care, and the economy. I remember when it used to \nbe the No. 1 concern of Americans, and following the same March Gallup \npoll over the years, it has gone from No. 1 or No. 2 over that period \nof time to No. 15--dead last. They have a lot of work to do, and it is \nnot going to work.\n  Before I yield the floor, let me thank my friend from Connecticut for \nall of his help last night. We worked late, and we did the right thing. \nI appreciate that very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am pleased and honored to follow my \ncolleague from Oklahoma, and I extend my thanks to him for his \ncooperation on the legislation we did last night by unanimous consent, \nwhich I was pleased to support eventually and work with him to reach a \nresolution on.\n  (The further remarks of Mr. Blumenthal are printed in today's Record \nduring consideration of S.

Mr. President, I recently traveled to my hometown of \nGillette, WY. I am usually in Wyoming most weekends, but I get to my \nhometown only about every other month because I have a huge State to \ncover. I happened to get there when the senior citizens were having \ntheir annual crafts gala. As I wandered through, looking at all of the \nmarvelous things they had done, I was shown a Christmas ornament \nspecifically designed for our county. I was asked if I could take it \nand a message to our President. Of course I agreed, and today I want to \nshare that message and that ornament with my fellow Senators.\n  That is what it looks like on the tree.\n  The letter says:\n\n       Dear Mr. President,\n       We seniors of Gillette, Campbell County, Wyoming, want to \n     send you this Christmas ornament that reflects the support of \n     many programs in our community. Without the coal and oil \n     industries, Campbell County would not have such a wonderful \n     school system or the outstanding programs for seniors. The \n     Campbell County Senior Center provides hot lunches for \n     seniors Monday through Friday and serves about 100 (or more) \n     every day. It also offers numerous other activities such as \n     ceramics, painting, exercise classes, social activities, \n     computer classes, day trips to local points of interest, and \n     assistance in completing forms for government programs. We \n     feel the Campbell County Senior Center is the Cadillac of all \n     senior centers.\n       The coal and oil industries not only support Campbell \n     County but they support the whole State of Wyoming. Much of \n     the tax dollars generated by the coal and oil industries are \n     distributed throughout Wyoming. When your administration \n     tries so hard to close down these industries, it not only \n     affects the thousands of families in Campbell County but it \n     affects the whole state. Although we realize there are valid \n     concerns about global warming and environmental issues in our \n     country, we want to testify that the coal and oil industries \n     in our county are environmentally conscience and they work \n     hard to beautify the land here.\n       The people of Wyoming not only receive but they also give \n     freely. If there is anyone in need here, the people step \n     forward and give their time, talents, and resources. If every \n     state in this country would give as Wyoming does, there \n     wouldn't be any hunger or homelessness.\n       We have enclosed some photos to show you a few of the \n     programs offered to children, seniors, and families in \n     Campbell County. We ask that you please take the time to look \n     at them. We would also like to invite you to visit Campbell \n     County to see the wonderful community we have. Visit our \n     open-pit coal mines and our oil industry along with the \n     various forms of wildlife that share this land.\n       Thank you for taking the time to listen to the concerned \n     seniors of Gillette, Wyoming.\n       May God Bless You and Your Family!\n\n  The letter is dated November 17, 2015. At the end of the letter is a \nlist of a number of the seniors who signed the letter. I ask unanimous \nconsent that their names be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Thomas W.

Hart, Fays \n     Coleman.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I have taken a closer look at the ornament \nthat they gave me to give to the President. We are not only the energy \ncapital of Wyoming, but we are also the energy capital of the Nation. \nWe produce 40 percent of the Nation's coal, and the reason we produce \n40 percent of the Nation's coal is that this coal is cleaner than \nanywhere else. Powder River Basin coal is lower in sulfur and other \nchemicals, and they have even found ways to improve the way it \noperates. If some of the money from the Department of Energy were used \nas an incentive for cleaning up coal, it could be done much better.\n  Our university, again using money from the energy business, is also \nworking on a few projects. One of them is to use solar power to \nseparate hydrogen out of water and burn the hydrogen with coal to make \nit burn better and cleaner.\n  We have five powerplants in my county, and we love to talk people \ninto coming to Campbell County. We are successful at getting senior \nstaffers, from both Republican and Democratic offices, to come each \nyear to take a look at what it is like in that part of the country. The \nbiggest comment that all of them make as they leave is that they had no \nidea that it could be that clean. They thought the coal mines would be \ndirty.\n  I ran into that when I went to the first global warming conference in \nJapan. I went there early, as the negotiations were starting, and I \nguess I was one of the first people to show up in a suit, so people \nwere leaping over tables and everything to interview me. I usually \ndon't do that. I ask what their circulation is in Wyoming, and of \ncourse in Japan it was zero, so I didn't do any interviews. But one of \nthe big papers in Tokyo was so interested that I wouldn't do an \ninterview that they sent a reporter to Wyoming. They called first and \nasked if it would be OK if he came and traveled with me for a day. I \nsaid that it would be fine as long as he also visited a coal mine and \npowerplant.\n  He came and traveled with me, and he had no idea of the distances \nthat we have between the few people that we have in Wyoming. We are the \nleast populated State in the Nation. He also followed through on \nvisiting the coal mine and powerplant. Again, he had the same comment. \nHe couldn't believe it could be done so cleanly and so well.\n  In the early days of the coal mines coming in, people said they would \nnever able to reclaim that land because we have such low moisture in \nWyoming. We are actually considered high desert. In fact, the eastern \npart of that State has the most desert. God didn't put anything above \nthe ground. He put it all under the ground, and part of it is coal \nunder 80 feet of dirt, which is considered nothing in the coal mining \nbusiness. So we have been able to mine the coal with this open pit and \nto reclaim it.\n  Now it is fun to take people out to see one of these mines because \nwhen you get to it, they say: Don't let them tear up that part over \nthere. We say: That is where the mine used to be. This is where it is \ngoing to be. They then say: Oh, go ahead and tear that up because it \nlooks better after they put everything back in its place.\n  It could be done better yet, but there are some requirements in the \nreclamation that it has to be put back the way that it was, and that \nputs some constraints on it. Nobody would move millions of tons of dirt \non a farm or ranch and put it back exactly the way it was, down to \nwhere the rocks are placed.\n  We have a product that is used nationally and that the Chinese would \nlike to use. Did you know that during the Olympic games in China they \nhad to fire out rockets that would go to a fairly high altitude and \nthen spread out some chemicals that would clean the air so that it \nwould look nice on television? They are extremely interested in getting \nCampbell County coal shipped to them so they can burn that in their \npowerplants and clean their air.\n  It is the least expensive form of energy there is, and I am talking \nabout just one of the forms of energy. We also have oil, which results \nin natural gas and coalbed methane. This little symbol is a uranium \nsymbol. We also produce most of the Nation's uranium in our \ncounty. That could be used more extensively to provide clean power and \nas a source for agriculture as well, including raising bison.\n\n  So I wanted to share this Christmas ornament with all of my \ncolleagues and echo what the seniors have said and suggest that America \nis the most innovative country in the world and if we have a problem, \nwe can solve it. A little bit of incentive can go a long way. We are an \ninventive country. A little bit of incentive has gone a long way a lot \nof times.\n  We actually have had some private companies that are talking about \nrestocking the space station. We have the plane that was powered by \nbicycle pedals that crossed the English Channel. If we can do those \nsorts of things, there is no limit to what can be done.\n  We have to quit discouraging inventiveness and encourage the use of \nthe resources we have.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for such time as I consume, not to exceed 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/senate-section/article/S8717-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8717-S8720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OMNIBUS SPENDING BILL\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise to address the 2,000-page, \ntrillion-dollar-plus, year-end omnibus spending bill--drafted behind \nclosed doors, away from public view, with only a limited number of \npeople involved. Members of the Senate and Members of the House were \nunaware of what deals were being cut and what decisions were being \nmade. I believe it contains provisions that will cause material harm to \nAmerican workers--I just do--and to matters involving this legislation \nthat I have worked on for years. I am very disappointed. Actually, I am \ndeeply disappointed.\n  This bill contains dramatic changes to Federal immigration law that \nwould increase, by as much as four-fold, the number of low-wage foreign \nworkers provided to employers under the controversial H-2B visa \nprogram. It has been a matter of controversy for a number of years. It \nhas been added to this bill without hearings and without an open \nprocess in the Senate. These foreign workers are brought in exclusively \nto fill blue-collar, low-wage, nonfarm jobs--not agricultural jobs--in \nhotels and in restaurants and on construction sites, in amusement \nparks, landscaping, truck driving, and in many other occupations--jobs \nbeing sought by millions of Americans around this country. Millions are \ntaking those jobs every day.\n  When we go into hotels and restaurants, are not Americans doing those \njobs? H-2B workers are supposed to be here to fill seasonal jobs that \nAmericans allegedly ``won't do.'' That is what they say--those who want \nmore, cheaper labor.\n  Even those they are supposed to be temporary positions, foreign H-2B \nworkers are allowed to bring their spouses and their children with \nthem--which, of course, results in costs being incurred by local \ncommunities, hospitals, and schools across the country. Although the \nalien's spouse and children are not supposed to work in the United \nStates, I don't think anyone is under the illusion that this \nadministration has any intention--or previous ones, for that matter--to \ndo anything to stop them from working if they want to, nor will they be \ndeported if they violate the terms of their employment, nor will they \nbe removed if they overstay the visa they have been given.\n  Hotels have good jobs. Construction has good jobs. As to landscaping, \nthere is a group that does my lawn in Alabama. Three African-American \nmen come out and work on our lawn in a fairly short period of time, \nusing good equipment. The head person is in his 40s and had 20 years in \nthe Army. What do people mean that Americans won't do this work?\n  At a time of record immigration, we do not appreciate the scope of \nit. We already have the highest number of foreign-born individuals in \nAmerican history. We are not against immigration. Immigration is a \npositive thing--properly conducted. Good people come into\n\n[[Page S8718]]\n\nAmerica. But we are at record levels both in total numbers and, in a \nfew years, the highest percentage of foreign-born in America will be \nreached, and it will continue thereafter. So is it any wonder that 83 \npercent of the electorate wants immigration either frozen or reduced?\n  The Republican-led Congress is about to deliver the President a \nfourfold increase in one of the most controversial foreign worker \nprograms we have. In fact, it is a much larger version of a proposal \nthat was contained in the Gang of 8 comprehensive immigration bill that \nwas rejected by the American people and the House of Representatives \njust 2 years ago. The result is higher unemployment and lower wages for \nAmericans. The free market controls--more labor, lower wage; more \nlabor, less job opportunity. It is indisputable.\n  The Economic Policy Institute has noted: ``Wages were stagnant or \ndeclining for workers in all of the top 15 H-2B occupations between \n2004 and 2014,'' and ``unemployment rates increased in all but one of \nthe top 15 H-2B occupations between 2004 and 2014, and all 15 \noccupations averaged a very high unemployment rate . . . Flat and \ndeclining wages, coupled with such high unemployment rates over such a \nlong period of time, suggests a loose labor market and an over-supply \nof workers rather than an under supply.''\n\n  I think that is a fact. Our free market friends ought to understand \nthat.\n  It is worth noting that the civilian labor force participation rate \nis currently at around 62.5 percent, a low that we have not seen in \nnearly four decades. Labor participation rate means the percentage of \nworkers in the working ages that actually have a job. It is the lowest \nrate we have had in four decades.\n  Nevertheless, despite this low labor force participation rate, this \nprovision in the omnibus bill would exempt from the statutory limit, \nwhich is now 66,000 H-2B workers a year--any worker who was present in \nthe United States during the three previous years. Thus, instead of \n66,000 foreign workers, the bill would allow up to 264,000 foreign \nworkers to be present in the United States on H-2B visas. That is over \na quarter of a million low-wage, low-skilled workers brought in to \noccupy blue-collar jobs. That may be good for certain businesses that \nnow have a large number of workers, because they don't have to raise \nwages and change working conditions and raise benefits to attract and \nkeep workers. They can just bring in people from abroad who are \nthankful to get any good cash-income job at lower wages.\n  This is bad for struggling American workers trying to get by and take \ncare of their families. It is particularly bad, as economist after \neconomist has shown, for minorities, including African Americans and \nHispanics, and recent immigrants who are here lawfully looking to try \nto get a little better wage with a little better retirement and health \ncare benefits. This is going to help them? Give me a break.\n  On top of this provision, this omnibus bill approves, without any \nconditions--the President's request for increased refugee admissions, \nallowing him to bring in as many refugees as he wants. He can do that. \nIt is hard to believe, but he is allowed to do so. He simply has to \nnotify Congress of how many he intends to admit. He can bring them from \nanywhere he wants and allow them access to unlimited welfare and \nentitlements at the taxpayers' expense, which is not scored as a cost.\n  At the Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest that I \nchair, we had an official from Health and Human Services who testified \nthat 75 percent of the refugees are self-sustaining within 180 days. \nBut my staff helped me to ask the follow-up question. What we found was \nthat means Health and Human Services is no longer giving them refugee \nmoney, but that other kinds of welfare don't count against them. But 93 \npercent, we know, of immigrants from the Middle East between 2009 and \n2013 are on food stamps, and 73 percent are on Medicaid or health care \nprograms. And they may be there the rest of their lives.\n  This is not being scored. This is why a country that is smart seeks \nto bring in people who have the greatest chance of being successful.\n  Sure, some will do well, and many are wonderful people, and we have a \ntradition of that. I am just saying that we have a President with \nunlimited powers who has an agenda, and he is passing on the costs that \nare going to be to the detriment of working Americans for decades to \ncome.\n  So the risks associated with the refugee admissions program are \nsignificant.\n  With respect to Syria, FBI Director James Comey repeatedly said that \nwe simply do not have the ability to vet refugees from Syria. \nTestifying before the House Committee on Homeland Security in October, \nhe said:\n\n       We can only query against that which we have collected. So \n     if someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a \n     way that would get their identity or their interests \n     reflected in our database, we can query our database until \n     the cows come home, but we are not going to. There will be \n     nothing to show up because we have no record on that person.\n\n  Well, that is absolutely correct. Of course, that is correct. But \nthey tried to tell us in Committee that we are going to do biometric \nchecks. So I proceeded to ask repeatedly, and finally, after the most \ndifficult time, they acknowledged they have no database in Syria to \ncheck biometrics against. It is not like the United States: If you are \ncaught by the police, they take your fingerprints, and they can tell \nwhether you were convicted in Maine, Alabama, or California. It is in \nthe computer system. They don't have that in Syria. So that was a \nmisrepresentation, an attempt to mislead and create false confidence in \nthe American people that we have an ability to vet people coming here \nfrom Syria--an ability we don't have. The FBI Director honestly and \ndirectly stated that.\n  Any claims made by others that refugees in the United States never \nengage in acts of terrorism are demonstrably false. Just a few weeks \nago, I identified a list of at least 12 individuals who were admitted \nto the United States as refugees, but who have been implicated in \nterrorism in the last year alone.\n  We found out there may be more, and probably they are under \ninvestigation right now. In fact, the FBI has said there is a terrorism \ninvestigation in every single State in America. These terrorists, for \nexample, are from Somalia, Bosnia, Kenya and Uzbekistan. They came in \ndifferent stages in their lives. Some were admitted as children, others \nas adults. Yet they all turn their backs on this country after being \nwelcomed here as refugees.\n  This is not made up. It is a real problem. The American people want \nsome action. They would like to see Congress and this Administration \nrespond, especially, and they are rightly angered and upset with their \nelected representatives and their President for not taking sufficient \naction.\n  I, along with my colleague Senator Shelby and others in the House, \nasked for inclusion of specific language in this omnibus bill that \nwould protect the interests of the American people, that would reassert \nthe constitutional role of Congress in establishing a uniform system of \nimmigration, that would require the identification of offsetting cuts \nin Federal spending to pay for the refugee admission program. But none \nof that was included in the omnibus bill.\n  I doubt they ever spent a minute looking at a letter from two \nSenators. As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Immigration and the \nNational Interest, I sent appropriators a list of several dozen \nprovisions for inclusion in our funding bills to improve immigration \nenforcement and to block Presidential overreach and lawlessness, \nincluding among other things, provisions to defund sanctuary cities.\n  Why should we be funding and providing Federal law enforcement money \nto cities that won't cooperate with the Federal Government in its most \nbasic responsibility of respect and comity between these various \nFederal and State agencies. It goes on every day. But we are being \nblocked in sanctuary city after sanctuary city.\n  Also, I asked the appropriators to prevent visas from being issued to \nnationals of countries that refuse to take back their criminals. This \nis important. My former colleague Senator Specter offered a bill for a \nnumber of things. It would bar admission for certain visas for \nnationals of countries that won't take back their people who have been \nin the United States. It is a fundamental principle of immigration\n\n[[Page S8719]]\n\nlaw worldwide that if you admit a person from a foreign country, when \ntheir visa is up, they go home. Their visa is up if they commit a \ncrime, and they are to be sent back home; they are to be deported.\n  But country after country is refusing to take back their convicted \ncriminals. I guess they figure: ``Why don't you keep our criminals for \nus?'' But that is not what the law is, and we are stuck with them in \njails. We have to pay for their housing. After 6 months, absent certain \ncircumstances, the Supreme Court says they generally have to be \nreleased. It's possible that if an alien files a habeas petition that \nthe government will have to go to court and have hearing with a judge. \nThis is driving up costs, using incredible amounts of hours. We \nshouldn't tolerate it one minute. There is no reason that this \ngovernment shouldn't act--which the law will now allow and directly \nsays they should do--to refuse to issue visas to a country that won't \ntake back their criminals. They refuse to do it. There is additional \nlegislation that would force that, and we could have done it in this \nbill. It should have bipartisan support.\n  I also asked for language in the bill to defund the unlawful, \nimproper Executive amnesty. The President's actions are unlawful. We \ndon't have to fund his unlawful activity. There is no duty on behalf of \nCongress to acquiesce and provide money to people to work in a big \nbuilding in Crystal City to process millions of people in the country \nillegally for amnesty because the President now says: ``I am just going \nto let them stay.'' It has been blocked for the most part by a Federal \ncourt, but there is nothing in the bill to expressly defund it.\n  I asked for legislation to protect American workers against abuses in \nthe H-1B program. This is where Southern California Edison had a \nprogram. They brought in 500 foreign workers from India in some sort of \ncontract deal, had the American workers who had been at Edison doing \ncomputer work for years train the new workers, and then ended up \nterminating the Americans and replacing them with those from abroad. \nHow can anyone say there was a shortage of workers? The same was done \nby Disney. Senator Nelson of Florida and I introduced legislation to \nfix that. I have introduced legislation with Senator Cruz and supported \nlegislation from Senator Grassley to fix this program. None of that has \nbeen included in this bill. Why not?\n  I asked for an expansion of the 287(g) program that allows Federal \nlaw enforcement officials and officers to assist with enforcing our \nimmigration law. This was a good program. It had been on the books. \nPresident Bush finally began to expand it. They train local law \nofficers for weeks at a time, and they become extensions of Federal law \nenforcement officers to help identify and process people who are \nunlawfully in the country and who have been apprehended--a very good \nprogram that had good results. This Obama Administration has \neviscerated it. It is less than half of what it was. It should have \nbeen expanded all over America, if you actually want the law enforced \nin this country. But if you don't want the law enforced in America, you \nkill a program like 287(g). Did the appropriators put in the omnibus \nbill anything to deal with that abuse? No.\n  We put in language that would prevent illegal aliens from receiving \ntax credits. This is unbelievable. The Treasury Inspector General for \nTax Administration from President Obama's own Treasury Department has \ndone an analysis of this and urged that it be fixed. People come to \nAmerica illegally, with children somewhere around the world. They don't \nhave a Social Security number. They use an ITIN identification \ndocument--which was intended for executives. They use that, and they \nfile a tax return. They don't pay taxes because their income is low, \nbut they get a tax credit based on children that are not even in the \ncountry.\n\n  How abusive is that? I understand this was rejected and was not in \nthe omnibus bill because President Obama didn't want it. So he gets to \ndictate what is in a congressional bill that I think would have 90-\npercent support by the American people if they understood how \nsignificant it was? That is a different figure, but it is an abusive, \nimproper tax credit.\n  So all of these provisions were rejected by the bill supporters.\n  But industry's request for more foreign workers was granted--\nunconditionally approved. So I asked about this provision. I heard it \nmight be under consideration, so I asked about it. I said: ``The \nAmerican people don't want a fourfold increase in immigration. I know \nthere are some special interests pushing for this. I have heard that. \nTell me it is not so.'' I was told it wasn't so. But last night--this \nmorning at 2 a.m.--when the bill was produced, it was in there. So I am \nnot happy about it, colleagues. I don't see how we can operate around \nhere if we can't rely on representations.\n  Because of this bill, sanctuary cities will continue to get Federal \nfunds, the Obama Administration can continue issuing visas to countries \nthat refuse to repatriate their criminal aliens, and the President's \nExecutive amnesty continues.\n  Meanwhile, the tax bill that will be moved with the omnibus bill \nmakes permanent the Additional Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income \nTax Credit, but it does nothing to block their future distribution to \nillegal aliens. A tax credit to a person who doesn't pay taxes is a \ncheck from the government. It is not a tax deduction; it is a direct \npayment. It scores as a welfare benefit. This means more illegal aliens \nwill continue to get tax credits. It should be stopped.\n  As I feared, the ultimate effect--and I have expressed concern about \nthis for some months now--is that this bill will fund the President's \nentire lawless immigration agenda. The only real bill we have to \nprovide an opportunity to legislate and fix some of these things is a \nbig omnibus bill. And what does it do? It funds essentially the \nPresident's entire agenda.\n  In fact, the omnibus spending bill will ensure that at least--for \nexample, we have had discussions about the Middle East. People argue \nthat we are not letting in enough people from the Middle East, and that \nwe shouldn't talk about a pause. But under this bill it would ensure \nthat at least 170,000 green cards--that means permanent residency with \na guaranteed path to citizenship--and refugee and asylee approvals will \nbe issued to migrants from Muslim countries just over the next 12 \nmonths. We are very generous about this, and it is very difficult to \nknow if we are managing this properly, except that we know it is not \nbeing safely monitored, and the FBI Director has told us so.\n  This bill even fails to address substantial problems with the EB-5 \ninvestment visa program, problems that some of my colleagues have \nworked for months to resolve. The problems with this program have been \ndocumented by the Government Accountability Office and the Department \nof Homeland Security Inspector General, not the least of which are \nissues related to fraud and national security. We can fix that program. \nWe need to do it. This would have been a good opportunity.\n  For years the American people have suffered under the lawless, \ndangerous, and wage-reducing immigration policies of this \nadministration. They sent us here to Washington to protect their \ninterests, to protect the people's interests, to ensure the defense of \ntheir families, and to advance the common good--the public interest. \nThey did not send us here to bow down to the President's lawless \nimmigration policies, nor to line the pockets of special interests in \nbig business. That is not what we are here for.\n  Whom do we represent?\n  This bill explains why Republican and Democratic voters are in open \nrebellion, as former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said recently--\nopen rebellion. They elected people whom they believed were going to \ntake action to protect their security, their jobs, and their wages. And \nwhat do they get? A bill that is worse than current law. It goes in the \nopposite direction--no wonder people are upset.\n  This legislation represents a further disenfranchisement of the \nAmerican voter. What does a vote mean in this country? At a time when \nhundreds of thousands of criminal aliens are on our streets, criminal \naliens are killing innocent Americans, numerous foreign-born \nindividuals are implicated in terrorism, tens of thousands of aliens \nfrom Central America continue to stream across our southern border, \ncountless Americans are being replaced\n\n[[Page S8720]]\n\nby foreign workers and forced to train their replacements, and millions \nof Americans are just struggling to get by, this Congress has chosen to \nmake things worse.\n  We need to remember whom we represent and whom our duty is to. Our \nduty is to voters, the American people, not the interests of \nbusinesses, activist groups, and that kind of thing.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to share these remarks. I have been very \nfirm about my statements here, but I am very unhappy about this bill. I \ndo not believe this is the kind of legislation we should be moving. It \nwas not moved in the normal process on the floor of the Senate, where \namendments could be offered and a bill could be studied over months of \ntime before final passage, perhaps. So with regret and a good deal of \nfrustration, I urge my colleagues to oppose and reject this proposal.\n  I would also just mention one more thing, and then I will wrap up. \nSenator Shelby and I wrote a letter to the Appropriations Committee on \nNovember 16, asking for Congress to assume its constitutional duty \nensuring immigration laws are uniform by approving the number of \nrefugees who come to America, and not leave that as an open-ended power \ngiven to the President, who can execute it in an arbitrary manner.\n  We also said that no benefits should be provided to future refugees \nuntil the Congressional Budget Office submits a score--a simple report \non the cost of this program. How long would it take? Not that long. \nDon't we need to have a score, a cost number?\n  We also asked that no refugees be admitted until the Department of \nHomeland Security submits a report on terrorist and criminal refugees.\n  None of those provisions were included in any of the legislation \nbefore us. I think all of those are logical.\n  I also previously wrote letters asking for other provisions, such as \nprohibiting funds for lawsuits against States that are trying to help \nenforce immigration laws, to bar funds for attorneys for illegal aliens \nthrough these grant programs that are being utilized. Fundamentally, it \nhas never been the responsibility of the Federal Government to prepare \nand provide free attorneys for people who have entered the country \nillegally. It never has been the law.\n  I also asked that no funds be provided for sanctuary cities.\n  I asked for language that prohibited funds for Executive amnesty \npolicies; that prohibited funds for the DACA Program; that there would \nbe no spending of funds in the Immigration Examinations Fee Account for \nanything other than naturalization and immigration benefits provided by \nCongress.\n  I asked for language that would bar funds for salaries of political \nappointees or other employees who direct employees to violate the law. \nWhy should we be paying people who direct their own subordinates to \nviolate fundamental provisions of immigration law?\n  I asked for language that would prevent funds from being used to \ngrant ``prosecutorial discretion'' to aliens in removal proceedings, no \nfunds for an extension of Temporary Protected Status unless approved by \nCongress, and no funds to continue the Administration's abuse of the \nparole authority. We shouldn't be funding these abusive practices that \nundermine the certainty of immigration laws.\n  I asked for language to prohibit funds to grant H-1B visas to \ncompanies that have replaced American workers. I asked for restrictions \non the issuance of Employment Authorization Documents, and that no \nfunds be used to add new countries to the Visa Waiver Program until \nimplementation of a biometric exit system.\n  This bill does direct some money to a biometric exit system, which, \nif this Administration would act, would begin to do something \nsignificant. But they have resisted what the 9/11 Commission has said \nwe must have. When people come into the country, they are checked in, \nthey are fingerprinted, and they are biometrically identified, but \nnobody checks if they left. So you can come into America on a visa and \nnever go home. This is why almost half of the people illegally in \nAmerica today came lawfully on a visa. They just didn't return when \nthey were supposed to.\n  I asked for money to establish--notably, there has been an advocacy \nunit in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the past to protect \nillegal immigrants and give them all kinds of additional rights--an \nadvocacy unit for victims of immigrant crimes.\n  I asked for others, too.\n  I would just say that I, and others, have raised a series of \nimportant issues that need to be fixed, and would receive, if \nunderstood by the American people, 90 percent support. Senator \nGrassley, chairman of the Judiciary Committee--of which my Subcommittee \non Immigration and the National Interest, is a part--has also been \nactive in these things. It is a deep disappointment that this last \npiece of legislation that could make some improvement in a number of \nthese issues will do nothing of significance, but it will increase by \nfour-fold the number of low-skilled, low-wage workers allowed to enter \nthis country from 66,000 to 264,000. They will pull down wages and \nreduce the job prospects of struggling Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/senate-section/article/S8720-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8720-S8723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         WILDFIRE PROVISIONS IN THE OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, most of us are busy today reviewing the \ncontents of the Omnibus appropriations bill that was released late last \nnight--actually, early this morning. I come to the floor this afternoon \nwith my colleague from Washington, the ranking member on the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, to speak about the wildfire provisions. \nMore specifically, I am here to explain why Congress chose not to \naccept a flawed proposal from the administration and really, I think, \nto be here to give hope and optimism about a path forward for next \nyear.\n  I think it goes without saying that our Nation's wildfire epidemic is \na serious challenge that demands attention from each one of us. Each \nyear the wildfire season seems to include new ``worsts'' and shattered \nrecords, and 2015 has been particularly devastating. It seems as though \nwe didn't have a wildfire season; we've had a wildfire year. We all \nknow that we have seen too much acreage burn, too many western \ncommunities have suffered damage, and, tragically, lives have been \nlost.\n  According to the National Interagency Fire Center, more than 9.4 \nmillion acres of our country had burned through October 30 of this \nyear. In Alaska, where most of these fires occur, we lost over 5 \nmillion acres during this period. For perspective, that is about the \nsize of the State of Connecticut. That is what we saw burn in Alaska \nalone this year.\n  Those of us whose States are impacted by wildfire started this year \nin agreement that the way wildfire management has been funded is \nbroken; and that it is past time we fix it. We know we can't continue \nto underfund fire suppression, only then to scramble to borrow money to \nfight fires--and all this while the fires are many times burning out of \ncontrol. We know that we need to end this very disruptive and \nunsustainable cycle of fire borrowing, which drains funds from other \nprograms as agencies desperately seek resources. I think this fire \nborrowing concept is one area where we have all been able to come \ntogether, whether it is those within the agencies or those of us \nlooking to address policy, the appropriators. We have to figure out how \nwe are going to stop the fire borrowing that goes on within the various \naccounts in an effort to respond to these wildfires.\n  Earlier this year, as the chairman of the Interior-Environment \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I set out to fix this very broken system. \nUnder my direction, our committee reported a bill to do just that. The \nInterior appropriations bill included a permanent, fiscally responsible \nfix for fire borrowing. It would have provided resources to the \nagencies up front--enough funding to fully cover the average annual \ncost of firefighting over the past 10 years--while allowing for a \nlimited cap adjustment in have truly catastrophic fire\n\n[[Page S8721]]\n\nyears. The bill simultaneously increased funding for fire prevention \nefforts and took steps also to return to active forest management.\n  We thought this was not only a sound approach to address the fire \nborrowing but also the forest management issues that so many of us are \nconcerned about. Unfortunately, we ran into a wall with the House of \nRepresentatives. They wouldn't accept the language because of its \nlimited cap adjustment. Instead, we worked across Chambers within the \nAppropriations Committee to provide an unprecedented level of funding \nto address wildfire in this omnibus.\n  As I said, I am still going through the omnibus myself and trying to \nfigure out whether to support the overall bill. But I do think it is \nimportant to recognize and understand what we have included in this \nomnibus. The wildfire provisions are both responsible and pragmatic. It \nprovides real money, right now and gives us the time to develop long \nterm real solutions. The bill includes $1.6 billion for fire \nsuppression, which is $600 million over the average cost of fighting \nwildfires over the past 10 years. It also includes $545 million for \nhazardous fuels reduction, and it includes $360 million for the Forest \nService's timber program, which will help us resume the active \nmanagement of our forests.\n  What we have in this omnibus bill is more funding for wildfires than \nwas spent during the 2015 fire season--and, again, that was one of the \nmost expensive fire seasons in history. When we think about what we \nhave done, barring a truly record-setting fire season in 2016, fire \nborrowing should not be an issue for us the rest of this fiscal year. \nWe did this the right way--the way that Congress should deal with the \ngovernment's responsibilities--by making cuts elsewhere to pay for this \nwithin the budget. Again, this is real money. This is money that will \nbe available immediately because we have done this through the \nappropriations process.\n  We have had many conversations--Senator Cantwell and I and many in \nthis body--with Members who were hoping to see a different proposal. \nThe House had a proposal, colleagues here in the Senate had a proposal, \nand the administration had a proposal. They were hoping it could be \nfactored into the omnibus, but for a number of reasons it was not \nincluded within the bill.\n  The administration's proposal would have amended the Stafford Act to \nexpand the purposes for emergency funding for major disasters to \ninclude fighting wildfires on Federal lands. The House included a \nsimilar idea in a forestry bill it passed earlier in the year. The \nirony here is that the Administration came out very strongly against \nthis back in July, just a few months ago. The President's advisers \nissued a Statement of Administration Policy objecting to the \nrepurposing of the Stafford Act and the use of the Disaster Relief Fund \nfor wildfire suppression operations.\n  In September, the director of FEMA wrote an opinion piece about this. \nHe said that tapping the Disaster Relief Fund for wildfires would \n``undermine the federal government's ability to budget for and fund \nresponses to disasters, as well as to finance state and tribal public \ninfrastructure recovery projects.''\n  The Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the \nhead of the Office of Management and Budget echoed that concern in a \nletter where they said, ``We do not believe that Congress should modify \nthe Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act as \na means to address the escalating costs of wildfire.''\n  Yet here we are just a few months later, and the administration is \nnow proposing to amend the Stafford Act. And after reviewing the \nproposal, it appears to be nothing more than a work-around that still \nhas serious problems.\n  I think the first important reminder is that the Stafford Act itself \nis designed to provide Federal assistance to State, local, and tribal \ngovernments to alleviate disaster suffering and facilitate recovery \nafter a disaster has occurred. There is no precedent for accessing it \nto provide emergency money for disasters on Federal lands.\n  The second concern we have is that this proposal doesn't actually end \nfire borrowing. What it does is create an account that is separate from \nthe Disaster Relief Fund that is subject to appropriations, which means \nthat it is now empty. That fund may be there, but there is nothing in \nit, and it could remain empty. There is no guarantee that appropriators \nwill fund the account or that the President will ever request funds for \nit. And if there are no funds in the account, then basically what we \nhave to assume is that the agencies are going to have to borrow again. \nSo we haven't fixed the borrowing.\n  We have an average of 68,000 fires each year. Under this proposal, \neach one could require a separate Presidential declaration once the \ninitial appropriations run out. So we have to ask the question: How \ndoes this actually work? Does the Forest Service Chief have to estimate \nhow much each fire is going to cost? What happens in the meantime while \nyou have all these fires burning? Again, the agencies are going to be \nin a situation where they are going to be forced to fire borrow.\n  Even if we assume that Federal dollars will be appropriated to the \nfund envisioned by this proposal and that the President will make \ndisaster declarations after he is asked to do so by Cabinet officials, \nwe are still setting another troubling precedent. The administration \nwill effectively be able to decide to give itself money under the \nStafford Act. This is not like giving an individual money after they \nhave suffered a disaster, a loss to their home or property; this is the \nadministration being able to decide to give itself money. So the \nquestion is, is this really something that we want to do?\n  Finally, I think this proposal is a missed opportunity. It was \nsupposed to be coupled with a set of productive forest management \nreforms. What we saw is a good start. There are forest reforms in there \nbut there is not very much in this to get excited about for Alaska, \nwhere we have both a wildfire problem and a timber problem. The \nproposal also does too little to help our firefighters or our \ncommunities which are at physical risk from wildfires and economic risk \nfrom restrictions on timber harvesting.\n  I am certainly not alone in this. Again, Senator Cantwell has spoken \nvery passionately on this issue--not only in committee but here on the \nfloor. I am going to yield to her in just a moment.\n  We heard from a representative from the International Association of \nFire Chiefs, who said that ``due to the rapidly rising cost of wildland \nfire suppression, IAFC [the International Association of Fire Chiefs] \nis concerned that the [Disaster Relief Fund] could run out of money as \nit is also used to address hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, and \nother emergencies.''\n  We have also heard from a nonprofit organization called Firefighters \nUnited for Safety, Ethics, and Ecology. Their letter to congressional \nleaders observes that ``allowing agencies to declare wildfires as \ndisasters simply to access near-unlimited funding for suppression will \nundermine efforts that have been long in the making to shift agencies \ntoward alternative proactive strategies in fire preparedness and \nplanning, fuels reduction and forest restoration.''\n  I want to find a solution to the fire-budgeting problem as much as \nanyone in this Chamber, but the proposal that surfaced during budget \nnegotiations was not the right way to go. It was not developed in the \nopen and transparent manner that we would hope, and it has not been \nfully vetted. It has drawn opposition not only from Members here but \nfrom outside groups whose members are on the ground actually fighting \nthese fires. So the only solution was to do what we have done, which is \nfully fund firefighting within the budget that we were given.\n  The omnibus is our path forward on wildfire funding for this year. It \ndevotes greater resources to fire prevention and hazardous fuels \nreduction and contains real money--not an empty account--that will be \navailable immediately. We can use the window it provides to develop \nlong-term solutions.\n  This is where I want to give encouragement to other Members. I am \ncommitted, as I know that Senator Cantwell is, to working to address \nthe longer term solutions to these issues. I am here today to affirm \nthat wildfire management legislation will be a top priority for those \nof us on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee next year.\n\n[[Page S8722]]\n\n  I know we come at this from different perspectives, but that is OK. \nLet's bring our different perspectives and work collaboratively with \nall Members to develop a commonsense bill that properly addresses the \nchallenges and concerns that Senator Cantwell has articulated when it \ncomes to active forest management, how we deal with our hazardous \nfuels, and how we work on the front end to prevent these catastrophic \nfires. We need to be working together toward these solutions, and I \ncertainly make that commitment with my ranking member to advance early \non in the New Year these provisions that I think will make a \ndifference.\n  I know Senator Cantwell wants to be part of the solution here and she \nhas played a great part as we have worked together to craft a solution \nin the committee. With that, I know that from the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee perspective, we have a lot on our plate. But I \nthink that from my perspective as a Senator from Alaska, this is an \nissue that the people in my State feel very passionately about.\n  I will ask Senator Cantwell, as we deal with the pressing issues that \nare before us, is this an area where we can come together as an energy \ncommittee to address these very immediate concerns?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, responding to my colleague from Alaska--\nand I will make a longer statement in a second--I do want to thank her \nfor her leadership, not just as chairwoman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, but also as the chairwoman of the Appropriations \nInterior subcommittee.\n  Thank you for your detailing exactly why it is so important to have \nreal money up front. You are right. For you and me and for many Western \nStates, we have seen a change in fire habit, and we have seen probably \ntwo of the worst fire seasons our country has seen in many years and \nthe fact that this year's season may trump that.\n  It is very important that we give the agencies the tools to address \nthis issue and that we give them the tools now--not a guessing game, \nnot how much they might get or how much they might borrow but how much \nthey have now. I think the 50-percent increase is a recognition of how \ndire the situation is and makes sure that these communities know that \nthey get those resources.\n  Yes, I wish to thank the chairwoman for allowing the committee to \nhave a hearing. Senator Barrasso participated at a very critical moment \nand at a very sad moment because it was just days after we learned that \nwe lost firefighters in the central part of our State.\n  I wish to say that she has had a committee hearing. We have had \ncommittee hearings. My staff attended what was called the Wildfire and \nUs Summit. Many people in the central part of our State participated in \nthat summit. Your question is, Is this important to us? I think when \nyou have a rain forest that catches on fire or you have parts of Alaska \nthat have never burned that are up in smoke, you bet this is of \ncritical importance to both our States and to many Western States. I \nthank you for the question and thank you for helping to get real \nresources on the table and a 50-percent increase over last year's fire \nbudget. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I know that Senator Cantwell has a \nlonger statement that she would like to make at this point in time.\n  I yield to Senator Cantwell.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague Senator Murkowski \nfor her leadership on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, and I thank the Senator for her discussion on fighting \nwildfires in the United States of America. I think she gave a great \nrendition. My hat is off to appropriators. I can tell you this: What we \nneed is real money, and that is what she has provided. I thank her for \nthat.\n  I thank her partner on the subcommittee, Senator Udall from New \nMexico. They worked together and had to provide a framework in which \nthe omnibus reflects an appropriation that we will vote on later this \nweek containing $1.6 billion for fire funding and fire suppression. \nThat is $500 million more than last year. So I consider it a very good \ndown payment.\n  Congress has recognized that it is very important to provide funding \nfor fire suppression and at sufficient levels so that agencies can \naddress the issues of prevention and hazardous fuel reduction. This is \nsomething. It is critically important.\n  I am pleased that this is a very large increase in firefighting \naccounts this year. Besides the 50-percent increase in fire \nsuppression, as my colleague mentioned, there is $375 million in \nhazardous fuel reduction and new grants to local communities to \ndecrease their fire hazards, additional fuel reduction projects such as \ncontrolled burns in our forests, and research on protecting homes \nduring massive wildfires.\n  This is critically important to my State, as they have implemented \nmany programs over the last two seasons that they call ``hasty \nresponse'' or fuel reduction, where they have been able to show that \ncertain treatments have actually been able to save communities and \nneighborhoods that have done such treatment. The challenge becomes \nthis: How do you educate the rest of the community, the rest of the \nState, on the vital importance of doing this fuel reduction? It is very \nimportant that we continue this.\n  I thank again the chairwoman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee and the interior subcommittee of the Committee on \nAppropriations on the fact that this is real money today, a 50-percent \nincrease without the necessity for a future declaration of disaster, \nwithout a future appropriations request, without pitting States against \neach other on every disaster, but providing some predictability with \nthis increase about how to move forward for the 2016 firefighting \nseason.\n  It is very important, as she mentioned, that we continue to focus on \na variety of issues and resolutions: stopping the way that we continue \nto erode funds from other accounts while ensuring there are \nconsiderations of cost and oversight for large and expensive fires, \nintegrating forest research to better prioritize where prevention money \ngoes, increasing controlled burns on our Federal lands, ensuring \npersonnel and equipment can operate seamlessly across jurisdictions \nduring wildfires, funding community preparedness and FireWise \nactivities, funding risk mapping, providing technology on all large \nfires to ensure managers know in real time the location of the fires \nand of our firefighters, and upgrading our air tanker system.\n  We saw a lot of this, and we heard a lot about our air tanker system \nduring our committee hearings and that there was much more we could be \ndoing.\n  As to establishing surge capacity, we heard a lot from our local \ncommunities that joined in the fight and are more than willing to join \nin this effort of helping us fight wildfires, but we need to have the \ncapacity and the training.\n  As to ensuring communications, nothing was more frustrating in some \nof these wildfires than to have no broadband communication and yet to \nbe in charge of all the evacuation for the region without the ability \nto communicate to the people that needed to be evacuated. It is \ncritically important that we have on-the-ground communications systems \navailable on day one.\n  Doing preventative treatments when risks are low is a particular \nissue for our State. We want to make sure that we have cooperation in \nworking with other agencies. We don't want to do fire treatments when \nwe are in drought conditions and high temperatures and dry, dry \nconditions, but when there are less risks.\n  We want to do mapping to clearly identify where the risks are, and we \nwant to use technology for safety and effectiveness, such as GPS and \nother systems that can be used from the air, and modifying the \nindividual assistance program. I say that because various communities \nthat have been hardest hit by our fires have been in rural communities, \nbut the way the definition works under our current law basically has \nprejudice against a community if it is not dense enough to meet the \ncurrent requirement.\n  I wish to say that the ranking member, myself, and probably even the \nPresiding Officer have very rural communities that can be devastated by \nfires. That means an entire community that may be based on recreation \nor outdoors\n\n[[Page S8723]]\n\nor any kinds of outdoor activities could be so devastated and yet would \nbe left without the resources, simply because they didn't meet a \npopulation density number. To me, we need to address this because these \ncommunities are integral parts of our larger United States and the \neconomic stability of many of our States.\n  We want to continue to make these improvements in our system. As I \nsaid, the chairwoman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nallowed several hearings to take place, and we want to continue the \nefforts in working with our colleagues to make sure that we are moving \nforward on this issue in providing all the resources that we can.\n  I wish to address one issue, and that is that we are not going to get \nthis overall solution by simply clearcutting large swaths of land in \nwhich we haven't made the right assessments. I say that because we have \nhad so many issues in the State of Washington where dangerous erosion \nhas taken place in those circumstances, but it is clear that we all \nagree that massive fuel reduction does need to take place.\n  I look forward to working with my colleague on that because there are \nmany ways in which we can prevent and fight our national wildland \nfires. I look forward to working with Senator Murkowski, and I thank \nher for getting us real money--a 50-percent increase--that doesn't \nrequire another declaration, doesn't require a future event. It is \nthere, and we can start using it. Let's go to work with our colleagues \nin defining how we do hazardous fuel reduction in the most aggressive \nway possible, giving our communities better tools to fight these fires \nin the future, and working to make sure that we have the best equipment \nand the best resources for those individuals who are fighting those \nfires.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from \nWashington for not only her comments here this evening but for her \nleadership and guidance in this area. When your State is hard hit by \nthese disasters, you learn a lot. You learn a lot about what works in \nthe process and, unfortunately, what doesn't work. When you cannot get \na cat to run a fire break because it doesn't have the appropriate card \nor designation, people come to us and say: Well, that is crazy. And you \nhave to agree; it is crazy. We can do better. When we are talking about \nthe issue of wildland fire and management, it is this management piece \nthat I really hope we can get to, because it is not just about throwing \nmore money at the fires and hoping that we get it right. It is not only \nabout ensuring that we prioritize and get it right with suppression \ndollars, but also that we are working aggressively to deal with the \nprevention, with hazardous fuels reduction, with actively managing \nthese issues. That is how we are going to be making the headway. That \nis where we need to be working collaboratively, whether you are from a \nvery open, remote, and large State such as Alaska or whether you are a \nState that sees smaller fires that have a catastrophic impact on your \nlocal economies. I know that Senator Cantwell has articulated that \nvery, very clearly within the committee.\n  We have our work cut out in front of us. I worked on a statement that \nincluded no shortage of fire puns and needing to put a damper on this \n10-alarm fire that was out there, but I decided that the issue of fire \nwas not a joke or a laughing matter for anybody.\n  We have a lot of work to do, and I am ready to do it. I am rolling up \nmy sleeves and looking forward to a lot of cooperation from my \ncolleagues as we address this very important priority.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my friend Chairman Hatch and I rise today \nto offer our sincere gratitude to Ambassador Michael Moore of New \nZealand who is returning to his home country after more than 5 years \nhere in Washington and a long, successful career as a beloved public \nservant.\n  With roots as a union organizer, he rose to become Prime Minister of \nNew Zealand and later served as a Director-General of the World Trade \nOrganization. He dedicated much of his career to the belief that freer \ntrade can help address some of the most intractable challenges facing \nimpoverished people around the globe.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am happy to join my friend and Finance \nCommittee colleague in expressing our gratitude to Ambassador Moore. \nHere in Washington, he witnessed the passage of three trade agreements, \nas well as historic trade legislation earlier this year that reflects \nmany of the values he fought to instill in global trade policy. \nAmbassador Moore was always there with advice and good counsel as we \nnavigated difficult waters, and his irrepressible spirit and good humor \nwill be sorely missed.\n  Mr. WYDEN. As they say in New Zealand, ``He tangeta, he tangeta, he \ntangeta,'' which translated from the Maori language roughly means, \n``people are the most important thing.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/senate-section/article/S8723-5", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8723-S8724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    CONGRATULATING THE WILDY FAMILY\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate the \nWildy family for being named the 2015 Arkansas Farm Family of the Year.\n  This honor recognizes the dedication of Wildy Family Farms and David \nand Patty Wildy to Arkansas's No. 1 industry.\n  The Wildy family settled in Mississippi County in 1914 and has been \non\n\n[[Page S8724]]\n\nthe same farm since 1938. David has devoted his life to farming, \nspending his childhood on the farm, and his passion has been passed \ndown to his children. Wildy Family Farms is a fifth-generation farm. \nHis father and grandfather both earned the Arkansas Master Farm Family \naward. Being named the Arkansas Farm Family of the Year has been a \nlongtime dream for David.\n  David and Patty oversee 9,200 acres of land where they grow soybeans, \ncotton, wheat, milo, and peanuts. The Wildys are committed to being \ngood stewards of the environment. Energy and water conservation play a \nmajor role in the business. Using a private environmental audit process \nto protect the condition of the land, Wildy Family Farms is able to \nmeet and improve its conservation goals and the standards established \nfor environmentally responsible practices.\n  David is a leader in Arkansas agriculture. He served as a member of \nthe Mississippi County Farm Bureau board of directors for 7 years, \npresiding as president in 1986. In addition, he served on the Arkansas \nAgriculture Department board from 2005-2010 and is a member of the St. \nFrancis Levee District board of directors, the University of Arkansas \nAgriculture Development Council, and several other boards and \nassociations.\n  The Arkansas Farm Bureau's Farm Family of the Year program honors \nfarm families across the State for their outstanding work both on their \nfarms and in their communities. This recognition is a reflection of the \ncontribution to agriculture at the community and State level and its \nimplications for improved farm practices and management. The Wildy \nfamily is well deserving of this honor.\n  I congratulate David and Patty as well as other partners, which \nincludes their sons and daughters Justin and Kristi Wildy, Tab and \nTaylor Wildy, Hayley Wildy and Paul and Bethany Harris, on their \noutstanding achievements in agriculture and ask my fellow colleagues to \njoin me in honoring them for this accomplishment. I wish them continued \nsuccess in the Farmer of the Year program and look forward to the \ncontributions they will continue to offer Arkansas agriculture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/senate-section/article/S8724-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JEFF SAYER\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, my colleague Senator Jim Risch joins \nme today in expressing our gratitude to Jeff Sayer, a great Idahoan and \npublic servant. We honor Jeff's contributions over the past few years \nas he transitions from State service.\n  Jeff Sayer has served honorably as the State of Idaho director of the \nDepartment of Commerce since October 2011. During his 4 years of \nservice at the Department of Commerce, Jeff accomplished many important \nobjectives. They include the reorganization of the department, making \nit leaner and more responsive to business. Jeff likes to say that he \nwants a department that ``moves at the speed of business,'' and he was \nsuccessful in meeting that goal. Jeff launched the Idaho Global \nEntrepreneurial Mission and established the Idaho Opportunity Fund, as \nwell as Idaho's Tax Reimbursement Incentive that resulted in 4,047 new \njobs, $496 million in new capital investments, $1.65 billion in total \nwages, and $288 million in new State revenue. These are just some of \nthe impressive accomplishments of the Department of Commerce under the \ndirection of Jeff Sayer.\n  Jeff's leadership of the Governor's Leadership in Nuclear Energy, or \nLINE, Commission is equally important. Jeff started this commission, \nled it through a complete review of the State's role in supporting \nnuclear energy and Idaho National Laboratory, and oversaw the \ncompletion of a final report that is still helping guide policymakers \nin Idaho and Washington, DC.\n  While we congratulate Jeff on being presented with an outstanding \nopportunity to return to the private sector, we are saddened to be \nlosing his leadership and talents in State government. We wish Jeff and \nhis wife, Laurel, well in their new endeavor and look forward to still \nleaning on Jeff for guidance and wisdom on a frequent basis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/senate-section/article/S8724-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/senate-section/article/S8724-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The message received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/senate-section/article/S8724-4", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:06 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following joint resolutions, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.J.

A bill to posthumously award the Congressional Gold Medal to \neach\n\n[[Page S8726]]\n\nof J. Christopher Stevens, Glen Doherty, Tyrone Woods, and Sean Smith \nin recognition of their contributions to the Nation; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, on September 11, 2012, militants attacked \nthe Temporary Mission Facility of the United States, and its personnel, \nin Benghazi, Libya. As the attack unfolded, our people attempted to \ndefend the Mission and protect United States diplomatic personnel. \nTragically, they did not succeed and four brave Americans sacrificed \ntheir lives.\n  Today, along with Senators Ayotte, Warren, Feinstein, Boxer, Wyden, \nand Merkley, I am introducing legislation to honor Ambassador J. \nChristopher Stevens, Glen Doherty, Tyrone Woods, and Sean Smith by \nposthumously awarding them the Congressional Gold Medal in recognition \nof their selfless service and extraordinary contributions to the \nnation, at the cost of their lives. These distinguished public servants \nand warriors made the ultimate sacrifice for our Nation, and their \nmemories will live on as an inspiration to all for their bravery and \ncommitment to our Nation.\n  J. Christopher Stevens was serving as United States Ambassador to \nLibya and previously served twice in the country, as both Special \nRepresentative to the Libyan Transitional National Council and as the \nDeputy Chief of Mission. He served in the United States Foreign Service \nfor twenty-one years. Public service was his life work. He started his \ncareer serving as a Peace Corps volunteer teaching English in Morocco.\n  Glen A. Doherty grew up in Winchester, MA. He was a Navy SEAL for \ntwelve years. He served in Iraq and Afghanistan, attaining the rank of \nPetty Officer First Class and earned the Navy and Marine Corps \nCommendation medal.\n  Tyrone Woods was a Navy Seal for 20 years. He also served in both \nIraq and Afghanistan, attaining the rank of Senior Chief Petty Officer \nwhen he retired. In Iraq, he led multiple raids and reconnaissance \nmissions and earned the Bronze Star.\n  Both Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods were working to protect American \npersonnel abroad when the Temporary Mission Facility of the United \nStates in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked. As the coordinated attack \nunfolded, Glen and Tyrone exposed themselves to enemy fire as they \nengaged attackers armed with guns, mortars, and rocket-propelled \ngrenades. Their ultimate sacrifice saved the lives of American \npersonnel who were rescued and safely returned to their families.\n  Sean Smith served in the Air Force for 6 years, attained the rank of \nStaff Sergeant and was awarded the Air Force Commendation Medal. After \nleaving the Air Force, he served in the State Department for 10 years \non various assignments which took him to places such as Baghdad, \nBrussels, Pretoria, the Hague, and Tripoli.\n  As their careers attest, all four men served our Nation honorably and \nwith high distinction and utmost bravery. They made the supreme \nsacrifice for our country, and this medal represents the deep gratitude \nof a nation that will never forget their heroic service.\n  I ask all Senators to join me in support of this legislation to \nposthumously award these four brave American heroes the Congressional \nGold Medal for giving our Nation their last full measure of devotion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/senate-section/article/S8726-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2929.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 297, S. Res. 310.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 310) condemning the ongoing sexual \n     violence against women and children from Yezidi, Christian, \n     Shabak, Turkmen, and other religious communities by Islamic \n     State of Iraq and Syria militants and urging the prosecution \n     of the perpetrators and those complicit in these crimes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am here to support the bipartisan \nefforts and goals of my colleagues in S. Res. 310, which condemns the \nongoing sexual violence perpetrated by ISIL against women and children \nfrom Yezidi and other religious communities.\n  The horrific and despicable actions of ISIL against women and girls \nwho were kidnapped, enslaved, tortured, raped, and impregnated in \nconflict-affected regions there and others around the world are one of \nthe horrors of terrorism. This resolution addresses it, but it could \nand should have gone much further. In fact, it lacks the recognition of \nthe full range of support that Yezidi survivors of sexual violence \ndesperately need. That is the reason that I offered two amendments to \nimprove this important resolution, to urge the President to exercise \nhis existing authority. No new author is necessary for him to provide \nand support age-appropriate, comprehensive post-violence care, \nincluding the provision of treatment to prevent HIV infection, trauma \nand surgical care, mental health services, social and legal support, \nand a full range of medically necessary reproductive health services, \nincluding emergency contraception, safe abortion care, and maternal \nhealth services.\n  When the horrors that ISIL inflicts on the Yezidis came to light in \nthe New York Times report entitled ``ISIS Enshrines a Theology of \nRape,'' including systematic rape of women and children in ISIL-held \nterritory, I demanded that our great Nation take action. I refer my \ncolleagues' attention to that article.\n  We cannot allow for the continued use of rape as a tool of warfare to \ndestabilize and disrupt communities, to\n\n[[Page S8731]]\n\nexert control over women and girls, and in the case of the Yezidis, to \nimpregnate them purposefully and relentlessly. Survivors should not be \nforced to carry pregnancies to full term simply because access to \nreproductive health care is not available following their vicious \nassault.\n  We cannot stand idly by while witnessing such violations of human \nrights and dignity. The United States must work to increase access to \nreproductive health care for the vulnerable populations, particularly \nsafe abortion services, and most especially for the Yezidi girls and \nwomen who were purposefully impregnated as a tool of terrorism by ISIL.\n  I have called on the administration multiple times to confront this \nhorror. In September, I wrote a letter with five of my Democratic \ncolleagues to Secretary Kerry, calling on the State Department to \ndeclare Iraqi religious minorities, including the Yezidis, as protected \npriority groups so they could seek refugee assistance within Iraq's \nborder.\n  In October, I wrote a letter with 27 of my Democratic colleagues, \ncalling on the President to take action to properly implement existing \nlaw. Existing law includes the Helms amendment. Tomorrow is the 42nd \nanniversary of the Helms amendment. For its entire existence, the Helms \namendment has been incorrectly interpreted, and it continues to serve \nas a critical obstacle in our foreign aid efforts to provide for safe \nabortions in the case of rape, incest, and life endangerment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter and the \nresponse of the administration dated December 7, 2015, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 22, 2015.\n     President Barack Obama,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We write to express our deep concern \n     for the reproductive health of women and girls who are \n     kidnapped, enslaved, tortured, raped, and impregnated in \n     conflict-affected zones worldwide. Rape is increasingly used \n     as a tool of warfare to destabilize communities, exert \n     control over women and girls, and in some cases purposely \n     impregnate them, as executed by Boko Haram in Nigeria and the \n     Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in Syria and Iraq. \n     Survivors are forced to carry pregnancies to full term \n     because access to reproductive healthcare is not available \n     following their assault. We cannot be bystanders to such \n     gross violations of the human dignity of these women and \n     girls. If the U.S. does not work to increase access to \n     reproductive healthcare for vulnerable populations, \n     particularly safe abortion services, there will be negative, \n     long-term consequences. As such, we implore you to take the \n     following actions to confront this crisis.\n       We request you take action to correct the overly \n     constrained implementation of the Helms Amendment which \n     serves as a critical barrier to safe abortion, particularly \n     impacting women and girls fleeing conflict. Although the \n     Helms Amendment prevents U.S. foreign aid from being used to \n     perform abortions for family planning purposes, for over 40 \n     years it has been incorrectly interpreted to prevent the use \n     of foreign aid to fund safe abortions even in the cases of \n     rape, incest, or life endangerment. These three cases clearly \n     fall outside the restrictions enacted by the Helms Amendment. \n     As such, we urge you to issue guidance to the relevant \n     agencies, allowing them to support safe abortion services in \n     at least the limited circumstances of rape, incest, or life \n     endangerment, including for survivors of conflict-related \n     sexual violence.\n       Subsequently, we urge you to exercise your existing \n     authority to ensure U.S. foreign aid does not stand in the \n     way of women and girls fleeing conflict who seek abortion \n     services. The Helms Amendment restricts U.S. foreign aid from \n     being used to pay for abortion even in countries where \n     abortion is permissible by local law. For instance, although \n     abortion remains illegal in Syria and Iraq, regional \n     countries which receive U.S. foreign assistance--Turkey, \n     Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt--have welcomed millions of \n     refugees and have varying legal exceptions or allowances for \n     abortions related to rape, incest, or life endangerment, \n     which are undermined by limitations imposed by this policy.\n       Finally, we applaud commitments made by this Administration \n     to address these issues, including those made last year at \n     the Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict and \n     those in the National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and \n     Security (NAP). We request that you further strengthen \n     actions taken under the NAP implementation plan. A high-level \n     objective of the NAP is ensuring women's access to relief and \n     recovery in a manner that recognizes the unique needs of \n     women and girls in conflict-affected zones and the need to \n     provide humanitarian services. As expressly noted in the NAP, \n     women's access to relief and recovery can be addressed by \n     ``support[ing] access to reproductive health in emergencies \n     and humanitarian settings.'' As such, we encourage increased \n     attention to this matter and request a report of the \n     Administration's comprehensive review and update to the NAP, \n     scheduled to be released this year. We also ask that the \n     Administration provide an assessment of how the relevant \n     agencies are fulfilling their respective duties to provide \n     access to the full range of reproductive healthcare.\n       We look forward to working with you to ensure these actions \n     are implemented. As the world's largest aid donor, the U.S. \n     can and should endeavor to provide the reproductive \n     healthcare that is desperately needed by some of the world's \n     most vulnerable populations.\n           Sincerely,\n         Richard Blumenthal; Jeanne Shaheen; Kirsten E. \n           Gillibrand; Barbara Boxer; Michael F.

Richard Blumenthal,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Blumenthal: Thank you for your letter of \n     October 22 to President Obama regarding your concern about \n     access to reproductive health care in conflict settings. We \n     have been asked to respond on the President's behalf.\n       The Department of State and the U.S. Agency for \n     International Development take this issue very seriously. The \n     Helms Amendment has prohibited since 1973 the use of U.S. \n     foreign assistance to pay for the performance of abortion as \n     a method of family planning or to motivate or coerce any \n     person to practice abortions. We review our policies on an \n     ongoing basis to ensure maximum effectiveness in improving \n     health outcomes, including for those who are highly \n     vulnerable to sexual violence because of conflict or other \n     crises.\n       Through our policies and investments, we continue to \n     demonstrate our commitment to rights and protection of women \n     and girls worldwide. We do so by working with the \n     international community, including the UN Population Fund, \n     the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the International \n     Committee of the Red Cross, and other development and \n     humanitarian organizations. We work together to: respond to \n     the challenges of increasing access to reproductive health \n     services in crisis settings; strengthen global coordination \n     to prevent sexual violence; promote justice and \n     accountability; and provide health care, including sexual and \n     reproductive health services.\n       The U.S. National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security \n     outlines the United States' commitment to the protection and \n     participation of women in a broad range of efforts to resolve \n     conflict and sustain peace. The Department of State and other \n     agencies are reviewing the NAP under the auspices of the \n     National Security Council. This interagency review reflects \n     our commitment to accountable implementation and rigorous \n     learning of best practices. Upon completion of the review \n     later this year, the Department would be pleased to brief you \n     and your staff on relevant findings.\n       Your letter provides valuable input on these important \n     issues. We welcome any additional input you or your staff may \n     have, and look forward to continued dialogue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Julia Frifield,\n                         Assistant Secretary, Legislative Affairs.\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. The letter very simply asks that the administration \n``take action to correct the overly constrained implementation of the \nHelms amendment which serves as a critical barrier to safe abortion, \nparticularly impacting women and girls fleeing conflict.'' The letter \nasks that the administration recognize that American foreign aid can be \nused to fund safe abortions even in the cases of rape, incest, or life \nendangerment. That is a very simple principle.\n  Preventing our foreign aid funds from being used for that purpose not \nonly denies critical assistance to Yezidi girls and women, but also \noverly constrains the assistance of this great Nation to the victims of \nterror and horror abroad.\n  Today, the U.S. Senate will adopt S. Res. 310, and I have joined in \nsupporting it. I am deeply disappointed that the administration has \nessentially denied even considering a change in policy. This action \ndoes not mean that the United States should be complacent regarding the \ndismal state of protection for the Yezidi girls and women.\n  The amendments I offered were rejected by my Republican colleagues,\n\n[[Page S8732]]\n\nand I understand my colleagues' goal of expressing concern for girls \nand women and others. Despite my reservation and profound \ndisappointment with the administration's reaction to and the denial of \nthese two amendments, I am supporting this resolution. I have withdrawn \nmy amendments, recognizing the reality of our current situation on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate, but it remains essential that we recognize \nthe full scope of the post-rape health care needed by survivors of \nrape. These victims have been hideously and gruesomely used as a tool \nof terrorism invoked by ISIL.\n  Fully countering ISIL's terrorist strategy means providing necessary \nand compassionate care for girls and women who have been victims and \nhave been shunned by their families. They have been rejected by their \ncommunities. They have been victims many times over as a result of \nthese heinous crimes committed against them.\n  I hope that my fellow Senators will join me as I continue to call on \nthe administration to right this wrong. As the world's largest donor of \nassistance around the world, the United States can and should do better \nand do more to provide health care that girls and women vitally need \nwhen they become vulnerable and, in fact, victims of terror inflicted \nby these heinous criminal acts.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nLankford amendment to the resolution be agreed to; that the resolution, \nas amended, be agreed to; that the preamble be agreed to; and that the \nmotions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2931) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To define ``complicit'' for purposes of the resolution)\n\n       On page 3, line 4, insert ``by Islamic State of Iraq and \n     Syria militants'' before the semicolon at the end.\n       On page 3, line 10, strike ``and''.\n       On page 4, line 2, strike the period at the end and \n     inserting ``; and''.\n       On page 4, after line 2, add the following:\n       (4) defines ``complicit'', for purposes of this resolution, \n     as having knowingly and willingly taken actions which have \n     directly supported, promoted, enabled, aided, abetted, or \n     encouraged crimes involving sexual violence against women and \n     children from Yezidi, Christian, Shabak, Turkmen, or other \n     religious communities by Islamic State of Iraq and Syria \n     militants, including actively working to deny, cover up, or \n     alter evidence of such crimes.\n\n  The resolution (S. Res. 310), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, as amended, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 310\n\n       Whereas the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has \n     publicly and systematically targeted communities on the basis \n     of their religious identities, including Yezidis, Christians, \n     Shi'a Muslims, Shabaks, Turkmens, and Kaka'i, in a campaign \n     of violence that includes summary executions, beheadings, \n     torture, arbitrary detainment, forced displacement, rape and \n     sexual violence, and enslavement;\n       Whereas enslavement and sexual violence against women is a \n     widespread practice among ISIS militants, who have, according \n     to the Yezidi Affairs Directory, captured and enslaved as \n     many as 5,500 Yezidis, including as many as 3,000 women, \n     since August 2014;\n       Whereas ISIS has established a formal slave trade in which \n     women and girls as young as 5 years old are systematically \n     abducted, transported, categorized according to physical \n     traits and perceived value, and traded among ISIS militants \n     or sold for as little as $10;\n       Whereas the Research and Fatwa Department of ISIS has \n     issued guidelines and directions for the enslavement of \n     Yezidi women and children and has justified the actions on \n     the basis of religious teachings;\n       Whereas the New York Times reported that ``the Islamic \n     State has developed a detailed bureaucracy of sex slavery, \n     including sales contracts notarized by the ISIS-run Islamic \n     courts'';\n       Whereas according to various reports, including testimony \n     before Congress by Khidher Domle, a Yezidi activist and \n     Director of the Media Department at the University of Dohuk, \n     the enslavement and sexual violence used against Yezidi women \n     and children by ISIS militants in their attack on Mount \n     Sinjar was premeditated;\n       Whereas ISIS has initiated the mass killing of Yezidi men \n     and boys, the sexual violence and enslavement of Yezidi women \n     and children, and the forced displacement of Christians and \n     other religious communities;\n       Whereas the threat and reach of ISIS extends beyond Iraq \n     and Syria into the rest of the world, as demonstrated by \n     ISIS-affiliated attacks and recruitment of foreign fighters \n     from the United States, Europe, Central Asia, and Africa;\n       Whereas, according to testimony presented before the \n     Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives \n     on September 29, 2015, it is possible that one of the ISIS \n     militants involved in the sexual slavery of Yezidi women and \n     children is a United States citizen; and\n       Whereas the United States Government should investigate and \n     urge prosecution of American citizens who are perpetrators of \n     or complicit in such crimes: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the ongoing sexual violence against women and \n     children from Yezidi, Christian, Shabak, Turkmen, and other \n     religious communities by Islamic State of Iraq and Syria \n     militants;\n       (2) calls on the Attorney General to commence the \n     investigation and prosecution of any United States citizens \n     alleged to be perpetrators of or complicit in these crimes \n     and to report back to Congress what steps are being taken to \n     investigate and urge the prosecution of those involved;\n       (3) calls on the Government of Iraq and the governments of \n     other countries to identify individual perpetrators and \n     individuals involved in these crimes and take appropriate \n     measures to arrest and urge the prosecution of those \n     individuals; and\n       (4) defines ``complicit'', for purposes of this resolution, \n     as having knowingly and willingly taken actions which have \n     directly supported, promoted, enabled, aided, abetted, or \n     encouraged crimes involving sexual violence against women and \n     children from Yezidi, Christian, Shabak, Turkmen, or other \n     religious communities by Islamic State of Iraq and Syria \n     militants, including actively working to deny, cover up, or \n     alter evidence of such crimes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/senate-section/article/S8732-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, DECEMBER 17, 2015\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
