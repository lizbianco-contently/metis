Mr. President, throughout the Democratic filibuster of \nthe antislavery legislation, this is basically what they have been \ntelling us: We don't read legislation we vote on. Even so, it was \nalways a stretch to believe that not a single one--not one--of the 13 \noriginal Democratic cosponsors of this bill, nor the many Democrats who \nvoted for this bill in committee, nor their well-educated staffs could \nnot have been bothered to make it to page 4 before deciding to support \nit--well, support it at least until far-left lobbyists told them they \ncould not support it anymore.\n  So yesterday's revelation that the Democratic side was indeed aware \nof the language in question could hardly have surprised anyone. It also \nmakes clear that Democrats decided to yank their support for an \nantislavery bill for one simple reason: Because far-left lobbyists said \nthey needed to--not because the American people said so.\n  Nearly 70 percent of Americans support the kind of bipartisan \nprovisions Democrats now claim they object to, and many Democrats have \nvoted for similar bipartisan Hyde language many times before in both \nappropriations and authorizing legislation. They voted for it many \ntimes before in other bills, most recently just this past December.\n  So our Democratic colleagues obviously lack a rationale for this \ncontinued filibustering of the antislavery legislation. If Democrats \nare truly sincere about wanting to move to an Attorney General vote as \nsoon as possible, then they should consider some of the recent advice \nfrom the Chicago Tribune.\n  Here is what the Tribune said. ``Democrats on the Judiciary Committee \nhave endorsed'' the same bill they are now filibustering, the Tribune \nnoted. So ``all they have to do is allow a vote'' on the same bill to \nmove to another vote they claim to want to have.\n  Yet, as the Tribune also noted, Democrats do not ``want to go on the \nrecord against a bill aimed at combating the evils of human \ntrafficking. So they are blocking a vote--yes, blocking a law to combat \nhuman trafficking--in hopes that they can get their way.''\n  Here is how the editorial concluded--and this is the part our \nDemocratic friends should listen to: ``Democrats,. . . . vote to move \nforward with the human trafficking bill. Then the Senate can get on \nwith approving a new attorney general. And Democrats can resolve never \nagain to vote for a bill they haven't read.''\n  Just resolve to never again vote for a bill you haven't read. It \nseems pretty simple. Ignore the lobbyists and vote to give hope to the \nvictims of slavery instead. That is the right thing to do, and today we \nwill give our friends another chance to show where they stand in this \ndebate over modern slavery.\n  (The remarks of Mr. McConnell pertaining to the introduction of S. \n799 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/19/senate-section/article/S1637-7", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1637-S1638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio).

Mr. President, in a few hours, the Senate will vote for a \nthird time on whether to end debate on human trafficking. The result \nwill be the same the third time as it was the second time and the first \ntime, which indicates to me that this week was a waste of time.\n  I indicated that the vote will fail, and it will fail because the \ndebate is such that this is an important issue. We are determined to \nfix this bill, and we will fix it by removing the unrelated abortion \nprovision from the pages of this legislation. I hope we can do that \nsoon.\n  My friend the majority leader referenced reports that Democratic \nstaffers should have--it should not have been plural--a Democratic \nstaff member knew about the abortion provision prior to the legislation \ncoming to the floor. Perhaps that is true, but I don't really know how \nthe abortion language got in the bill for sure. I think I know. But it \ngot in the bill. I think I know who put it in there, but it really \ndoesn't matter. The fact of the matter is it is in the bill, and I am \nmore concerned about getting the bill out.\n  We have had some columnists make fun about the fact that we should \nhave read the bill more closely. I will not go into a lot of detail, \nbut page 4 of the original bill--the section to which a lot of people \nlove to point--was eliminated. If you look at it, it is crossed out.\n  If you go to page 50 or 51, it is stuck back in that part of the \nbill, and this is where the controversy gets pretty interesting. A \nRepublican Senator who was responsible for this bill in the committee \nsent out a notice to all Senators, including Democrats, saying that we \nmade some changes in the bill that passed last year--one, two, three, \nfour, five, six changes that were made. The problem is he didn't \nindicate that they put the abortion language back in. It was really \nmisleading, as was indicated on the floor yesterday by Senator \nFeinstein.\n  We can go into why the language is in the bill. I have indicated I \nthink I know who put it in and why they put it in. But they did put it \nin the bill. It is in the bill. We can have all of these accusations \nabout paper trails and why it is in the bill, but it is in the bill, \nand it needs to come out.\n  Remember, Speaker Boehner, who has good qualifications for being the \nprotector of abortion rights, as seen by the Republicans, was able to \npass a version of this legislation without the abortion language. No \none can question Boehner's qualifications for being anti-abortion. If \nthey passed it in the House, why can't we do the same thing here?\n  Were the House Republicans wrong to pass the bill? I don't think so.\n  So before we embark upon a third iteration of the vote today, which \nis going to fail, I ask the Republican leadership: Are you interested \nin working toward a solution on this human trafficking legislation? If \nso, take this language out.\n  My friend the Republican leader was talking about leftwing lobbyists. \nThe leftwing lobbyists are women, who--as indicated on the floor \nyesterday by Senator Feinstein--are concerned about protecting their \nbodies and reproductive rights. They are interested in protecting \nthemselves, as they should be, and they are protecting women all over \nAmerica.\n  So are they only interested in scoring political points by forcing \nthese show votes or are they interested in reaching a solution? If they \nare interested in a solution, we are willing to work with them, but the \nabortion language is going to come out of this legislation.\n  For the first time in the history of our country, we are now focused \non not doing what has been done with the Hyde amendment for 30 years, \nand that is making sure there are no government taxpayer dollars spent \nfor performing abortions. Now they have moved beyond that to private \nfunding. It is wrong and we are not going to go there.\n  Would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/19/senate-section/article/S1638-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Lynch Nomination\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to address a \nvery serious accusation leveled yesterday against Republican Members of \nthis body by the Democratic whip, the Senator from Illinois. I do so \nwith some regret. The Senator from Illinois and I have been friends for \nmany years. We served in the House together and here in this body, and \nwe have worked together. That is why I was so surprised and \ndisappointed in the comments he made yesterday on the floor of the \nSenate--comments that are totally inappropriate to be made on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  My colleague from Illinois said:\n\n       The Republican majority leader announced . . . that he was \n     going to hold this nomination of Loretta Lynch until the bill \n     which is pending before the Senate passes, whenever that may \n     be.\n\n  Then he went on to say:\n\n       So Loretta Lynch, the first African-American woman \n     nominated to be Attorney General, is asked to sit in the back \n     of the bus when it comes to the Senate calendar. That is \n     unfair. It is unjust. It is beneath the decorum and dignity \n     of the U.S. Senate.\n\n  What is beneath the decorum and dignity of the U.S. Senate, I would \nsay to the Senator from Illinois, is for him to come to this floor and \nuse that imagery and suggest that racist tactics are being employed to \ndelay Ms. Lynch's confirmation vote. Such inflammatory rhetoric has no \nplace in this body and serves no purpose other than to further divide \nus.\n  Perhaps my colleagues, and the Senator from Illinois in particular, \nneed to be reminded of their own record when it comes to the treatment \nof African-American women whose nominations were before this body. In \n2003, Janice Rogers Brown--an African American--was nominated to serve \non the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia--a court that \nhad never included an African-American woman judge. The Senator from \nIllinois voted to filibuster her nomination in 2003 and again in 2005. \nWhen she was finally confirmed, after waiting 684 days, the Senator \nfrom Illinois voted against the historic nomination. I would never \nsuggest--even with veiled rhetoric--that Judge Rogers Brown's race was \nthe reason for the opposition to her nomination by the Senator from \nIllinois. And he should extend, I say to my colleague from Illinois, \nthat same courtesy to me and my colleagues.\n  I would also like to remind the Senator from Illinois about how we \nwere able to fill vacancies in the U.S. District Court of Arizona last \nyear--effectively alleviating a judicial emergency. With tremendous \nbipartisan support of the nomination of Senator Flake and myself, we \nconfirmed a diverse and historic slate of six nominees which included \nan Hispanic, an African American, and the first Native American woman \never to serve on the Federal bench. But their race had nothing to do \nwith their successful confirmations, just as the race of Ms. Lynch \nshould have no impact on her consideration in this body. Those six \njudges were approved by this body because each of\n\n[[Page S1639]]\n\nthem had shown a commitment to justice, public service, and the people \nof Arizona. Each had also demonstrated the judicial temperament and the \nprofessional demeanor necessary to serve with integrity.\n  I further point out to the Senator from Illinois that at no time has \nthe majority leader ever indicated that he would not bring the Lynch \nnomination to the floor; in fact, the opposite is true. We have made it \nvery clear time and again that we will consider the Lynch nomination \nonce we have disposed of the bipartisan trafficking bill. Had the \nSenator from Illinois and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nnot filibustered this bill over a manufactured crisis, we could have \nconsidered the Lynch nomination this week. They chose otherwise.\n  I deeply regret that the Senator from Illinois chose to come to the \nfloor yesterday and question the integrity and motivation of myself and \nmy Republican colleagues. It was offensive and unnecessary. I think he \nowes this body, Ms. Lynch, and all Americans, an apology.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am glad I heard the comments of my \ncolleague firsthand and I wish to respond to them directly.\n  As of today, Loretta Lynch, who is the President's nominee for \nAttorney General, has had her nomination pending before the U.S. Senate \nfor 131 days. How does that compare to previous nominees for Attorney \nGeneral? It is three times longer than the period of time that Attorney \nGeneral Ashcroft was pending before the U.S. Senate, 2\\1/2\\ times \nlonger than the time taken to confirm Attorney General Mukasey, and \ntwice as long as the time taken to confirm Attorney General Holder.\n  Why? In some cases, these nominees had questions that were raised by \nMembers of the Senate--questions about their political views, their \nbackground; legitimate questions requiring time to answer.\n  I sat in the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing for this nominee, \nLoretta Lynch. There were no questions raised of any nature, of any \nkind, questioning her ability to serve as Attorney General. None.\n  When my colleague from Arizona notes the fact that I have voted \nagainst African-American women nominees in the past, it is true. I am \nnot arguing that every Member of the Senate should vote for Loretta \nLynch simply because she would be the first African-American woman to \nserve in that capacity. All I am saying is she deserves the same fair \ntreatment we have given to other nominees for this job.\n  She has now been pending before the Senate longer than any nominee \nfor Attorney General in the last 30 years. She has been on the calendar \nnow--on the calendar waiting for a vote--for a longer period of time \nthan the last five nominees for Attorney General combined. Why? It has \nnothing to do with her qualifications for the job, which are the very \nbest.\n  Why in the world are we taking this important post--Attorney General \nof the United States of America--why are we taking this important civil \nrights moment, when the first African-American woman in history is \nbeing given an opportunity to serve, and entangling it in the politics \nof the Senate?\n  A week ago, the majority leader, Senator McConnell, said right \noutside this Chamber he was going to call her nomination this week. We \nbreathed a sigh of relief; she has been waiting so long. Then, over the \nlast weekend, he announced she wouldn't be called until a bill pending \non the floor is passed.\n  Yes, I am upset and frustrated on her behalf to think that she is \nbeing treated in this manner. I am not going to use any pejorative \nterms other than to say I believe it is insensitive for the Senate to \nhold her up for such a lengthy period of time with no objection to this \nwoman's character, fitness, and ability to continue to serve the United \nStates.\n  She has served. She is currently in a position as a U.S. attorney in \nNew York. She has the support of the following organizations: the \nNational District Attorneys Association, the Federal Law Enforcement \nOfficers Association, the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice, the Major Cities Chiefs Association, the Association of \nProsecuting Attorneys, the FBI Agents Association, and a long list of \nRepublican- and Democratic-appointed former U.S. attorneys, including \nPatrick Fitzgerald and Scott Lassar from the Northern District of \nIllinois. She has the support of former FBI Director Louis Freeh and \nformer Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson from the George W. Bush \nadministration.\n  Under ordinary circumstances, this would have been an easy ask for \nthe President to bring a person of this quality to the Senate for \nconfirmation. She had three votes supporting her on the Judiciary \nCommittee from the Republican side. I don't understand the objections \nof the others, but I respect whatever their reasoning.\n  All I am asking for--all the President is asking for and all the \nSenate is asking for--is a vote. Bring her off the pages of the \ncalendar, before the Senate, for a vote. Don't make it contingent on \nsome bill or some political agreement in the future. Let this woman, \nwho has led such an extraordinary life, have her chance to continue to \nserve the United States of America. That, to me, is only fair and only \njust and would be in keeping with the traditions of the Senate to \nfollow.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time during the \nquorum call be divided equally between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we find ourselves in the unusual posture \nof being stuck on a piece of legislation that had 12 Democratic \ncosponsors and was supported unanimously by all Republicans and all \nDemocrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and which \nuncharacteristically was brought to the floor without having to jump \nthrough the regular procedural hoops that legislation usually has to \njump through that requires consent by all 100 Senators.\n  So when you think about combating human trafficking and particularly \nthe targeting of 12- and 14-year-old girls who are of the typical ages \nand gender of the people who are victims of human trafficking, you \nwould think that if there is anything that ought to be able to avoid \nthe partisan wars here in Washington, DC, and the divisions that seem \nto separate us, it ought to be the subject of human trafficking. Well, \nI guess to say I was disappointed is an understatement. But I am \ndetermined to keep our focus on the victims of human trafficking, the \npeople this would help rescue and help heal and get on with their \nlives. Yes, I am also determined to make sure we can demonstrate that \nwe can function, something I thought Senators wanted to do.\n  After this last election there were a number of people who said: Gee, \nwe would really like to change the Senate to restore its reputation as \nthe world's greatest deliberative body, where we actually treasured and \nvalued solutions more than we did scoring partisan political points.\n  I come here today in the spirit of trying to offer a solution that \nwill help us get unstuck from where we have found ourselves. I see my \nfriend, the Senator from Maine, who has been working tirelessly to try \nto help us get unstuck, and perhaps this will help.\n  Just to recap: The way this bill was structured is it would deal with \nthe demand side of human trafficking; in other words, it would take the \nfines and penalties from the people who purchased these services and it \nwould create a crime victims compensation fund, which in essence would \nbe used to help provide the money to faith-based and other \norganizations that help rescue and help heal these victims of human \ntrafficking. Then we heard from some of our colleagues on the other \nside that they wanted to change the way this was structured so that it \nwas subject to the routine appropriations process and didn't enlarge \nthe way the traditional limitations on appropriations were treated \nunder the so-called Hyde amendment.\n\n[[Page S1640]]\n\n  Just to refresh everybody's memory: Since 1976, all funding, all \nappropriations bills, and many authorization bills, including the \nAffordable Care Act and the Defense authorization bills, have been \nsubjected to a limitation on the use of tax dollars for abortions \nexcept in the case of rape and in the cases where a physician certifies \nthe health of the mother is at stake. The bill we introduced that was \npassed out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously and has 12 Democratic \ncosponsors has a reference to an appropriations bill that had that same \nlimitation. The idea was that we wouldn't try to change the status quo; \nwe would try to maintain the status quo which has existed for 39 years. \nBut then some of our colleagues on the other side said, when offered an \nopportunity to vote on an amendment stripping that language out, they \nwould not even vote. They wanted to obstruct and filibuster this \nlegislation instead.\n  I, for one, am more interested in getting to a solution than I am \nengaging in this partisan point scoring. I believe there is a \nsufficient number of Members of the Senate who are sick and tired of \nthe dysfunction and who don't want to be distracted by the politics but \nwant to focus on how to help those 100,000 victims of human sex \ntrafficking who are estimated to exist on an annual basis.\n  What I have come to the floor to do is to say let's make this fund \nsubject to the annual appropriations process that will preserve the \nmoney for the victims and it cannot be used for any other purpose, but \nit will be subject to the Appropriations Committee and the usual riders \nthat have existed for 39 years. It won't represent an expansion of the \nHyde amendment, as some of our colleagues have expressed concerns \nabout. It would, basically, again, maintain the status quo.\n  I came to the floor yesterday and my friend, the Senator from \nCalifornia, was here. I pointed out that not only did she cosponsor \nthis legislation, she voted for it in the Judiciary Committee. But she \nnow feels so strongly--and I know it is a matter of good faith and true \nconviction for her, but she feels like this is the place where we ought \nto fight this fight--we ought to relitigate the scope of the Hyde \namendment. I don't think we have to do that. I am proudly pro-life and \nI believe the Hyde amendment represents one little island of consensus \nin the wars over abortion that we have. That is why for 39 years we \nhave had a limitation on tax dollars. Indeed, fines paid into this fund \nwould be public dollars. It wouldn't be generated from revenue, but it \nis not private money; once they are paid into this fund they are public \ndollars under my proposal, subject to appropriation on an annual basis \nby the Appropriations Committee. So now the money will flow from the \nvictims fund through the relevant appropriations bills. It will be \npreserved for the victims and cannot be used for any other purpose, and \nall spending limitations that have routinely applied to those bills \nwould apply to these funds as well.\n  So the question is, Can our friends who have been obstructing and \nfilibustering this legislation take yes for an answer? Can they take \nyes for an answer? I think this will also be very revealing, because we \nwill find out whether people are actually interested in a solution or \nare they trying to shut down the Senate and prevent us from functioning \non anything. As I said before, if we can't get the yes on an \nantitrafficking bill, Heaven help us on issues where there is not \nconsensus, where there are genuine policy differences.\n  I believe we can do exactly, for example, what Senator Leahy, the \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee, asked for on the floor on \nMarch 10. He said ``but let's have it on things it should be on--\nappropriations bills.'' So I would say yes, my proposal would give what \nSenator Leahy asked for.\n  Then the minority whip, Senator Durbin, the Senator from Illinois, \nsaid on March 16:\n\n       Henry Hyde authored the Hyde amendment that said no Federal \n     funds should be used to pay for abortion procedures except in \n     very limited circumstances: rape, incest, and life of the \n     mother. That has been put in appropriations bills every year \n     since--without question, without challenge.\n\n  That was stated by the minority whip, Senator Durbin from Illinois. \nMy proposal would facilitate exactly what he is arguing for. Can he say \nyes, take yes for an answer?\n  The minority leader, Senator Reid, said on the 11th: I served in the \nHouse of Representatives with Henry Hyde; a very fine man. He has had \nhis name affixed to an anti-abortion bill, anti-abortion legislation \nfor almost three decades. And it's been continued year after year in \nappropriations bills.\n  That was spoken by Senator Reid, the Democratic leader.\n  As I pointed out, what has perplexed me so much about all of this is \nthat our Democratic friends have routinely voted for appropriations \nbills that contain the same restriction. When it was said, well, now \nyou are extending it to an authorization bill, I pointed out that they \nvoted for this very similar restriction in the Affordable Care Act and \nthe Defense authorization bill, so that argument doesn't hold water; \nbut I am giving them a chance to say yes, and, in essence, trying to \nfind a way to break this impasse that has existed now for the last \ncouple of weeks.\n  So that is the question. Now that we have made a proposal to them to \ngive them what they have asked for and still preserve the 39-year \nlimitation on the use of public dollars for abortion, can they take yes \nfor an answer? I can't wait to hear what their response is to that \nproposal.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me first commend the senior Senator \nfrom Texas for his efforts to work out a compromise that I hope will \nallow this bill to go forward. Senator Heitkamp and I also have been \nworking with the senior Senator from Texas to try to come up with a \nsolution that is similar to what he has outlined, and we will have more \nto say about that after the vote.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to proceed \nas in morning business for the purpose of a bill introduction, unless \nsomeone else is seeking the floor to speak on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Collins pertaining to the introduction of S. 804 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Maine, my neighbor in New England.\n  We actually still have some debates on this floor. We had an \nimportant one yesterday. Someone called it a ``C-SPAN moment.'' It was \na focused and memorable discussion of a significant issue now before \nthe Senate. It was an honest discussion about what is at stake in the \ndebate we are having right now. The core question is how we are going \nto support the survivors, in what every Senator agrees is a heinous and \ndeplorable crime.\n  Late yesterday, Senator Feinstein spoke with powerful clarity about \nwhy the Hyde amendment has no place in what we are trying to do here, \nparticularly when this legislation we are debating does not involve \ntaxpayer funds. The Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund included in S. \n178 is funded by a special assessment fine collected from convicted sex \ntraffickers. It is intended to help survivors rebuild their lives.\n  Now, whether taxpayer dollars should be used to ensure the full range \nof health care options available to this very vulnerable population is \nan important debate. We will have that another day. But the application \nof the Hyde amendment when zero taxpayer dollars are involved is \nunprecedented. It represents a very significant change in Federal \npolicy.\n  When asked why the Hyde amendment has resulted in such an outcry, \nSenator Feinstein said simply but powerfully:\n\n       Because of what this legislation is. This legislation is \n     about the raping . . . of young girls.\n\n  Senator Feinstein is right. I encourage everyone to go back and watch \nher moving remarks that got right to the heart of this debate.\n  These are children who have been bought and sold like animals. They \nhave had every choice taken away from\n\n[[Page S1641]]\n\nthem. Now, if they survive, if they escape, we should not put limits on \nwhat health services they can seek. I stand with the survivors of these \ncrimes. I stand with Senator Feinstein.\n  This is a line we should not cross. Human trafficking victims are \noften not treated as rape victims. Too often these young girls are \ntreated as prostitutes, even though they had no choice in it. That is a \nfact we are trying to change, but we cannot ignore the reality that \nmany of these girls are put through our juvenile justice system and \nprosecuted as criminals, rather than treated as victims.\n  It is easy for some to claim that there is a so-called ``rape \nexception'' to the Hyde restriction but the reality is that for the \nsurvivors of this terrible crime, the rape exception feels more like an \noverwhelming bureaucracy. In many States, victims are forced to jump \nthrough hoop after hoop to qualify for the exception. They have to \nobtain police reports or certifications from State agencies. They have \nto relive the details of their trauma again and again. One State even \nrequires the Governor to approve any exception. Another State refuses \nto recognize the rape exception at all.\n  The easiest, most appropriate solution here is to simply remove the \nHyde restriction so that survivors can make their own health care \ndecisions. That is what the survivors are asking us to do. That is what \nthe professionals who work with human trafficking survivors are asking \nus to do.\n  Yesterday, my friend, the senior Senator from Texas, argued that the \ninclusion of the language was routine, that this does not change the \nstatus quo at all. Well that is simply not accurate. The Hyde amendment \nis about keeping taxpayer dollars out of the abortion debate. We may \nhave different opinions on the issue, but that is not what we are \ntalking about here.\n  The money at issue in this bill is not taxpayer dollars, it is money \ncollected from sex traffickers. The bottom line is that the offender-\nfinanced fund created in this bill relies on zero taxpayer dollars.\n  So if you want to maintain current practice, you have to remove this \nprovision. The House bill, that passed unanimously almost 2 months ago, \ndoes not contain this expansion of the Hyde amendment's reach. It does \nnot apply the Hyde amendment to nontaxpayer dollars. If Speaker Boehner \ncould find a way to bring the House together and pass this bill without \ninjecting abortion politics into the discussion, then why can't we do \nthat in the Senate?\n  Senator Feinstein is right. We have amendments we need to consider if \nwe can simply get past this stalemate, but she is also right that the \nissue at stake is too important to turn our back on. This is not a \nprovision we can just ignore and dismiss as the status quo. But I \nbelieve, as Senator Feinstein and others have said, we can find a path \nforward. The path forward should not be one that expands restrictions \non the health care choices of human trafficking survivors.\n  These survivors--many are 12 or 13 years old--let's not put further \nhurdles in front of them. Let's not push for a political agenda on \neither side. The Hyde amendment will appear on taxpayer-funded matters, \nas it usually does. That is one thing the Appropriations Committee will \nface. We are not talking about taxpayer dollars here. We are not \ntalking about taxpayer dollars.\n  This would be like reaching into a State and saying: Oh, by the way, \nyou have people who have raised money for a particular organization, \nnot taxpayer dollars, but we in Congress are going to restrict what you \ncan use that money for. Well, we do not do that. The reason we do not \ndo it is because our involvement is with taxpayer dollars. If we want \nto go and appropriate money in this area, that is the time to bring up \nthe issue.\n  The Appropriations Committee--I have served on that Committee for \nalmost 40 years--we handle that issue there, but not here.\n  What is the pending parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is on consideration of S. 178, with \nthe time until 12 noon equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I wish to speak about the bill that I \nwould have thought a few days ago would have passed by now--the bill \nbefore the Senate and the bill that addresses this topic of modern-day \nslavery. This bill came out of the Judiciary Committee in a unanimous \nfashion before it came to the Senate floor. Then, there was no dissent; \nwe agreed we should get right to the bill and pass it.\n  I am pleased to cosponsor the Victims for Justice of Trafficking Act, \nwhich includes sexual trafficking and labor trafficking. This bill \nwould help innocent victims of trafficking by creating grants for State \nand local governments to develop comprehensive systems to address these \nproblems in every State, we are told, and certainly in almost every \ncity--if not every city--where this is a problem.\n  This bill allows law enforcement to deal with the problem by giving \nthem the tools they need to hold the people accountable who are forcing \nthese violent crimes and violent living conditions and the abuse of \npeople's dignity in so many ways on others. Apparently, approximately \n100,000 American children each year are victims of commercial sex and \nchild prostitution and child trafficking, according to the National \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children. It is like so many numbers \nthat we think of. I would encourage everybody to think of any city they \ncan think of that has 100,000 people. Most of us would see that as a \nbig community and a lot of people--100,000 children every year--100,000 \nchildren every year, not every decade or every century--every year, in \nthe United States of America, not all over the world.\n\n  I would guess most Americans would assume if this is a problem, it \nhas to be a bigger problem in any other country, but 100,000 children \nhere among us are victims of this tragedy.\n  The Justice Department says there are more human trafficking cases \nprosecuted by Federal attorneys in Missouri's Western District, the \ndistrict where the U.S. Attorney's office is in Kansas City, MO, than \nanywhere else in the country. I hope that means the people in the \nWestern District of Missouri who run that office are doing an \nextraordinary job, but I think it would be foolish for me to think that \nthis isn't also an extraordinary problem. My house in Springfield, MO, \nis in that district, as are Springfield, Joplin, and Kansas City. These \nare places one wouldn't think, what is the No. 1 prostitution area for \nvictims of human trafficking in the country? The Western District of \nMissouri.\n  St. Louis, MO, is also one of the top 20 cities, we are told, for \nhuman trafficking, according to the Department of Justice. These are \nbad statistics, as every single statistic any of us could look at in \nour State could be. Of course, one case of human trafficking is one \ncase too many, but we are not, unfortunately, just talking about one \ncase; we are talking about lots of cases.\n  Earlier this month the FBI arrested a person in my State who was \ncharged with transporting a minor across State lines with the intent to \nengage in prostitution. The FBI reported the man involved was \nphysically abusive, verbally abusive, emotionally abusive, and sexually \nabusive to this young person he was using for himself and offering to \nothers. This modern-day slavery should not be allowed to continue.\n  The bill that is before the Senate right now, the Justice for Victims \nof Trafficking Act, has been endorsed by 200 different advocacy groups, \nincluding the NAACP, the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren, Exodus Cry, a Grandview, MO, group, Rights4Girls, the \nNational Association to Protect Children, the Fraternal Order of \nPolice, and the National Conference of State Legislatures. We can't \nvote on it here on the Senate floor? We can't get this bill on the \nPresident's desk? Why is that?\n  Why again today did the minority refuse to provide the votes we \nneeded to get from where we are to 60? We did have a few Members from \nthat side join us this week, but we are still short.\n  Let's deal with this problem. They say it is because there is a \nsection of the bill that deals with the Hyde amendment. OK, the Hyde \namendment has been around now for part of four decades. What does the \nHyde amendment do? It bans taxpayer-provided abortions.\n  One of the things we have done in this country is to say because \nthere is vast disagreement on this--we understand there is vast \ndisagreement. Surely we are not going to take money from some taxpayers \nwho are totally opposed to this and use it to pay for something they \nare totally opposed to. There is a provision in this bill. It was there \nwhen the bill was voted out of committee. It was there when everybody \nvoted to move to the bill. Suddenly, it is a provision that nobody was \naware of before. In fact, in committee, there was at least one \namendment that amended the sentence right below this sentence. So are \nwe not doing our job? Are we not reading these bills, or, are we just \nlooking for a reason not to get anything done? Surely the Senate in the \nlast half dozen years has proven to the country that the Senate can be \ndysfunctional. Surely we don't need to continue to make that case.\n  So let's get to work. Let's get down to business. Let's look at what \nneeds to be done here. Let's see what we could do to set an example for \nthe world. Frankly, there were colleagues who had amendments that could \nhave been at least debated that would have talked about what could be \ndone to carry this beyond our borders to deal with this modern-day \nslavery--whether for labor or for sex--in ways this issue should be \ndealt with.\n  I would love to see the President step forward and encourage the \nleaders of\n\n[[Page S1643]]\n\nhis party to get together and get the votes needed to pass this. Let's \nmove to a conclusion and put this on the President's desk. I think \nwithout the language that some people now suddenly find objectionable, \nthis bill wouldn't pass the House. But the bill will pass the House as \nreported out of committee, if the Senate would pass it, and it would be \non the President's desk. There is nothing new here.\n  I hope we get this done. I think people are ready to see the Senate \nwork. Let's get this done.\n  Let's get on with a budget for the first time in 7 years, if we could \njoin with the House of Representatives and say, OK, let's present a \nplan to the country of how we are going to get back to a balanced \nbudget and what our priorities are.\n  But one of our priorities should be to end the nightmare for victims \nof human trafficking, and we can't do that unless we face reality and \nget on this bill.\n\n\n                      Letter on Iran Negotiations\n\n  Also, Madam President, while I am here, I want to talk a little bit \nabout the letter I signed along with Senator Cotton and 45 others a few \ndays ago. I thought the interesting thing about that letter is that the \nletter was essentially addressed to the Foreign Minister of Iran but \nreleased to every newspaper in America. In many ways it was an idea \nthat is important that the American people understand.\n  I am sure the Iranian Foreign Minister, by the way, already \nunderstood it. If one had any interest in reading the Congressional \nRecord or watching C-SPAN or reading any newspaper in the last 6 \nmonths, you would have seen that the Senate was very concerned in a \nbipartisan way that the President was negotiating an agreement with \nanother country and was refusing to come to the Senate and ask for the \napproval that the Constitution anticipates should be there.\n  I was surprised by the Iranian Foreign Minister's response, which \nwas: Well, really, when you are dealing with this kind of situation, it \nis international laws that prevail. The laws of any individual country \ndon't matter. Well, we all take an oath when we are sworn in to the \nSenate that the law and the Constitution of the United States do matter \nand it is our job to uphold and defend the law and the Constitution of \nthe United States. There was nothing I saw that suggested the Iranian \nForeign Minister or anybody else should interpret that for me. The \nConstitution is pretty clear, by the way, that there is an advise-and-\nconsent responsibility. Frankly, advise means to talk to the Senate \nwhile you are negotiating.\n  I read somewhere the other day that, well, it is so presumptuous for \nthe Senate to want to give advice to the President before he has \nnegotiated an agreement. Well, the Constitution says that we are in a \nposition to do that. The traditions of the country say if the President \ndoesn't keep at least the right people in the Senate informed--the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, the minority senior person \nof that committee, the chairman of the defense committee, the Armed \nServices Committee--if they aren't kept informed, you are not going to \nbring people along as you should. That is obviously part of trying to \nmake the government work.\n  No matter what the President thinks, the Senate is not just an \ninconvenience; the Congress is not just an inconvenience. There is a \nreason for these branches of government.\n  Actually, in another interesting response, the Secretary of State \nsaid: Well, obviously this agreement is not binding on anybody but the \nperson who signs it. That is what I have been saying for about a year, \nbut it was interesting that it took this letter for the Secretary of \nState to say that. This agreement really doesn't bind anybody. If the \nPresident signs this agreement, it is an agreement, not a treaty. What \ndoes that mean? It means if it is not a treaty, then the government of \nthe United States hasn't agreed to it. Only the President of the United \nStates has agreed to it. President after President have brought \nagreements about nuclear weapons to the Senate--the START treaty, all \nthe treaties which were approved by the Senate. It would have been \nunthinkable just a few years ago that one would even think about \ncommitting our country to something that involves nuclear weapons \npotential and not involve the U.S. Senate.\n  So I think getting these issues on the table is a good thing. \nFrankly, I think a nuclear-weapons-capable Iran is the most \ndestabilizing thing that could happen in the world today. Not only our \ngreat ally and friends in Israel, but countries all over the Middle \nEast will immediately be concerned. Countries within reach of those \npotential future weapons in Europe and other places would soon be \nconcerned. We are headed down a bad path here, negotiating not that \nIran will never be allowed to have nuclear weapons but apparently \nnegotiating how long it will be from the moment they start until they \ncan have the enriched material it would take to have a nuclear weapon.\n  There are many countries in the world today that have nuclear power \nthat don't enrich in a way that would allow them to ever have a nuclear \nweapon. Iran, if it wanted to, could have added itself easily to that \nlist. Iran, one of the most energy-rich places in the world, could \neasily have added itself to that list, if it wanted to add to all that \nnuclear energy power. I think it is obvious the shadow that Iran would \nlike to cast over the next decade in the region they are already \ndominating in a handful of capitals is a shadow of nuclear weapons \ncapability. The United States should be very concerned, and this \ndiscussion at the highest levels is the right kind of discussion for \nthe country to be having.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President and colleagues, in my professional life I \nalways considered myself to be a numbers guy. As I have sat back and \nlistened to the debate over these past 17 days since the Justice for \nVictims of Human Trafficking Act was reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee, I decided I would maybe try a different take on the numbers \nwe should be concerned about.\n  As I said, it has been 17 days since the bill we are considering came \nout of the Judiciary Committee--56 days since the bill was first \nintroduced on January 13th. Now, some of my colleagues on the other \nside have said that somehow between when the bill was introduced on \nJanuary 13th and when it was reported out of Committee on March 10th, \nthere was a provision placed in the bill that they were not made aware \nof. This is simply not the case. My colleagues had days to review this \nbill, but unfortunately, some of them are in the habit of passing \nsomething and then finding out later what they were actually voting \nfor.\n  It has been 39 years since the Hyde language we are currently \ndiscussing was first passed into law. It was so long ago I was even \nyoung--16 years old. The Hyde language was first enacted in 1976, and \nsince then, has become known, well-settled law. Obviously, this is not \nsome sort of new concept. It is language that everybody who is in this \nbody--and every staffer who has served somebody in this body--should \nknow about.\n  Now, with the Hyde amendment being around for some four decades, I \nwas trying to figure out: Well, maybe we are talking about Members who \nare familiar with the Hyde language, but never voted for it.\n  So I decided to go back to my numbers and take a look at the voting \nhistory of the Senators in this Chamber today, many of whom--all of \nwhom, actually--on this graphic are now preventing this very important \nhuman trafficking legislation from moving forward.\n  The minority leader has voted in support of the Hyde amendment 14 \ntimes, and all these other Senators on my chart at least a dozen times, \nwith the exception of Senator Boxer who has voted in support of the \nHyde language 10 times. Senator Boxer stood on the floor last week and \nsaid it was offensive language. However, Senator Boxer has voted for \nthis language 10 times, most recently this past December when they \npassed the fiscal year 2015 omnibus bill.\n\n[[Page S1644]]\n\n  So one wonders what they are really trying to accomplish here. I hear \nthem. My Democrat colleagues are very sympathetic to the content of the \nbill. I hear them say that human trafficking is horrible, and we need \nto do something about it. But their words do not fit their actions. \nTheir words say we ought to move forward and end these horrible \nsituations--and I will talk a little bit more about those numbers \nlater--but their actions are just burning time in this body preventing \nus from moving on to the many other important things we need to \naddress--such as our national security, our economic security, and our \nenergy security. But no, we have spent 17 days on a bill that my \ncolleagues in the Democratic caucus say we should act on, but are at \nthe same time impeding the process.\n  Now, as confusing as these numbers are, as confusing as it is to hear \nso many Senators say that this language is offensive and needs to be \ntaken out--despite the fact that they have regularly voted for it in \nthe past--the very sad result of their actions are what we are not \ngetting done, and that is getting the human trafficking bill passed so \nwe can end the horrible conditions that are imposed on the many people \nwho are enslaved on a daily basis.\n  I'm going to give my colleagues a couple of numbers to think about. \nThe State Department and other agencies estimate that there are 600,000 \nto 800,000 people trafficked across global borders each year. That is \nabout 1,600 to 2,200 boys, girls, men, and women being enslaved every \nsingle day in this world.\n  Now, in our country, it is estimated that 17,500 people are \ntrafficked across our borders into the U.S. sex trade every year and \nthat there are about 100,000 people already here.\n  Think about that in terms of the numbers. Every day that goes by, \nthere are another 50 victims from overseas trafficked into the U.S. for \nsex trade--every single day another 50 people.\n  This week, we have had five votes on this bill. This means, another \n250 young girls, young boys, women, and men will have been trafficked \ninto our country for sex trade.\n  This is a good bill, and it works to stop the growth of human \ntrafficking and free those who are currently enslaved.\n  Colleagues, I am a freshman. I have been here fewer than 70 days. \nWhen I read the human trafficking bill, I knew that the Hyde amendment \nwas in it. Anybody who is doing their job in the Senate should have \nbeen able to figure that out.\n  So it raises a very interesting question--how could we come out of \nthe Judiciary Committee, which I serve on, with a unanimous vote? As a \nmatter of fact, there are 12 Democrat cosponsors of this bill. \nCertainly, those Members of the Democratic Caucus read the bill and \ntheir staffs had time to read the bill in the months that the language \nhas been public.\n  So, colleagues, I wonder if it is really about the human trafficking \nbill and the language or if it is about a strategy just to slow the \nprocess down, but what I think is so sad is the human consequences of \nthis inaction, and we need to move forward.\n  I just came from the Senate steps to take a picture with about 100 \nstudents from my great State of North Carolina.\n  While I had time before the photographer arrived to let them ask me \nfew questions, I said: I am going to have to go to the Senate floor \nsoon and speak. They said: What are you going to speak on?\n  I was really at a loss for words. I was wondering how I was going to \ntell them I am trying to help pass legislation that makes them safer, \nbut we are having a petty fight in the Senate over process.\n  So I really ask Members of the Democratic caucus to look into their \nhearts and to understand the human tragedy this legislation is \nattempting to correct and join with us to pass this bill and move on to \nthe many other things we need to do for this great Nation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have had a lot of discussion regarding \nthe pending bill. I thought again I would emphasize what Senator \nFeinstein said earlier, which was so good, and I hope people will \nlisten to her words. I would just follow on to that to say my good \nfriend--and he is my friend--the distinguished senior Senator from \nTexas has suggested that we make the funds collected from traffickers \nsubject to the appropriations process to get around this impasse, but \nthat does not solve the problem.\n  The pending legislation came out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nan authorizing committee that does not appropriate funds. We should be \ntelling appropriators that we believe services to trafficking victims \nare important by authorizing funds. As the most senior member of that \nAppropriations Committee I can tell you that this is an important \nprocess that results in real money for victim services.\n  It is a process that works well. Under Democratic leadership of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, total appropriations for trafficking \nvictims' services more than doubled from $28.1 million in FY2014 to \n$58.1 million for FY2015.\n  Senator Cornyn's proposal to simply funnel fees collected from \ntraffickers through the appropriations process still presents the same \nproblem--this is not taxpayer money, and subjecting it to the Hyde \namendment would expand the amendment's reach to an offender-financed \nfund meant for women and children who should have all options available \nto them when it comes to health services after being sexually \nexploited.\n  I would quote what the House Republican author of this bill, \nCongressman Poe, said today:\n\n       We passed a bill. The Senate should take it up and pass it.\n\n  That could be done immediately. I don't think there would be anybody \ntrying to block it. The Republican House of Representatives passed this \nbill unanimously. We could take up and pass it, and not waste 2 weeks \nof having this dance on the floor, vote after vote, which both sides \nknow isn't going anywhere. The easiest and best thing to do is to \nremove the Hyde restriction so survivors can make their own health care \ndecisions.\n  I will not do it again today, but I put into the Record letters and \nstatements from hundreds of people--survivors' organizations and the \npeople they represent--and they have said: Let us make our own health \ncare decisions.\n  Now, to argue what my friend from Texas says, that the inclusion of \nthis language is routine and it does not change the status quo at all, \nis not accurate. In fact, that is probably why, I suspect, a majority \nof the Members of the House of Representatives--who support the Hyde \namendment--did not include it in the House version of the bill. The \nHyde amendment is about keeping taxpayer dollars out of the abortion \ndebate. Now, we can have different opinions on the issue, but that is \nnot what we are talking about here. The money at issue in this bill is \ncollected from sex traffickers.\n  The bottom line is the offender-financed funds raised in this bill \nrely on zero taxpayer dollars. Maintaining the current practice, if \nthat is what you want to do, means removing the provision. Maybe we \nought to listen to some of the leadership on the Appropriations \nCommittee and how they feel about this. They are not the ones asking to \ndo this. The Appropriations Committee is not asking us to turn them \ninto some kind of a superauthorizing committee, and we should not put \nthem in that position.\n  I hope cooler heads will prevail and come together on this. I think \nit will be very easy for both sides who do want to stop sex trafficking \nto come together, and pass this bill.\n  Then, let us also take the steps to correct what has been a shameful \nposition in the U.S. Senate and confirm Loretta Lynch as Attorney \nGeneral. She has waited on the floor much longer than the four men who \npreceded her put together. This woman has waited longer than those four \nmen before her put together, and yet everybody applauds her as a superb \nprosecutor. We talk about sex trafficking, and she is about the only \nperson we have seen in here as a nominee who has actually prosecuted \nsex traffickers. Let's get on with the job.\n\n[[Page S1645]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I saw on television my friend from \nVermont, the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, talking \nabout the virtues of the House human trafficking bill, and I thought it \nwould be worthwhile for Members and whoever else is listening to \nunderstand the difference between the two bills.\n  First of all, our bill, the one that is being filibustered by our \nDemocratic colleagues--I should say, all but four of them--contains a \n$30 million fund that is financed through criminal funds. This is \nanalogous to a crime victims compensation fund. For example, when I was \nattorney general of Texas, we administered one, and we were able to \nmake grants to various organizations. That is what this $30 million \nfund would be. The bill on the House side actually has no fund. It is \nan authorization. It is a $5 million authorization. It has no money. It \nhas no mechanism to generate funds like ours does.\n  Our bill contains language increasing restitution for trafficking \nvictims by using criminal assets to satisfy these needs and allowing \nlaw enforcement to pay witness-assistance award money to victims.\n  The bill in the House does nothing. In other words, we have an asset-\nforfeiture provision in our bill to take the people who profit from \nhuman trafficking and to forfeit those funds and use that to add to the \nfines and use that money to help rescue and heal the victims. The House \nbill has nothing in it in that regard.\n  Our bill requires law enforcement agencies to file regular reports of \nhuman trafficking case totals as part of the Uniform Crime Reporting \nProgram. That is important because so much of the human trafficking \ndamage is never reported to law enforcement.\n  First of all, many victims of human trafficking are children who may \nor may not actually consider themselves victims. They may be runaways. \nThey may find some adult who has taken them under their wing, only to \nturn them out on the streets as prostitutes and the like. They may not \nactually consider themselves victims, at least initially, which they \nare.\n  Our bill would make sure the statistics and reports of human \ntrafficking totals are reported in the Uniform Crime Reporting Program \nso we would actually have a better objective record about the number of \ncases and so people could appreciate the severity of this problem. The \nbill in the House has nothing in that regard.\n  Next, our bill clarifies that child pornography producers are engaged \nin commercial sex acts. The bill on the House side does nothing in that \nregard.\n  Our bill requires persons indicted for human trafficking to be \ntreated as violent criminals for purposes of pretrial, in terms of the \navailability of bail. The bill on the other side of the Capitol, in the \nHouse, does nothing in that regard. Our bill requires prosecutors and \njudges to undergo training to improve restitution in traffic cases. \nAgain, our friends on the other side of the Capitol--their bill does \nnothing in that regard.\n  Finally, our bill requires human traffickers to remain under \nsupervision for at least 5 years after they are released from prison. \nOn the House side, it doesn't touch on that.\n  I don't say that to criticize the House bill, because I think they \nhave done some good work. But it is important to recognize that the \nbill over here, which is being filibustered by our Democratic minority, \ndoes a lot more and a lot of different things, and things that I think \nare going to be a lot more helpful to the victims of human trafficking, \nwhich I can only imagine should be our collective goal.\n  I came to the floor this morning, and I said that we would be willing \nto work with our Democratic colleagues to try to address some of their \nstated concerns with the original bill. I said that notwithstanding the \nfact that 12 Democrats cosponsored the bill, the original bill that is \nnow being filibustered. Nine Democrats, along with all of the \nRepublicans on the Judiciary Committee, voted to pass the bill out of \nthe Judiciary Committee. Literally all 100 Senators had to consent for \nthe bill to come to the floor without going through the typical \nprocedural hurdles with which we are all very familiar.\n  Imagine my surprise, when in the middle of last week, these \nobjections came up. What was the nature of the objection? The objection \nwas that this bill contained a reference to an appropriations bill that \nwas passed in 2014 and for which all of our Democratic colleagues \nvoted. But that reference was to a restriction on the use of taxpayer \ndollars to fund abortions, known as the Hyde amendment. Then after they \nsaw that or after they claimed that this was something new and \nunbeknownst to them, they objected.\n  I just simply cannot accept this argument that a provision that \ncolleagues on that side of the aisle have routinely voted for on \nappropriations bills, that they routinely voted for on Defense \nauthorization bills, and one they voted for on the Affordable Care Act, \nrestricting the use of taxpayer funds under these circumstances--why \nthey would pick this vehicle to object to that very same provision.\n  I accept at face value that some of our colleagues said that this is \nsomething they perhaps should have read more closely but they failed to \ndo. I personally find it a little hard to believe, given the nature of \nthe professional staff we have here in the Senate, that Members did not \nknow that this restriction, known as the Hyde amendment, was part of \nthe underlying bill. But assuming that is the case, what we are now \noffering them is a middle ground--to say that instead of this fund \nbeing a separate pool of money outside of the appropriations process, \nwe would agree that the Appropriations Committee would appropriate \nmoney out of this fund in the same manner as they do all \nappropriations, with the exception that the money would be specifically \ndesignated to help the victims of human trafficking and not be able to \nbe used for any other purpose.\n  So the reports are--after we made this proposal trying to address \nsome of the concerns on this side of the aisle--that they would not be \nhappy unless we stripped out all reference to the Hyde amendment in the \nbill. That is unacceptable. That is unacceptable for the same reason \nthat they would object to a change in the status quo by an expansion of \nthe Hyde amendment. We have now brought the Hyde amendment back within \nthe appropriations process where it has been for 39 years. But to say \nwe are going to eliminate any reference to those restrictions, which \nhave been the law of the land for 39 years, would be viewed as an \nerosion of the Hyde amendment--hardly a status quo.\n  I don't know how long this is going to take. I appreciate the \nperseverance and commitment of the majority leader who, as you know, \ndetermines what bills come to the floor and when and who says we are \ngoing to stay on this bill until it passes. We have had a number of \nvotes, and four of our Democratic colleagues have joined us to get to a \nplace where we could actually pass this legislation. We just need a \nhandful more--two or three more--to help us.\n  I know that a number of Senators are going to be hearing from their \nconstituents back in their States because 200 different organizations--\nlaw enforcement organizations and victims' rights organizations that \nare very concerned about this human trafficking plague--are going to be \nlighting up the phone lines, sending emails, and communicating with \ntheir elected officials--as they should.\n  There is no reason we cannot get to ``yes'' on this bill unless this \nwhole debate is a phony debate, and what the leadership on the \nDemocratic side is more concerned about is trying to make the Senate as \ndysfunctional in the 114th Congress as they did in the 113th Congress.\n  I suspect, unfortunately, because of the phony issues saying take out \nlanguage we voted for time and again--yes, it was contained in a bill \nwe cosponsored. Yes, it was contained in a bill we voted for already. \nNow we are going to come to the floor, and we are going to block it.\n  We know who pays for this political gamesmanship. Sadly, it is the \nvery same victims whom our colleagues\n\n[[Page S1646]]\n\nhere on the floor say they want to help--the children--the 100,000 \nchildren who are subjected to human trafficking each year. Other people \nwho need our help and deserve our help are among the most vulnerable \npeople we can possibly imagine.\n  All of us are mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers. We all \nunderstand this could happen to anybody's family. Why in the world \nwould we want to indulge in this sort of gamesmanship and phony \nobjections to provisions that have been voted for time and again by the \nsame Members who now object to them on this legislation and say to \nthese victims of human trafficking that we don't care and we are not \ngoing to help?\n  I don't believe for a minute that is why Members of the Senate come \nhere. I know virtually all 100 Senators, and I believe that most \nSenators--if not all Senators--come here because they actually want to \ndo something. They actually want to solve problems. They actually want \nto help people who need the help. I cannot think of anybody more \ndeserving than the victims of human trafficking.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Colorado here. I will yield for \nhim momentarily.\n  I wanted to come to the floor and respond to the comments made by the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont, the ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, that all we need to do is take up and pass the House bill. \nThe House bill doesn't appropriate any money. It is an authorization \nbill. It authorizes $5 million in appropriations.\n  The great thing about our bill is it doesn't take any tax dollars. \nThese are all fines and penalties and asset forfeitures from people \nengaged in the criminal enterprise, and this takes some of the profit \nout of this terrible crime.\n  It also does a number of other things, which I mentioned earlier. But \nthe idea that we can somehow just take up and pass the House bill and \navoid this bogus objection and somehow solve the problem, I think, just \nmisses the point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, through the Chair, I would like to thank \nthe senior Senator from Texas for his courtesy in allowing me to speak \nthis afternoon.\n\n\n                            Lynch Nomination\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the nomination of Loretta \nLynch to be our next Attorney General. It has been 131 days since \nPresident Obama nominated her for this position. By Monday, she will \nhave waited longer on the Senate floor than the last seven Attorney \nGeneral nominees combined.\n  When it comes to Ms. Lynch's nomination, it seems as if we are \nsetting records--but for all of the wrong reasons. The irony of that is \nthat she is probably one of the most qualified and least political \nAttorney General nominees that this Chamber has seen in decades.\n  She has spent a significant portion of her career as a Federal \nprosecutor in the Eastern District of New York, having twice served as \nthe U.S. attorney. There she took on corrupt public officials and \nexpanded the office's national security practice. She has also worked \nin private practice at one of the country's top law firms, where she \nspecialized in commercial litigation, white-collar criminal defense, \nand corporate compliance.\n  In 2011, she was recognized as the Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation Foundation honoree of the year. In 2014, she was honored as \nthe recipient of the Women in Federal Law Enforcement Foundation \nPresident's Award. She has received support--no surprise--from all \nacross the political spectrum.\n  Just this week, even former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani--hardly a \ngreat friend of the President--wrote that she was ``balanced, \nprofessional and a dedicated public servant.'' He went on to write that \nhe can ``further attest that her skill set seems very appropriate to \nthe tough tasks she would face as attorney general.''\n  The Major Cities Chiefs Association, which represents the 67 largest \nlaw enforcement agencies in the country, wrote this to the Senate: \n``Ms. Lynch has overseen many important criminal prosecutions for \nterrorism, organized crime, corruption, drug and gang related cases. It \nis clear that her familiarity with the Department, managing a fast-\npaced and high profile office as well as her integrity and private \nsector legal experiences make her a qualified candidate.''\n  What are we waiting for?\n  Some 25 former U.S. attorneys who worked in both Democratic and \nRepublican administrations wrote to this body saying: ``Ms. Lynch has \nthe experience, temperament, independence, integrity, and judgment to \nimmediately assume this critically important position.'' They should \nknow. They should know. These are the folks with whom she has worked \nclosely, and will continue to work as Attorney General. Both as a \nFederal prosecutor and in private practice, they have seen firsthand \nher character, intellect, and her integrity.\n  I myself once worked for the Deputy Attorney General of the United \nStates at the Department of Justice. I know how close the collaboration \nis when things are working well between the Attorney General and the \nU.S. attorneys all throughout the United States of America, and it is \nsomething to see.\n  I know it has become fashionable around this place to continually \ncriticize our Federal employees, but I recommend that our new \ncolleagues, if they ever have the chance, go see the investiture of a \nnew judge in their State, as I have had a chance to do in my State. \nWhen you see how the U.S. attorney's office, the Federal public \ndefender's office, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI, and the U.S. \nMarshals Service are all represented, you will say to yourself: Thank \nGod I live in a country that is committed to the rule of law. Thank God \nI live in this country instead of most of the countries around the \nworld where they don't even know what the rule of law is.\n  That is what we have in the United States, and the chief law \nenforcement officer of this country is our Attorney General.\n  Everybody who has looked at this nomination from the outside has said \nshe would be an excellent Attorney General. So given all of that, it is \nawfully difficult to understand why she has had to wait so long just to \nreceive a simple up-or-down vote. Has anyone challenged her \nqualifications? Come to the floor today and do it. Has anyone \nquestioned her character or integrity? Of course not. Has she failed to \nprovide necessary information to the Senate? It is my understanding \nthat she testified for almost 8 hours and responded to about 900 \nquestions for the record. Is her nomination delayed just to make \npolitical points on completely unrelated issues?\n  I have gotten to the point now that when people come to my office \nafter they have been nominated to be a judge or have been nominated to \ndo something in the Federal Government, the first words out of my mouth \nare not ``Congratulations'' anymore; the first words to come out of my \nmouth are ``Don't take it personally. Don't take this process \npersonally.''\n  We are losing talented people who want to serve the United States of \nAmerica in these important and in many cases nonpolitical jobs because \nthe Senate cannot confirm them. It is because we tell somebody like \nLoretta Lynch: Sorry, it is going to be zillions of days before you \nhave a chance to even serve this country.\n  It is not right. I am amazed at the capacity of people in this place \nto waste their own time, but we should not waste other people's time.\n  Unfortunately, the delay in confirming Ms. Lynch is having real-world \nconsequences. Earlier this week, the former Deputy Attorney General \nexpressed his concern that the protracted nomination process is adding \nunnecessary uncertainty to the Department of Justice. He highlighted \nthe importance of having continuity in undertaking long-term \ninvestigations or in developing national security policy and how it is \nharder to facilitate continuity the longer Ms. Lynch's nomination is \ndelayed.\n  As I said, this has become in many ways the new norm in our politics \nwhere these fights in Congress are having real-world consequences on \nthe people we represent. It is incredibly counterproductive to the \npeople we represent, whether it is shutting down the Department of \nHomeland Security or running the government on continuing resolutions \nor passing 2-week tax extender bills, for goodness' sake. There is not \na mayor or county commissioner\n\n[[Page S1647]]\n\nin the entire State of Colorado who could get away with governing like \nthis, and neither should we. It is obvious to everybody watching the \nSenate that we have not been productive. We have not really been \nproductive for a long time but certainly not for the last 90 days. We \nbarely managed to keep the Department of Homeland Security open for \nanother 6 months. We passed a resolution of disapproval that the \nPresident will veto.\n  At the very least, we should be able to find the time to confirm \nLoretta Lynch as the Nation's next Attorney General. Her experience, \ntemperament, and independence make her abundantly qualified for one of \nthe most important positions our country has, and she has waited too \nlong to receive an up-or-down vote.\n  I am not worried about her; she will be fine no matter what she does. \nI am worried about the Department. I am worried about our homeland \nsecurity. I am worried about the willingness of other Americans to put \ntheir hand up and say ``Let me serve'' for fear that they will get \ncaught in the crazy politics of the Senate.\n  I look forward to supporting Ms. Lynch's nomination. I hope we will \nhave the opportunity to consider that nomination in the coming days.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, this is an important subject. For many, \nit is a matter of life and death. So I am pleased that we are taking up \nthis bill so early in the session.\n  The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act can save lives, it can \nrestore dignity to the victims of these heinous crimes, and it can help \nend modern-day slavery. I believe, without a doubt, every Member of \nthis body wants to see this bill become law. I hope we can overcome \nthis delay and send the bill to the President so we can make it a \nreality.\n  As the father of three girls and as a grandfather of granddaughters, \nI support the bill. I cosponsored it. I am eager to see it become law. \nBy doing so, we will build on our previous efforts that have \ndramatically reduced instances of human trafficking around the globe.\n  Since the passage of the landmark Trafficking Victims Protection Act \nof 2000, the United States has been a leader in the international \ncommunity's fight to end modern-day slavery. This law ushered in a new \nstrategy that addressed human trafficking on multiple fronts.\n  Combining strong protection for victims, including shelter and \nasylum, with tough punishments for traffickers, including long jail \nsentences and asset confiscation, and, most importantly, sanctions for \noffending governments, the law has enabled us to crack some of the \nbiggest international human smuggling rings.\n  The most recent statistics show that during the 12-year period from \n2000 to 2012, over 1,100 traffickers were charged in the United States, \nresulting in 755 successful convictions. The Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act can replicate these successes in combating \ninternational trafficking by helping us take on the traffickers here at \nhome.\n  This is an effort by my colleagues that we can all agree is \nworthwhile, which is clear by how easily this passed in committee and \nby the level of bipartisan cosponsorship it maintains. So I am not \nquite certain I understand what the Democratic leadership's strategy \naims to accomplish. The language they now find objectionable has been \nin the bill all along. It is standard language that has been around for \ndecades.\n  On top of that, the majority leader offered a vote to strip the \nlanguage. Yet the minority continues to block this bill from floor \nconsideration. Not only can they offer an amendment to strip that \nlanguage, but Members of the minority can offer any amendment they \nwant, any amendment they believe will make the bill stronger. That is \nthe amazing thing about regular order. I know some Senate Democrats are \nstill getting used to the idea after years of being forced to the \nsidelines by their own leadership, but this is a good change which we \nshould all embrace.\n  I believe this particular bill was strong from the onset, but I have \noffered a couple of amendments to make it even stronger and better. \nBoth of these amendments make improvements to our efforts to address \ntrafficking on the global stage.\n  The first one deals with countries that try to game the system to \navoid sanctions. The State Department's tier system for ranking \noffending countries is an excellent tool for ferreting out the problem \ngovernments and prompting positive change. By utilizing the threat of \nsanctions, we can effect change for the better.\n  Regrettably, some countries have abused the system and taken \nadvantage of the ``special watch list'' designation that is supposed to \nbe reserved for troubled nations making good-faith efforts to actually \nchange. These nations have been able to get this designation without \never attempting to address human trafficking and, in turn, avoiding the \nsanctions that they deserve. China is a perfect example.\n  With this amendment, we can put an end to the games. It will close \nthe loopholes that allow governments to retain the ``special watch \nlist'' designation without making immediate progress to reduce human \ntrafficking or face quick removal. This will force governments to take \nreal action, not just a nod and a wink to the problem to buy sanctions \nrelief.\n  The second amendment aims to put more teeth in the State Department's \nOffice to Monitor and Combat Trafficking. This amendment seeks to \nrename it and elevate it to the status of bureau to increase its \neffectiveness so that those responsible for this essential diplomatic \ntool are heard within the State Department.\n  These two amendments will help our overall strategy to combat \ntrafficking, but again, this bill, as it was introduced, would be a \nhuge help in our efforts to save lives.\n  The bill has the support of 200 advocacy groups, many of which are \nlaw enforcement organizations. These advocacy groups are voicing the \nsame concerns we hear on the local level in our communities back home--\nthat this is a real problem with real victims--and our local officials \nwant this bill passed for that exact reason.\n  Just last week, I was visiting with some of my State's mayors who \nwere in Washington for the Arkansas Municipal League fly-in, and the \nissue came up. The mayor of Hot Springs, AR, Ruth Carney, said that \nthis is an issue which is really close to her heart and highlighted \nthat Garland County has a task force to tackle human trafficking. She \nsaid: ``It's a great thing to see that Congress is working to help with \nthis situation because I feel like it's very important for our \ncountry.'' I imagine that the Senators holding up this bill hear the \nsame thing from their State and local officials. Perhaps they should \nlisten to them about the importance of getting this done.\n  So why drag this on longer? We could pass this bill within hours if \nthe Democrats would drop this manufactured outrage over language that \nhas been in the bill since its introduction. This language has \nliterally been applied to similar legislation for decades.\n  The senior Senators from Texas and Minnesota came together in a \nbipartisan manner to draft this important legislation. It was passed by \nthe committee, in regular order, in a similar bipartisan manner.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand with the victims, pass this bill, get \nthem help, and get our communities the resources they need to save \nthousands more from becoming victims.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today, we are continuing our consideration \nof the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. I should note from the \noutset this is a bill that essentially every Senator--every single one \nof us--supports. How could we not? Right now in this country there are \nthousands of human beings living as slaves--stolen from their homes, \nstripped of their God-given rights, and robbed of their human dignity. \nA disproportionate number of these victims are women and children, \noften forced into sex slavery. These are crimes that shock the \nconscience, and every single one of us\n\n[[Page S1648]]\n\nshould do everything in our power to stop this scourge and help make \nthe victims whole again.\n  The legislation we are currently considering makes important steps \ntoward achieving those goals. It treats children trapped in these \nhorrible circumstances for what they are--victims, not criminals. It \nimposes stiff penalties on traffickers, exactly the sort their \ndespicable crimes merit. It establishes an effective means of \nrestitution for the victims, helping them to begin to rebuild their \nlives in the wake of enormous suffering.\n  I applaud the majority leader for his commitment to getting this bill \npassed. It is exactly the sort of legislation the Senate should be \nconsidering. While this may seem an obvious point, it is worth spelling \nout why this is true.\n  The majority leader's traditional right to be recognized first gives \nhim control over what sort of legislation we consider. There is always \na temptation to bring up partisan bills, so-called messaging bills. \nThese bills are not designed to actually pass; after all, we all know \nwe need 60 votes for cloture and 67 votes to override a veto. Instead, \nthe goal of these messaging bills are to make a political point for the \nnext election or even just for the next news cycle.\n  In the last Congress, the Democratic leadership called up these sort \nof messaging votes week after week. They repeatedly moved to bring up \nhighly partisan bills that they refused to let us attempt to amend, \nwith full knowledge that many of us would therefore have to vote \nagainst them and in most cases have to make them get at least 60 votes.\n  In last fall's election, the American people showed just how fed up \nthey were with partisanship and gridlock by voting in a new Republican \nmajority that promised a return to productive legislating through \nregular order. The majority leader's commitment to passing this human \ntrafficking bill demonstrates how those of us in the new majority are \ntrying our hardest to keep our promise to get the Senate back to work \nfor the American people. This is not about partisan messaging votes \ndoomed for failure. This is about getting a bill with broad bipartisan \nsupport passed into law that makes meaningful progress in our fight \nagainst the evils of human trafficking. Scoring political points for \nour party is rightfully taking a backseat for producing important \nresults for our country.\n  Nevertheless, our majority can only do so much on its own. Simply \nput, it is hard to get much done in the Senate without bipartisan \ncooperation. So for all the restraint the majority has shown by \nbringing up bills such as this one that enjoy broad bipartisan support, \nwe need at least some measure of restraint from the minority. By \nrestraint, I do not mean to call for my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle to give up all their principles and simply give in to \neverything the majority wants. Instead, I mean the minority cannot \ndemand getting their way on every single issue, that they should be \nwilling to work through the open amendment process to reach an \naccommodation. Unfortunately, we find ourselves at an impasse with the \nminority claiming we somehow ambushed them with supposedly \ncontroversial language that they now are demanding we remove. My \ncolleagues and I have come to the floor repeatedly over the past few \ndays to illustrate just how ridiculous that claim is--how the language \nthat is in the bill has been in there every step of the way since its \nintroduction and how the Democrats had voted for it over and over again \nover the nearly 40 years it has been settled law.\n  Beyond all of the rhetoric, the pivotal moment in this debate came \nwhen the majority leader came to the floor and offered an up-or-down \nvote to strip out the language in question. This offer should have \nsettled this controversy once and for all. It represented the majority \nleader extending his hand across the aisle in hopes of cooperation, but \nthe minority leader objected, demanding a guarantee the provision would \nbe removed. Well, that is not the way it works around here. That moment \nrevealed what this logjam is really about. This is about the minority \nleadership resorting to the same ``my way or the highway'' tactics they \nabused when they were in the majority, tactics that have no place in a \nbody built on compromise. This is about trying to stir up a fake \ncontroversy to fit a discredited war-on-women narrative.\n  Above all else, this is about scoring political points and trying to \nembarrass the majority by undermining our efforts to govern \nresponsibly. This behavior is itself embarrassing and unworthy of this \ngreat institution in which we all serve, but it comes at a price.\n  It comes at a price for the victims of human trafficking whose \nsuffering we are all committed to alleviate. It comes at a price for \nthose men, women, and children living in silence, fear, hopelessness, \nand unspeakable anguish.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are not bad people--far \nfrom it. They are men and women of great character who want to do the \nright thing for their constituents and for the Nation. I have enormous \nrespect for each and every one of them, but in this latest maneuver, I \nfeel many of them have gotten so caught up in partisan rhetoric--\nsomething that is so easy to do in Washington--that they have staked \nout an unjustifiable position that is prolonging the suffering of \ntrafficking victims.\n  Let's be honest about it. The Hyde amendment has been in many bills \nthat we all voted for time after time after time. However, NARAL, the \nNational Abortion Rights Action League, and Planned Parenthood have \ntried to make this into an issue that it should never have been made \ninto. Unfortunately, we don't have any courage on the other side of the \naisle except for a few Senators who are willing to vote with us. We \ndon't have any real courage to take on these people.\n  My gosh. I mean there comes a time--keep in mind, how do Republicans \ngive in on this when this has been such an established law of our \ncountry?\n  I ask my colleagues to take a step back from the heat of the debate \nto think about this language that has been in the bill from the very \nbeginning, that they have voted for in so many other contexts, that has \nbeen the settled law of the land for nearly 40 years, that they have \nrejected an up-or-down vote to remove, and that they have demanded be \nremoved as a condition for passing this important legislation.\n  Is picking this fight really worth it?\n  Is scoring points against Republicans really worth the costs of \nvictims of human trafficking?\n  Is trying to undermine our efforts to govern worth sacrificing the \nopportunity to help these men, women, and children in need?\n  The choice is clear. I applaud my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle who are pushing to end this stalemate, especially my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle who are willing to sacrifice temporary \npolitical gain to do the right thing for these victims we all want to \nhelp. I plead with those who have yet to join our efforts to move this \nbill forward to realize the suffering they are prolonging and to change \ntheir approach at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\n\n                       Geospatial Data Reform Act\n\n  Mr. President, in addition to urging the passage of the bill under \nconsideration to fight human trafficking, I want to highlight another \nimportant bipartisan bill I have introduced and urge its speedy \nconsideration. It is exactly the sort of productive legislating in \nwhich I believe the Senate should be engaged.\n  I rise in strong support of the Geospatial Data Reform Act, a \nbipartisan bill that will save taxpayers money while improving public \nsafety, bolstering public development and preserving our natural \nresources through wider accessibility to geospatial data.\n  I am grateful for Senator Warner's collaboration on this bill. \nWithout his partnership this legislation would not have been possible, \nand I wish to thank him for his support over the past several months. \nTogether we have worked tirelessly to craft bipartisan legislation that \nstreamlines the way Federal agencies collect, manage, and distribute \ngeospatial data to better serve the American people.\n  Whether we realize it or not, geospatial data is ubiquitous in our \neveryday lives. Geospatial data is the information that identifies the \ngeographic locations and characteristics of\n\n[[Page S1649]]\n\nnatural or constructed features and objects. To make this abstract \nconcept more tangible, consider that every time we turn to the GPS on \nour phones we rely on geospatial data to find our destination. \nGeospatial data is an invaluable information resource, and we are just \nbeginning to tap its full potential.\n  Every year, private businesses and government agencies are finding \nnew and innovative ways to use this information to better deliver \nservices to the public and to improve overall quality of life. FEMA's \nuse of geospatial data during Hurricane Sandy is testament to the \nmerits of this information resource.\n  The tragedy of Hurricane Sandy is still fresh in our memories. In \n2012, this late autumn storm ravaged our eastern seaboard, battering \nbuildings, toppling homes, and demolishing power lines, leaving behind \na wake of destruction and shattered lives. Sandy was the deadliest \nhurricane to reach our shores since Katrina in 2005. In addition to the \nhuman toll, Sandy extracted a heavy financial cost, with estimated \ndamages exceeding well over $50 billion. By using geospatial data, our \ngovernment was better equipped to respond to this catastrophe. As \nvictims rummaged through the rubble and wreckage of their broken homes, \nFEMA set to work analyzing geospatial datasets to identify over 40,000 \nhomes damaged by the storm. This information allowed the Agency to \npinpoint the most devastated neighborhoods and dispatch emergency \npersonnel to those areas more quickly and efficiently. The use of \ngeospatial data in response to this tragedy played an integral role in \ncoordinating emergency response and helping families repair their \ndamaged lives.\n  The way FEMA used geospatial data to aid victims of Hurricane Sandy \nis just one powerful example of the positive impacts geospatial data \nhas on our lives.\n  But there are many more. The CDC also uses geospatial data to track \ndisease outbreaks, informing decisions that ultimately save lives, the \nDepartment of Education uses geospatial data to analyze test scores \nfrom schools across the country to make plans for improvement, and the \nNational Park Service uses geospatial data for resource management and \nto conserve our Nation's natural treasures.\n  There is almost no end to the sundry uses and benefits of geospatial \ndata, but as the Federal Government invests billions of dollars every \nyear in the collection and storage of geospatial data, there is a \nserious problem of interagency duplication. This duplication stems from \na glaring lack of coordination between agencies on efforts to collect \nthis information. In short, agencies are spending inordinate sums in \ntaxpayer dollars to collect the same geospatial data other agencies may \nhave already collected.\n  These duplicative efforts are a monumental and inexcusable waste of \ntaxpayer money. Although the executive branch has been working for \ndecades to reduce duplication and standardize the process for \ncollecting and storing geospatial information, it has received little \nhelp from Congress.\n  The legislation Senator Warner and I have introduced provides the \nexecutive branch the resources and direction it needs to reduce \nduplication and engender cooperation among agencies to ensure the \nefficient collection and dissemination of geospatial data across all \nlevels of government. To save the taxpayers money, our bill requires \nFederal agencies to implement international consensus standards for \ngeospatial data and assist in eliminating duplication.\n  The Geospatial Reform Act also codifies the implementation of the \nnational spatial data infrastructure and provides agencies with a clear \ndefinition for geospatial data and metadata.\n  In addition, this bill standardizes the collection process by \nrequiring agencies to comply with the Federal Geospatial Data \nCommittee's standards for the development, sharing, and use of \ngeospatial information.\n  Finally, our bill ensures accountability, transparency, and public \naccess to nondefense-related Federal investments in geospatial data. \nAlready, States, counties, municipalities, and the private sector are \ndiscovering dynamic ways to use and share geospatial data with one \nanother.\n  Collaboration in this sphere is leading the way for new and improved \nservices that were previously impossible to deliver. These entities \noutside of the Federal Government are finding new ways to coordinate \ninvestments and implement common standards. We need to do the same on \nthe national level. We need proper Federal management for these data \nassets, and we need a national strategy for their many uses.\n  Our legislation provides the foundation for both. In a political \nenvironment clouded by polarization, this bill is a ray of hope. It is \nan opportunity for us to work together in a bipartisan fashion to pass \ncommonsense legislation that is based on transparency and good \ngovernance.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support the American taxpayer by \nsupporting this bill. It is the right thing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business, and that following me, the Senator from Washington be \nallowed to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Oso Mudslide\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, almost 1 year ago, on a calm Saturday \nmorning in the small town of Oso, more than a square mile of mud rushed \ndown a mountainside in my home State of Washington. In a matter of \nseconds, dozens of homes were destroyed, dozens of people were missing, \nand they were trapped in the debris from the mudslide.\n  It was unclear at first the extent of the damage, the number of \npeople trapped, and what could be done in the face of such devastation. \nFirst responders risked their own lives, braving dangerous conditions \nto look for survivors. Some were pulled from the rubble, but so many, \ntoo many, were lost. Houses over more than a square mile were simply \nswept away. The main highway to nearby Darrington was blocked, \nisolating that community. Forty-three people--children, mothers, \nbrothers, and aunts--were killed.\n  This was the deadliest mudslide in our country's history. A year \nlater, there is not a single person in Oso who has not been affected by \nthis devastating natural disaster. In the blink of an eye, they saw \nwater and earth wipe away their homes and their entire community. Let \nme tell you what I found when I visited the small nearby town of \nArlington, where recovery plans were being made just days after the \nmudslide occurred 1 year ago.\n  I saw small towns like so many across the country in all of our \nStates, the types of towns where everybody knows each other, the types \nof places where everyone stops to say hello and lend a helping hand. \nWhat I saw that day last March was a community where there was not a \nsingle person who was not doing every single thing they could to help.\n  Amidst the terrible destruction, I saw hope. I spoke to firefighters \nwho had not slept for days, refusing to stop searching for survivors. I \nsaw neighbors and friends and volunteers providing food and shelter and \nhugs and prayers, anything to assist the community who had experienced \nthe unthinkable.\n  I want to tell one story from the days following that awful moment, a \nstory that has been told before but bears repeating. A local woman \nnamed Rhonda Cook heard about the slide and she found out that her \nfriend was driving by and was buried when the slide hit. Rhonda spent \ndays digging through that debris looking for that blue car she knew was \nthere somewhere, determined to bring her friend out of the mud.\n  When that car was finally uncovered and her friend's body was lifted \nout, Rhonda paused to pay her last respects. But then she kept on \ndigging, looking for others. Rhonda is just one of the many heroes. \nThere were so many, and so many more who continue working to this very \nday.\n  Last year, I joined many others in a pledge to stand with the people \nof Oso and Darrington in the months and years to come and to do \nwhatever we could to help them on the road to recovery. I was proud to \nwork with my colleagues in the Senate and with our friends in the House \nto make sure the Federal Government was offering a hand, because we are \na nation that sticks together when times are tough.\n\n[[Page S1650]]\n\n  We worked to secure housing grants and FEMA funding and \ntransportation investments to repair State Route 530. More than 600 \nNational Guard soldiers were deployed to help in the emergency \nresponse. The main highway through Darrington reopened finally last \nsummer. Homes are now being rebuilt. Lives are being pieced back \ntogether. While I am so grateful for all that has been done to aid the \nrecovery, our work is far from done.\n  Although the devastation will eventually be cleared, injuries will \nheal, the emotional scars will always remain, and the memory of those \nwho were lost will never leave us. A disaster of this magnitude \nrequires long-term assistance to help these communities respond, \nrebuild, and cope. Now a year down the long road of recovery, there is \none word that comes to mind when trying to explain what the people of \nOso and Darrington are at their core: resilient.\n  Aid workers searched for remains to return to loved ones for as long \nas 4 months after that mudslide. A man who lost his wife and son gave \nthousands of dollars in donations to other victims who he thought \nneeded the money more than himself.\n  The people of Oso and Darrington will look back on March 22, 2014, \nthis weekend, remembering lost homes and lost loved ones and even pets. \nI want those communities to know that all the way here across the \ncountry in the other Washington, I stand with Oso. We stand with Oso. \nTheir resiliency in the face of such unthinkable devastation is an \ninspiration to us all. We will always remember what it means to be \n``Oso strong.'' They have the thoughts and prayers of everyone in the \ncountry to continue rebuilding, from Washington State to Washington, \nDC, and everywhere in between.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague, Senator Cantwell, who, as I was, \nwas there time and time again with this community.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague from \nWashington, Senator Murray, on the observance of this very solemn \nmilestone. This Sunday will be 1 year since this catastrophic event. I \nwant to thank Senator Murray for something she did not mention, which \nis her leadership on helping us get passed the Green Mountain Lookout \nlegislation in the aftermath of this event, which is legislation that \nshe had championed for a long time and yet had been stuck. When people \nrealized there were things we could do for this community to help \nrestore its recreational and economic activity, she got on it and we \nwere able to pass that very quickly. So I thank her for that \nleadership.\n  This Sunday is a very solemn milestone, because 43 Washingtonians \nlost their lives in a very destructive mudslide that buried the highway \nbetween the communities of Darrington and Oso and nearby Arlington. \nThese communities lost loved ones, friends. Their memory will be with \nus for a long time. These communities have shown that even in the most \nunimaginable devastation, people can come together in unity and \npersevere. They showed how light and hope can shine through even in \ngrief.\n  Now, after many months, stores are reopening, the highway is again \nbustling, there are new connections of Internet and phone lines being \nrestored, residents are rebuilding, and they are hoping for a brighter \neconomic future.\n  As my colleague said, we were very inspired by the hope and grace of \nthis community, that continues to demonstrate that on a daily basis. It \nis hard to believe that a year has gone by. On that morning, it became \njust like every other morning, a rainy Saturday morning, and people \nwent about their business. But as the heavy rain weakened one of the \nhills in the Stillaguamish Valley, the resulting landslide was \napproximately 1 square mile. Forty-nine homes were destroyed, 530 were \ncovered, and the Stillaguamish River was basically rerouted. So many \nproblems arose. But immediately more than 1,000 volunteers descended. \nMany from the local community, with their own transportation systems, \ntheir own rigs, came to the river and devoted thousands of hours to try \nto help survivors and to help the community recover.\n  This American flag was hoisted by one of the firefighters. It is \ntacked to a standing nearby tree, just to show our resilience. Much \nlike the American flag, this community was battered and bruised but was \nvery proud. During those days, many Washingtonians would make sure that \nevery resource was made available to this community. When faced with \nthese immense challenges, these communities of Darrington and Oso \npulled together and, yes, Oso became ``Oso strong.''\n  It was a rallying cry for the volunteers, to the young people, to \nmany people who were working many hours a day. Private companies and \nindividuals, corporations, tribes, charities, nonprofits--all sorts of \ngovernments chipped in. Everybody helped. We want to thank them for \nthat help. It was just a year ago that it seemed as though every \nresource covered the festival grounds and the Forest Service parking \nlot, FEMA, Snohomish County, the Department of Natural Resources, the \nNational Guard, fire departments up and down the State. They continued \nto make sure everything was addressed--recovery efforts underway, local \npeople gathered, such as the small business owner there in Darrington, \nKevin Ash, who tried to keep a plan for every business to stay open.\n  We looked at what could be accomplished for the future. Out of these \nmeetings, we were able to secure a $150,000 grant from the Economic \nDevelopment Administration to draft an economic disaster recovery plan \nfor the community. That plan is set to be unveiled in June and help the \nlocal economy that once was heavily dependent on logging that was hit \nhard by this disaster.\n  Senator Murray and I have worked with Mayor Dan Rankin from \nDarrington, whose leadership and on-the-job focus for this has helped \nthe community continue to survive this incredible disaster. There are \nso many strategies Mayor Dan has put into place that are about how the \ncommunity moves forward.\n  Over the past year, the Small Business Administration awarded \n$400,000 in low-interest loans to help rehabilitate businesses in the \narea. It is helping the Darrington-Arlington economy and others in the \naffected area. Through their innovation and hard work, everybody is \ntrying to help what is called the Upper Stillaguamish Valley not just \nget back to where it was but flourish in the future. This is some of \nthe most beautiful territory in our State, from the heights of Glacier \nPeak to the depths of the Upper Stillaguamish Valley. This typifies the \nbeauty of the Northwest.\n  I want to make sure we thank the appropriate people who helped us in \nthis response: President Obama, who visited the area; Homeland \nSecretary Jeh Johnson; FEMA Director Craig Fugate; obviously our \nGovernor; Representative DelBene, who was there practically every \nmoment of this disaster, from the moment it happened, for days and days \nand days, and then around the clock, shuttling back and forth between \nWashington, DC, and the site; Congressman Larsen; obviously SBA \nAdministrator Maria Contreras-Sweet, who came to the site; the Red \nCross; the Oso fire station.\n  We talk about first responders here. But when you see first \nresponders for small communities step up and address such an incredible \nnatural disaster and coordinate everything--I want to say a thanks to \nWilly Harper from the Oso fire station, and Travis Hots, who was the \nincident command leader for the first several days from Snohomish \nCounty Fire District, which brought all of the resources together to \ntry to make the planning and recovery efforts for this incredible \ndisaster go as smoothly as possible; County Executive John Lovick and \nSheriff Ty Trenary. I also want to say Arlington Mayor Barbara Tolbert \ndid more for the community in using every resource she had to help \nsupport the recovery of these Washington residents. Some communities \nmight say, well, that is somewhere down the road, and who is going to \nhelp us? But she put every Arlington resource onto this site, knowing \nit might be months and months and months before she ever saw any of the \nresources to reimburse them.\n  We want to thank Arlington for everything they did. So while we will \nthis weekend be having a moment of silence on the site, we have to \nremember the\n\n[[Page S1651]]\n\nindividuals we lost, and how we need to move ahead. This hillside bears \nan unmistakable scar. It has inflicted deep wounds. But it is healing \nbecause of the friends and neighbors who have strengthened us in this \nregion.\n  We want to make sure that the memories of those we lost will fuel our \ndetermination to do better. Regardless, it is not going to be easy, it \nis not going to be quick, but we will continue to build off of the \nstrength this community demonstrated in the aftermath of this disaster.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Heitkamp, \nI send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be received.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, for the past 10 days this body has been \nengaged in an important debate on a bill that has had widespread, \nbipartisan support, that was reported unanimously by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, and that would help to end the scourge of human \ntrafficking.\n  I am a cosponsor of this bill because I believe it will help equip \nlaw enforcement and prosecutors with the tools they need to combat \nthese horrific sex trafficking crimes.\n  I, along with my colleague, Senator Leahy, have also introduced a \nbill--that we have filed as an amendment--that would reauthorize the \nRunaway and Homeless Youth Act programs so we can also have a \nprevention piece in this legislation.\n  Many Members of this body have worked very hard on this legislation. \nSenator Cornyn, whose bill we are considering, has been a real leader \nin the area of human trafficking. Senator Klobuchar also has a bill I \nhave been proud to cosponsor. Senator Grassley and Senator Leahy, at \nthe request of all 20 of the women Senators, held a hearing on this \nissue at which I was privileged to testify, along with Senator Ayotte, \nSenator Mikulski, and Senator Gillibrand.\n  I applaud the Judiciary Committee for its work in shining a light on \nsome of the darkest stories imaginable. No State is immune from the \nevils of human trafficking.\n  Just recently in Maine, a couple was arrested for allegedly \ntrafficking a girl who was only 13 years old. They used the Internet to \nsell her for sex.\n  The Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act that \nSenator Leahy and I have cosponsored seeks to prevent young people from \never getting trapped in these situations in the first place, and I hope \nwe can move on to that bill, which we have filed as an amendment.\n  But, regrettably, we find ourselves at an impasse--imagine that--an \nimpasse on a bill that would help curb human trafficking. How can that \nbe?\n  Senator Heitkamp and I have joined forces to try to move this bill \nforward. That is our goal, and the goal of the amendment we have filed.\n  What our amendment would do, and it is very straightforward, is it \nwould subject the fund that Senator Cornyn has created, and which I \nstrongly support, to the annual appropriations process and to all of \nthe usual restrictions that the Appropriations Committee can and does \nadd to appropriations bills.\n  There is precedent for taking a fund that is not financed by tax \ndollars and sending it through the appropriations process. It, frankly, \nhappens all the time. We have seen it with the oil and gas revenues \nthat go to the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Those are not tax \ndollars.\n  We have seen it with a number of fees and restitution programs that \nare not tax dollars but go through the appropriations process, where \nthe Appropriations Committee can work its will.\n  Under out amendment, all of the money collected from special \nassessments imposed on certain trafficking criminals and deposited into \nthe fund would still be made available to anti-trafficking and victims' \nservices grant programs, but only through the direction of the annual \nappropriations process. By placing the fund squarely within the \njurisdiction of appropriators, each and every penny collected would be \nsubject to the limitations in those appropriations bills. Our amendment \nwould strike the reference that has been the sources of this \ncontroversy from this authorizing bill, but does not alter that \nrestriction on federal funds that has existed for 39 years.\n  Our amendment makes clear that money in the fund, or transferred from \nthe fund, is subject to the limitations provided in appropriations \nacts.\n  I believe our amendment, by allowing the Appropriations Committee to \nput whatever restrictions are appropriate on this fund--and I have no \ndoubt the usual restrictions will be put on by the Appropriations \nCommittee--could get this bill to move forward, and those such as \nSenator Cornyn, Senator Klobuchar, and others who have worked so hard \nto bring this bill to the Senate floor, will see there is a path \nforward.\n  We owe it to the victims of human trafficking. We owe it to the \nvictims of human trafficking. We owe it to them. We cannot fail in this \ntask. If we cannot approve a bill to deal with human trafficking, then \nwhat will we be able to deal with?\n  We have to get past the tendency to score partisan, political points \nthat have affected too many bills on both sides of the aisle. In this \ncase, it is simply too important.\n  I thank my dear friend and colleague from North Dakota, Senator \nHeitkamp, who has been an attorney general, who has dealt with the \nvictims of this terrible crime, for coming forward and joining with me \nas we attempt to put forth--for our colleagues' sincere consideration--\na path forward that will end this impasse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I thank my great friend, the Senator \nfrom Maine. She has been so instrumental in achieving compromise in the \nbody, whether it is in the Commonsense Caucus, when we were in shut \ndown, or it is just bridging the gap many times and trying to find a \npath forward for us to legislate in the Senate. She truly is a champion \nin her efforts in trying to make this body work.\n\n  I wish to start off by saying that as an attorney general, the whole \nwhile I was attorney general--for 8 years--there was very little \nactivity on prostitution. When I was running for office, I visited with \nlaw enforcement--and I still have a lot of friends in law enforcement--\nand I asked them: What are your challenges? Every local sheriff, \nespecially those in western North Dakota, and every city chief of \npolice said: We have a growing concern with prostitution.\n  I started thinking about that. I started thinking about what that \nmeant. Then I started looking behind what those claims of prostitution \nwere, and I began to realize that for very many of these young women--\noften children--who are in this life of prostitution, it is not by \nchoice. This is some of the most horrific victimization that goes on in \nAmerica today--the victimization of small children, the dehumanization \nof small children, the challenge of a recovery once they are given an \nopportunity to find a different path forward, the addiction that comes \nwith it, the grooming that comes with it, and the shame that comes with \nit.\n  Many people say they want to prevent this, but very often we know the \nvictims of human trafficking come from homes that weren't the \nhealthiest of homes. These are very often runaways, they are homeless \nyouth, and they have no other option for recovering, they have no other \noption for sustaining their life than being part of this horrific \nexperience.\n  So as my great friend from Maine talks about this, we need to do a \nbetter job in getting the tools for prosecution, which is the excellent \nbill Senator Klobuchar has advanced for promoting safe harbor \nlegislation, which will not only help in the path to recovery but also \nwill give us an opportunity to encourage more and more of these victims \nto come forward as witnesses for the prosecution. It is very difficult \nto convince someone who has been told for years and years, as they have \nbeen in the life, that ``If you tell about this victimization, what \nwill happen is you will go to jail with me. So we have to\n\n[[Page S1652]]\n\nstick together.'' How do we break that cycle of control? We break it by \nproviding opportunity, which these bills do. We break it by passing the \nhomeless youth and runaway bill. We break it by focusing a bright light \non this problem.\n  I could not have been prouder of this body as we moved toward these \nseries of bills on homeless youth and moved forward on these series of \nbills on trafficking. This body was speaking for some of the most \ndisenfranchised citizens in our country--those victims of human \ntrafficking. So you can imagine my despair and I think the despair of a \nlot of victims groups and the despair of a lot of people in this body \nwhen we reached this impasse.\n  It is important that we say that the goal now is not to rehash what \nhas happened in the past, it is not to rehash the problems and the \nconcerns everybody has had in the past. We must set aside all of that. \nSet aside all of the rancor we have heard for the last week and focus \non one thing: Focus on a victim who may be watching us. Focus on a \nvictim's advocate who may be wanting and needing and desperately \nseeking the help we can provide that advocate in providing a secure \nfuture for these victims. Let's focus on them. Let's focus on what we \ncan do to bridge this impasse.\n  My friend Senator Collins and I think we have, as she has described \nit, advanced a proposal that we believe firmly resolves all the issues. \nIt sets forth a path where we can, in fact, move forward and listen to \nthe voices that don't get heard very often in places like Washington, \nDC, and respond to their concerns, respond to the victimization, be the \nempathetic body I know we can be by saying: Yes, we can help, and we \nwill help.\n  So my colleague and I hope this will at least generate enough \ndiscussion, provide at least enough of a bridge forward that we can \ncontinue to have the dialogue, continue to address amendments--if we \ncan get through this--and actually move this issue forward.\n  I yield to my great friend from Maine, but I would like to ask her a \nquestion. As an appropriator, I know there may be some controversy. She \nhas raised this already. There is some discussion that this may not be \nan appropriate place to make this decision, and I would like my \ncolleague to elaborate on the appropriations process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. If I could respond through the Chair, Mr. President, I \ndo have the privilege of serving on the Committee on Appropriations, \nand I have seen the restrictions we have put on funds over the years. \nOne of those restrictions which is at issue here goes back 39 years. So \nit is not unusual for the Committee on Appropriations to put certain \nlimitations on the use of funds.\n  As I explained earlier, the Committee on Appropriations also deals \nwith nontax dollars. It is not unusual for us to appropriate money that \ncomes from the collection of fines, of fees, of penalties, from leases. \nThis is common. So what we are proposing in this bill is not anything \nnew, unusual, or unique. It would be part of the standard \nappropriations process.\n  Indeed, Senator Cornyn actually raised the idea on the floor today of \nhaving the victims fund go through the appropriations process. We \ndiffer in language, so I don't want to imply there is any endorsement, \nbut the concept is one the author of the bill has raised.\n  So in response to my colleague from North Dakota, who has spoken so \neloquently of her experience in dealing with the victims of human \ntrafficking, I would assure her that as a member of the Committee on \nAppropriations, I know full well that we put restrictions and \nlimitations on funding as a standard course.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I would like to have a moment where we \nthink about this body and how impressed everybody throughout the \ncountry is, how proud they are of our system of government, how proud \nof the great decisions that have been made in this room and of the \ngreat deliberations and the great debates. This truly is a remarkable \ngovernment, and it is a remarkable system. But it has always been \nremarkable because it is not just the wealthy and powerful who have a \nvoice in this body. With us comes the opportunity to speak for the most \ndisadvantaged Americans, the most disadvantaged people in our system. \nAnd I cannot imagine a more horrific life than the life of being sold \ninto prostitution. I cannot imagine a more horrific life than being \nenslaved through the horrible events of human trafficking.\n  Let's speak for those victims. Let's speak for those advocates who \nwork so hard, who have been so encouraged that an issue such as this \nhas become a priority issue for the United States of America. Let's try \nto bridge this gap. Let's work across the aisle, and let's reach to \nfind a way forward because these victims deserve our attention, they \ndeserve this debate, and they deserve our voice.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I again want to thank my colleague from \nNorth Dakota for her very eloquent plea to our colleagues.\n  I know we can do this. I know we can find a path forward. I know we \ncan get a sufficient number of votes so that we can proceed and debate \nthe many amendments that have been filed on this bill. I know we can do \nit. The victims of this horrific crime deserve no less from the United \nStates Senate, so let's not fail them. Let's not fail them.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor again today to talk \nabout the importance of getting the bill passed, and we have seen today \nfor the first time--I talked I think 3 hours yesterday--the need to \nchange the tone and try to work across the aisle on some ideas to move \nforward with this bill. That is happening in many conversations in this \nSenate Chamber and in offices, and I am pleased that we have had a \nchange in tone and that we have some possibility of moving forward. I \nthank my colleagues for that.\n  Senator Cornyn and I have worked on this issue for a long time. In \naddition to the bill that is on the floor today, we also have the \nimportant safe harbor bill that I am leading and that Representative \nErik Paulsen is leading in the House. This is a bill--since it went out \nof the Judiciary Committee unanimously and has none of the issues and \ncontroversy involved in the current bill on the floor--I hope will be \nable to get through this Senate Chamber in the coming week as either \npart of this bill or on its own.\n  This safe harbor bill, of course, is about treating the victims of \nsex trafficking as victims and not treating them as criminals when they \nare 12 years old. It is taking a model from Minnesota and 15 States and \nnow creating incentives to bring it out to the rest of the country.\n  So what is it we have been talking about here over this last week? We \nare talking about 27 million people around the world who are victims of \nsome kind of trafficking every year. Some of this is labor trafficking, \nbut what we are focused on this week is sex trafficking. It is the \nthird biggest criminal enterprise in the world. The first is illegal \ntrafficking of drugs, the second is illegal trafficking of guns, and \nthe third is illegal trafficking of girls and young boys. And the \naverage age is 12 years old--not even old enough to drive a car, not \neven old enough to go to their first prom.\n  Last year, I went to Mexico with Cindy McCain, and we met with a \nnumber of officials and prosecutors and victim advocates who were \nworking to fight this crime in Mexico. We visited a shelter for abused \ngirls. We met with the Attorney General and with the Federal Police. \nBut what I most remember of all of those meetings as to how we could \nbetter coordinate our focus on sex trafficking was the visit to the \nCovenant House in Mexico City, where there were girls as young as 11 \nyears old who were victims of trafficking.\n  There was one girl who truly stood out. Her name was Paloma. She was \nnew to the house which had taken her in and was in the first stage of \nrecovery. Unlike the other girls who spoke\n\n[[Page S1653]]\n\nthrough an interpreter, she could speak English, but all she could say \nwas her name, and then she couldn't stop crying. And while some of the \nother girls told their stories, she never told her stories in words. \nShe only told her story through her tears. That is a moment I won't \nforget.\n  It reminded me of something I heard when I visited a refugee camp \nonce in Jordan, where a mother said she had seen things that would make \nstones cry. That is what that little girl Paloma was saying through her \ntears, that the experiences she had had of being trafficked at 11 years \nold would make stones cry. These are real stories.\n  When Polaris--one of the major groups working on this issue of sex \ntrafficking--released their State-by-State rankings of efforts to fight \nhuman trafficking, here is what they had to say:\n\n       The scope and scale of human trafficking within the United \n     States presents a daunting challenge to policymakers, service \n     providers, law enforcement, and advocates. Originally, human \n     trafficking was thought to be more of a problem in other \n     countries, but now it is known to be happening in our own \n     backyards. It is estimated that there are hundreds of \n     thousands of victims of sex and labor trafficking inside our \n     borders.\n\n  But what we know today is that 83 percent of the victims in the \nUnited States are from the United States. It is not just girls at the \nbottom of a ship--which does happen--it is girls right in our country, \ngirls right in Minnesota, on the streets of Rochester, where just in \nthe last few months we had a 12-year-old girl who got a text inviting \nher to a party, showed up at a McDonald's parking lot where she was \nsupposed to go, a guy puts her in a car, takes her up to the Twin \nCities, rapes her, takes sexually explicit pictures of her, puts them \non the Internet. The next day she is sold on Craigslist to two other \nmen and raped. That happened in Minnesota. That man has now been \nindicted by the U.S. Attorney's office. But we have seen these cases \nover and over again.\n  People say, why is this getting worse? Why is the Senate debating \nthis issue right now? It is because, as much as we love the Internet, \nwe also know it has provided a vehicle for this kind of activity so \nthat it is much easier for people to do behind closed doors where no \none notices them basically get these young girls in their grasp.\n  Yesterday I spent nearly 3 hours reading from a book by Nicholas D. \nKristof and Sheryl WuDunn about international sex trafficking called \n``Half the Sky.'' I did that because I felt the tone had gotten so bad \nin this Chamber on both sides, with people hurling accusations and not \neven being willing to talk about possible ways to resolve this, and I \nam glad again that now we are finally talking today.\n  They have another book about domestic sex trafficking, which is the \nfocus of the bill on the floor today, as well as our safe harbor bill. \nThey tell a story of a girl named Clemmie. The book is called ``A Path \nAppears.'' They say:\n\n       One of the first women whom Becca helped was Clemmie \n     Greenlee, an African American woman who had been raped \n     repeatedly beginning at the age of five and then \n     systematically pimped from the age of twelve. Clemmie began \n     drinking at the age of eight, dropped out of school in fourth \n     grade, and soon became a heroin addict and an expert at \n     robbing johns. On one occasion she did more than steal. A \n     customer was beating her so badly, so she pulled out a knife \n     and stabbed him. ``I didn't see blood, so I stabbed him \n     again, four more times,'' she said. He almost died, but \n     fortunately for Greenlee he was a married man who begged the \n     police not to press charges, and without his testimony they \n     didn't have a case. She was freed.\n       By 2001, Greenlee was a gaunt eighty-five pounds, sleeping \n     on the streets or in abandoned buildings, all of her money \n     was going to crack cocaine. She had had a son who was killed \n     in gang violence. She was seen as having so little commercial \n     value that pimps abandoned her. An old friend from the \n     streets found Greenlee in a crack house and dragged her over \n     to see Reverend Stevens at Magdalene.\n\n  This is an example of what we are seeing across this country--right \nin our own country. These stories are so raw and so ugly, but I tell \nthem and read from that book yesterday just so people remember why we \nare here and what we are dealing with, so we can put some of these \nissues--extraneous issues, things we need to change in the bill and fix \nin the bill, that we have some motivation to do it. These girls really \ndon't know how to change the laws in Congress. They need our help to do \nthat.\n  My good friend Cindy McCain, through her work at the McCain \nInstitute--and I see Senator Rubio here from Florida, who is also \nfamiliar with that work and knows what she has done. They undertook a \nstudy looking to get some baseline data on sex trafficking around big \nevents. We have seen what happens where we have increases in Web site \nadvertising and other things, and we have seen what happens when law \nenforcement actually comes together across all jurisdictional lines--\nFederal, State, and local--when the private sector engages, like our \nhotels--hotels like the Radisson Hotels in Minnesota. Marilyn Carlson \nNelson has been such a leader on this, and has really set up and helped \nto fund foundations, because they see it. They know their workers are \non the frontline and can actually stop it from happening--or airlines, \nlike Delta, American, United that are on the frontlines and they train \nemployees so they can stop this from happening.\n  So, yes, these bills will help. The bill we have on the floor right \nnow that Senator Cornyn and I worked on, and many others in this \nChamber, will help get funds for the victims and for these shelters. \nThe bill I am leading with Senator Cornyn will actually help to make \nsure our States get incentives to make sure we are handling these \ncriminal prosecutions in a way that works, that emboldens the victims \nso they don't go back to the pimps, so they don't go back to that cycle \nof violence, so they actually feel they are in a safe harbor, that they \nare in a safe place so they will testify against these perpetrators--\nthe ones running these rings, these crooks, these people who are \ntreating these young girls as chattel. That is what these bills are \nabout.\n  So we need a path forward. I think for the first time today we are \nseeing--despite no agreement yet and a lot of ideas out there, we are \nseeing a different tone. I want people to remember that not only will \nthis bill involve the fund I am talking about, but once we either join \nit or pass separately our safe harbor law, it will also create \nincentives for States to change their laws. It will also create a \nnational sex trafficking strategy that is in my safe harbor law. It \nwill also allow these young girls who are victims to be part of job \ntraining programs and other things, to make it easier for our law \nenforcement with an amendment that I included in my bill from Senator \nSessions and Senator Whitehouse with the U.S. Marshals. There are many \ngood things that are going to help.\n  Mostly, we are going to send a message from this Chamber, finally, \nafter all of this acrimony over the last days and all of the blame, \nthat we can finally send a message to that little girl named Paloma \nthat this country believes in her. We believe these lives have value, \nand we must stand by these victims and stand up for these victims--not \nonly in our country but internationally.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer. I thank my colleagues. I know these \nconversations are continuing as we work to find a path forward. I thank \nSenator Cornyn for the work we have done together. I look forward to \ngetting this done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, let me begin by acknowledging the work the \nsponsors of the human trafficking bill are doing. Trafficking is a \nsanitized way to discuss this issue. It is actually slavery, and I am \nglad that term is finding its way into the lexicon of how this is \ndiscussed.\n  It is not just the sex trafficking--sex slavery--it is also labor \ntrafficking, which is a major problem in this country as well.\n  I do hope we can find a way forward on this one. It is an \nextraordinarily important issue, one that has taken far too long to pay \nattention to. It is not something that happens just around the world, \nbut it happens here closer than we think.\n\n\n                                 Israel\n\n  Mr. President, I want to talk about a separate topic today as well. \nIt is one a\n\n[[Page S1654]]\n\nlot of people have been reading about in the newspapers over the last \n72 hours.\n  As we all know, there was an election in Israel this week, and many \npeople are wondering: What is this aftermath of the election we keep \nreading about, where there is this controversy and back and forth? \nCertainly some of that happened a few weeks ago, when the Prime \nMinister of Israel visited Washington and spoke before the Congress. \nPeople are wondering, what is it that is going on here and why is there \nso much controversy around all this? I want to take a moment to delve \ndeeper into this, because this is important.\n  First of all, to answer the fundamental question: Why should we care \nabout what is happening with Israel, in Israel, and about Israel? There \nare two reasons I think we should care.\n  The first is because Israel represents everything we want that region \nof the world to be. Israel is a democracy, as evidenced by the vibrant \nelection process they just underwent. Israel is a free enterprise \neconomy, a developed economy, that provides prosperity for its people \nand its partners in trade and commerce. And Israel is a strong American \nally--a democracy, a free enterprise, and a strong American ally.\n  Don't we wish the entire Middle East looked that way? Don't we wish \nwe had more countries in the Middle East that looked like Israel--that \nwere allies, that were democratic, and had a free and prosperous \neconomy? How much better would the world be if the Middle East looked \nmore like Israel and less like Iraq and Syria and other places look \nlike at this moment?\n  There is another reason why we should care about Israel. Israel is \nnot just another country. It has a special and unique purpose. It was \nfounded as a homeland for the Jewish people in the aftermath of the \nSecond World War and of the Holocaust, where over 6 million human \nbeings were slaughtered. It was founded on the promise that never again \nin the history of the world would there not be a place for the Jewish \npeople to go and be safe. It is not just a nation, it is a nation with \na special and unique purpose unlike any other nation in the world, and \nI for one am proud that the United States has stood with Israel for all \nthese years, and I am proud that the American people on a bipartisan \nbasis have stood behind the Jewish State of Israel for all of these \nyears. So the security, safety, and future of Israel is in our national \nsecurity interest, as well as a moral obligation of every Member of \nthis body and us as a nation.\n  What are the underpinnings of Israeli security? There are two things. \nFirst, the ability of Israel to defend itself; and the second, the \nreality that if Israel ever has to defend itself, the United States \nwill be there to support them.\n  There is little doubt about the first pillar of its security. As the \nPrime Minister reminded us: Unlike many other countries, Israel is not \nasking us to send American soldiers or aircraft to support them. They \nare willing to defend themselves. But the second pillar, about strong \nand unquestionable American support, is increasingly being questioned \naround the world. And there is good reason why.\n  Let's begin with the aftermath of this recent election.\n  As far as I know--maybe this has changed in the last few hours--after \nthis election, the President has yet to call the Prime Minister. That \nis unlike, of course, the fact that in March of 2012, he was among the \nfirst to call and congratulate Putin in Moscow. Or that in June of \n2012, he was among the first to call Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood \nwhen they won the Egyptian Presidency. Or that in November of 2012, he \ncalled to congratulate the top Chinese Communists on their new \nposition--which, by the way, is not elected in the way you and I would \nconsider there to be an election. Or the fact that in 2013, there was \nan historic phone call. They bragged about how he called the Iranian \nPresident and congratulated him on his election. And of course, in \nAugust of 2014, he called to congratulate Turkey's President Erdogan.\n  And on and on.\n  Time and again, this President has made a habit of quickly calling \nthese leaders when they win. But as of 4:40 p.m. eastern time, as far \nas I know, that call has yet not been made. Thinking about all the \nthings that have been going on with Israel, we would think he would be \nquick to make that call. It hasn't happened. Maybe it has already, but \nit certainly didn't happen fast enough.\n  But where does this come from? Is this new? Is this something that \njust happened recently? It isn't. In fact, we can start to see the \ntrends here pretty early.\n  In October of 2008, then-Senator Obama told an audience in Cleveland:\n\n       There is a strain within the pro-Israel community that says \n     unless you adopt an unwavering pro-Likud [one of the \n     political parties in Israel] approach to Israel that you're \n     anti-Israel.\n\n  Which is a silly comment to make, since at that time that party had \nbeen out of power.\n  In January of 2009, the President, upon taking office, makes a quick \nphone call to the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas before \nhe even phoned the Israeli Prime Minister. Abbas's spokesman Nabil Abu \nRudeina quoted Obama as saying:\n\n       This is my first phone call to a foreign leader, and I'm \n     making it only hours after I took office.\n\n  In July of 2009, the President hosted American Jewish leaders at the \nWhite House, and he reportedly told them that he sought to put \n``daylight'' between America and Israel. Here is the quote that someone \nat that meeting says he made: ``For eight years [during the Bush \nadministration] there was no light between the United States and \nIsrael, and nothing got accomplished,'' he declared.\n  In September of 2009, in his first address to the U.N. General \nAssembly, President Obama devoted five paragraphs to the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict, during which he declared--to loud applause; by \nthe way, in the United Nations, no surprise--``America does not accept \nthe legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements.'' He went on to draw a \nconnection between rocket attacks on Israeli civilians with living \nconditions in Gaza. There was not a single unconditional criticism of \nPalestinian terrorism.\n  In March of 2010, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton berated Prime \nMinister Binyamin Netanyahu on a now infamous 45-minute call, telling \nhim that Israel had ``harmed the bilateral relationship.'' By the way, \nthe State Department triumphantly shared details of the call with the \npress. That same month, the Israeli Ambassador was dressed down at the \nState Department, and Mr. Obama's Middle East envoy canceled his trip \nto Israel, and the United States under his leadership joined the \nEuropean condemnation of Israel.\n  In May of 2011, the State Department issued a press release declaring \nthat the Department's No. 2 official would be visiting ``Israel, \nJerusalem, and the West Bank,'' as if Jerusalem was not part of Israel. \nSo they left that separate.\n  Later in the month, only hours before Mr. Netanyahu departed from \nIsrael to Washington, Mr. Obama delivered his infamous Arab Spring \nspeech, which focused on a demand that Israel return to its \nindefensible pre-1967 borders with land swaps.\n  In November of 2011, an open microphone caught part of a private \nconversation with the President and French President Nicolas Sarkozy. \nSarkozy said of the Israeli premier:\n\n       I can't stand Netanyahu. He's a liar.\n\n  But rather than defend Israel, the President piled on. He said:\n\n       You're tired of him; what about me? I have to deal with him \n     every day.\n\n  In February of 2012, at a conference in Tunis, Secretary of State \nHillary Clinton was asked about Mr. Obama pandering to ``Zionist \nlobbies.'' She acknowledged that it was ``a fair question'' and went on \nto explain that during an election season ``there are comments made \nthat certainly don't reflect our foreign policy.''\n  In 2014, during the Gaza conflict, the White House and the State \nDepartment criticized Israel for the deaths of Palestinians who were \nbeing used as human shields by Hamas. But far worse and far more \nsuggestive of the President's true feelings was the White House's \ndecision to try and use arms supplies as a pressure point against \nIsrael.\n  In October of 2014, an anonymous administration official called Prime \nMinister Netanyahu ``a chicken----'' I can't even finish it.\n\n[[Page S1655]]\n\n  That is what has happened up to this point. That is what has happened \nup to this point. What has happened now? An election just happened 2 \ndays ago. The first thing the White House says is: You used a lot of \ndivisive language in that election. That is saying a lot from someone \nwho has been elected at least once, probably twice, on extremely \ndivisive language.\n  But what about when Iran had a fraudulent election in 2009 and the \npeople of Iran took to the streets to protest in the famous Green \nRevolution? You know what the White House said? We are not going to \ncomment on that election because we are not going to interfere in the \nsovereignty of Iran. They will comment on the elections of an ally, \ncalling the rhetoric of the election divisive. But when an enemy--which \nis what Iran is--has a fraudulent election and kills people who protest \nagainst it, we can't comment. We can't comment because that would be \ninfringing on their sovereignty.\n  The other thing that has happened is the Prime Minister made a \nstatement about how a two-state solution isn't possible given the \ncurrent circumstances. What does the White House do? They jump up and \nsay: Well, that means we may have to reconsider. We may have to go to \nthe United Nations Security Council now and support a resolution, and \nthat means not to use our veto authority to stop a resolution that \ncalls on Israel to create a Palestinian State with 1967 borders.\n  Why would the Prime Minister of Israel say that, by the way? He is \nright; the conditions don't exist. Do you want to know why the \nconditions don't exist? First of all, let's go through the history of \npeace negotiations.\n  In 2000, at Camp David, Israel offered the Palestinian Authority \nnearly all of the West Bank, Eastern Jerusalem, and Gaza. The \nPalestinians said no. In 2000, Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon. \nDo you know what that is today? That is a place where they launch \nrockets against Israel.\n  In 2005, Israel withdrew from Gaza. Do you know what that is today? A \nplace where they launch rockets from against Israel.\n  In 2008, Israel offered--again, to the Palestinian Authority--nearly \nall of the West Bank, nearly all of Judea and Samaria and Eastern \nJerusalem. The Palestinian authority said no.\n  What about the Palestinian record? Let's begin with the fact that \naccording to many reports, about 6 percent of the Palestinian budget is \ndiverted to pay the salary of prisoners. That means the salary of \nterrorists, of people who have blown up centers and killed civilians, \nincluding Americans. They are being paid salaries and benefits, \nincluding with money from donors, such as the United States, Great \nBritain, Norway, and Denmark.\n  Here is another material on how the PA routinely depicts a world \nwithout Israel. This is from a Palestinian schoolbook:\n\n       Palestine's war ended with a catastrophe that is \n     unprecedented in history, when the Zionist gangs stole \n     Palestine . . . and established the so-called State of \n     Israel.\n\n  Or what about this particularly horrific expression of ideology which \nappeared in a Palestinian Authority daily as far back as 1998:\n\n       The difference between Hitler and [British Foreign \n     Minister] Balfour was simple: the former [Hitler] did not \n     have colonies to send the Jews to, so he destroyed them, \n     whereas Balfour . . . [turned] Palestine into his colony and \n     sent the Jews. Balfour is Hitler with colonies, while Hitler \n     is Balfour without colonies. They both wanted to get rid of \n     the Jews...Zionism was crucial to the defense of the West, \n     [by] ridding Europe of the burden of the Jews.\n\n  This is from a daily of the PA. These are the people with whom we are \npressuring them to cut a peace deal.\n  What about this?\n\n       The Palestinian Authority has named numerous locations and \n     events after Palestinian terrorists responsible for killing \n     Israeli civilians.\n\n  What about this? This opinion piece appeared in the New York Times in \n2013:\n\n       The Palestinian Authority's television and radio stations, \n     public schools, summer camps, children's magazines and Web \n     sites are being used to drive home four core messages. First, \n     that the existence of a Jewish state . . . is illegitimate \n     because there is no Jewish people and no Jewish history. . . \n     . Second, that Jews and Zionists are horrible creatures that \n     corrupt those in their vicinity. Third, that Palestinians \n     must continue to struggle until the inevitable replacement of \n     Israel by an Arab-Palestinian state. And fourth, that all \n     forms of resistance are honorable and valid, even if some \n     forms of violence are not always expedient. Instead of being \n     schooled in the ``culture of peace,'' the next generation of \n     Palestinians is being relentlessly fed a rhetorical diet that \n     includes the idolization of terrorists, the demonization of \n     Jews and the conviction that sooner or later Israel should \n     cease to exist.\n\n  These are the people with whom this President wants to put pressure \non them to cut a peace deal. I think Netanyahu is right. The conditions \ndo not exist for a peace deal with people who teach their children that \nkilling Jews is a glorious thing. The conditions for peace do not exist \nwith a people--with a government, I should say, not a people. The \npeople are victims of this government, the Palestinian Authority--not \nto mention Hamas, which teaches people that killing Jews is a glorious \nthing, that there is no such thing as a Jewish people, that any methods \nof destroying them is valid, that pays them salaries and benefits.\n  This President is making a historic mistake. Allies have differences. \nBut for allies such as Israel, when you have a difference with them and \nit is public, it emboldens their enemies--to launch more rockets out of \nsouthern Lebanon and Gaza, to launch more terrorist attacks, to go to \ninternational forums and delegitimize Israel's right to exist. This is \nwhat they are doing.\n  This is a historic and tragic mistake. Israel is not a Republican or \na Democratic issue. If this were a Republican President doing these \nthings, I would give the exact same speech. In fact, I would be even \nangrier. This is outrageous. It is irresponsible, and it is dangerous. \nIt betrays the commitment this Nation has made to the right of a Jewish \nState to exist in peace. No people on earth want peace more than the \npeople of Israel. No people have suffered more at the hands of this \nviolence and this terrorism than the people of Israel. They need \nAmerica's support unconditionally. If there are differences, they need \nto be dealt with privately as we do with other allies.\n  More than anything else, they deserve to be treated with more \nrespect, not less than the respect this President and this White House \nis giving the Supreme Leader of Iran. He would not dare say the things \nabout the Supreme Leader of Iran now that he is saying about the Prime \nMinister of Israel because he wouldn't want to endanger his peace deal \nor his arms deal that he is working out with them.\n  I hope he will reconsider. I hope the bipartisan nature of our \nsupport of Israel is reinvigorated. I hope that once again this body, \nthis Congress, and this government will recommit themselves to this \nextraordinarily important relationship, because if America doesn't \nstand with Israel, who would we stand with? If Israel--a democracy, a \nstrong American ally on the international stage--is not worthy of our \nunconditional support, then what ally of ours around the world can feel \nsafe in their alliance with us?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, today I want to comment on the recent \nelection in Israel and the Obama administration's outrageous reaction \nto it. Two days ago Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's Likud Party won \na decisive victory in the Israel election. For myself and on behalf of \n3 million Arkansans, I want to offer hearty congratulations to Prime \nMinister Netanyahu. I have the greatest admiration for the Prime \nMinister's visionary and courageous statesmanship, as well as his \nservice as a young man in his country's elite special operations \nforces. Prime Minister Netanyahu and his family have paid the highest \nprice over the decades in the fight against the common enemies of \nIsrael and the United States.\n  Yet let me also stress that the alliance between the United States \nand Israel is not an alliance for this or that Israeli statesman nor \nthis or that Israeli political party. Nor, for that matter, does the \nalliance depend on whom or which party controls the White House or the \nCongress. Rather, it is an alliance between the American people and the \nIsraeli people, between the ultimate defender of the West and the \neasternmost frontier of the West. Our alliance rests on our shared \nexperiences and principles: our Judeo-Christian heritage, respect for \nthe natural\n\n[[Page S1656]]\n\nrights of mankind, democratic self-government, market-based economics, \nand strong provision for our common defense. Israel's commitment to \ndemocratic elections demonstrated just this week an important \ndistinction from many of their neighbors and why they are our closest \nally in the region.\n  Apparently, President Obama harbors such deep-seated and irrational \nantipathy for Prime Minister Netanyahu that he is now willing to upend \nthis decades-long alliance. President Obama's antagonism toward Prime \nMinister Netanyahu is longstanding and well known. Last year, for \nexample, anonymous administration officials used a vulgar epithet to \nquestion Prime Minister Netanyahu's courage.\n  I will point out, as an aside, that anonymity is the Washington \ncoward's shield, just as I am also compelled to point out that, so far \nas I know, neither the President nor his senior political aides served \nin our country's elite special operations forces, unlike Prime Minister \nNetanyahu.\n  Back to my main point, in the last 48 hours, more anonymous \nadministration officials have suggested a fundamental rethinking of the \nUnited States-Israel alliance, citing Prime Minister Netanyahu's simple \nrestatement of fact that there can be no Palestinian State until \nconditions change. The Palestinian Authority must, at a minimum, eject \nHamas from its governing coalition, reclaim control of the Gaza Strip, \naccept a demilitarized eastern border in Judea and Samaria, and \nrecognize Israel's right to exist as a Jewish State. As Prime Minister \nNetanyahu has said, if the Palestinians lay down their arms, there will \nbe peace. But if Israel lays down its arms, there will be no Israel.\n  The Obama administration, though, has gone off the deep end and let \ntheir personal bitterness towards the Israeli Prime Minister drive \ntheir public foreign policy toward our closest ally. Here are just a \nfew quotes from administration officials suggesting a fundamental \nchange in our relationship with Israel and a willingness to abandon \nIsrael at the United Nations.\n  One official said: ``We are signaling that [if the Israeli \ngovernment's position is no longer to pursue a Palestinian state,] \nwe're going to have to broaden the spectrum of options we pursue going \nforward.''\n  According to reports, that same official ``wouldn't rule out a \nmodified American posture at the United Nations, where the U.S. has \nlong fended off resolutions criticizing Israeli settlement activity and \ndemanding its withdrawal from Palestinian territories.''\n  Another senior White House official said:\n\n       The premise of our position internationally has been to \n     support direct negotiations between the Israelis and the \n     Palestinians. We are now in a reality where the Israeli \n     government no longer supports direct negotiations. Therefore \n     we clearly have to factor that into our decisions going \n     forward.\n\n  Finally, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said:\n\n       We're currently evaluating our approach. We're not going to \n     prejudge what we would do if there was a UN action.\n\n  Some observers will dismiss these comments as the petulant response \nof a President and political operatives who didn't get their way in the \nelections this week. But there is something much more worrisome \nunderway. While Prime Minister Netanyahu won a decisive victory, he \nstill has just started assembling a governing majority coalition.\n  These kinds of quotes from Israel's most important ally could very \nwell startle some of the smaller parties and their leaders with whom \nPrime Minister Netanyahu is currently in negotiations. This raises the \nquestion, of course, if the administration intends to undermine Prime \nMinister Netanyahu's efforts to assemble a coalition by suggesting a \nchange to our longstanding policy of supporting Israel's position with \nthe United Nations.\n  After all, if you were an elected leader in Israel's parliament, you \nsurely would worry about the United States refusing to exercise its \nveto at the U.N. Security Council. Consider the United Nations' long \nand dark history of anti-Semitism.\n  The U.N. Human Rights Council has condemned Israel in 45 resolutions \nsince its creation in 2006. In 2013, the U.N. General Assembly adopted \na total of 21 resolutions singling out Israel for disapproval and just \n4 resolutions for the rest of the world.\n  Fifty percent of all emergency special sessions of the General \nAssembly over the last six decades were convened to denounce Israel. \nMeanwhile, no emergency special session has been called for any other \nstate in over 30 years. Given this history and the stakes here and \nabroad, let me speak bluntly so there can be no misunderstanding. Under \nno circumstances will I or this Congress allow the Obama administration \nto abandon Israel to the United Nations or any other international \ninstitution or to change fundamentally the terms of our alliance with \nIsrael.\n\n  This administration's latest outrageous pronouncement is even more \ndifficult to understand as they simultaneously coddle the terrorist \nregime in Iran. The people of Israel should know the American people \nremain in solidarity with them in their quest to exist peacefully with \ntheir neighbors and that we will not allow them to be thrown to the \njackals at the United Nations--a characterization made famous by a past \nMember of this body, the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan. I call on all \nMembers of this body, including my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, to join with me in one voice supporting our ally Israel against \nthe jackals.\n  In the coming days--perhaps as soon as the debate over the budget \nresolution next week--I will propose legislation that reaffirms the \nlongstanding policy of the United States to continue to defend Israel \nagainst attacks at the United Nations and other international agencies. \nI urge all Members of this body, including my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle who have a long history of supporting Israel, to join \nme in supporting such legislation.\n  Further, should the United Nations, its subordinate agencies, the \nInternational Criminal Court or any other international agency take \nadverse action against Israel, I will consider introducing legislation \nto restrict U.S. funding for the offending agency. Finally, if the U.S. \nAmbassador to the United Nations does not exercise the American veto \nagainst any anti-Israel resolution, I will also consider introducing \nsimilar legislation to restrict funding to the Ambassador's office.\n  For decades, the relationship between Israel and the United States \nhas transcended political and personal differences. Our shared \ninterests were enough to overcome any ideology or personal \ndisagreement, but I fear mutual respect is of little concern to this \nadministration. The President and all those senior officials around him \nshould carefully consider the diplomatic and security consequences of \ntheir words. This Congress certainly will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                  Syrian War Crimes Accountability Act\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the ongoing crisis in \nSyria. Sunday, March 15, marked the fourth anniversary of the beginning \nof the Syrian civil war.\n  Since this brutal war began, more than 3.8 million Syrians have fled \nSyria, 7.6 million have been displaced within Syria, and 12.2 million \nSyrians are in need of humanitarian assistance. Most tragically, more \nthan 205,000 people have died as a result of the war. This past year \nwas the deadliest year since the conflict began, with more than 76,000 \ndying in 2014 alone, including more than 3,500 children.\n  One thing has remained clear over the last 4 years--the war tactics \nemployed in Syria by both government and opposition forces represent \ngross violations of human rights and fly in the face of internationally \naccepted rules of war.\n  The United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry on \nSyria has reported that the progovernment forces have murdered, \ntortured, assaulted, and raped civilians in Syria. Antigovernment \ngroups have also engaged in murder, execution, torture, hostage-taking, \nand shelling of civilian neighborhoods. Medical workers and hospitals \nacross Syria have also been targeted, but nowhere was the brutality of \nthis war more evident than the events of August 21, 2013, when the \nSyrian Army, under the direction of President Assad, launched a \nchemical weapons attack in the Damascus suburbs killing 1,400 Syrians.\n\n[[Page S1657]]\n\n  The United States, along with the international community, has a long \ntradition of upholding international norms, including holding \naccountable those guilty of crimes against humanity and war crimes. The \ninternational community cannot stand by and allow the murder of \ninnocent men, women, and children to go unchallenged. He must \nimmediately bring Assad and all the perpetrators of gross human rights \nviolations in Syria to justice. This cannot wait another year.\n  Earlier this week, I reintroduced the Syrian War Crimes \nAccountability Act, along with my colleagues Senators Rubio, Menendez, \nShaheen, and Peters. This bipartisan legislation establishes a Syria-\nspecific standard of reporting and accountability for crimes against \nhumanity. The bill will require the U.S. State Department to report to \nrelevant congressional committees on war crimes and crimes against \nhumanity committed in Syria. This would include an account of war \ncrimes and crimes against humanity committed by the regime of President \nBashar al-Assad and violent extremist groups and other combatants \ninvolved in the conflict.\n  Today, as I stand on the floor of the Senate, the violence is \ncontinuing unabated.\n  Some of my colleagues may be aware of a Syrian defector and \nphotographer named Caesar. Caesar fled from Syria in 2013 with more \nthan 55,000 photos documenting the torture and murder of more than \n11,000 civilians. Last week, some of those photos were put on display \nat the United Nations.\n  We must shine a light on the atrocities that have been committed in \nSyria and demand accountability. Ignoring these violations sends a \nmessage to the global community that war crimes and crimes against \nhumanity are tolerable. The Syrian people deserve much more than that.\n  On this fourth anniversary of the beginning of the Syrian war, we \nmust recommit to supporting the Syrian people through humanitarian \nefforts and by holding those individuals and groups which are guilty of \ncommitting war crimes and crimes against humanity accountable for their \natrocities.\n  I ask my colleagues to stand with the Syrian people and join me in \nsupporting the Syrian War Crimes Accountability Act.\n\n\n                            Lynch Nomination\n\n  Mr. President, I will also take time to urge my colleagues to \nimmediately bring Loretta Lynch's nomination to the floor of the U.S. \nSenate to be the next Attorney General of the United States.\n  Ms. Lynch currently serves as the Senate-confirmed U.S. attorney for \nthe Eastern District of New York. She has already been confirmed by the \nU.S. Senate. She served with great distinction as the U.S. attorney for \nthe Eastern District.\n  I had the chance to visit with her last January and talk to her \nfirsthand about her vision to be the next Attorney General of the \nUnited States. She is extremely impressive, very well qualified, and \nhas the right values to be the Attorney General of the United States.\n  I will give a few examples. I know all of us are concerned about \nequal justice to the law. Well, Ms. Lynch has lived that through her \nown personal commitments. At Harvard Law School, she was a member of \nthe Legal Aid Bureau, helping people who otherwise would not have been \nable to afford access to our legal system.\n  Ms. Lynch has a long and distinguished record of prosecuting \nterrorists, sex traffickers, organized crime cartels, corrupt \npoliticians, and dangerous gangs. She has been endorsed by a wide \nvariety of law enforcement agencies and individuals.\n  Put it this way: I have not heard anyone question her qualifications. \nI have not heard anyone question why she should not be confirmed to be \nthe next Attorney General of the country.\n  Loretta Lynch's nomination has been pending on the Senate floor as \nlong as the five most recent Attorneys General combined. If we take \nfive of the most recent Attorneys General and add all the time it took \nfor their nominations to be confirmed, Loretta Lynch is now exceeding \nthat. That is not fair.\n  President Obama is entitled to have his team in place, and we have a \nresponsibility to vote on his nominations. Let's do the right thing and \ntake up this nomination, debate it, and then have Senators vote up or \ndown, not maybe, on her nomination. We owe it to Ms. Lynch, the \nemployees of the Justice Department, and the American people to have a \nnewly designated Attorney General in place as the Nation's chief law \nenforcement officer and top defender of Americans' constitutional \nrights.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/19/senate-section/article/S1657-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I rise to honor the 60th anniversary of \nBishop Gorman High School in Las Vegas, NV.\n  In 1954, Bishop Gorman High School opened as the first Catholic high \nschool in Southern Nevada. I congratulate the institution on 60 years \nof leading our country in first-rate education while positively \nimplementing Catholic values.\n  Bishop Gorman High School has graduated more than 9,000 students and \ncurrently has a 100 percent graduation rate and a college bound rate of \n96 percent, making Bishop Gorman a national leader in college \npreparatory education. The school is equipped with an impressively \nexperienced and credited faculty, with nearly 70 percent holding \nadvanced degrees. The administration and the faculty's dedication to \nproviding excellent education in a Catholic setting, in addition to a \nlow student-teacher ratio, has contributed to Bishop Gorman's success \nand helped ensure that its students can reach their full potential.\n  The school takes pride in providing its students with a well-rounded \neducation that includes strong academic principles, faith, and \ncompetitive athletic opportunities. Over the past 60 years, students \nhave won 97 State athletic championships and received State and \nnational recognition in academics, fine arts, and extracurricular \nactivities.\n  Bishop Gorman High School also gives back to the local community and \nthe State. Every year they organize multiple service events, and this \npast year, art students designed a beautiful courtyard for a \ntransitional home in Las Vegas. Additionally, the National Honor \nSociety students volunteered each week at a local food bank.\n  I applaud Bishop Gorman High School President John Kilduff and \nPrincipal Kevin Kiefer for their strong leadership and recognize this \nyear's Knight of the Gaels honoree, Jack Raftery, Sr. I am pleased that \nthrough your joint efforts and the dedication of those before you, this \nremarkable institution has been a part of our community for 60 years. \nBest wishes for continued success, and congratulations on this great \nachievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/19/senate-section/article/S1657-3", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1657-S1658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BLACK WOMEN'S HISTORY WEEK\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I request that the U.S. government \nofficially recognizes the last week in March as Black Women's History \nWeek. During the week of March 23, as part of Women's History Month and \nin honor of the U.N. declaration of 2015 as the decade of Afro \ndescendants, this week marks the perfect occasion on which to begin an \nannual recognition and celebration of Black women's history and \ncontributions to American society.\n  Black women have long gone above and beyond the call of duty in their \ncontributions to American society through civic engagement, high voter \nturnout, and stepping up as leaders and bulwarks in their communities. \nEven in the face of grave oppression throughout our Nation's history, \nBlack women have continued to stand strong\n\n[[Page S1658]]\n\nand contribute to the well-being of their families, communities, and \nour country as a whole. A recognition of Black Women's History Week on \nthe part of the Obama Administration and Congress would send a critical \nmessage that the government wishes to elevate their role in history and \ncontemporary society and recognizes the unique struggles they continue \nto experience today.\n  Black women have consistently played a critical role in this Nation's \nhistory, often with little thanks or recognition. Harriet Tubman \nescaped slavery and bravely returned to the enslaved South 13 times to \nherald her people to freedom on the Underground Railroad. A century \nlater, Rosa Parks witnessed the oppression of her people--specifically \nher fellow Black sisters--and took an active role in organizing the \nMontgomery Bus Boycott. Today, a Black woman is our nation's First \nLady. Recognition of Black Women's History Week would honor and uplift \nthe sacrifices of women such as Harriet Tubman and Rosa Parks, who \npaved the way for Barack and Michelle Obama to reach the White House, \nand me to address you on their behalf today.\n  Yet at the same time that Black women from our Nation's history have \nbecome inspirational symbols of strength and perseverance, Black women \ntoday continue to face the necessity to persevere through undue burdens \nas they navigate American society. They must try to hold their families \ntogether as primary caregivers when family members are incarcerated or \nkilled, support their children as they grow up in food deserts and \nattend failing schools, they must continue to persevere when our \nsociety does not provide them with adequate support and equal rights. \nAll the while, many Black women struggle to forward their own careers \nand provide for their families. Recent U.S. Department of Labor data \nshows that while job prospects are improving for nearly every group in \nAmerica, one glaring exception remains: Black women. Since August 2013, \nBlack women are the only group for whom unemployment rates have not \nfallen.\n  Karen McLeod's experience as a 59-year-old college graduate with two \ndegrees who cannot find steady employment sheds light on the economic \ntribulations many Black women face. Karen went from making $30 per hour \nas a respiratory therapist to $16 per hour at a nonprofit, to $8.67 per \nhour, working only 4 hours per week. In her current circumstances, she \nhas had to make a series of tough decisions to get by. Karen sold her \njewelry to pay for gas, pawned her television for food, and was forced \nto ask local nonprofits for rent assistance. Karen's story represents \nthe experiences of a growing number of Black women, whose conditions \nare not improving with economic recovery. White House recognition of \nBlack Women's History Week will serve to acknowledge and call attention \nto the continued struggles Black women face in our society today and \nwill send the critical message that their government cares about what \nthey are going through.\n  This year, a coalition of organizations advocating for the well-being \nof women and communities of color will partner to elevate the stories, \nhistories, and realities of Black women's lives. Each day of the week, \nstarting on March 23 and continuing through March 29, will focus on a \ndifferent issue Black women face in American society today, from \neconomic disparities to educational achievement to police violence. \nExploring these issues and acknowledging the centrality of Black women \nto our history and social fabric, along with recognizing the uniquely \ngendered and racialized inequities they face, is critical as we seek to \nextend equal rights to all Americans. I hope and request that this will \nbe the first year in what will become an annual tradition of \ncelebration and intentional recognition of our sisters through Black \nWomen's History Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/19/senate-section/article/S1658-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          TRIBUTE TO DON SHORT\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, I would like to recognize \nan exceptional Iowan who has been devoted to the State and to our \nagricultural heritage. After serving as president of Silos and \nSmokestacks National Heritage Area since 2001, Don Short has announced \nhis retirement.\n  Don Short was raised in Winthrop, IA, where he took over the family \nfarm. From early on, Don has dedicated his efforts to farming and \nagricultural policy. He was employed with Moews Seed Company, a family \nowned business since 1927 that specializes in corn seed production. \nAfterward, Don worked for DuPont Seed Company.\n  Don's experiences in agriculture have provided him the insight \nnecessary to lead the Silos and Smokestacks National Heritage Area. For \n15 years, he has been able to protect and promote natural, cultural, \nand historic areas. He spearheaded efforts to maintain and strengthen \nthe Silos and Smokestacks National Heritage Area and has been a dogged \nadvocate on its behalf. He is a farmer whose desire is to keep \nagricultural heritage alive through partnerships, such as historic \nsites, tourist attractions, and businesses that bring economic benefits \nto Iowa.\n  I want to congratulate Don Short on his retirement and his success \nover the years. Silos and Smokestacks will no doubt miss his daily \ncontributions; however, he plans on remaining a consultant on a \nparttime basis. I thank him for his unwavering commitment to improving \nagricultural policies and making Iowa a better place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/19/senate-section/article/S1658-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1658-S1659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING WILLIAM DAVID ROTH\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I wish to speak today in \nremembrance of William David Roth, who passed away on March 17, 2015.\n  William ``Bill'' David Roth, 71, of Albany, NY, lived an \nextraordinary life and made major contributions to U.S. public policy. \nHe was the son of Dr. Oscar Roth and Dr. Stefanie Zeimer Roth, refugees \nfrom Vienna who arrived in the United States just prior to the onset of \nWorld War II. Bill graduated magna cum laude from Yale University in \n1964 after majoring in mathematics, economics, and politics. This is \nall the more remarkable given the fact that a neuromuscular disorder \nfrom the age of 8 left him unable to write. He performed complex \nmathematical equations and logical formulae in his head. He was also a \nformidable presence at Yale and later at the University of California, \nBerkley, where he received his Ph.D. in 1970. He was that rare person \nwho was both a man of thought and action and who inspired others by \novercoming great odds and obstacles. From 1971 to 1972 he taught \npolitical science at the University of Vermont. He very well may have \naverted a Kent State tragedy in 1972 by permitting himself to be \narrested at the Federal building in downtown Burlington during a \nnonviolent student protest against the Vietnam war. While Roth was \noffered immediate release because of his disability, he chose instead \nto remain until all the students had been released from the Burlington \ncity jail. In this way he showed one of the virtues of civil \ndisobedience, conducted with dignity and without violence, thus serving \nas an example and inspiration to others.\n  Subsequently, he went to work on the Carnegie Council on Children in \nConnecticut. He coauthored a landmark book that dealt searchingly with \nchildren with disabilities. His first major work was called ``The \nUnexpected Minority: Handicapped Children in America.'' He also \ncoauthored ``The Grand Illusion: Stigma, Role-expectations, and \nCommunication.'' These are widely acknowledged as providing the \nanalytical basis for the disability rights movement as well as \nfostering a new academic discipline, disability studies.\n  Bill's work emphasized the disability movement's core vision: the \nmost socially incapacitating aspects of disability are not the \ninescapable consequence of biology but the result of countless social \ndecisions that do not acknowledge the needs of people with different \nbodies and, indeed, discriminate against people whose bodies are \ndifferent. Bill went on to pioneer the use of computer technology for \npeople with disabilities and in 1984 founded the Center for Computing \nand Disability at SUNY, Albany, one of the first such centers in the \nNation. Bill was widely acknowledged through his scholarly research, \ntechnological\n\n[[Page S1659]]\n\nimagination, and progressive politics, as one of the founders of \nAmerica's disability rights movement. He helped establish the framework \nfor the Federal Disabilities Act and his work over the years addressed \nthe architectural, transportation, and technological barriers to living \nwith a disability in the United States.\n  As a longtime professor at the University at SUNY School of Social \nWelfare he taught courses in social policy and disability studies. In \nrecent years, Bill's research and writing focused on illuminating the \ndamage done in the aggressive pursuit of dismantling of the U.S. \nwelfare state. His book, ``The Assault on Social Policy,'' Columbia UP, \nis now in its second edition. It is recommended reading for all of my \ncolleagues. Bill Roth fought not only with issues in disability but \nwith his own neuromuscular disorder. He was a little like the phoenix--\nthe bird that kept coming back. He was one of the most courageous \npeople I have ever known. He was brilliant, imaginative, inventive, and \nutterly fearless. Bill inspired those of us who had the good fortune to \nknow him. As Senator Joe Lieberman noted upon hearing of Bill Roth's \ndeath:\n\n       Bill was an extraordinary person--gifted, strong, funny, \n     inspiring. We were blessed to know him.\n\n  As lawmakers, we have benefited from his many contributions to public \npolicy and discourse. We remember and honor him for these \naccomplishments. Bill Roth overcame serious illnesses as well as \ndisabilities. He served as a courageous example to his family, friends, \ncolleagues, and students.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/19/senate-section/article/S1659-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING HELM PAINT & DECORATING\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, small businesses often set the bar \nfor quality and service across the United States. When quality and \ncustomer service are at the forefront of a business's mission, viable, \nsustainable jobs are created for countless members of our communities. \nSuch is the case with the Small Business of the Week, Helm Paint & \nDecorating of Hammond, LA.\n  Ronald ``Bunky'' Helm opened shop in 1970 on Earhart Boulevard in New \nOrleans. Despite having to move from their original location after \nHurricane Katrina in 2005, the Helm family has continued to bring \nexcellent service and paint colors to south Louisiana. Today, Helm \nPaint is more than just a paint store--offering a wide variety of \nspecialized paint, decoration, and accessory consultation. Helm's self-\nproclaimed goal is for their customers to have a customized and quality \nexperience.\n  Last week, I had the distinct honor of officiating the grand opening \nribbon cutting of Helm in Hammond, LA. The Hammond store is one of six \nlocations serving south Louisiana communities. Each store participates \nin its surrounding community, holding events throughout the year in \nsupport of local charities and other organizations. Helm Paint & \nDecorating is also a testament to how vital small businesses are for \ncreating jobs for Louisianians. Much of the company's staff are second, \nthird or even fourth generation employees who serve second, third, and \nfourth generation customers. Because Helm employees are experts in the \nproducts they sell, the majority of customers only have to complete a \nproject once. As the locals like to say, Helm Paint & Decorating is not \njust a business, it is an experience.\n  Congratulations again to Helm Paint & Decorating for being selected \nas Small Business of the Week. Thank you for your commitment to \ncustomer service and creating quality jobs in communities across the \nState.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/19/senate-section/article/S1659-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/19/senate-section/article/S1659-3", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/19/senate-section/article/S1659-4", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1030.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. BOOKER:\n  S. 797. A bill to amend the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory \nReform\n\n[[Page S1662]]\n\nAct of 1976, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, our Nation faces an infrastructure \ninvestment crisis across the board, but one aspect of our \ninfrastructure that has been particularly neglected by the Federal \nGovernment is rail. While the Nation's large freight rail carriers are \nable to invest in infrastructure with their own funds, the \ninfrastructure used by passenger and many smaller freight railroads is \ndeteriorating at an alarming rate. We need to be doing more to repair \nand modernize these tracks, roadbeds, bridges, tunnels, and train cars.\n  Nowhere is the investment crisis more pressing than in New Jersey, \nwhere a set of tunnels constructed under the Hudson River in 1910--\nbadly damaged by Hurricane Sandy--must either be replaced or shut down \nsometime over the next two decades. The shutdown scenario is \nunacceptable to the economy of not only my State, but the entire \nnortheast region, if not the country.\n  Amtrak has a plan, known as the Gateway Program, to replace these \ntunnels, as well as the century old Portal Bridge. Executing the \nGateway Program will take a significant funding commitment from the \nFederal Government, and I stand ready to fight for that funding. But, \ngiven the significant upfront cost, and the long-term benefits and \nrevenue potential, it makes sense to explore financing opportunities in \naddition to funding.\n  The Federal Government already has an established financing program \nin the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing Program, or \nRRIF. However, the RRIF program is fraught with limitations, \nparticularly in its ability to finance fixed infrastructure projects \nlike a bridge or tunnel. The program is significantly underutilized, \nespecially relative to other Federal financing programs.\n  That is why I am introducing the Railroad Infrastructure Financing \nImprovement Act. This bill would incorporate into RRIF the policies \nthat make other Federal loan programs more successful. For instance, it \nwill establish new creditworthiness criteria focused on the merits of \nthe project, increase repayment flexibility, help leverage private \nfinancing opportunities, speed up the process of applying for and \nreceiving a loan, and improve access to the program particularly for \nsmaller applicants.\n  The bill is meant to start a conversation about the tools we \ncurrently have available for investing in rail infrastructure, and the \nimprovements we can make to start getting critical projects like the \nGateway Program off the ground. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues and rail stakeholders to build upon this proposal and move \nforward on a comprehensive passenger rail reauthorization bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Casey):\n  S. 799. A bill to combat the rise of prenatal opioid abuse and \nneonatal abstinence syndrome; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, next month I look forward to hosting \nour Nation's newest drug czar at a forum in Covington, KY. It is a \nforum that will allow Director Bottecelli to hear firsthand accounts of \nthe devastating impact of one of America's most significant public \nhealth challenges and one that continues to hit my State particularly \nhard--the growing epidemic of prescription drug and heroin abuse.\n  It is hard to overstate the challenge. Drug overdoses, largely driven \nby pain killers, now claim more Kentucky lives than car accidents, and \nrising heroin overdose rates now account for nearly one-third of all \ndrug overdose deaths in Kentucky.\n  While statistics such as these are devastating enough, they hardly \npaint the full picture because they don't account for the thousands of \ninnocent children born dependent on opioids. The numbers are hard to \nhear. Nationwide we have seen a staggering 300-percent increase in the \nnumber of infants diagnosed with newborn withdrawal since 2000. But in \nKentucky, we saw similar numbers grow by an almost unbelievable 3,000 \npercent.\n  It is a tragic challenge, and I say that especially as a father of \nthree daughters. But it is a challenge we can do something about. If \nWashington enacts the bipartisan Protecting Our Infants Act that I am \nintroducing today, along with Senator Casey of Pennsylvania, it is a \nchallenge we will do something about.\n  This bipartisan bill will do a number of important things. It will \ndirect the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop \nrecommendations both for preventing prenatal opioid abuse and treating \ninfants dependent on opioids. It would direct the Secretary to help \ndevelop a strategy to address research and program gaps--a step \nrecommended by GAO in one of their reports released last month--and it \nwould encourage the Director of the CDC to work with States to help \nimprove surveillance and data collection activities in this area.\n  Obviously, no piece of legislation would ever solve the challenge \novernight, but the bipartisan Protect Our Infants Act can help move the \ncountry in the right direction. That is why it is supported by the \nMarch of Dimes, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American \nCongress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. That is why an identical \nbill will also be introduced in the House today by Congresswoman \nKatherine Clark of Massachusetts and Congressman Steve Stivers of Ohio.\n  I commend these Representatives and Senator Casey for their \nleadership on this issue. I look forward to working with them to \nadvance this important measure through Congress, and I look forward to \ndiscussing it with Director Botticelli during his visit to Kentucky in \nthe next few weeks.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 799\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Our Infants Act \n     of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Opioid prescription rates have risen dramatically over \n     the past several years. According to the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention, in some States, there are as many as \n     96 to 143 prescriptions for opioids per 100 adults per year.\n       (2) In recent years, there has been a steady rise in the \n     number of overdose deaths involving heroin. According to the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the death rate \n     for heroin overdose doubled from 2010 to 2012.\n       (3) At the same time, there has been an increase in cases \n     of neonatal abstinence syndrome (referred to in this section \n     as ``NAS''). In the United States, the incidence of NAS has \n     risen from 1.20 per 1,000 hospital births in 2000 to 3.39 per \n     1,000 hospital births in 2009.\n       (4) NAS refers to medical issues associated with drug \n     withdrawal in newborns due to exposure to opioids or other \n     drugs in utero.\n       (5) The average cost of treatment in a hospital for NAS \n     increased from $39,400 in 2000 to $53,400 in 2009. Most of \n     these costs are born by the Medicaid program.\n       (6) Preventing opioid abuse among pregnant women and women \n     of childbearing age is crucial.\n       (7) Medically-appropriate opioid use in pregnancy is not \n     uncommon, and opioids are often the safest and most \n     appropriate treatment for moderate to severe pain for \n     pregnant women.\n       (8) Addressing NAS effectively requires a focus on women of \n     childbearing age, pregnant women, and infants from \n     preconception through early childhood.\n       (9) NAS can result from the use of prescription drugs as \n     prescribed for medical reasons, from the abuse of \n     prescription drugs, or from the use of illegal opioids like \n     heroin.\n       (10) For pregnant women who are abusing opioids, it is most \n     appropriate to treat and manage maternal substance use in a \n     non-punitive manner.\n       (11) According to a report of the Government Accountability \n     Office (referred to in this section as the ``GAO report''), \n     more research is needed to optimize the identification and \n     treatment of babies with NAS and to better understand long-\n     term impacts on children.\n       (12) According to the GAO report, the Department of Health \n     and Human Services does not have a focal point to lead \n     planning and coordinating efforts to address prenatal opioid \n     use and NAS across the department.\n       (13) According to the GAO report, ``given the increasing \n     use of heroin and abuse of opioids prescribed for pain \n     management, as well as the increased rate of NAS in the \n     United States, it is important to improve the efficiency and \n     effectiveness of planning and coordination of Federal efforts \n     on prenatal opioid use and NAS''.\n\n[[Page S1663]]\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nspecify coverage of continuous glucose monitoring devices, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, as the founder and the cochair of the \nSenate Diabetes Caucus, I have learned much about this devastating \ndisease affecting nearly 29 million Americans. Fortunately, due to the \nSpecial Diabetes Program and to increased investments in diabetes \nresearch, we have seen some exciting breakthroughs and we are on the \nthreshold of a number of important new discoveries.\n  This is particularly true for the estimated 1.2 million Americans \nliving with type 1 diabetes. Advances in technology such as continuous \nglucose monitors are helping patients control their blood glucose \nlevels, which is key to preventing costly and sometimes deadly diabetes \ncomplications. We are moving closer and closer to our goal of an \nartificial pancreas.\n  The National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug \nAdministration have been extremely supportive of these innovations in \ndiabetes care. I was, therefore, shocked and troubled to learn that \ninsulin-dependent Medicare beneficiaries are being denied coverage for \ncontinuous glucose monitors because the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services has determined that they do not meet the definition \nfor durable medical equipment and do not fall under any other Medicare \ncategory. As a consequence, we are seeing situations similar to what we \nsaw with insulin pumps in the late 1990s, where individuals with type 1 \ndiabetes have had coverage for their continuous glucose monitors on \ntheir private insurance, only to lose that coverage when they get old \nenough to become eligible for Medicare.\n  Let me give some brief background. A continuous glucose monitor is a \nphysician-prescribed, FDA-approved medical device that can provide \nreal-time readings and data about trends in glucose levels every 5 \nminutes, thus enabling someone with insulin-dependent diabetes to eat \nor take insulin and prevent dangerously high or low glucose levels.\n  There has been essential and extensive clinical evidence that shows \nthat individuals using this device have improved overall glucose \ncontrol and, thus, reduced rates of hypoglycemia or low blood glucose \nlevels. That is why professional medical societies have recognized the \nclinical evidence and have published guidelines recommending that these \nmonitors be used in appropriate patients with type 1 diabetes.\n  Now, here is the fact that is astonishing to me. About 95 percent of \ncommercial insurers provide coverage for continuous glucose monitors, \nbut Medicare is refusing to provide coverage for those devices. I \nrecently heard about this problem from one of my constituents, 74-year-\nold Prudence Barry of Portland, ME. Diabetes treatments have changed \ndramatically since Pru was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes back in 1954. \nBack then, it was very difficult for her to control her insulin levels \nand to get her glucose levels properly read. Well, Pru has led an \nactive and fulfilling life. Living with type 1 diabetes for more than \n60 years has taken its toll.\n  Today, Pru no longer feels it when her blood glucose levels drop to \ndangerous levels, causing her to lose consciousness and suffer seizures \nmore frequently. Nighttime low sugars are particularly troubling. She \nfears the possibility of her blood sugar developing so low during the \nnight that she never wakes up. The continuous glucose monitor is a \npotential lifesaver for Pru because it prevents these dangerously high \nor low blood glucose levels by alarming the wearer when the glucose \nlevels fall outside of the safe range.\n  So even though 95 percent of private insurers cover this technology, \nMedicare does not. As a consequence, Pru does not have access to the \npotentially lifesaving device because she cannot afford to pay for it \nout of pocket. Pru is not alone. There are thousands of seniors with \ntype 1 diabetes who like my constituent are denied access to this\n\n[[Page S1664]]\n\ntechnology that would help keep them healthy and safe.\n  The ironic thing is it is only because of advances in diabetes care, \nsuch as continuous glucose monitors, that people with type 1 diabetes \ncan expect to live long enough to become Medicare beneficiaries. So I \nam very concerned about this decision by CMS. It makes absolutely no \nsense. It contradicts all the work NIH and the FDA are doing to get new \ninnovative treatments and technologies to patients.\n  I brought this up in a recent hearing of the HELP Committee and asked \nthe outgoing FDA Commissioner what she thought. She expressed her \nregret about the lack of consultation between her agency and CMS about \npayments for FDA-approved devices and drugs. I am particularly \nconcerned given the implications that this coverage decision will have \nfor future decisions regarding artificial pancreas systems, which will \ncombine a continuous glucose monitor, insulin pump, and sophisticated \nalgorithm to control high and low blood sugar around the clock.\n\n  This coverage decision on the part of CMS--which, after all, is also \npart of the Department of Health and Human Services--directly \ncounteracts all of the work that the NIH and the FDA are doing to get \nnew innovative treatments and technologies to patients. As I said, I \nrecently had the opportunity at a HELP Committee hearing to ask \noutgoing FDA Commissioner Hamburg whether CMS consults with her agency \nwhen making these kinds of coverage decisions. In response to my \nquestion, Commissioner Hamburg expressed regret that her agency does \nnot routinely consult with CMS about payments for FDA-approved drugs \nand devices, saying that the FDA should ``look at the whole ecosystem \nof biomedical product development and use, and recognize that each of \nthe different components that often operate in silos actually are very \ninterdependent.'' I completely agree with her assessment.\n  I am therefore joining my colleague from New Hampshire and the Co-\nChair of the Senate Diabetes Caucus in introducing the Medicare CGM \nAccess Act of 2014 to create a separate benefit category under Medicare \nfor the continuous glucose monitor and require coverage of the device \nfor individuals meeting specified medical criteria.\n  Our legislation is strongly supported by a coalition of \norganizations, including the American Association of Clinical \nEndocrinologists, the American Association of Diabetes Educators, the \nEndocrine Society and the JDRF.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join us as cosponsors of this important \nlegislation.\n  I see Senator Leahy has come to the floor and undoubtedly wants to \nspeak on the pending business. Let me conclude my remarks by saying I \nam very pleased the Senator from New Hampshire, Jeanne Shaheen, who is \nthe cochair of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, is joining me in introducing \nthe Medicare CGM Access Act to create a separate benefit category under \nMedicare for these monitors and to require coverage of the device for \nseniors who are meeting specified medical criteria.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of endorsement \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 15, 2015.\n     Hon. Susan Collins, \n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeanne Shaheen,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Collins and Shaheen, Therapy innovation is \n     moving forward at a rapid pace for those living with insulin-\n     dependent diabetes. As leaders of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, \n     you have worked to catalyze these efforts by ensuring \n     American patients have access to these life-saving \n     technologies that can transform quality of life. Advancements \n     in integrated insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring \n     (CGM) technologies are progressing toward closed-loop \n     ``artificial pancreas'' systems that will enable greater \n     patient care and improved health outcomes. With these \n     technology advancements, thankfully, most children with type \n     1 diabetes will be Medicare beneficiaries one day, something \n     that could not have been said with such certainty even 20 \n     years ago.\n       While thousands of people with insulin-dependent diabetes \n     benefit from advanced diabetes technologies, including CGM, \n     Medicare beneficiaries do not. CGM is covered by nearly all \n     private health plans. Numerous studies have demonstrated \n     conclusively that use of CGMs improves glucose control, \n     enabling better patient care, thereby improving patient \n     health. Studies have also shown that use of CGM devices \n     reduce severe hypoglycemia events, which particularly impact \n     elderly patients and can lead to falls, fractures and other \n     complications. The average cost of an inpatient hypoglycemia \n     admission is over $17,500.\n       The undersigned organizations strongly support your \n     legislation, the Medicare CGM Access Act that would remedy \n     this disparity for those in Medicare. Your legislation \n     creates a new benefit category for FDA approved CGM devices, \n     including stand-alone CGM, CGM integrated with an insulin \n     pump, and future artificial pancreas device systems. This \n     therapy would be covered for those meeting appropriate \n     medical criteria consistent with private coverage and \n     professional clinical guidelines. Again, thank you for your \n     continued leadership on behalf of those with diabetes and we \n     look forward to working with you to move this legislation \n     forward quickly.\n         American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE); \n           American Association of Diabetes Educators (AADE); \n           Dexcom; Endocrine Society; JDRF; Johnson & Johnson; \n           Medtronic.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Merkley):\n  S. 814. A bill to provide for the conveyance of certain Federal land \nin the State of Oregon to the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower \nUmpqua, and Siuslaw Indians; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce five unique \nOregon tribal bills S. 814, S. 815, S. 816, S. 817, and S. 818, that \neach deliver on promises made to the tribes long ago. By introducing \nthese bills today I am renewing my commitment to the five Oregon tribes \nwho will benefit greatly from passage of these bills--the Confederated \nTribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians, the Coquille \nIndian Tribe, the Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians, the \nConfederated Tribes of Siletz Indians, and the Confederated Tribes of \nGrand Ronde.\n  For the Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw \nIndians and the Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians, their bills \nput land into trust, the last two remaining federally-recognized Indian \ntribes in Oregon without a land base. The third bill amends the \nRestoration Act of the Coquille Indian Tribe to make forest management \nactivities on tribal lands uniform with the management of other tribal \nforests. The final two bills streamline the Bureau of Indian Affairs \nprocess for putting land into trust for the Confederated Tribes of \nSiletz Indians and the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde. These five \nunique bills honor and respect tribal sovereignty and support each \ntribe's right to be self-sufficient, build their economies, and support \nand provide for their communities. I am pleased to be joined on these \nbills by my colleague Senator Merkley and look forward to working with \nour Senate and House colleagues to advance the bills and to finally \nsend them to the President's desk.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 814\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish requirements with respect to bisphenol A; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I remain concerned about the high \nlevels of exposure Americans have to Bisphenol-A, BPA, an endocrine-\ndisrupting chemical. BPA is a synthetic estrogen, which means that it \nmimics this hormone when in the body. Scientific studies continue to \nshow cause for concern, especially for the health effects on babies, \nchildren, and expectant mothers. While these studies continue to \nexamine the exact effects that BPA has on humans, consumers deserve \nmore information.\n  BPA is most commonly found in food products, such as the lining of \ncanned goods like string beans, but consumers have no clear way of \nknowing this. The BPA in Food Packaging Right to Know Act is a simple \nsolution to fix this problem. This legislation requires that food \npackaging that uses BPA include a clear label that reads, ``This food \npackaging contains BPA, an endocrine-disrupting chemical, according to \nthe National Institutes of Health.'' This is basic information that \nconsumers have the right to know so they can make informed decisions \nabout the products they wish to purchase.\n  This legislation also directs the Department of Health and Human \nServices to do a safety assessment of food containers that use BPA to \ndetermine if there is reasonable certainty that no harm will come from \nexposure, including from low doses over the long term. This safety \nstandard would also apply to the evaluation of alternatives to BPA to \nensure that replacement chemicals are not simply causing the same harm \nby a different name. The legislation calls specific attention to the \neffects of exposure on vulnerable populations, such as infants, \nchildren, pregnant women, and workers who are exposed through \nproduction practices or handling of final products.\n  I am particularly concerned about the negative health effects to \nchildren who are exposed to chemicals both while they are developing in \nthe womb and in the first few years of their lives. Children are \nparticularly susceptible to toxins while their bodies are developing at \nsuch a rapid pace.\n  According to Dr. Heather Patisaul, a biologist at North Carolina \nState University, when pregnant women are exposed to BPA and other \nendocrine-disrupting chemicals, three generations are impacted: the \nmother, the fetus, and the reproductive cells in the fetus. She cites \nthat nearly 100 studies have shown an association between BPA exposure \nand negative health effects in humans. These include reproductive \ndisorders, behavioral problems in children, and heart disease. In \naddition, there are over 1200 published animal studies on effects of \nBPA that show potential links to cancer, tumors, and brain development \ndisorders.\n  A recent study published in Hypertension, a journal by the American \nHeart Association, found that individuals who drank beverages from \ncontainers made with BPA had an acute increase in their blood pressure, \ncompared with individuals who drank the same beverage from containers \nthat did not use BPA. This shows the potential for an increased risk \nfor heart disease.\n  Another recent study, published in Endocrinology, a journal by the \nEndocrine Society, shows a link between fetal exposure to BPA and \nincreased oxidative stress--an imbalance in the body's ability to \nprotect against and repair cell damage.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 93 \npercent of Americans have BPA in their bodies. As a society we are \nconstantly exposed to low doses of this chemical over a long timeframe. \nConsumers deserve the opportunity to have more control over their own \nexposure and at the least should be provided information about if BPA \nis in the food products that they purchase.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the BPA in Food \nPackaging Right to Know Act and stand up for the rights of consumers to \nhave this basic information.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Risch, Mr. Merkley, Ms. Murkowski, \n        and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 822. A bill to expand geothermal production, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the \nGeothermal Production Expansion Act of 2015 with my colleagues Senators \nRisch, Merkley, Murkowski, and Crapo.\n  This bipartisan bill will allow for the rapid expansion of already \nidentified geothermal resources without the additional delays of \ncompetitive leasing and without opening up those adjacent properties to \nspeculative bidders who have no interest in developing the resource. At \nthe same time that the bill streamlines the leasing process, it also \nprotects the taxpayer by requiring that developers pay fair market \nvalue for the new lease, and limiting the amount of adjacent Federal \nland that can be leased to 640 acres.\n  The Bureau of Land Management, which manages geothermal projects on \nfederal land under lease agreements, estimates about 250 million acres \nof federal land contains geothermal power potential. Geothermal energy \nprojects that are producing geothermal power under the BLM's management \nmake up about half of the total geothermal generating capacity in the \nUnited States. This legislation takes an important step to speed the \ndevelopment of this tremendous clean energy potential on public lands, \nand I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S1668]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 822\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to sunset rules \nafter 10 years unless agencies undergo notice and comment rulemaking, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, when I travel across the State of Montana, \nfrom Alzada to Whitefish, I meet many different people and small \nbusinesses. Although the diversity of thought in Montana is self-\nevident to anyone who has spent time there, everyone agrees on one \nthing. Regulation dictated by bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. is \nstifling entrepreneurial creativity, pushing opportunities overseas, \nand killing jobs.\n  While many burdensome regulations are new, through adoption of laws \nsuch as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act and the Affordable Care \nAct, still many more have been on the books for years without review. \nIn an evolving and dynamic economy, regulators should, at the very \nleast, review their regulations on a periodic basis, allow for public \ninput, and eliminate any rules that are either obsolete or unnecessary.\n  Oftentimes, regulation has unintended consequences on Montana's small \nbusinesses. In discussions about the harmful impacts of regulations \nwith Montanans, Vicki Bertelsen, who is the President of K Trucking \nin Great Falls, said, ``Burdensome reporting requirements eat up too \nmany business hours every month. I would rather be growing my business \nthan sending redundant [and] antiquated paperwork to the government.''\n  With nearly 175,000 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations, it is \neasy to understand how regulations are keeping people from getting back \nto work.\n  That is why today I am introducing the Regulatory Examination Vital \nfor Improving and Evaluating Working Solutions, REVIEWS, Act. While \nthis bill recognizes that many regulations serve a noble purpose in \nprotecting consumers and natural resources, it also seeks to address a \nstructural deficiency in government agencies which allow obsolete and \nunnecessary regulations to remain in the Code of Federal Regulations. \nBecause agencies operate on limited resources, they focus their efforts \non drafting new regulatory rules, rather than monitoring the rules that \nalready exist. While most agency employees are well-intentioned, this \nstructural deficiency places a greater emphasis on creating rules, \nrather than monitoring the application and effectiveness of existing \nrules, only to the detriment of Americans.\n  The REVIEWS Act will require agencies to periodically review each \nregulation every ten years using the Notice and Comment process. This \nrequirement will ensure that obsolete regulations are recognized and \neliminated and that regulatory cost considerations are properly \nevaluated. If a rule is not reviewed at least every 10 years, it cannot \nbe enforced in court. This requirement will provide public \naccountability and force regulators to periodically examine existing \nrules.\n  It is my hope that this common sense bill will ultimately reduce the \nregulatory burden on Americans and allow them to freely pursue their \nends, independently of government intervention.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 826\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
