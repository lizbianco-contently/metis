Mr. President, the Obama administration is trying to \nimpose deeply regressive energy regulations that would eliminate good-\npaying jobs, punish the poor, and make it even harder for Kentuckians \nto put food on the table. Their effect on the global carbon levels? \nEssentially a rounding error. Their effect on poor and middle-class \nfamilies? Potentially devastating. Yet the deep-pocketed leftwingers \nwho increasingly call the shots in the Obama White House don't seem to \ncare. Just like with their decision on Keystone last month, the Obama \nadministration is putting facts and compassion to the side in order to \nadvance their ideological agenda.\n  Higher energy bills and lost jobs may be a mere trifle to some on the \nleft, but it is a different story for millions of middle-class \nAmericans in Kentucky and across the country. Senators from both \nparties are saying that we should be standing up for the middle class \ninstead. That is why we have joined together to work toward overturning \nthese two-pronged regulations.\n  I am happy to report that the bipartisan measures we filed last month \nto overturn these regressive regulations have now been made available \nfor consideration by the full Senate. The first measure pertains to \nregulations on existing energy sources, while the second pertains to \nregulations on new sources. Together they represent a comprehensive \nsolution.\n  Senator Capito has been a leader in this effort, and I thank her for \nher hard work. That hard work will continue as the Senate and House \nboth take up the measures and pass them. That is the right thing to do \nfor middle-class Kentuckians and middle-class Americans who have \nsuffered enough under this administration already.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/17/senate-section/article/S7973-8", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7973-S7974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 BURMA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on several occasions this year I have \ncome to the floor and noted that this year's Burmese election would \nrepresent a crucial test for the country's path to political reform. \nThe lead-up to this November's election was marked by a number of \ndiscouraging developments: the disenfranchisement of the Rohingya \npopulation and the defeat of commonsense constitutional reform \nproposals back in the summer. Yet, despite these setbacks, I am pleased \nto note that last week's election in Burma seems to have been a \nsuccess.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate my friend Daw \nAung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy party for their \noverwhelming victory. It was a truly remarkable achievement. At the \nsame time, I would also like to commend Burmese President Thein Sein \nfor his gracious remarks following the NLD victory and for his \ncommitment to abide by the results of the election. The same should be \nsaid of Burma's commander in chief. He also appears to have accepted \nthe results of the election and has pledged to support the NLD during \nthe transition.\n  In many ways, the key test for a young democracy is not the first \nelection but the first election in which there is a transfer of power \nfrom the ruling power to the opposition. The transfer of authority in \nBurma will therefore be pivotal. Accordingly, I would urge both the \nPresident and the commander in chief to continue on the positive course \nthey have charted since the election and to meet with Daw Suu in the \ncoming days to map out an appropriate transition plan.\n  The NLD now has a mandate to govern and has sufficient strength in \nParliament to choose a President and one\n\n[[Page S7974]]\n\nof the two Vice Presidents, although Daw Suu herself is prohibited from \nthese positions. The prohibition itself reflects one of the many \nchallenges that lie ahead. Others include addressing the problem of the \nmilitary's quota of seats in the Parliament, promoting reconciliation \namong ethnic groups, and healing the divide among those of differing \nreligious faiths.\n  For now, it is worth acknowledging the good news last week in Burma. \nThe road to bring the bilateral relationship to where it stands today \nhas been a long one indeed. The transition of power has the potential \nto be a watershed in Burma history. It provides an opportunity to \nreinvigorate the reform effort in that country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/17/senate-section/article/S7974-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING SENATOR BARBARA MIKULSKI\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

This is a woman who played an important role in our colleague's \nlife, one the Senator speaks of often. She emigrated from Poland when \nshe was 16 years old with little more than a few pennies in her pocket. \nShe couldn't even vote when she arrived. ``She never thought,'' our \ncolleague said, ``that her own great-granddaughter would one day be a \nUnited States Senator.

Mr. President, for the first 6 years of Barack Obama's \nPresidency, Republicans have tried to block nearly every nomination \nthat has come to the Senate.\n  From a record backlog of judicial nominees to the first-ever \nfilibuster of a Secretary of Defense, Republicans abdicated their \nconstitutional responsibility to provide their advice and consent \nregarding these nominations. In fact, the Republicans have blocked \nPresident Obama's nominees more than all the other Presidential \nnominees in history combined. Think about that. They have blocked more \nof this President's nominations than all the preceding Presidents in \nthe history of our country. Seventy-one percent of all cloture motions \nfiled on nominees during the history of the country were for President \nObama's nominees. Seventy-three percent of cloture motions on judicial \nnominees were for Obama nominees. Ninety-seven percent of cloture \nmotions on district court judges were for Obama nominees.\n  When Republicans assumed power of the Senate in January, some may \nhave expected that their obligation to govern would bring an end to \ntheir obstruction, but it didn't. We all know what happened last year. \nWe all know they were holding up all nominations they didn't like--not \nall of them but all of those they didn't like, and that is most all of \nthem.\n  Something that has been traditional in this country, the National \nLabor Relations Board--they refused to allow us to have a vote. They \nfilibustered every one of them, which meant that the National Labor \nRelations Board, which is so important to working men and women in this \ncountry, could not go forward. They didn't even have a quorum. The \nsecond highest court--some say the most important court in the land--is \nthe DC Court of Appeals. They refused to allow any votes on nominees. \nThey filibustered every one of them. We have five vacancies.\n  Well, something had to be done, and it was done. It was done for the \nright reason, and it was good for the country. Those people have now \nbeen confirmed. We have a better country as a result of that.\n  When the Republicans assumed power, they kept talking about how they \nwanted to get the Senate back to work. Sadly, we all know that has been \nan absolute joke. We have had more revotes than in the history of the \ncountry during the time they have been in power here. We have done less \nthan any Senate in the history of the country. So getting the Senate \nback to work is not very honest.\n  Sadly, those who were hoping that the Republicans would get serious \nabout governing have been terribly disappointed. Republicans are still \ndoing everything they can to block even the most qualified nominees.\n  Many of these nominations are vitally important to our national \nsecurity. I will list the people who have been blocked from having a \nvote in the Senate--and they have even gone one step further; they are \nnot even holding hearings to allow them to come to the floor. Here are \nsome who we could vote on and we should vote on: The Under Secretary of \nDefense for Personnel and Readiness, the Assistant Secretary of Defense \nfor International Security, Under Secretary of the Air Force, Secretary \nof the Army, Under Secretary of the Army, Under Secretary of Treasury \nfor Terrorism and Financial Crimes. Those positions are unfilled.\n  Think about the Secretary of Treasury for Terrorism and Financial \nCrimes. They are not even bringing it to a vote. As the United States \ncontinues to fight ISIS and its terrorism, shouldn't we confirm the \nperson in Treasury who is responsible for terrorism and financial \ncrimes?\n  How about the Secretary of the Army--do you think that is important? \nBeing disappointed doesn't go very far if all my Republican colleagues \nsay is a resounding no. But this is all part of\n\n[[Page S7975]]\n\nthe Republican trend of grinding the nomination process to a halt.\n  So far this year the Republican Senate has confirmed 100 fewer \ncivilian nominees than it did during the most comparable Senate session \nin 2007, for example. That number also lags well behind any other \nrecent session.\n  Judicial emergencies are triple what they were at the beginning of \nthis year. What is a judicial emergency? It means you have a judge who \nhas more work than he can handle. Jury trials are not allowed to go \nforward, especially civil jury trials. Hearings on important issues, \nrestraining orders, and other important issues are not held. In 2007 at \nthis same stage we had confirmed 34 judges; this year, 10.\n  Consider the nomination of a man by the name of Felipe Restrepo for \nthe Third Circuit in Philadelphia. He was nominated more than 1 year \nago. The seat to which Judge Restrepo has been nominated is a judicial \nemergency, meaning there are more cases than the judges are able to \nhandle. The seat has been vacant since July 2013. Judges have said: We \nmay do the work, but we are not doing it the way we should be doing it \nbecause we are so busy on everything. That seat, I will repeat, has \nbeen vacant since July of 2013.\n  He is an American success story. He was born in Colombia and came to \nthe United States as a toddler. In 1993 he became a U.S. citizen. He is \neminently qualified, having graduated from the University of \nPennsylvania--one of the Ivy League schools--and Tulane University Law \nSchool. He worked as a public defender and started his own practice \nfocusing on civil rights and criminal defense issues. Since 2013 he has \nserved with distinction as a district judge in the Eastern District of \nPennsylvania. The Senate confirmed him in his current judge position \nunanimously.\n  More than a year ago, Senator Casey and Senator Toomey--a Democrat \nand a Republican--jointly recommended Judge Restrepo to the President \nof the United States for this appointment to be a circuit court judge. \nSenator Toomey said at the time: ``I believe [Judge Restrepo] will also \nmake a superb addition to the Third Circuit.'' But despite his public \nstatements of support, the Republican Senator from Pennsylvania refused \nto allow the Judiciary Committee to move forward with a hearing on his \nnomination by refusing to turn in something called a blue slip, as it \nis blue. It has been tradition in the Senate forever that you need both \nSenators to turn in their blue slips. He won't turn his in, which has \ndelayed confirmation of a qualified man who has been recommended to the \nPresident. He could advance Judge Restrepo by signing a piece of paper, \nbut he has long refused to do so. It is kind of baffling when he makes \npublic statements about what a great guy he is.\n  After the media started asking questions about the delay, the junior \nSenator from Pennsylvania told the Huffington Post:\n\n       No, I'm not blocking him. But I've got to run for this \n     lunch.\n\n  The junior Senator from Pennsylvania couldn't wait for his lunch, but \nthis judge and the people who he is responsible for taking care of are \nwaiting. This Third Circuit is overwhelmed with work. It is a judicial \nemergency. Other judges are doing more work than they should be doing. \nThey need him. So even though he couldn't wait for lunch, he is making \nmillions of Americans wait for a judge they desperately need.\n  In July his nomination was finally voted out of committee by voice--\nmeaning there was no controversy--showing, of course, that it should be \nvoted on now, immediately. That was in July. Remember, that was a year \nafter he was nominated. We are now in November. Why has a qualified \njudge's nomination sat on the floor since July waiting for a lunch that \nhas never been completed?\n  It is past time that the Senate confirmed Judge Restrepo. Senator \nToomey should demand and ask the majority leader to allow us to vote on \nJudge Restrepo before we leave for Thanksgiving--and in the process, \nsign that little piece of paper. We would be happy to work with \nRepublicans to confirm this good man today.\n  Unfortunately, it is not just this junior Senator from Pennsylvania--\nthey should also confirm Judge Mary Barzee Flores to the Southern \nDistrict of Florida. Unfortunately, Judge Barzee Flores's nomination \nhas been held up due to the same delaying tactics that Senator Toomey \nused to stall Judge Restrepo. But this nominee is being delayed by one \nof the many Republicans running for President, the junior Senator from \nFlorida.\n  Senators Nelson and Rubio jointly signed and recommended that she \nbecome a judge in the Southern District of Florida. She was nominated \non February 26, 2015--8 months ago--but since then the junior Senator \nfrom Florida is running for President. He doesn't have time to mess \nwith a judicial emergency. The Miami-based seat is considered another \njudicial emergency. It has been without a Senate-confirmed judge for \nmore than a year.\n  Like her counterpart in Pennsylvania, she has an impeccable record. \nIn fact, her nomination won wide praise in the Florida press. She is a \nfamiliar face to many in the legal community in South Florida, having \nserved on the Eleventh Judicial Circuit of Florida in Miami for more \nthan a decade. Prior to her judicial service, Judge Flores worked as a \npublic defender for 13 years. By any measure, she is well qualified and \ndeserves a hearing in the Judiciary Committee.\n  Senator Nelson indicated his support 8 months ago, but the junior \nSenator from Florida refuses to sign off on Judge Barzee Flores and is \nthe only obstacle stopping the nomination from moving forward. It is \npuzzling that Senator Rubio is delaying a judge whom he helped \nrecommend to President Obama. Without his approval, the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee cannot schedule a hearing on the Barzee Flores \nnomination.\n  Even with his busy schedule traveling around the country--I recognize \nhe doesn't vote here. He does not like to be in the Senate. He said so. \nHe does not like the Senate. That is why I said he should resign. He \ntalked about other Senators who missed votes. Any Senator who ran for \nPresident during my time in the Senate loved the Senate. They may have \nmissed votes, but they never, never denigrated the Senate. Senator \nRubio has done just that. So even with his busy schedule running for \nPresident and missing votes in the Senate, he should be able to find \nseconds to sign his blue slip that would allow Judge Flores to move \nforward with a hearing.\n  The junior Senator from Florida simply needs to sign a piece of paper \nto advance a qualified nominee whom he recommended to fill a judicial \nemergency in Florida, but like the junior Senator from Pennsylvania, he \nrefuses to do so. His constituents are paying a price, a big price.\n  Sadly, Republicans' strategy for the sake of obstruction is by no \nmeans limited--sadly, I say it again--to the junior Senators from \nFlorida and Pennsylvania.\n  Right now, Republicans are blocking important State Department \nnominations.\n  The junior Senator from Arkansas is preventing three Ambassadors from \ngetting their rightful vote on the Senate floor.\n  The junior Senator from Texas is blocking one of the most qualified \nnominees before the Senate, Gayle Smith. She was nominated 6 months ago \nas the next Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment. With this refugee problem facing the world, facing our \ncountry, wouldn't it be nice if we had someone whose job it was to \noversee this for our government? But, no, there is some extraneous \nissue the junior Senator from Texas--who is also running for \nPresident--is more concerned about than this important Agency.\n  I have spoken at length about the obsession of the senior Senator \nfrom Iowa with blocking more than 20 qualified State Department \nnominees. The nominees he has blocked are people who have worked as \nForeign Service officers for a long, long time for different periods of \ntime. When it comes time that they get automatic changes in their \nstatus, they get a few more dollars and get a different title. He is \nblocking these. That is so sad. There is no need for it.\n  If Republicans were serious about governing, they would change course \nand stop blocking these nominations. Every moment that Republicans \ndelay, they are hurting our country in many\n\n[[Page S7976]]\n\ndifferent ways: our justice system, our foreign policy system, and our \nability to respond to the havoc that is taking place in the Middle East \nright now. Let's put an end to all of this obstruction. Let's move \nforward with votes on these qualified consensus nominees as we have \ndone historically.

Mr. President, earlier in this session we observed a \nmoment of silence to exhibit our solidarity with the people of France. \nI add my voice to others here today in sharing my deepest condolences \nand solidarity with the people of that great nation. As a result of \nbarbaric violence that occurred over the weekend, we are finding this \nsolidarity coming together from across the world, standing behind the \npeople of France in their hour of need.\n  These events that occurred in Paris were heartbreaking and \ninfuriating. America knows well from the tragic events of September 11 \nthat this kind of savagery is a challenge to the civilized world, one \nwhich we must collectively stand and defeat.\n  As French President Hollande said to a joint session of the French \nParliament, when France is attacked in such a manner, the whole world \nis attacked. I agree.\n  The people of Russia are also victims of such violence in the recent \ndowning of their airplane departing Egypt, another tragedy for which \nISIS has claimed credit. The people of Lebanon and Turkey have suffered \nhorrific bombings in their capitals in the last few weeks from these \nsame terrorist groups, and the brave reformers in Tunisia--one of the \nfew countries to emerge from the Arab spring with an inclusive and \ninspiring democracy--have faced similar violence against innocent \npeople at their museums and tourist destinations.\n  The perpetrator of all of these monstrous attacks is ISIS, which has \nfilled the void created by the wars in Iraq, Syria, and the broader \npolitical chaos of the Arab spring. These murderous henchmen have \nconducted the most heinous of acts: beheadings, mass rape, torture, and \nthe murder of innocents in a sick attempt to intimidate the civilized \nworld and to feed their own warped ideology.\n  I have supported President Obama's leadership in organizing a global \ncoalition to defeat ISIS and will continue to do so. I applaud \nSecretary Kerry for his efforts to negotiate an end to the Syrian civil \nwar, but we must do more.\n  When France is attacked and President Hollande reaches out to his \nallies, he is reaching out to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, \nNATO, of which the United States is a member. He should reach out as \nwell--and we all should reach out--to Russia which, as I mentioned \nearlier, has been victimized by this terrorist group in the downing of \nthat aircraft. Then reach out to the Saudis and Muslim leaders around \nthe world. Join us in a coalition to destroy ISIS, first in their \noccupied territory in Syria and in Iraq, and then in their murderous \nweb of recruitment and hate around the world.\n  Several people in the United States have reacted to the tragedy in \nFrance by calling for us to suspend refugees coming to this country. \nMany of these people have not reflected on the refugee situation in our \ncountry. Each year, the United States of America accepts about 70,000 \nrefugees from around the world. These refugees are each carefully \ninvestigated, reviewed and vetted. That process takes anywhere from 18 \nto 24 months before a refugee from any part of the world is allowed to \nenter the United States. We do everything humanly possible and take \nextraordinary efforts to make certain dangerous people do not arrive on \nour shores. That vetting process must continue and when it comes to \nsuspicious circumstances, must be doubled in its intensity to make \ncertain our Nation is safe, but for those who are focusing on that as \nthe answer to what happened in Paris, they are very shortsighted.\n\n  One out of four of the refugees coming to the United States in the \nlast fiscal year came not from the Middle East but from Burma. In \naddition to that, we find many refugees coming to the United States \nfrom Iraq. It turns out that over 3,000 refugees came from Iran. In \neach and every instance, we should apply the standard of strict vetting \nand the highest standards of investigation. I certainly stand by that, \nbut those who say we should turn away refugees coming to the United \nStates have forgotten the lesson of history. It was May of 1939, a ship \ndocked in Florida. The ship was named the SS St. Louis. On that ship \nwere almost 1,000 Jews from Europe who were trying to escape \npersecution. Sadly, the United States turned them away and they had to \nreturn to Europe. They were afraid for their lives. The Nazis had \nengaged in Kristallnacht and violence against Jewish people, and these \nrefugees were coming to our shores seeking refugee status. In May of \n1939 we turned them away. They returned to Europe and over 200 of them \ndied in the Holocaust.\n  Since that time the United States has taken a different approach to \nrefugees. We have been a country sensitive to the reality that in many \nparts of the world people are living in fear of death every day and can \nonly find safety on our shores. Over the years we have accepted 750,000 \nrefugees from Vietnam; we have accepted over 500,000 Cuban refugees, \nincluding the fathers of two U.S. Senators, one who is running for \nPresident; we accepted over 200,000 Soviet Jews who were escaping \npersecution in the former Soviet Union; we have accepted refugees from \naround the world--from Somalia, from Bosnia. The list is long. That is \nan indication of who we are and our values.\n  Now, we need to be careful when any refugee comes to the United \nStates. We should give them a thorough investigation, but for us to \nstep back and say we are going to stop being a refuge for refugees from \naround the world is a retreat from America's values. Let us make sure \nthe process for refugees, immigrants, and visitors is the very best. \nLet us carefully follow through on each one of them, but let us not \nturn our backs on many around the world who fear for their lives and \nare looking for the safety of the United States. That has been part of \nour heritage for over 60 years and it should continue.\n  What can we do? We know we have an obligation to keep America safe, \nand we know ISIS and terrorists like them are trying to find ways into \nthe United States. First, we must acknowledge the obvious. For more \nthan 14 years, with the exception of the Boston Marathon, involving \nlone-wolf terrorists, we have kept America safe. It has been through \nthe good work of our men and women in the intelligence community, the \nmilitary, the FBI, and in so many different aspects of our government.\n  So what can we do in the Senate to make sure they are able to do \ntheir job effectively? Why don't we do our job in the Senate. Why don't \nwe pass the appropriations bills for these agencies. Imagine, here we \nare, over a month into this fiscal year, and the Senate has not passed \nthe appropriations for the FBI, the appropriations for the Department \nof Homeland Security. What are we waiting for? Instead, we have vote \nafter revote after revote over old issues that have been resolved on \nthe floor of the Senate months ago. This week, if we want to fight \nterrorism and protect the United States, let us pass the appropriations \nbills for all of the agencies of our government. It is time to do it \nand to do it now.\n  Secondly, we need to make sure our country has the tools to fight \nterrorism, the kind of terrorism we have seen in Paris, France. We know \nwe need to change the approach when it comes to the encryption of data \nand communications so that we have access\n\n[[Page S7977]]\n\nto the communications of terrorists. Technology is leaping ahead of our \ncapacity. We are told by our agencies of government that to keep \nAmerica safe we have to deal with encryption standards today. That is \nthe reality of the challenge to the United States.\n  Some would dwell on refugees. I think we ought to be careful on every \nsingle refugee that comes to this country, but there is more we can do. \nPass the appropriations for the agencies that keep us safe, put in new \nstandards so we can deal with the encryption where would-be terrorists \nare hiding their communications from our surveillance even under court \norder.\n  Third, we need to come together--France, the NATO nations, Russia, \nthose Muslim countries that abhor this extremism that is exhibited by \nISIS--and wipe ISIS off the map in Iraq and Syria. We need to rely on \nlocal forces there who have been so effective, like the Kurds, who are \nwilling to fight the ISIS troops on the ground and to defeat them. \nEliminating them from Iraq and Syria is no guarantee they will not \ncontinue their efforts around the world, but let us have a common enemy \nin ISIS and come together in a large global coalition to fight them and \nstop their efforts.\n  I come to the floor with some emotion today because my wife and I, \nfor years, have visited France. We consider it to be a wonderful \ncountry with great people. We have had our differences on foreign \npolicy from time to time, but any student of history knows the French \nstood with us when it came to our Revolution. The French have been by \nour side time and again, and we have been by their side in both World \nWar I, World War II, and in so many other theaters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will conclude by saying, from the birth \nof our Nation to this day, France has always been one of our closest \nallies. America stands arm in arm with the people of France.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, like the speaker before me, I rise to \noffer my condolences to the nation of France.

Mr. President, I rise to share my concerns about the \ndevastating impact of the Affordable Care Act and, specifically, the \nCadillac tax. The Cadillac tax is a 40-percent excise tax set to take \nplace in 2018 on employer-sponsored health insurance plans. In Nevada, \n1.3 million workers who have employer-sponsored health insurance plans \nwill be hit by this Cadillac tax. These are public employees in Carson \nCity, service industry workers on the strip in Las Vegas, and small \nbusiness owners and their retirees across the State of Nevada.\n  My colleagues from across the country have heard the same concerns I \nhave: This 40-percent tax will increase costs, significantly reduce \nbenefits or result in employers getting rid of employer-sponsored \nhealth coverage all together. Is this what we want? Is this what we \nvoted for? Is this what the other side voted for?\n  This is precisely why Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and I \nhave sponsored the Middle Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act of 2015, \nthe only bipartisan piece of legislation to fully repeal this onerous \ntax. My bill has 19 bipartisan cosponsors.\n  Over the summer, when I committed to taking a leadership role to \nfully repeal this tax, I waited for months for a sign that my \ncolleagues across the aisle would work together to repeal this tax. \nThere was a lot of talk, but there was no action. To date there is \nstill little action from these same colleagues, which is why I ask them \nonce again to join me in repealing this bad tax.\n  This shouldn't be a bipartisan issue. Yet my colleagues across the \naisle have turned it into one. That is why I commend Senator Heinrich \nfor joining me in working together in a bipartisan manner to fully \nrepeal this tax, and this repeal needs to happen and happen quickly for \nthe employers to be able to plan for the future. Whether it is through \nour bill or any of the must-pass measures the Chamber takes up in the \nnext 6 weeks before the end of this year--for example, tax extenders--\nthe Cadillac tax needs to be fully repealed.\n  As a member of the Senate Committee on Finance, this is something I \nhave engaged my colleagues on and will continue to do so, especially as \nwe hopefully look to move tax extenders before the end of this year. \nThis is not just something that needs more bipartisan support in the \nSenate. There are over 218 cosponsors in the House of Representatives--\nnearly half of them are Democrats--and 83 organizations have endorsed \nour efforts to repeal the Cadillac tax. It is very rare these days to \nsee this much agreement in Washington, DC. Organized labor, chambers of \ncommerce, local and State governments, large and small businesses have \ncome together with a bipartisan group putting forth a solution to \nfixing a problem affecting so many hard-working, tax-paying Americans.\n  The Cadillac tax doesn't officially go into effect until 2018, but \nthe impact of this tax is being talked about more and more because \nemployers are starting to make major changes today now to their \nworkers' health care benefits in order to limit the impact of the tax \nor avoid the tax altogether.\n  I have heard from large companies, I have heard from small businesses \nand organized labor, such as the culinary union in Nevada, and they are \nall saying the same thing: The Cadillac tax needs to be fully repealed \nor our employees will experience massive changes to their health care.\n  We are talking about three things. We are talking about reduced \nbenefits, we are talking about increased premiums, and we are talking \nabout higher deductibles. Is this what we want? All of these lead to \nmore money being taken out of the pockets of hard-working, tax-paying \nfamilies.\n  According to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, employees who \nhave job-based insurance have witnessed their out-of-pocket expenses \nclimb from $900 in 2010 to $1,300 in 2015, on average. That is almost a \n50-percent increase in their insurance coverage in the last 5 years. \nEmployees working for small businesses now have deductibles over \n$1,800. Kaiser also notes that deductibles have risen nearly seven \ntimes faster--seven times faster--than workers' earnings since 2010. \nKaiser's president, Drew Altman, said:\n\n       It is quite a revolution. When deductibles are rising seven \n     times faster than wages . . . it means that people can't pay \n     their rent . . . they can't buy their gas. They can't eat.\n\n  As deductibles rise, another way employers are planning on avoiding \nObamaCare's massive new tax is by eliminating health savings accounts \nand flexible spending accounts. Over 33 million Americans use FSAs, or \nflexible spending accounts, and 13.5 million Americans use health \nsavings accounts, or HSAs. They may see these accounts vanish in the \ncoming years as companies scramble to avoid the law's 40-percent tax \nhike.\n  HSAs and FSAs are used for things like hospital and maternity \nservices, they are used for childcare, they are used for dental care, \nphysical therapy, and access to mental health services. Access to these \nlifesaving services could all be gone for tens of millions of Americans \nif the Cadillac tax is not fully repealed.\n  Every day there is a new article in the national press talking about \nhow middle-class workers, tax-paying Americans, are going to be hit by \nthis tax. Towers Watson, a management and consulting firm, did a survey \nof large businesses that typically offer the most comprehensive \ncoverage. They found in 2018 more than half of the employers are \nplanning to significantly cut what they contribute to insure employee \nspouses and children. The United Parcel Service, UPS, is one of those \ncompanies that have already said they plan on limiting plan eligibility \nfor spouses of employees.\n  Shaun O'Brien, assistant policy director of the AFL-CIO, said \nrecently that ``employers are coming to the table asking for cuts in \nbenefits based on their preliminary projections around the 40 percent \nexcise tax.''\n  To make matters worse, the chief financial officer of a waste and \nrecycling company, Action Environmental, recently told the Wall Street \nJournal\n\n[[Page S7978]]\n\nthat his company would consider getting rid of its employee coverage \naltogether because of ObamaCare's Cadillac tax. He said: ``I'd be lying \nif I said we haven't had that discussion.''\n  Delta Airlines expects ObamaCare will cost it $100 million per year. \nOne reason for the new costs is the 40-percent excise tax on Delta's \nemployee health benefits, as if Americans don't already have enough \nissues with airlines these days.\n  Out of all the news we see from the Cadillac tax, none of it--zero--\nis positive. The goal of health care reform should be to help those who \ndo not have health coverage and lower costs for those who already have \ninsurance. This tax doesn't achieve either of these goals, and everyone \nknows it.\n  I will do everything I can to see that this tax is fully repealed. \nThere is a real urgency that we get this done. I will work with anybody \nin this Chamber to see that the Cadillac tax is fully repealed by the \nend of the year. Once again, whether it is my bipartisan bill or a \nyear-end package such as the tax extenders, we need to repeal this very \nbad tax. Fully repealing the Cadillac tax is an opportunity for \nRepublicans and Democrats to join forces and to work together to repeal \na bad tax for one purpose: to help 151 million workers keep the health \ncare insurance they like.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/17/senate-section/article/S7978-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7978-S7979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST FRANCE\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to join all of our Senate \ncolleagues in sending our deepest condolences to the families and loved \nones of the victims in the attacks in Paris. Our hearts go out to the \npeople of France. The United States stands firmly and united in \nsolidarity with France, just as France--our Nation's oldest ally--has \nstood in solidarity with us. We must work to find those responsible for \nthose attacks and bring them to justice.\n  We remain steadfast as a country, and talking to people in my own \nState, I know this. We remain steadfast in our resolve to defeat ISIS, \nto root out this evil. From those planning these attacks in Belgium to \nthose training camps in Syria, our military--our strong and mighty U.S. \nmilitary--has already provided critical leadership with France in \nescalating the airstrikes in Syria and Iraq, and we must continue to do \nthat. In the coming months we must focus on building this international \ncoalition against ISIS, as well as providing critical intelligence in \ngoing after these perpetrators.\n  Just yesterday Russia announced that it was in fact a bomb that \nbrought down the plane over Egypt. Not all the facts are known yet, but \nISIS has claimed responsibility. There is no limit to what these people \nwill do. That plane was filled with innocent families and children \ncoming back from vacation, just as the concert hall in France was \nfilled with young people there for the music. They now lie maimed in \nhospitals all over Paris or, worse, their families are burying them in \nthe ground.\n  What can our country do? First, we must have a unified agenda to keep \nAmerica safe and to stand by our allies. We must do all we can to build \nthis coalition and to fight this evil at its root with resolve. We have \nunprecedented technology that should allow us to fight this fight. We \nhave biometrics. We have ways that we can assist other countries.\n  Secondly, we must do all we can to enhance our own security. We know \nour first responders throughout the last decade have done amazing work \nin thwarting attacks. We must continue to support them. If we do more \nin terms of legislation, we must make sure that we are doing something \nthat will actually make a difference. We are having a security briefing \nwith all Senators tomorrow, and we must listen to our security and \nintelligence experts to make sure that what we are proposing will make \na difference.\n  Third, we must give our first responders and our military on the \nfrontline the resources they need. I know Senators Shelby and Mikulski \nare working hard, with their counterparts in the House of \nRepresentatives, to craft a budget bill. We must take up that bill as \nsoon as it is completed. Of course, we have had some positive success \nin reaching a budget that didn't make deep cuts into our military or \nour homeland security capabilities. That was positive. Now we must \nbring it home with the budget.\n  The fourth and final action I will mention today as part of this \nunified agenda to keep our country safe and to support our allies is to \nmake sure we have our own frontline positions filled. As was mentioned \nearlier, this includes the Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and \nFinancial Crimes, a position that must be filled, and military \npositions, including positions within our own Army.\n  We have a judiciary that has to take on these terrorism cases. I \ncan't comment about what is going on in every jurisdiction in the \ncountry, but I know Minnesota has one of the highest caseloads. We have \na well-qualified applicant named Wilhelmina Wright, a former \nprosecutor, who passed through the Judiciary Committee without dissent, \nthanks to the good work of the chair of this committee, Senator \nGrassley, and Senator Leahy. Her name is one that is coming up before \nthe Senate.\n  Given that we have 15 indictments out of Minnesota alone--and that \nnumber growing--against ISIS, home-grown terrorists, and people who \nwere trying to fight for ISIS abroad and given that our great law \nenforcement in Minnesota on the Federal and the local level were able \nto track them down and our aggressive U.S. attorney's office was able \nto make the cases, we need judges to handle those cases. We have one of \nthe highest caseloads already in the country.\n  I appreciate the work of the Judiciary Committee, on a bipartisan \nbasis, in bringing this nomination to the floor. It is one of several \nthat need to get done. Again, these are frontline positions--frontline \npositions dealing directly with the terrorism that we are talking \nabout.\n  Finally, we have to fill the State Department positions that are \nopen--USAID, which provides critical assistance to our allies and our \nfriends that are taking on these fights. The fact that we don't have \nanyone confirmed in that position is very disturbing. We have someone I \nknow Senator Corker is supporting that we would like to get through and \nwe must get through--Ms. Smith.\n  We also have open ambassador positions--again, noncontroversial \nnominees--in the European continent, in countries that have not had an \nambassador for years. I bring up one nominee from the State of \nMinnesota, and that is for the country of Norway, which has been a \ncritical ally. Norway is one of our country's strongest and most \ndependable international allies. It was a founding member of the NATO \nalliance, an ally we will be relying on heavily as we look at fighting \nISIS. Its military has participated in operations with the United \nStates in the Balkans and in Afghanistan. Norwegians have worked \nalongside Americans in standing up the Ukraine, and they have worked \nwith us in countering ISIS.\n  Yet we have not had an ambassador for over 2 years. I recognize part \nof this is because the initial nominee ended up withdrawing--someone \nput forward by this administration. That happened. Now we have a \nnoncontroversial nominee, along with a nominee for the country of \nSweden. The nominee for Norway, Sam Heins, from the State of Minnesota, \nhas gotten through the Foreign Relations Committee and was approved by \nvoice vote. No one raised any questions about the qualifications of Mr. \nHeins for this position.\n  Given that Europe is on the frontline of these ISIS attacks, we must \njoin with Europe and make sure that we not only have our military \npositions filled, our State Department positions filled, our USAID \npositions filled, and our judiciary at home with the nominees before \nthe Senate so that we can have a strong, united front, but we also have \nto make sure we fill the positions for these ambassadors.\n  Again, I am not pushing controversial nominees. These are people who \nwill be serving in these positions for the remaining year. But I ask \nthat the Senate take up these nominations, as well as get the budget \ndone, which we are well on our way to do, as well as come together on \ncommonsense solutions for our own security, as well as making sure that \nwe put together and\n\n[[Page S7979]]\n\nlead, in America and with our allies, an international coalition to \nroot out ISIS.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake).

Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of my \nresolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act against \nEPA's greenhouse gas regulation targeting existing power sources.\n  I am so proud to be here with my colleague from North Dakota Senator \nHeidi Heitkamp. We have 47 cosponsors on this bipartisan effort to stop \nthe existing coal plant rule. We have had a lot of discussion about \nthis. It affects all of our States differently, but I think it is \nimportant to talk not just about what this does to our individual \nStates but what this is going to do to us as a country.\n  If the administration's proposed Clean Power Plan moves forward, \nhardship will be felt all across the country. Fewer job opportunities, \nhigher power bills, and less reliable electricity will result. West \nVirginia and other coal-producing States, such as Kentucky and Wyoming, \nare feeling the pain of prior EPA regulations. Nearly 7,000 WARN \nnotices, or notifications to employees--let me ask, does everybody know \nwhat a WARN notice is? If you have gotten one, you will never forget it \nbecause basically what a WARN notice says to that employee is that you \ncould be laid off within the next 60 days.\n  In West Virginia, 7,000 of those notices have gone out to West \nVirginia families, West Virginia coal miners, in the year 2015, and \nmore than 2,600 of those were just issued last month alone. Our \nneighboring State of Kentucky--the State of the majority leader--lost \nmore than 10 percent of its coal jobs during the first quarter of this \nyear.\n  Kentucky's coal employment now stands at the lowest level since the \n1920s. The Energy Information Administration's most recent annual coal \nreport for 2013 showed that the average number of coal mine employees \ndropped by roughly 10 percent in other coal-producing States, such as \nAlabama, Utah, and Virginia.\n  According to the Mine Safety and Health Administration, coal mining \nemployment nationally has dropped by a massive 31 percent in just the \nlast 4 years. If you travel to the State of West Virginia--particularly \nour coal area--it does not take you long to see that. The impact of \nthis war on coal extends far beyond the coal industry. These \nregulations are affecting all aspects of Americans' lives. Last month, \nWest Virginia's Governor announced that most State agencies would have \nto endure 4 percent cuts, largely because of shrinking energy tax \nrevenues. For the first time in many years, the Governor cut our \neducation budget in the State of West Virginia because of this war on \ncoal. That means less money for roads, for schools, and for health care \nservices, but the terrible impact that prior regulations have had on \nWest Virginia and the Nation would get far worse if the EPA's Clean \nPower Plan goes into effect.\n  The Clean Power Plan is the most expensive environmental regulation \nthe EPA has ever proposed on our Nation's power sector. Compliance \nspending is estimated to total between $29 billion and $39 billion per \nyear. Household spending power--the money American families have in \ntheir pockets--will be reduced by $64 billion to $79 billion by this \nrule.\n  A new study by NERA, a respected economic analysis firm, of the final \nrule found that electricity prices in West Virginia would increase \nbetween 13 and 22 percent, but certainly West Virginia will not be \nalone, as we are going to hear through this debate, in enduring higher \nenergy prices and job loss. NERA projects that all of the lower 48 \nStates will see their electricity prices go up under the Clean Power \nPlan. As many as 41 States could see electricity prices increase by at \nleast 10 percent. That is just from this regulation. I am sure my \ncolleague from North Dakota represents one of those affected states. \nTwenty-eight States would see electricity prices that would increase by \nat least 20 percent.\n  What does that mean for our economy? The National Rural Electric \nCooperative Association found that a 10-percent increase in electricity \nprices could mean a loss of 1.2 million jobs across the country. Half a \nmillion of those jobs would be in rural communities in rural States \nsuch as West Virginia and North Dakota.\n  The National Black Chamber of Commerce found that the Clean Power \nPlan would increase poverty among blacks by 23 percent and poverty \namong Hispanics by 26 percent. Affordable energy matters, especially to \nthose living on fixed incomes. Households earning less than $30,000 a \nyear spend an average of 23 percent of their income on energy costs. \nThese families, these children, these workers, these elderly are the \nones who will suffer most under this administration's policy.\n  Energy reliability also matters. Coal is the source of our baseload \ngeneration, and the administration wants to replace coal with \nintermittent sources. What does that mean? That means that on a hot \nday, when the air-conditioner is running and factories are operating, \nwe could be confident that a coal-fired powerplant will be supplying \nthe energy needed to cool our homes and keep our businesses running.\n  In the cold winter of 2014, when the demand for electricity surged, \ncoal was the energy source utilities relied on to keep people warm. \nRenewable sources--and we want more. We want more variable ones and \nmore frequent ones. Renewable sources are an important part of our \ncountry's energy mix, but there are always going to be days when the \nwind isn't blowing and the Sun isn't shining, and it is critical we \npreserve more reliable energy resources to meet the demand of powering \nour economy.\n  Where I would like to see us go is innovation. Innovation, not \nacross-the-board regulations, should be our focus, but these \nregulations will not spur innovation. The Clean Power Plan sets a \nstandard for new plants that cannot be met by the most commercially \navailable technology we have today. That not only flies in the face of \nthe Clean Air Act but also makes gradual improvements in technology \nthat would improve our environment impossible implement. The effect \nwill be to instead choke off our most reliable and\n\n[[Page S7980]]\n\naffordable source of energy and devastate the livelihoods of many folks \naround this country.\n  Prior to this administration, our country did a laudable job of \nprotecting and improving our environment while promoting economic \ngrowth. Last week marked the 25th anniversary of the 1990 Clean Air Act \namendments, which were signed into law by President George H.W. Bush \nand supported by Senators across the political spectrum. Our air is now \nthe cleanest it has been in decades. We continue, and we must continue, \nto reduce harmful pollutants such as sulfur dioxide as our energy \nconsumption increases and our population grows.\n  Since 2005, U.S. carbon dioxide emissions have fallen by 13 percent. \nAccording to the EIA, West Virginia has emitted 19 percent less carbon \ndioxide since the year 2000. We should continue on this track. We \nshould continue to protect our environment but not at the expense of \nour families, our communities, and our economy. I am serious when I \nsay, if you come to West Virginia, you will easily see this.\n  With this rulemaking, the EPA is attempting to impose the same type \nof cap-and-trade system that Congress rejected 5 years ago. Having \nfailed at its attempt at cap and trade, the administration has taken a \nsecond bite at the apple by claiming authority under the Clean Air Act \nto impose a regulatory cap-and-trade program. That is not the way it \nshould be. This raises an obvious question. If EPA had cap-and-trade \nauthority, as the administration is asserting now, why did the \nadministration go to such lengths to try to pass cap-and-trade \nlegislation? The answer is clear. The Clean Air Act does not authorize \na mandatory cap-and-trade program. With its Clean Power Plan, EPA \nignores 40 years of history and prior regulations that consistent with \nthe law, always based standards on controls installed at an existing \nplant.\n  Let me be clear. In the 40-year history of the Clean Air Act, EPA has \nnever issued an existing plant program quite like this. As one EPA \nofficial summed it up to the New York Times, ``The legal interpretation \nis challenging. This effectively hasn't been done.''\n  Rather than regulating existing plants using the best technology, EPA \nis instead attempting to regulate the entire energy grid. This has not \nbeen done before because the Clean Power Act does not authorize EPA to \ndo this. Both States and the private sector are doing what they can to \nfight back over this overreach.\n  West Virginia is 1 of 27 States that has filed lawsuits to block this \nrule. Additionally, 24 national trade associations, 37 rural electric \ncooperatives, 10 major companies, and 3 labor unions representing over \n800,000 employees are challenging the EPA's final Clean Power Plan.\n  In less than 2 weeks, international climate negotiations will begin. \nThe world is watching to see whether the United States will foolishly \nmove forward with costly regulations that will do virtually nothing to \nprotect our environment.\n  Under the Congressional Review Act, the Senate now has the chance to \ntake a real up-or-down vote on whether the EPA's Clean Power Plan can \nand should move forward. This is a legal binding resolution that if \nsuccessful will prevent the Clean Power Plan or a similar rule from \ntaking effect.\n  Passing this resolution will send a clear message to the world that a \nmajority of the Congress does not stand behind the President's efforts \nto address climate change with economically catastrophic regulations. \nPassing this resolution will also demonstrate to the American people \nthat the Senate understands the need for affordable and reliable \nenergy. Congress should pass this resolution and place this critical \nissue squarely on the President's desk. America's economic future is at \nstake, and it is time to send a clear signal that enough is enough.\n  I am very privileged to be offering this resolution with Senator \nHeitkamp from North Dakota. She has been a champion on this issue. She \nhas a different energy mix in her State and different energy concerns, \nbut I think it goes to the heart of North Dakotans and West Virginians \nabout the economic impact of such a very far-reaching and untried \nregulation in an area that is so far-reaching. I thank the Senator for \nher steadfast support. It has been my pleasure to be working with \nSenator Heitkamp.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I want to express my great thanks to my \ncolleague from West Virginia, Senator Capito, who has been absolutely a \nchampion on this issue, but also a champion on looking at new \ntechnologies and a champion to actually see what we can do moving \nforward with the great innovation that is the history of this country \nand the history of coal country.\n  If you look over the life of the Clean Air Act, you will see \nliterally billions of dollars of investment in cleaner energy, billions \nof dollars of investment in pollution control, billions of dollars of \ncommitment to the environment by the industries we represent, whether \nit is a utility industry that has an interesting resource mix that \nincludes coal or whether it is those facilities that utilize the energy \nlooking at energy efficiency.\n  The numbers that Senator Capito gave you in terms of America's \nachievement on reduction of CO2 happened without any \ninvolvement or any interference by the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  North Dakota's situation is unique as it relates to the Clean Power \nPlan rules, and that is why North Dakota filed its own separate piece \nof litigation because we have a different story to tell, I believe, a \nstory that involves lignite, which isn't the coal that is mined in West \nVirginia, but it certainly, for those of us in the center of the \ncountry, has become an important fuel source for a generation of \nelectricity for generations.\n  When you look at it and you think about where we are with fuel \nsources, you remember that there was a period of time when utility \ncompanies in this country were told you cannot use natural gas to \ngenerate electricity and, as a result, billions of dollars of \ninvestment were deployed to find a way to have a redundant, reliable, \nand affordable source of energy, and that redundant, reliable, and \naffordable source of energy was coal. Now things have transitioned. \nNorth Dakota is truly all of the above as it relates to our energy \nresources in this country and providing the electricity and the \nreliability of our electricity in the region.\n\n  When we look at where we are right now, we have created an incredible \nlevel of uncertainty for utility companies in this country. What do I \nmean by that? If you are sitting as a member of the board of directors \nin a utility company right now and know you are going to have baseload \ngrowth moving forward, how do you build out your resources to meet the \ndemand, which is required by our regulatory environment? Now you are \ntold: Look, by this year, those of you in North Dakota have to reduce \nyour CO2 output by 45 percent. Guess what. The original \nrule, as drafted, had an 11-percent reduction, and now we are up to 44 \npercent. In what world is that an appropriate leap as we move forward \nin terms of looking at compliance with this new regulation? The EPA is \nnot authorized to issue rules that are impossible. The baseline and \nfundamental principle of both the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act \nis about using the best available technology--what is actually there \nand commercially available in that space. I have sat down with people \nwho run utility companies in my State, and they have told me it is \nvirtually impossible. Not only do we have a rule that is impossible, \nbut we have an issue that I think the good Senator from West Virginia \ntalked about that is even more serious. We have one agency of the \nFederal Government not empowered by any law in this country basically \ncontrolling our energy deployment, our electrical deployment. We have \nignored FERC, and we have ignored all the other agencies that are \nresponsible for the transmission of electricity.\n  If you look at the history of this country and compare our history \nwith many of our competitors across the world, the one thing we do \nbetter than our competitors is our reliable electricity. No matter what \ntime of the day it is, you can reach over and turn on a light switch in \nthe United States of America and the lights come on.\n  If you are building a new manufacturing facility and need new energy,\n\n[[Page S7981]]\n\nthat energy is made available to you. Having electricity deployed at \nthe end of the mile in my State, which can be as remote as another 20, \n30 miles away from anyone else is a miracle. That is really a miracle \nof the commitment we have made to make sure we have power in America. \nThis rule jeopardizes that commitment. This rule is wrongheaded and it \nis a dramatic change from the draft rule, especially as it relates to \nthe State of North Dakota. This rule represents an attitude that says: \nWe don't care what the law says. We don't care that you have rejected \ncap and trade. We don't care that you have rejected a carbon tax. We \nare going to unilaterally adopt those public policies as public \npolicies in America. I don't think any of that should happen. I think \nit is time that we push back at all levels.\n  As I said many times on the floor, whether it is the waters of the \nUnited States or the Clean Power Plan rule, the challenge we have is \ntrying to do what this Congress is responsible for doing, which is to \nlegislate. It is not to have a fight about whether we like the EPA or \nnot. It is not to have a fight about whether this rule is right or not. \nIt is about the appropriate public policy. When we simply leave it to \nthe regulatory agencies, we end up with litigation and uncertainty for \nthose people sitting in the boardroom who have a critical \nresponsibility for delivering power in the United States of America.\n  I gladly join my colleague from West Virginia as we pursue this \nmatter. I think we all know that this legislation will likely pass. We \nalso know what the likely outcome will be once it reaches the \nPresident's desk. We need to continue to have these conversations. We \nneed to continue to talk about what the consequences are, not just for \nthe coal miners in West Virginia and North Dakota but for the \nredundant, reliable, and affordable delivery of electricity in our \ncountry.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I listened to every word as my friend \nspoke, and I respect the words from my colleague from West Virginia \nvery much, but I just want to be clear. I could not disagree with them \nmore. Why would the majority leader and my friends push for the \noverturning of a Clean Power Plan rule that will, in fact, save lives--\nthat is a fact because when the air gets cleaner, you save lives--and \nwill also protect our planet from the ravages of climate change? I \ndon't know why they would take that stand. I really don't. When we are \nsworn in here, above all we are supposed to protect the health and \nsafety of the people of our Nation, not protect one utility over the \nother. That is the private sector. We are here to protect lives and to \nprotect the planet. I am going to go into depth as to why I feel this \nis very wrongheaded.\n  I particularly have great respect for our majority leader. Senator \nMcConnell has the power to bring anything before the body that he \nchooses. That is his right, and he has done that. But I must question \nthis--given what happened in Paris and the need to keep America safe: \nWhy are we going after the Clean Air Act today? It doesn't make sense. \nWe should be moving to the omnibus budget agreement. We should be \nlooking at every part of that budget to make America safe.\n  For example, in the EPA budget, we could look at ways to improve \nchemical safety and how to protect our reservoirs. We could look at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and how we can step up security at our \nports, airports, border checkpoints, and railroads. We could look at \nfunding biometrics, which could help us fight against homeland \nterrorism.\n  In the State Department, we could look at ways to enhance security at \nour embassies and consulates. There is a lot of talk about Benghazi, \nBenghazi, Benghazi, but the Republican budget cut embassy security. How \nabout looking at that? Why don't we look at the Office of Personnel \nManagement and look at ways we could boost our cyber defenses after one \nof the largest data breaches in our government's history. The \nDepartment of Justice needs to make sure the FBI and local law \nenforcement have the resources they need to keep our families safe.\n  I compliment everyone who came to the table and got a universal \nagreement on the budget for the next 2 years. Why are we looking at \nrepealing a Clean Power Plan rule instead of taking up that budget \nagreement and looking--in a bipartisan way--at every single agency that \nwe fund to make sure they are doing everything to keep America safe?\n  I was talking to one of my colleagues from New York, and he pointed \nout that the terrorists have been after us since 9/11. So we know we \nhave been doing something right. Let's look at what we are doing right \nand see if there is anything we are not doing right. Let's beef it up \nand make sure that our refugee policy is the right policy. We have a \nlot of work to do, but, no, here we go again.\n  Just 2 weeks ago Senate Republicans led an attack on one of our \nNation's landmark environmental laws, the Clean Water Act, and we \ndefeated them. Now they are back again, and this time they are against \nclean air. They are attacking the Clean Air Act and the President's \ncommonsense proposals to address dangerous climate change. Of course, \nmost of them don't even believe climate change is happening. They say: \nWell, we are not scientists. That is right; you are not. So why not \nlisten to the 98 percent of scientists who know this is happening?\n  The Senate is considering at least one Congressional Review Act \nresolution, and the one we are talking about now has to do with \nexisting powerplants. Senator Capito has introduced that legislation \nthat would block the Clean Power Plan for existing powerplants from \ngoing into effect. This is dangerous. It is dangerous because we would \nbe throwing out the first rules to reduce carbon pollution for \npowerplants that emit 31 percent of our Nation's total carbon \nemissions. If we are ever going to attack the problem of too much \ncarbon pollution, we have to go to use our powerplant side, and I \ncommend the President for his courage and for doing the right thing.\n  I have heard colleagues say that the process wasn't good. What more \ndo you want? The process used to develop these rules was extremely open \nand inclusive. The EPA met with State officials and a broad range of \nstakeholders. They held 600 meetings for the Clean Power Plan alone. \nHow many more meetings do they want--1,000? The EPA received more than \n6 million comments from the public on both the existing powerplant rule \nand the new powerplant rule.\n  Senator McConnell's resolution to block the standards for new \npowerplants and Senator Capito's resolution, which we are talking about \nnow, to block the Clean Power Plan would not only toss out these \nextensive outreach efforts, but the hubris of this is that this \nresolution would prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from ever \nundertaking similar rulemakings, leaving no plan in place to address \ncarbon pollution from this source. Let me repeat that. Not only does \nthis resolution toss out this rule that would clean our skies, but they \nsay that we can never do it again. This is an attack on the American \npeople.\n  I remind my colleagues that the EPA is setting these carbon pollution \nstandards not because they decided one day to go after the coal \ncompanies. They did not. They are doing it because under the Clean Air \nAct, they have to do it. It is an authority they have that has been \nconfirmed by the Supreme Court. I don't know if my colleagues want to \nhear this, but I am sorry, because I will repeat it: In the \nMassachusetts v. EPA case, the Supreme Court found very clearly that \ncarbon pollution is covered under the Clean Air Act. George W. Bush \nfought it for 8 years. He fought it for 8 years, but the Supreme Court \nwrote the following in their decision: ``Because greenhouse gases fit \nwell within the Clean Air Act's capacious definition of `air \npollutant,' we hold that EPA has the statutory authority to regulate \nthe emissions of such gasses.''\n  All that talk about how the EPA is overreaching and that carbon isn't \ndangerous and you don't have to fix it is so much baloney. The Court \nfound it straightforwardly in Massachusetts v. EPA in 2007. Following \nthat decision, the Obama administration issued an endangerment finding \nshowing that current and future concentrations of carbon pollution are \nharmful to public health and welfare.\n\n[[Page S7982]]\n\n  Once that decision is made, we have to act. We can't make believe \nthis planet isn't endangered. We can't make believe pollution from \npowerplants does not cause problems for our people. We have to act. The \nadministration is well within its rights. If they did not act, they \nwould be sued, and they would lose because they have to protect the \npeople from too much carbon pollution. It is required under the Clean \nAir Act and was sustained by the Supreme Court in 2007. Not only do the \nRepublicans oppose standards for old plants, but they even oppose \nstandards for newly constructed plants. Both of these resolutions--both \nof them--are harmful to public health and the environment, and many \ngroups oppose them.\n\n  So I am going to show my colleagues some of the groups that oppose \nthis Republican resolution, and America can decide whom it wants to \nstand with. The Republicans want to overturn the Clean Air Act rule, or \nthese people.\n  How about public health groups--the Allergy and Asthma Network, the \nAmerican Lung Association, the Public Health Association, the Thoracic \nSociety, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, Children's \nEnvironmental Health Network, Health Care Without Harm, Trust for \nAmerica's Health. That is as American as apple pie. These are the \npeople who stand up and protect our health and the health of our \nfamilies. Whom do we want to stand with--the Republicans, who are \npushing this on us on a day when we should be making America safe from \nthe terrorists, or these groups?\n  Business groups: the American Sustainable Business Council, Business \nfor Innovative Climate and Energy Policy, and Environmental \nEntrepreneurs.\n  Consumer groups: Center for Accessible Technology, Citizens Action \nCoalition, Greenlining Institute, National Consumer Law Center, Ohio \nPartners for Affordable Energy, Public Citizen, TURN, the Utility \nReform Network, Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, the Washington \nState Community Action Partnership, and A World Institute for a \nSustainable Humanity.\n  Latino groups--why do they care? Because a lot of times they live in \ncommunities that suffer from filthy air. The abc Foundation Green \nForum, Citizens Energy, the City Project, Common Ground for \nConservation/America. There are more Latino groups. It goes on an on: \nEmerald Cities Collaborative, GreenLatinos, Ideas For Us, Latino \nCoalition for a Healthy California, National Hispanic Medical \nAssociation, National Latino Evangelical Coalition, solar Four.\n  I will just mention a few environmental groups: Alliance of Nurses \nfor Healthy Environments.\n  Could I just say, if we were to ask people ``Whom do you trust more--\nthe Senate or the nurses?'' dare I say the results? I would guess it \nwould be 99 percent in favor of nurses as opposed to us. And why don't \nwe listen to them? They don't want to see these rules overturned.\n  Appalachian Voices, Arkansas Public Policy Panel, Center for \nBiological Diversity, Clean Air Task Force, Clean Water Action, Climate \nParents, Conservation Voters for Idaho, Conservation Voters for South \nCarolina, Defenders of Wildlife, Earth Justice, Elders Climate Action, \nEnvironment America and 24 State affiliates, and Environmental \nAdvocates of New York. It goes on.\n  These groups whose names I am reading oppose this action by my \nRepublican friends because they want clean air, they want to protect \ntheir families, and they want to fight climate change.\n  Environmental Justice Leadership Forum, Environmental Law Policy \nCenter, Health Care Without Harm, Interfaith Power & Light and 28 State \naffiliates, League of Conservation Voters and 7 State affiliates, Maine \nConservation Voters, Montana Environmental Information Center, Natural \nResources Defense Council, New Virginia Majority, PDA Tucson, \nPennEnvironment, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Protect Our \nWinters, Rachel Carson Council, Sierra Club, Southern Environmental Law \nCenter, Southern Oregon Climate Action Now, Union of Concerned \nScientists, Virginia Organizing, Voices for Progress, Western \nOrganization of Resource Councils, Wisconsin Environment, World \nWildlife Fund.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of groups that \noppose this rule change be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Groups That Oppose S.J.

So we can see clearly--and I think the letter from the \nAmerican Sustainable Business Council makes a very important statement:\n\n       History shows that smart clean energy policies are good for \n     our environment, our economy, and business. We urge you . . . \n     to oppose both resolutions to disapprove the established \n     safeguards.\n\n  Another letter from many of these leading public health \norganizations--quote:\n\n       Please make your priority the health of your constituents \n     and vote No on these Congressional Review Act resolutions. . \n     . .\n\n  I find it very hard to comprehend that a majority of this Senate, led \nby my Republican friends, would side with the special interests above \nthe people who simply want to breathe clean air, who simply want to see \nus dedicated to the fight against climate change.\n  These groups understand the importance of taking action to reduce \ncarbon pollution. When we reduce that dangerous pollution from \npowerplants, the Clean Power Plan will deliver important health \nbenefits.\n  This is what I hope the American people will understand. This is \nscience. By the year 2030, if we defeat this Republican effort, here is \nwhat will happen to our communities: We will prevent up to 3,600 \npremature deaths, we will prevent up to 1,700 heart attacks, we will \nprevent up to 90,000 asthma attacks in children, and we will prevent\n\n[[Page S7983]]\n\n300,000 missed workdays and schooldays.\n  Why on Earth does anyone want to vote to repeal a rule that will \nprevent 3,600 premature deaths, 1,700 heart attacks, 90,000 asthma \nattacks, and 300,000 missed workdays and schooldays? Why? The answer is \nspecial economic interests. That is the answer. It is a disgrace, a \ntotal and complete disgrace. We should be fighting for our families, \nnot for the special interests. These are the cobenefits of reducing \ncarbon. A lot of times we will hear my colleagues say: Carbon isn't \ndangerous. We breathe it out. It is not dangerous. The fact is, when we \nmake these improvements to the powerplants to reduce carbon pollution, \nthere are cobenefits. These are the cobenefits. They are, in fact, \narticulated.\n  The Clean Power Plan will cut emissions from existing plants 32 \npercent below 2012 levels by 2030.\n  The other thing is it is going to save $85 a year on utility bills. \nSo everyone who says that this is terrible and that it is going to \nraise our energy bills doesn't know the facts.\n  The Clean Power Plan also includes help to low-income Americans \nthrough the Clean Energy Incentive Program, which prioritizes early \ninvestment in energy efficiency projects in low-income communities. So \nif we reduce our use of energy because we are conserving energy, we are \nusing less energy, we are cleaning the environment, and our bills go \ndown. That is what we call low-hanging fruit--conservation.\n  The American people support efforts to reduce dangerous carbon \npollution. According to a League of Conservation Voters poll in August, \n60 percent of voters support the Clean Power Plan, while just 31 \npercent oppose it.\n  So I have to ask my colleagues, my friends whom I constantly fight \nwith on this, why do you side with the special interests against the \npeople--the people who will benefit from longer lives, fewer sick days, \nfewer schooldays lost, and fewer asthma attacks? Why? And why do you \nturn against 60 percent of the voters who support the Clean Power Plan? \nThe only answer I can come up with is they are not really thinking \nabout the majority of the American people; they are thinking about the \nspecial interests who call here all the time and push us to do things \nto help them.\n  There was another report in January of 2015 by Stanford University. \nWe have all heard of Stanford University. It is pretty well thought of. \nA lot of my colleagues went there and graduated from there. The \nStanford University poll found that 83 percent of Americans, including \n61 percent of Republicans, say that if nothing is done to reduce \nemissions, climate change will be a serious problem in the future. It \nalso found that 74 percent of Americans say the Federal Government \nshould take substantial steps to combat climate change.\n  Look, all of this furor against these rules doesn't go with the \nAmerican people; it goes against where the American people are. As I \nsaid, 83 percent of Americans, including 61 percent of Republicans, say \nreduce these emissions. We have to stop climate change. We already see \nthe ravages around us. We already see climate refugees. We already see \nextreme weather. It is destabilizing. It is dangerous.\n  According to the same poll, 74 percent of Americans say the Federal \nGovernment should be taking substantial steps to combat climate change. \nYes, the President has listened and he has put forward these rules that \nare substantial steps because the emissions come from these \npowerplants--31 percent of the carbon emissions. So instead of just \nstanding up here and demagoguing and saying this is horrible and \nfrightening the American people, why not join hands with us and do this \nright?\n  My State is a leader in clean energy. We are creating jobs hand over \nfist. We are doing great in California because we care about climate \nand we care about jobs, and those things go hand in hand. When we \ninstall a solar rooftop, we can't outsource that job, we have to hire \nsomeone in our State. That is why we have so much strong support in our \nState, because we see the results of pushing forward aggressively for \nclean energy. People are happy about it. They are proud of it. They are \ndoing well. Climate change is real.\n  We have to take reasonable steps to reduce carbon pollution, as with \nthe Clean Power Plan. And all we see from our Republican friends, God \nbless them--I am very close with a lot of them--is attack after attack \nafter attack on the environment, attacks against the Clean Water Act, \nattacks against the Clean Air Act, attacks against the Safe Drinking \nWater Act.\n  These resolutions that are coming before us ignore the long and \nsuccessful history of the Clean Air Act. We heard the same arguments \nagainst the original Clean Air Act that we are hearing today. In the 40 \nyears since the Clean Air Act was enacted, our GDP--our gross domestic \nproduct--has risen not 100 percent but 207 percent. If we go back to \nthose debates--and I have gone back to them--we would hear the very \nsame voices coming from the very same side of the aisle decrying the \nClean Air Act: Oh, this is going to be a disaster. Well, it not only \nwasn't a disaster, it was a resounding success. And where we export our \nideas to the world, clean energy is an area where we are exporting \nthose ideas.\n  Supporting the Clean Air Act makes good fiscal sense. The benefits of \nthis landmark law, the Clean Air Act, amount to more than 40 times the \ncost of regulation. Let me say that again. For every dollar we have \nspent complying with the Clean Air Act, we have gotten more than $40 of \nbenefits in return.\n  As I mentioned, my State--I am so very proud of it--we are on a path \nto meet or exceed our goals of reducing climate pollution to 1990 \nlevels by 2020, just 5 years from now. That is required in our State--\nAB 32. By the way, Big Oil and big polluters tried to overturn it on \nthe ballot, and the people said: Go home. We are happy. We like this. \nWe embrace it. And they turned back the millions of dollars spent by \nBig Dirty Oil, and we won. Clean air won.\n  We are on the path to achieving our ultimate goal of reducing \nemissions by 80 percent by 2050. Imagine. During the first year and a \nhalf of my State's carbon reduction program called cap and trade, we \nadded 491,000 jobs. So all this fearmongering about jobs lost is so \nmuch fearmongering because, guess what, look at my State--491,000 jobs \nadded. And that job creation actually outpaces the national growth rate \nof jobs. California has been a leader in reducing its carbon footprint, \nand the United States must take steps to address this threat.\n  I am just going to go back and read to my colleagues the main \nprediction of mainstream scientists made many years ago about what \nwould happen if we weren't aggressive on climate.\n  One, temperature extremes, they said, would be more frequent. NOAA \nscientists predicted that 2015 would be the hottest year since \nrecordkeeping began and it will displace 2014. So the first prediction \nby the scientists that temperature extremes would be more frequent has \nbeen proven true--2015 will be the highest year on record, and before \nthat 2014 was the hottest year on record.\n  Secondly, they told us when I took over the chair of the EPW \ncommittee--which I regretted having to hand over the gavel to my friend \nSenator Inhofe, but I did hold it for about 6 years, if my memory is \ncorrect. A little over 6 years I had the gavel, but who is counting. \nThe fact is, we called the scientists before the committee. They said \ntemperature extremes would be more frequent. That has proven out. They \nsaid heat waves would be more frequent. That has proven out. They said \nareas affected by drought will increase, and Lord knows the West knows \nthat has been proven. Wildfires would be bigger and more frequent, they \nsaid. We know in the West that is true. Tropical storms and hurricanes \nwill be more intense. Just ask New Jersey and New York. There will be \nmore heavy precipitation and flooding events. We have seen that with \nour own eyes. We have seen cars floating down the streets in Texas. \nPolar sea ice will shrink. That is a fact. Sea levels will rise. That \nis a fact. All of these predictions by climate experts have become a \nreality today.\n  So I ask my friends, Why are you willing to gamble? Why are you \nwilling to take this gamble and walk away from trying to reduce the \nravages of climate change? That is immoral in the face of what we know \nfrom the scientists and with what we know from reality in the States. \nWe see all the predictions coming true. The fact is\n\n[[Page S7984]]\n\nthat climate change endangers the health of our families and our \nplanet. We cannot delay action to reduce carbon pollution.\n  I thank President Obama for his leadership on this critical issue. \nThese rules are an essential element of the leadership on climate \nchange. There is no doubt about it. At the end of this month President \nObama and other leaders will gather to reach an agreement on how all of \nthe nations will work to reduce carbon pollution that is causing \nclimate change. Nearly 160 nations have reduced their plans.\n  I ask my Republican colleagues that if you don't like President \nObama's plan, don't just repeal it, tell us how you would reduce \nharmful carbon pollution. Tell us how you are going to save all these \nlives. Tell us how. Explain to us how you are going to prevent 3,600 \npremature deaths, 1,700 heart attacks, 90,000 asthma attacks in kids, \nand 300,000 missed workdays and schooldays. Where is your plan? Don't \njust get up there and say it is going to cost more for electricity, \nbecause the fact is, we have a special part of this rule that addresses \nthe costs and will actually save money for consumers because we will \npush the low-hanging fruit of energy efficiency.\n  These resolutions will take us backward, prevent us from acting to \navert the worst impacts of climate. This Republican initiative is going \nto endanger the health of millions of our children and families from \ndangerous carbon pollution and will stop the cobenefits to them from \ngoing into effect.\n  I know we are going to have a robust debate. As I said at the start, \nI think we ought to be debating the omnibus budget agreement. I think \nwe ought to be debating how to keep America safe from the terrorists \ninstead of figuring out ways to repeal a law that if you are \nsuccessful, will in fact mean adverse health consequences for our \npeople. We should be debating how to keep America safe today. We are \nnot debating that. I am very sorry about that, and I agree with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle who say they know the end result \nof this. Yes, there is a majority of people here who are going to vote \nto repeal these clean power rules. We know that. Yes, we know that will \ngo to the President and, yes, we know the President will veto that and, \nyes, we know when that comes back we are going to sustain the \nPresident. We know the outcome.\n  Why not get to work on keeping America safe? Go to this omnibus \nbudget resolution, look throughout the budget and see ways we can make \nsure our people are kept safe from terrorists and, for goodness' sake, \nwhile we are at it, keep them safe from pollution. That is something we \nhave in our hands. What is before us today will not keep them safe from \npollution, and I look forward to this being rejected at the end of the \nday.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                    Terrorist Attacks Against France\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I do agree we should be debating what is \nhappening in the world, particularly on the issue of ISIS and its \nimpact not only on America, not only on Europe but on the world, and \nthat is what I intend to do.\n  We have all witnessed the horrific attacks in Paris and this \nunprecedented form of evil that we have seen disrupt the lives of free \npeople. All Americans--Republicans, Democrats, Independents--all \nAmericans stand in solidarity with Paris and the French people. This \nisn't just an attack on Paris. This is an attack on the free world, the \ncivilized world.\n  Don't just take my word for this conclusion because ISIS has already \nmade such a declaration; that is, we are coming after you. We are \ncoming after all those who don't abide by our messianic message of our \npurpose in the world to destroy you because you don't agree with us.\n  Sadly, the tragedy we have seen in Paris reinforces that the battle \nagainst terrorism and extremism will not only be fought in the Middle \nEast. The United States and Western nations are dealing with escalating \nsecurity challenges that cannot be resolved through diplomacy and are \nnot being resolved by the current strategy of this White House.\n  A headline today in the Wall Street Journal is: ``Pressure Grows for \nGlobal Response.'' We, the United States, need to show the world that \nthreats to our principal freedoms are entirely unacceptable. \nUnfortunately, President Obama continues to fail to provide the \nAmerican people with the leadership we so desperately need.\n  Consider his response yesterday to the tragic events in Paris versus \nthe response of the French President. The French President, Francois \nHollande, said: France is at war. We are in a war against jihadist \nterrorism, which is threatening the entire world.\n  I want to repeat that: France is at war. We are in a war against \njihadist terrorism, which is threatening the whole world.\n  Virtually at the same time, President Obama, in a shockingly \ndismissive tone, doubled down on his so-called strategy to deal with \nthis global threat. What has his strategy to date accomplished? Well, \nISIS has expanded into more than half a dozen countries. They are not \ncontained as the President said. Ask the people in Paris if ISIS is \ncontained. Ask the people who have been subjected to attacks inspired \nby ISIS across the world: Is ISIS contained? I don't think so.\n  Time after time, the President has shown he simply doesn't get it. In \n2012, he boasted Al-Qaeda was on the path to defeat. In 2014, he \ndismissed the Islamic State as the ``JV team,'' saying that ISIS ``is \nnot a direct threat to us nor something that we have to wade into.'' \nLast Thursday he said, ``I don't think [the Islamic State] is gaining \nstrength'' and saying ``we have contained them.''\n  What will it take for this President to wake up and see what is \nhappening around the world as a result of the ever-expanding threat of \nISIS terrorism? The President did say yesterday that if people have \nother ideas to bring them forward. So what I would like to do is offer \na few suggestions for the President to consider. In fact, I actually \nbrought forward suggestions over a year ago, but of course none of them \nhave been accepted or acted upon by the President that I am aware of.\n  When I first addressed this subject in the summer of 2014, I outlined \nseveral areas in which urgent action was required. First, and more \nimportant, I called for the administration immediately to articulate a \ncomprehensive plan to defeat ISIS. We have a problem out there. Put a \nplan together to address the problem and do it in a comprehensive way \nso we have a goal to achieve and a strategy to work out to achieve that \ngoal. This comprehensive plan has been entirely absent from this \nCongress and from the American people. What we have seen instead are \nincremental responses--responses that contradict what the President had \nearlier said--to events that have taken place behind the curve, not \nahead of the curve, too little and too late. I called for efforts to \nreach out to nations across the globe to work together to defeat ISIS, \nincluding working with Islamic states and communities to oppose this \noutrageous ISIS perversion of the Islamic faith.\n  I want to say that, again, for those who simply say this is a \ndecision that affects America only, all we are calling for are our \nboots on the ground, that is entirely wrong. The President should know \nit, and I think he does know it. I, among many, have called for efforts \nto reach out to nations across the globe to work together to defeat \nISIS, including working with Islamic states and communities to oppose \nthe outrageous ISIS perversion of the Islamic faith.\n  I called for a diplomatic effort to persuade Saudi Arabia, Turkey, \nQatar, and other regions to join with us to resist more forcefully ISIS \naggression. Last year I called for much greater security assistance for \nour potential partners in the fight against ISIS. The United States \nshould move quickly to provide more arms, training, and other requested \nassistance to Iraqi Kurdistan's Peshmerga forces--proven fighters who \nare willing to stand up and confront ISIS. They needed our support. \nThey needed weapons from us. They needed training and guidance from us, \nbut they were ready to engage in the fight. I said we also needed to \nfind effective ways to support and directly arm the reliable, vetted \nSunni tribes and Sunni leaders in Iraq who are essential partners in \ncombatting ISIS extremism that ultimately are Sunni Islam's greatest \nthreat.\n\n[[Page S7985]]\n\n  It is true, the question of where have they been, where are they. We \nneed more than just sending a check to cover payment for somebody else \nto fight a proxy war. We need their engagement. They are in the \ncrosshairs of ISIS. Why haven't they stepped up? Where is the flocking \nto the center square of town saying enough is enough? Where are the \nimams saying that this is a perversion of our religion? Where are the \npeople in the crosshairs of ISIS simply rising up together and saying \nwe need to address this?\n  As I said, we also need to find effective ways to support the Sunni \ntribes and Sunni leaders. Those efforts have been slow, indirect, and \ninsufficient. I called for us to provide lethal assistance to the Free \nSyrian Army. The administration's effort in this regard was an absurd \n$500 million, multiyear effort to train and arm 40 fighters, most of \nwhom were promptly killed or captured. Yes, I called for increased \nspecialized military action by our own Armed Forces. I, with many \nothers, am willing to stand here and say enough. I have called for \nincreased specialized military action by our own Armed Forces--\nintelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and special forces--not a \nmassive invasion. This has to be a global effort, as I just talked \nabout. It has to include Sunni nations. It has to include Muslims who \nbelieve their faith and their culture is being brutally perverted by \nISIS.\n  It is clear ISIS cannot be defeated without U.S. participation. \nNations of the world look to the United States to either have their \nbacks or to work with them to stand side by side. We have capabilities \nand capacity that other nations don't have. Coalitions cannot be formed \nwithout our engagement. Our bombing campaign--this strategy of bombing \nagainst ISIS targets--has been far from adequate. There have been an \naverage of just a handful a day, many of which have planes turning \naround and landing back at the airfield with bombs still attached to \ntheir wings because they simply haven't had the kind of targeting and \ndirecting to ensure that the rules of combat are confirmed.\n  Contrast this anemic bombing campaign with the bombing campaign \nbefore the first Gulf War, which was several thousand sorties a day. In \nBosnia it was several hundred a day. Clearly, our anemic air strategy \nis not defeating ISIS. Frankly, military history shows that air action \nonly cannot achieve the goal of defeating an enemy.\n  Lastly, I called on the Obama administration and Congress to reassess \nour border security and do whatever is necessary to make us stronger. \nOne element of that effort is legislation I introduced earlier this \nyear, a bill that would enact changes to the Visa Waiver Program and \nprovide additional tools to enhance border security--changes that, in \nmy opinion, are absolutely necessary to fill and plug a gaping hole in \nour border security.\n  Let me talk about that for a moment. The current Visa Waiver Program \nallows citizens from several dozen nations to travel to the United \nStates without a visa. They are citizens of these nations. In order to \nexpedite the travel process, we entered into the Visa Waiver Program. \nThat works fine if you don't have a situation like the one that exists \ntoday, with ISIS and other forces--Al-Qaeda and others--trying to bring \npeople into the United States, to plant people here to carry out evil \nacts against American people.\n  My bill would amend the Visa Waiver Program by tightening existing \npre-travel clearance procedures and making them more focused on \ncounterterrorism efforts. We have to now recognize the reality that \nexists here in terms of abuse of the Visa Waiver Program or the \npossibility of abuse and inserting terrorists into the United States.\n  The bill would ensure stricter compliance with information sharing \nagreements by those countries that participate in the Visa Waiver \nProgram and suspend their participation if they do not come into \ncompliance at a 100-percent level. We can't afford any glitches. We \ncannot afford 99 percent. We have to go all the way.\n  The bill would also authorize the Secretary of State to revoke any \npassport issued to a U.S. citizen who is suspected of engaging in \nterrorist activities and would update the definition of ``treason'' to \ninclude support of terrorist organizations.\n  When introducing this, I remember the response: Oh, that is too \ntough. Nothing is too tough these days to keep Americans safe. We need \nto implement these provisions that I introduced many months ago, \nbecause I believe it is a solution that addresses the real and growing \nthreat of terrorist attacks carried out by individuals with Western \npassports.\n  Unfortunately, these things I have mentioned and have introduced \nearlier have not been adopted in any meaningful way. Now, a year and a \nhalf later, we are in a much more difficult position, with ISIS \nstronger and expanded to new areas and new countries. The threat to us \nall is comprehensive, multifaceted, and nearly global. It demands a \nglobal, comprehensive response.\n  So I would urge the President to seriously consider these and other \nproposals, and I would like to mention one other proposal this morning. \nIn addition to what I have previously stated, I believe it is now time \nto consider whether NATO should take on a vital new mission. NATO \nresponded in Bosnia in 1994 and brought about peace. It can do so \nagain.\n  When I served as ambassador to Germany for 4 years, I had direct \ncontact with NATO and NATO nations, and I know the accumulation of \nresources, of training, of capability that is available through NATO, \nand it is a multi-nation, comprehensive coalition. It can play a vital \nrole in dealing with this terrorist threat.\n  We need a comprehensive, realistic, articulate plan if we are going \nto destroy ISIS, and NATO action should be part of that plan, whether \nor not France invokes the article 5 collective defense provision of the \nNATO treaty--which I think they should do, and perhaps they will do--\nwhich requires all NATO nations to come to the support of and do what \nis necessary to address a threat to one of the nations. If one of the \nNATO nations is threatened, we all stand together to deal with it.\n  Former NATO Commander ADM James Stavridis issued his own six-step \nplan for NATO engagement and leadership to destroy ISIS, and we should \nlook at that and take it seriously. He suggests NATO should assign one \nof the major alliance commands to lead the operational planning for \nforceful military efforts against ISIS in both Syria and Iraq and bring \nall the alliance resources to bear. In addition, he suggests our NATO \nallies should be joined in this effort by other nonmember European \nstates, such as Sweden and Finland, which are similarly threatened by \nISIS terrorism. Most importantly, he said NATO must work creatively to \nbring in the regional powers, such as the Kurdish Peshmerga, Saudi \nArabia, and other Arab states in a broad coordinated effort against \nISIS under NATO leadership.\n  This is the mechanism and this is an organization that is trained, \nhas the equipment, has the capability, and can form the coalition \nnecessary with our Arab friends and neighborhoods--the Saudis, the \nSunnis and others--that need to be a part of this if we are going to be \nsuccessful.\n  NATO's efforts against ISIS, Admiral Stavridis says, should also \ninclude assistance to Turkey--after all, Turkey is a NATO member--to \nbetter secure their borders against the flow of jihadists in and out of \nSyria. This is NATO at its best and is something I think should be \nseriously considered by this White House as a way of moving forward to \ndevelop a coalition to address the great threat we are facing.\n  Let me now say one other thing, because Admiral Stavridis also \nsuggests the possibility of forming some type of a coalition with \nRussia. We are seeing a strong Russian response today--last evening--\nonce it was determined and proven the Russian airliner was brought down \nby a bomb and by ISIS. ISIS has taken credit for it, and ISIS will \nreceive the wrath of the Russian military as a result, in direct \ncontrast to what we have done for attempts on our own people.\n  I am not a big fan of Putin. I am not a big fan of the current Russia \ngovernment. I spoke out strongly about Russia's invasion of the Ukraine \nand the annexation of Crimea, and have strongly advocated for Russia's \ndiplomatic isolation. In fact, I so strongly advocated for it that \nRussia put me on a\n\n[[Page S7986]]\n\nlist of seven people who are banned from entering Russia for life. \nWell, I have been to Russia, and I don't need to go back. So it is no \nbig deal. Apparently it was a big deal to them. But now we are facing \nan emergency situation.\n  Russian forces are deployed in Syria. Russian efforts need to be \ncoordinated with NATO efforts, if we go the NATO route. We are already \ncoordinating in terms of some of our flights. As we learned in 1941, \nnational emergencies can create strange bedfellows.\n  Whatever option is considered, the irreducible minimum is real: \ndetermined U.S. leadership. This tragic civil war and escalating \nterrorist threat have continued and grown much too long without an \neffective American response. Oh, yes, we have had a response--mostly \nrhetorical--but clearly a strategy that has not succeeded, and clearly \nsomething that is not deterring ISIS from growing stronger and \nspreading further. It simply has not been effective. So whether it is \nthrough NATO, whether it is through a coalition of the willing, \nvigorous American leadership is absolutely essential for the future of \nall of us.\n  In conclusion, let me say this. In 2014, the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr \nal-Baghdadi, said:\n\n       Our last message is to the Americans: Soon we will be in \n     direct confrontation, and the sons of Islam have prepared for \n     such a day. So watch, for we are with you, watching.\n\n  This is the enemy we are dealing with. This is not some vague threat; \nthis is a direct threat. We have seen how they carry out their direct \nthreats, and we stand in the crosshairs. And, yes, it is very possible \nand probably very true that they are with us here now, watching, \nwaiting, planning, contriving for another Paris, for another Baghdad, \nfor another attack--hopefully none, but something that could be \npossibly much greater than what we saw in Paris. They have created \ntheir homeland in Syria, but they have told us what we don't want to \nhear, but which is probably true, that they are here and they are \nwatching and they are waiting.\n  So the question is, does President Obama grasp what we are up \nagainst? Last year he laid out the goal of defeating ISIS, but \nPresident Obama still has not put forward the comprehensive strategy to \naccomplish that goal, and yesterday he doubled down on the same \npolicies that have led to our current foreign policy failures. The \neffort to defeat ISIS will be successful only with leadership from the \nPresident of the United States. Let me say that again. The effort to \ndefeat ISIS will be successful only with the leadership from the \nPresident of the United States.\n  So, President Obama, as Republicans, as Democrats, as Independents, \nas Americans, we desperately need for you to provide that leadership at \nthis critical time. President Obama, are you up to the job or do we \nhave to wait another year to put a leader in the White House?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, it is a pleasure and privilege to \nfollow the distinguished Senator from Indiana. His concerns for \nnational security are well established, and I enjoy working with him, \nparticularly in the area of cyber security. But I would note, in the \nwake of his eloquent remarks about our national security situation, \nthat we are not here on the floor to discuss national security. We are \nhere on the floor right now because the Republican leadership is taking \na run at the President's Clean Power Plan.\n  Paris has not recovered from the devastation of the other day, and we \nhave important bills that the chairman of the Committee on \nAppropriations has worked very hard on to get ready and that would \nimprove the capacity of our Department of Justice, our FBI, and our \nDepartment of Homeland Security to address this threat. Are we on those \nbills? No. The majority leader has decided we are going to take a run \nat a climate regulation.\n  Now, with ISIS and terrorism being the issue of the day, one might \nthink: OK, I can understand why we are going to climate change. We have \nknown for years that our intelligence community, our defense leaders, \nand the men and women in uniform we count on to protect us have said \nclimate change breeds terrorism. It creates the conditions--the \nQuadrennial Defense Review and the intelligence reports have said--that \nspawn the kind of despair that leads to terrorism. It is a catalyst of \nconflict.\n  So one might say: OK, sure, it makes sense we should address climate \nchange because it is a catalyst for conflict. And we would find \nvoices--I think the distinguished Senator from Indiana mentioned \nAdmiral Stavridis. We love Admiral Stavridis in Rhode Island because he \nhas been associated with the Naval War College. He has said that the \ncascading interests and broad implications stemming from the effects of \nclimate change should cause today's global leaders to take stock, and \nhe has said many other eloquent things on climate change too. But we \nare not here to do something about climate change and help reduce it as \na catalyst of conflict. What the majority leader has brought us here to \ndo is to undo American leadership in this area.\n\n  One might say: OK, they have a better plan. The Republicans have a \nplan they think is better than the Clean Power Plan, and therefore they \nwant to foul up the Clean Power Plan so they can put a clean power plan \nof their own in place. There is no such thing. There is no Republican \nstrategy to deal with climate change. In fact, a majority of my \ncolleagues on that side can't even admit that it is real.\n  So that is where we are. We are on a measure that clearly won't pass \nunder the Congressional Review Act, clearly will go to the President \nand be vetoed and be sustained on the veto. So this will never become \nlaw. It is just a big exercise in time-wasting.\n  While the smoke is still clearing over Paris, we are still engaged in \nthis big exercise in time-wasting. Why? To send a signal. To send a \nsignal to the big coal interests, the big oil interests, the Koch \nbrothers, and the tea partiers that ``We are with you.'' The American \npublic isn't with you. Even Republicans aren't with you. If we look at \nrecent polling, other than the tea party--and by the way, 70 percent in \nthe tea party thinks global warming isn't happening--isn't happening. I \ndon't know whom they are talking to. They are not talking to fishermen \nin my State. They are not talking to foresters out West. They are not \ntalking to farmers in the Midwest. It is happening. We might go further \nas to discussing what to do about it, but the tea party is so \nirresponsible that they think, in a strong majority, it is not even \nhappening. But they are not the ones we should be listening to because \n83 percent of Americans--including 60 percent of Republicans--and by \nthe way, with the November elections coming up, 86 percent of \nIndependents say that if nothing is done to reduce emissions, global \nwarming will be a very or somewhat serious problem in the future. So we \nare now going against what 83 percent of Americans, including 61 \npercent of Republicans and 86 percent of Independents, would direct us \nto do, in order to keep the faith with the big coal and oil and Koch \nbrothers industries that fund so much of this operation here.\n  So 56 percent of Republicans--and 54 percent of conservative \nRepublicans--say that the climate is changing and that mankind is \ncontributing a lot or probably a little to the change. A majority of \nRepublicans now believe there is solid evidence of global warming--\nagain, 56 percent. When we look at young Republicans, this is where it \ngets very interesting. Young Republicans--under the age of 35--think \nclimate denial by politicians in Congress is ``ignorant, out of touch \nor crazy.'' That is where young Republicans are on this.\n  Yet the majority leader has brought us here to interrupt any \nconversation we might be having over national security, slowing down \nany progress on the domestic security appropriations bills that might \ngo forward, against the interests of young Republicans and everybody \nelse virtually across the country, all to help out Big Coal, Big Oil, \nthe Koch brothers, and to cater to this small, little tea party \ncontingent, 70 percent of whom don't even believe climate change is \nhappening. There is a point where you can't take views seriously. \nFrankly, if this group by 70 percent thinks it is not even happening, \nthere is a point where we have to say: Run along, fellows; we want to \nplay with the grownups here who understand what is going on.\n  So here we are on this bill. I will say that I like to do a little \nresearch when\n\n[[Page S7987]]\n\nthere is somebody speaking on the Senate floor. I thought the Senator \nfrom Indiana was going to talk about climate change, so I did home \nState Indiana, university, and climate change, to see what comes up. \nWhat came up was an article published by the University of Indiana that \nsays ``Indiana University experts comment on climate change report.'' \nThat is the headline. The No. 1 lead under it is ``Changing climate \nwill affect Midwest crops, forests, public health.'' That is the lead, \nIndiana University. The second lead is ``Report signals need to move \naway from fossil fuels.'' So they get it at the University of Indiana.\n  Here is the quote: ``Climate change, once thought to be a problem for \nfuture generations, `has moved firmly into the present. . . . ' '' That \nwas an article from May 6, 2014, more than a year ago, and still we are \non the floor fighting about vain and doomed-to-failure efforts to \nattack the only climate change plan that is out there.\n  I invite my Republican colleagues: If you have a better plan than the \nclimate plan the President has put forward, let's hear it. But I am \nhere to say they have nothing--nothing--zero. So bring up that subject \nif you want. Highlight for the American people that this is a party in \ntow to coal and oil and Koch brothers' interests. Highlight for the \nAmerican people that you are running in direct opposition to what the \nAmerican people believe, to what even young Republicans believe. I \ndon't get it, but have fun with it.\n  The last thing I will mention is this. I am from the Ocean State. I \nam about to be followed by my distinguished colleague and friend from \nWyoming. Rhode Island has a little bit of a different situation. We are \non the ocean. This denial business really doesn't work for us. We can \ngo down to Narragansett Bay and measure that the bay is 3 to 4 degrees \nwarmer, mean water temperature, than it was 30 years ago. That is not \njust a statistic; that signals the end of the winter flounder fishery \nin Rhode Island. We used to catch winter flounder. It was a robust \ncrop. It is gone, more than 90 percent wiped out, largely because that \nwarming has changed the ecosystem in which the winter flounders grew. \nSo it is gone. We paid a price for that.\n  We can go to Naval Station Newport and look at the tide gauge. It is \nup 10 inches since the hurricane of 1938 came through. Google \n``Hurricane of 1938, Rhode Island.'' Take a look at the images. We got \nsmashed by that hurricane, and now there are 10 inches more water that \ncan stack up with storm surge into an even bigger cocked fist against \nmy State. That is directly related to the warming oceans--unless \nsomebody wants to repeal the law of thermal expansion around here. But \nI don't think we get to do that in the Senate. That is one of God's \nlaws. That is one of the laws of nature.\n  So our seas are warming, and our seas are rising. We have virtually \nlost our winter flounder fishery. We are losing our lobster fishery. We \nare getting clobbered, and we can't deny this stuff. The effect carbon \nhas on the oceans can be replicated in a high school science lab. Ramp \nup the carbon dioxide in saltwater and seawater and it turns acidic. \nThe ocean is turning acidic at the fastest rate ever since humankind \nhas been on this planet.\n  Go to the western coast and look at a little tiny sea snail called \nthe pteropod, the sea butterfly. God's evolution has metamorphosed this \nlittle snail to having a foot that is actually a wing that swims it \nthrough the ocean. It is one of the core species. If we had good ocean \nsense here, everybody would know what a pteropod was. It is all over \nthe place. It is a huge food source. It is the bottom floor of the food \npyramid.\n  In the study just done, more than 50 percent of the pteropods in the \nPacific from California north had severe shell damage--more than half \nof the species had severe shell damage from acidification of those \nseas. People in Oregon and Washington have had their oyster farms wiped \nout as the acidified water came in and ate away the shells of these \nlittle creatures. You do not survive long in an environment in which \nyou are soluble, and that is the predicament we are creating for these \nof God's species.\n  Pope Francis said something very simple: We don't have that right. We \ndon't have that right. Those pteropods aren't this generation's \nspecies. They are God's species. They are the Earth's species. It is \nnot for us to tell our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren: We \ndon't care. Go ahead, die right out. We are going to protect our big \nindustry friends. That is just wrong.\n  We should not be on this bill. This is a time-waster. This is a \ndisgrace. This has no business being here. The American people know \nbetter, and that may be the reason we are trying to get off it as \nquickly as we can. But I am here to say it is not enough to get off \ntrying to knock down our one plan for dealing with climate change; we \nought to be thinking about how we enhance wind and solar in Texas, wind \nand solar in Wyoming, protect the great forests of this country, \nprotect the great shores of this country, and protect the species \noffshore. We are changing their world on them by making the oceans more \nacidic than they have been in the lifetime of our species.\n  I know the Senator from Wyoming is here to rebut everything I have \nsaid, but he has that right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for 10 minutes, followed by Senator Shaheen for 10 minutes, \nSenator Cornyn for 10 minutes, Senator Nelson for 10 minutes, and \nfinally Senator Manchin for 10 minutes; that following Senator \nManchin's remarks, the Senate recess until 2:15 p.m. for the weekly \nconference meetings, and that the time in recess count against the \nmajority time on the CRA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, it is fascinating to listen to my \ncolleague and friend from Rhode Island because I have the National \nJournal Daily printed today. It has back-to-back pages talking about \nthe terror, the horror in Paris. Obviously the thoughts and heartfelt \ncondolences of the people of this country continue to go out to our \nfriends in France, who have stood by us, and we will stand by them.\n  One page talks about how President Obama has continued to \nunderestimate ISIS. This is in today's paper, quoting President Obama, \nsaying: ``The analogy we use around here sometimes, and I think is \naccurate, is if a JV team puts on Lakers uniforms, that doesn't make \nthem Kobe Bryant.''\n  The President has continued to underestimate ISIS.\n  The other side of the page: ``ISIS vs. Climate Change.'' It talks \nabout the Democratic debate Saturday night--national television--after \nthe tragic events in Paris the night before. The moderator asked one of \nthe leading Democrats running for President--running second in the \npolls now--if that candidate had a chance to back off on his claims \nthat climate change is the greatest security threat facing the country. \nThat candidate said: ``In fact, climate change is directly related to \nthe growth of terrorism.'' That is the position I just heard from the \nSenator from Rhode Island. It is a position we hear from a leading \ncandidate for President on the Democratic side of the aisle. I would \nwonder how many Americans believe that who--if they heard that \nstatement, believe that is true.\n  That is why I come to the floor today to talk about President Obama's \nplans--his plans to tear down the American energy reliability, American \nenergy stability, things that are important for our national security, \nbecause he wants to remake energy into a form he prefers. The President \nhas a strategy to do it. He has made it clear. He said that when he was \nrunning for President in 2008. He bragged that his plan--he said if it \nwent through, that ``electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket.'' \nAnd ever since then, President Obama has been pushing to make that \nhappen, even though he couldn't get it passed. When he tried to get \npart of his plan through Congress, even the Democrats rejected it. They \nknew that the American people didn't want it and that the American \neconomy couldn't afford it.\n  Did President Obama listen to the American people? Absolutely not. \nDid he accept the overwhelming judgment of Congress--a bipartisan \napproach--\n\n[[Page S7988]]\n\nthat his extreme attacks on American energy were a bad idea? No, he \ndidn't listen to that, either. The President is much more interested in \nthe opinion of far-left, extreme environmentalists than he is in the \nopinion of hard-working Americans. He has done everything he can to \ngive his plans the effect of law without asking Congress to actually \npass them as laws. He has had his Environmental Protection Agency draw \nup regulations--regulations that would shut down American energy \nproducers and damage our own economy. That is what the President's own \nEnergy Information Administration has said. The agency put out a \nreport--a report that found that the EPA's new rule on carbon dioxide \nemissions would close coal-fired powerplants, would raise electricity \nprices, and would reduce the gross domestic product of our Nation.\n  That is just one of many rules this administration has been pushing \ninto force without legal support. Every one of these rules will mean \nhard-working Americans will lose their jobs and hard-working families \nwill be paying higher electric bills. Put it all together, and the \nprice tag could reach hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  Who is asking President Obama to do this? Who is asking to pay more \nin their electric bill every month? People don't want it, and the \nPresident doesn't have the authority to do it. That is why he is not \nasking Congress to weigh in on his plans. That is why he is pushing \nthese rules by unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats instead of going to \nthe people and their representatives. The American people do have a \nvoice, and they are making their voice heard through us today.\n  We are here talking about two rules in particular. These are the \nrestrictions on existing powerplants and on new powerplants, plants \nthat haven't even been built yet. These are the core of what the \nPresident calls his Clean Power Plan.\n  We are here to say today that these rules go too far. The Obama \nadministration has tried this before. It has pushed through other \nregulations that people didn't want and can't afford. The \nadministration has said that it gets to decide what is best, that it \ngets to decide what people should do. The courts legitimately have \nsaid: not so fast.\n  This summer, the Supreme Court rejected a different EPA rule because \nthe administration never bothered--this is what the Court said--to take \ninto account the costs of the rule. The Supreme Court said: ``One would \nnot say that it is even rational''--this is the Supreme Court talking \nabout the President's rules; it isn't even rational--``never mind \n`appropriate,' to impose billions of dollars of economic costs in \nreturn for a few dollars in health or environmental benefits.''\n  Two courts have blocked the EPA's rule on waters of the United \nStates. One of the courts said that the rule was likely the result of \n``a process that is inexplicable, arbitrary, and devoid of a reasoned \nprocess.''\n  All of these rules are suffering from the same kinds of problems. The \nObama administration, once again, has been acting far beyond its own \nauthority and far beyond anything that is rational or appropriate for \nour Nation. The same day that President Obama put out the new rule on \nhis so-called Clean Power Plan, 26 States filed lawsuits in Federal \ncourt to stop the disastrous rule. Twenty-three States sued to block \nthe rule on new powerplants. Twenty-seven States have sued to block the \nrule on existing powerplants. I believe these States are going to win \nin court because the rules are so extreme and this administration is so \nout of control.\n  President Obama doesn't really care about any of that. He thinks he \nstill wins even when he loses in court. He thinks if he can drag it out \nlong enough, businesses will have to spend the money and comply anyway.\n  That is actually what the President's EPA chief said before the last \nregulation got rejected by the Supreme Court. She went on television a \nfew days before the decision and said that it didn't matter what the \nSupreme Court said. She said that it didn't matter if the \nadministration loses because the rule has already been in place for 3 \nyears.\n  That is exactly what the Obama administration is counting on this \ntime as well. That is why it is so important that Congress act today to \nblock these rules from taking effect. We are debating the two measures \nthat will do that. The measure by Senator McConnell and Senator \nManchin--this is bipartisan--would block the rule for new powerplants, \nand the second measure by Senator Capito and Senator Heitkamp--again, a \nRepublican and Democrat working together--would block the rule for \nexisting powerplants.\n  These are bipartisan resolutions of disapproval under the \nCongressional Review Act. They are our chance for Congress to stand up \nfor the people that we represent. America can't afford these illegal \nrules to go into effect and be there for 3 years before the Court \ntosses them out.\n  There is another reason that Congress needs to vote to strike down \nthese expensive, burdensome regulations immediately. Later this month, \nthe President will be participating in the international talks on \nclimate change. This is a meeting of about 200 countries from around \nthe world to limit the amount of carbon dioxide and other emissions \nthat each country can produce.\n  The President desperately wants his so-called Clean Power Plan so \npeople will say he is leading on the issue. Without these illegal \nregulations, he has nothing to offer. Congress needs to make clear that \nthe American people do not support these regulations. Foreign diplomats \nat the climate conference need to understand that these rules will not \nstand up in court.\n  President Obama's ego is writing checks that his administration can't \ncash. Any climate deal based on these flawed rules is simply not worth \nthe paper it is printed on. It is time for President Obama to be honest \nabout what he can and cannot do. If he will not admit that, then \nCongress is going to have to make it clear so that everyone \nunderstands. The American people do have a voice. They will not allow \nthese reckless and destructive regulations to shut down American energy \nproduction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nClean Power Plan and against the efforts by the majority to undermine \nthe plan. The Clean Power Plan is vital to the environmental and \neconomic well-being of both New Hampshire and this country. It is an \nimportant and historic step that will mitigate the effects of climate \nchange by reducing carbon pollution from our Nation's dirtiest \npowerplants.\n  Powerplants account for nearly 40 percent of all U.S. carbon \nemissions. That is more than every car, every truck, and every plane in \nthe United States combined. If we are to be successful in addressing \nclimate change, we have to reduce the amount of pollution that is \ncoming from this sector, and we cannot delay.\n  My home State of New Hampshire is doing its part to reduce carbon \nemissions by making smart investments in renewable energy and energy \nefficiency, but we do need a Federal plan to make sure our country \nmoves forward together.\n  As Senator Whitehouse and Senator Boxer have said so eloquently, the \nverdict on climate change is in. It is a reality that must be \naddressed. Study after study reinforces the overwhelming consensus that \nglobal temperatures are steadily rising and contributing to more \nextreme weather events and changes in our environment.\n  We are seeing that firsthand in New Hampshire, where climate records \nshow a steady increase in yearly temperatures and annual precipitation \namounts continue to grow. As a result, climate change is affecting New \nHampshire's tourism and outdoor recreation economy, which are really so \nimportant to our State. Tourism is the second largest industry in New \nHampshire. Each year hundreds of thousands of sportsmen and wildlife \nwatchers come to New Hampshire to enjoy our natural resources. Hunting, \nfishing, and outdoor recreation contribute nearly $4.2 billion to the \nNew Hampshire economy each year. But rising temperatures are affecting \nour fall foliage season, which has just ended. We are seeing fewer snow \ndays, which impacts skiing and snowmobiling, and ice\n\n[[Page S7989]]\n\nout on our lakes is happening earlier each year.\n  We heard Senator Whitehouse talking about the impact on fisheries in \nRhode Island. We have seen that in New Hampshire as well, where cod \nstocks in the North Atlantic and the Gulf of Maine have been reduced so \nprecipitously that it has devastated New Hampshire's fishing industry.\n  We are also seeing changes in our State's maple syrup industry. New \nHampshire produces more than 100,000 gallons of maple syrup annually. \nIt is the third largest maple producer in the New England States. Maple \nsyrup production is entirely dependent on weather conditions. Any \nchange, no matter how slight, can throw off production and endanger the \nindustry. Trees require warm days and cold nights to create the optimal \nsugar content and sap production. The changing climate is putting more \nstress on sugar maples, affecting syrup production.\n  According to a report by the New Hampshire Citizens for a Responsible \nEnergy Policy, ``current modeling forecasts predict that maple sugar \ntrees eventually will be completely eliminated as a regionally \nimportant species in the northeastern United States.''\n  If we look at this chart, we can see the red here is elm, ash, and \ncottonwood. We see the green is oak and pine and oak and hickory. This \nis 1960 to 1990. This is a current look at what is happening with our \ntrees in New Hampshire and New England. This darker red that we see \nhere, which is almost all of New Hampshire, is maple, beech and birch \ntrees. That is what things look like today. By 2070, you can see there \nare no more maple trees left in New Hampshire and all of New England. \nThere are very few elm, ash, and cottonwoods. There is a little bit in \nNew York. They have all moved to the West and the North.\n  If we fail to act on climate change, we are going to lose these \ntrees, lose the industry, and lose our fall foliage because maples are \nso important to the fall foliage. Climate change is also a threat to \nour wildlife and their habitats.\n  In New Hampshire, the moose is a vital part of our State's culture, \nand yet, as a result of climate change, we have seen a 40-percent \ndecline in the moose population. It is hard to see. You can see that \nthis moose looks very distressed, as does this one. What looks like \nlittle knobs on this moose's tail are ticks. Those ticks are there \nbecause with the warmer winters, insects and ticks are not dying off. \nThey infested our moose population, which is down 40 percent.\n  Climate change is also impacting the health of New Hampshire's \nfamilies. New Hampshire has one of the highest childhood asthma rates \nin the country. Rising temperatures increase smog levels. They heighten \nthe effects of allergy season. All of those things imperil the health \nof vulnerable populations in New Hampshire, which is already the \ntailpipe. New England is the tailpipe of the central part of the \ncountry. So all of the pollution that is being created in the Midwest \nby those powerplants that are spewing out fossil fuels is coming on the \nair currents to New Hampshire and to New England.\n  I am proud to say that Granite Staters have recognized the effects of \nclimate change, and New Hampshire has been a leader in reducing \npollution. We are one of nine Northeastern States that are part of the \nRegional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. As a result, New Hampshire has \nalready reduced its power sector carbon pollution by 49 percent since \n2008. Because of the initiative of the State and local communities, New \nHampshire is on track to meet the Clean Power Plan's carbon reduction \ngoals 10 years early. We are going to be there by 2020, rather than \n2030.\n  In addition, New Hampshire is investing in clean energy, using \nproceeds from emissions permits sold at RGGI auctions. The Regional \nGreenhouse Gas Initiative is a cap-and-trade system that is working in \nthe nine Northeastern States. In 2012, New Hampshire invested 94 \npercent of those funds from the program in energy efficiency and \nrenewable energy programs that directly benefit New Hampshire \nresidents.\n  I had a chance last week to visit the western part of the State and a \ntown named Peterborough. Actually, ``Our Town,'' the play by Thornton \nWilder, is written about Peterborough. They have built the largest \nsolar array in New Hampshire, and they are using it to power their \nwastewater treatment. Selling excess power into the grid and reducing \nthe town's other energy costs, they are saving between $25,000 and \n$50,000 a year.\n  What is so exciting to me is that when this project came up at a town \nmeeting for a vote, it passed unanimously. Yesterday I had a chance to \nvisit Middleton, NH. I went to Lavalley/Middleton Lumber. It is a \nsawmill that produces pine boards for Diprizio Lumber. In 2006, they \ninstalled a very large wood-fired boiler. They are able to use the \nbyproducts from the sawmill to fire the boiler, using combined heat and \npower. Not only are they able to heat their complex, but they are also \nable to provide the generation that they need for power to run the \nmills. As a result of this, they are saving $700,000 a year on their \npower bills.\n  New Hampshire has shown that we can take advantage of moving to \nrenewable energy sources. We can make smart energy choices that benefit \nthe environment and yet strengthen our economy. Nationally, the Clean \nPower Plan is projected to cut carbon emissions by millions of tons per \nyear and generate tens of billions of dollars a year in health and \nclimate benefits.\n  It is good for the economy. That is why 81 major companies, including \nfour in New Hampshire, have signed a letter pledging to support new \ninitiatives that may emerge from the global conference on climate \nchange in Paris in December. America's Clean Power Plan is a powerful \ndemonstration of our global leadership on climate change, and it will \nallow the United States to lead with credibility and authority at the \nParis conference.\n\n  We all know--or at least those people who are willing to acknowledge \nwhat the research shows--that climate change represents an enormous \nchallenge, but solutions are within reach if we put in place policies \nthat allow for action. We have a responsibility to help protect our \nchildren and our grandchildren from the severe consequences of global \nwarming by taking action now. It is time to move forward with the Clean \nPower Plan without delay. It is time to stop short-circuiting efforts \nto reduce carbon pollution in this country.\n  I urge my colleagues to stop standing in the way of this important \neffort to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Alabama be recognized to speak and that following his remarks, I \nbe permitted to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n          Terrorist Attacks Against France and Syrian Refugees\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the terrorist attacks that rocked the city \nof Paris and the entire world on Friday, I believe we all agree, were \nhorrific and unthinkable. The people of France stood by our side after \nthe horrendous events of September 11, 2001, and the American people \nwill stand by them during this tragic time. Cowardly and barbaric acts \nof violence against innocent civilians absolutely should not be \ntolerated anywhere in our society, and we must take any and all steps \navailable to prevent a similar attack from occurring right here in the \nUnited States.\n  Early reports from the terrorist attacks in Paris on Friday indicate \nthat the refugee programs in Europe allowed at least one of the \nattackers to enter France. In light of these reports, the United States \nshould take notice. We are now faced with an opportunity to make a \ncommonsense, responsible decision that would put Americans at ease and \nput an end to the risk of radical Islamic terrorists infiltrating our \nNation through the refugee resettlement program. I believe we simply \ncannot trust this administration to put in place the rigorous vetting \nsystem needed to ensure that the refugees who enter our Nation will not \nbe future threats to our people in our own homeland. It is, without a \ndoubt, in the best interest of the American people and our national \nsecurity to immediately halt any plans to allow Syrian refugees to \nresettle in the United States.\n\n[[Page S7990]]\n\n  We know we live in an increasingly dangerous world, and I believe the \nObama administration's lack of leadership on foreign policy has \nexacerbated the problem. We cannot continue to let President Obama's \nill-conceived policies put Americans at risk. This administration is \neither asleep or out of touch with the danger lurking in the world.\n  I ask the American people today: What is it going to take to wake up \nthis administration? Will it take another horrific attack on our own \nsoil and our own people?\n  I believe it is more than time to put an end to relocating Syrian \nrefugees in our country, and that is why I will work tirelessly with my \ncolleagues in the Senate to reverse President Obama's extremely \ndangerous position that threatens the American people and our homeland.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, on Friday we all watched in horror the \ntragic events that unfolded in the city of Paris. We saw radical \nIslamic terrorists brutally target innocent civilians in places that no \none should feel unsafe--a soccer stadium, a concert hall, and a cafe. \nThese attacks on our Nation's oldest ally have struck us here at home \nto our very core.\n  We know what it is like to be attacked in our homeland, and therefore \nwe know what the French people are going through. As we continue to \nkeep the French people in our thoughts and prayers, we should do \neverything in our power to assist them. As the facts unfold and if, \nindeed, ISIS did plan and execute these attacks as they have claimed, \nthen the United States and our allies have an obligation to join France \nin responding swiftly and forcefully.\n  These attacks are a tragic reminder that the threat of ISIS stretches \nwell beyond the Middle East. ISIS is not a JV team, nor have they been \ncontained as the President of the United States has claimed. More than \na year ago, I stood here on the Senate floor and said that we would not \nvote to give the President a blank check in Syria without a clear \nstrategy with achievable objectives to defeat the terrorist threat. \nNevertheless, over the course of this last year, the President has \nfailed to come up with any sort of coherent strategy to deal with this \nthreat. What we have seen and heard are speeches, interviews, and vague \nassurances that have attempted to distract the American public from the \nstark reality that the President's so-called strategy against ISIS is \nnot achieving his stated objective of degrading and ultimately \ndestroying ISIS. This whole idea that you can, through bombing attacks, \ndefeat a threat like ISIS and, once the threat is cleared, hold that \nreal estate or hold that land is just a pipe dream.\n  The United States and our partners are facing a robust enemy of more \nthan 20,000 core and foreign fighters that have continued to murder \ntheir way across Syria and Iraq, decimating populations there and \nelsewhere as their influence and power grows. Over the last year, the \nadministration's paralysis over how to defeat this terrorist threat has \nplunged Syria deeper and deeper into violence and chaos. What started \nas a civil war in Syria back in 2011 has now cost the lives of roughly \n1 million Syrians. Millions of people have been internally displaced \nwithin Syria and outside of its borders into surrounding countries, \nsuch as Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, and elsewhere, and now we are seeing \nthat wave of refugees extend to Europe, and, indeed, some have now made \ntheir way to our shores.\n  By allowing ISIS to take over such a large portion of territory, \nPresident Obama has neglected one of the key recommendations of the 9/\n11 Commission, which advised the U.S. Government following that fateful \nday on September 11, 2001, to ``identify and prioritize actual or \npotential terrorist sanctuaries.'' Instead, the President has stood and \nwatched like a spectator while this terrorist army, over the course of \nmany months, has carved out its own safe haven right in the heart of \nthe Middle East, and in doing so, has erased the border between Syria \nand Iraq where they control large swaths of territory.\n  The capture of these swaths of territory and the spread of the \nviolent, extremist ideology has not been the only consequence. The \ncivil unrest in Syria has fueled the influx of nearly one-half million \nrefugees who have flooded Eastern Europe and elsewhere.\n  Under questioning in the House Committee on Homeland Security last \nmonth, FBI Director James Comey was asked about the security \nprecautions the Federal Government was taking when screening refugees. \nDirector Comey confirmed what many of us have feared, and that is if a \nSyrian refugee was not already known to law enforcement and \nintelligence officials, it is difficult, if not impossible, for us to \nvet that individual's background for potential terror ties to various \nterrorist groups. He explained it by saying: ``If someone has never \nmade a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their \nidentity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our \ndatabase until the cows come home but . . . there will be nothing . . . \nbecause we will have no record on that person.''\n  I am proud of our history of opening our doors to innocent people \nfleeing violence or religious persecution. That is part of who we are \nas a country. But following Friday's attack, we should pause our Syrian \nrefugee program until we can be sure that the individuals are being \nfully vetted for potential terror ties so we can ensure the public \nsafety of all Americans, which is our first responsibility. Compassion \nfor those refugees is important, as I said, but protecting our homeland \nand keeping the American people safer is the first order of business. \nWith the latest public threat from ISIS yesterday directed at us here \nin the United States, we must remain vigilant against the ongoing \nthreat that may come from those already inside our country.\n  The attack in Paris has drawn attention to the degree to which law \nenforcement and intelligence officials are able to track, surveil, and \napprehend potential threats before they turn deadly, but with changing \ntechnology and damaging intelligence leaks, that is becoming \nincreasingly challenging.\n  In that same House hearing in October, the Director of the National \nCounterterrorism Center noted that potential homegrown threats were \nfinding ways to communicate ``outside of our reach'' and therefore, off \nour radar.\n  As law enforcement officials have noted, this includes the use of \nInternet service providers outside the United States as well as the \nincreasingly widespread use of encryption capabilities and new \ntechnologies. Yet, as the threat of ISIS evolves and intensifies, the \nworld is looking toward the United States as an example of strength. So \nI propose in the wake of this deadly attack that our administration and \nthe Federal Government do three things.\n  First, the President needs to hit the pause button on Syrian refugee \nresettlement until the Department of Homeland Security can verify with \ncertainty that our processes are enhanced to ensure that applicants do \nnot have ties to ISIS or any other terror groups.\n  Secondly, the President needs to lay out a clear strategy for \ndestroying perhaps the best resourced, best armed terrorist group on \nthe planet. This is long overdue, and his failure to do so is one of \nthe reasons we find ourselves where we are today. It is in the best \ninterest of the Syrian people to stay in Syria if they can, but with \ncircumstances being what they are, we can understand from a human \nperspective why they would seek a safe haven wherever they can find it. \nThis refugee crisis is directly related to the President's failure to \nhave any effective strategy to deal with the situation on the ground in \nSyria. It is destabilizing governments in the region, which have huge \nrefugee populations and which have to deal with the economic and other \nchallenges of dealing with that situation. It is important to see the \nrefugee crisis--including the 10,000 Syrian refugees who appeared in \nNew Orleans just this last week--is a result of a failure of any \nstrategy to deal with this conflict in Syria.\n  There are suggestions that have been made that I think bear some \nconsideration, such as having safe zones and no-fly and no-drive zones \nenforced by the international community. Before I spoke, I believe the \nSenator from Indiana suggested maybe this would be an appropriate \nmission for NATO. Maybe so. We ought to talk about and reach some \ndecisions about that.\n\n[[Page S7991]]\n\n  Finally, the President of the United States has the obligation to \nexplain to the American people how he is going to defend our interests \nand keep our people safe here at home.\n  As I said, one of the biggest threats is homegrown terrorists \nradicalized over social media and the Internet. Perhaps even more \nconcerning to me than the threat of a potential attacker entering the \nUnited States is a self-radicalized attacker that is already here. This \nhomegrown threat, I believe, poses a much more imminent danger to our \npeople--a sad fact we learned the hard way at Fort Hood, TX, in 2009, \nand in Garland, TX, earlier this year.\n  In conclusion, all indications from the White House are the President \nwill not change a thing. He is going to stay the course in spite of the \ngathering risk and danger of terrorist attacks being exported or being \nincited within our own borders. Now, more than ever, the Nation needs \nthe kind of strong leadership that is commensurate with the challenges \nwe are facing. That is the kind of leadership that the American people \nexpect and the kind of leadership that they deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Wicker). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I will have more to say about the refugee \ncrisis and the necessity of the considerable vetting of those refugees, \nas well as any other refugees, as we protect ourselves here at home. I \nwill have more to say about that later.\n\n\n            U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act\n\n  Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of the Senate that \nlast night the House passed a bill we modified--the U.S. Commercial \nSpace Launch Competitiveness Act. It will now go to the President to be \nsigned into law. This bill contains the language we helped to negotiate \nas a compromise between two different bills that had passed the House \nand the Senate earlier this year.\n  This bipartisan legislation, which passed the Senate unanimously, is \na major effort that recognizes the tremendous growth of the commercial \nspace industry. It is an industry that now represents more than 75 \npercent of the $330 billion global space economy--$330 billion. It is \nan industry here in the United States that will continue to grow as \nmore companies enter into new and exciting space ventures, such as \nlaunching thousands of small satellites that will provide worldwide \nInternet access, such as recovering valuable resources from distant \nasteroids, and such as sending tourists on incredible journeys that one \nday may even include overnight stays in space hotels.\n  These are the innovative kinds of commercial space activities this \nlittle country boy dreamed about years ago when I had the privilege of \nhelping pass the first Commercial Space Launch Act way back in 1984. It \nis an industry where we are starting to see a resurgence of activity \nhere in the United States. For example, just 10 years ago, there was \nonly one American commercial space launch, compared at that time to \neight launches from Russia and five from Europe. Last year there were \n11 American commercial launches, accounting for nearly half of the \nworldwide commercial launches and earning $1.1 billion in revenue--more \nthan both Russia and Europe for the very first time. Much of this \ngrowth has been seeded by a commercial industry supporting the needs of \nour space program; in particular, the International Space Station. \nFolks just do not realize that we have an International Space Station \nup there right now that is as long as from one goalpost on a football \nfield all the way to the other goalpost. That is how big this is. There \nare six human beings up there on orbit right now. Two American \ncompanies are now supplying the International Space Station with \ncritical cargo and supplies, along with our international partners. \nSoon, U.S. companies will begin launching NASA astronauts and \ninternational partner astronauts to the space station.\n  That is why this bill is so important. It paves the way for NASA to \nbegin launching government astronauts on American-made commercial \nrockets so we do not have to depend on our crews getting to and from \nthe space station just on the very proven and reliable Russian Soyuz.\n  Commercial companies are also making great use of the space station \nfor medical research, and one company is even 3D-printing tools right \nnow on the space station. So the bill extends the operations of the \nInternational Space Station to provide certainty to industry and to the \ninternational community that the station will be around not just to \n2016, not just to 2020 but now, as we put it in the bill, at least to \n2024. I think we will see efforts later on that it will even be \nextended beyond 2024. It is fitting that I mention that because this \nmonth we are celebrating the 15th anniversary of continuous human \npresence aboard the ISS--15 years we have had humans up there on an \naround-the-clock basis.\n  The commercial space sector is also revitalizing old government \ninfrastructure such as the historic launch pads that lined Florida's \nspace coast. It has been a privilege for me to spend some time there at \nthe Cape and at the Kennedy Space Center. It is an amazing \ntransformation of Cape Canaveral into a bustling space port, but I have \nseen how challenging it can be for commercial companies to get to do \nbusiness out there on the Air Force territory.\n  That is why this bill requires the FAA, NASA, and the Air Force to \nwork together to reduce the administrative burden on industry operating \non government property and to do that by streamlining the Federal \nlaunch requirements and processes.\n  This bill is a major update to our commercial space legislation. It \nwill encourage the growing commercial space industry for many years \ninto the future--an industry of vital economic, scientific, and \nnational security importance.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I thank all of my colleagues who have \nworked with me on these resolutions to stop the EPA's destructive new \nregulations such as the new source performance standards. They are \ntruly unrealistic and unreasonable and threaten our security and \nprosperity.\n  I have always said we are all entitled to our opinion and our views, \nwe are just not entitled to our own facts. As I go through this \npresentation, I will show my colleagues the facts that we will not be \nable to give us the energy we need if we go down this destructive path.\n  The CRA resolution I have introduced with Senate Majority Leader \nMitch McConnell will disapprove and stop the EPA's rule for emissions \nfrom new coal-fired powerplants. I thank my colleague from West \nVirginia Senator Capito and the Senator from North Dakota Senator \nHeitkamp for joining me in this fight by introducing a separate \nresolution to disapprove the EPA's rule for emissions from existing \ncoal-fired powerplants. It is time for Congress to step in and stop \nthese rules from harming not only hard-working West Virginians but the \nAmerican consumer. I am pleased these measures are being brought to the \nfloor for a vote today.\n  Never before has the Federal Government forced an industry to do \nsomething that is technologically impossible--until now. I have always \nsaid that if a regulation is not obtainable, it is unreasonable, and \nthat is the fact we have in front of us.\n  The EPA has based its final rule for new coal-fired powerplants in \nthe United States largely on a still-developing powerplant unit in \nCanada, which is called the Boundary Dam CCS Project. The EPA asserted \nin the final rule that the Boundary Dam facility has been operating \nfull carbon capture sequestration successfully at a commercial scale \nsince October 2014. That is found to be totally untrue. Canadian press \nreports have recently disclosed that the Boundary Dam project has \nfailed to operate successfully at full CCS for any meaningful period of \ntime.\n  The reports also identify the CCS system of the demonstration plant \nas being a key issue in the delays for getting the plant up and \nrunning. After 1 year of operation, the project was forced to replace \ncertain important features at a cost of $60 million. There have always \nbeen nearly $23 million in nonperformance penalties and lost revenues.\n  The plant's management company, which is SaskPower, has acknowledged \nthese recent reports and are now pushing back the project's operational \ndate to the end of 2016, but there are no guarantees this will prove \ntrue either.\n\n[[Page S7992]]\n\nSaskPower is also claiming that the project will need at least a year \nof stable operation to prove the technical operation and the economics \nof the project, which would aid in determining commercial viability. \nSaskPower has announced it will not be able to make an informed \ndecision about carbon capture sequestration until 2018. Yet the EPA \nhere in the United States of America is demanding that all U.S. coal-\nfired generation industry implement this technology now. That is what I \nhave said all along: If it is not obtainable, which it has not been--we \nhave not spent the money trying to develop this technology, and it \nhasn't worked--shouldn't we at least make sure it works before we force \na complete overhaul of the system or people to meet standards that are \nunobtainable.\n  These recent revelations prove that CCS is still technically unproven \nand still potentially damaging in a powerplant application. Therefore, \nit is foolish for this administration to require it now for new U.S. \ncoal plants.\n  Last week I wrote a letter to Administrator McCarthy about these \nreports because forcing coal to meet standards when experts know that \nthe required technology is not adequately demonstrated on a commercial \nscale makes absolutely no sense at all. Instead, I believe the EPA \nshould scrap this impossible-to-meet rule or amend it to require \nadvanced technology that has actually been implemented which would \noffer improved environmental performance and is commercially viable.\n  For the administration, this rule is more about desirability rather \nthan feasibility, with little regard for rising consumer prices, the \neffects on jobs, and the impact on the reliability of our electric \ngrid.\n  This administration thinks the country can do without coal. I will \nsimply tell my colleagues this: They are in total denial. They might \nnot like it, they might not want it, but it is built into the plan for \nthe next 20 to 30 years. They have flat out ignored their own data that \nsays that coal will produce more than 30 percent of our electricity \nthrough 2040.\n  It is completely contradictory that the EPA continues to impose \nunreasonable and unattainable rules in an attempt to regulate coal into \nextinction. The people who suffer are hard-working West Virginians and \nconsumers across this great country. If these regulations go into \neffect, no new coal plants could begin new operations, more Americans \nwould lose their jobs, and economic uncertainty would grow.\n  The Nation's coal-fired powerplants currently have an average age of \n45 years, the average age of all coal plants in America today, which \nproduce close to 40 percent of our power. Many will need to be replaced \nin the near future, and regulations that prohibit building new coal-\nfired powerplants can soon become a serious issue for the Nation's \nelectricity grid and the reliability we all depend upon.\n  Although the Energy Information Administration--the EIA--within the \nDepartment of Energy still projects 37 percent of electricity \ngeneration will come from coal in 2040--I remind you, this \nadministration that has put together rules that are unattainable and \nunreasonable is saying they are still going to need 37 percent of the \nelectricity this country will need by 2040 from coal. The currently \noperating plants, without new additions, will average 65 years of age \nby that time. If nothing is done, these plants are averaging 65 years \nof age to produce the type of power this country needs. The history of \ncoal plant operations already tells us coal plants at that age will not \nachieve the levels of hours of reliable operation required to meet the \n2040 forecast.\n\n  The coal industry must be allowed to add the new coal-fired \npowerplant additions, such as the ultra-supercritical, which we know is \ntechnology that works. We know it works, but this is not the direction \nthey are going. They are putting something that is unattainable in \nplace. That is why we need to block this plan, the Clean Power Plan, \nthat the President has brought before us because it cannot be attained \nand we are going to be in a deficit.\n  There is no doubt this President's agenda has already had a crushing \nimpact on my State of West Virginia and other energy States around the \ncountry. We have to say enough is enough. In West Virginia we want \nclean air, we want clean water, and we are doing everything humanly \npossible. We have cleaned up the environment more in the last two \ndecades than ever before.\n  If you look around the world, there is more coal being burned than \nhas ever been burned before. The United States burns less than 1 \nbillion tons of coal a year. Over 7 billion tons of coal are being \nburned elsewhere in the world, with 4 billion tons being burned just in \nChina. I would venture to say nobody is meeting the standards that we \nare required to here for the technology that is going to be needed to \nbe attained.\n  I will continue to explore all available options to prevent these \nunattainable regulations from impacting the State of West Virginia and \nthe United States.\n  I would ask the President--this administration--to work with us to \nfind and develop the technology that would allow us to use a product \nthat we have in abundance in this country--which is coal--in the \ncleanest fashion. We can then export that technology around the world \nto clean up the overall environment and to help the environment around \nthe globe.\n  Right now Congress needs to move forward to stop these rules that are \ncrippling our energy production, jeopardizing the energy grid, and \nputting our workers out of good-paying jobs. I urge all my colleagues \nto support these resolutions that are put forward today when we vote.\n  Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/17/senate-section/article/S7992-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business and that I be allowed to speak without a \ntime limit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                                  ISIL\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it has been more than 1 year since \nPresident Obama spoke to the Nation about the threat posed by ISIL and \nescalated U.S. military operations against it. The goal at that time, \nthe President said, was to degrade and destroy ISIL. One year ago, the \ngoal was to degrade and destroy ISIL. It is impossible to look at where \nwe are today and claim that the President's strategy is succeeding or \nthat it is likely to succeed on anything approaching an acceptable \ntimetable and level of risk.\n  No one should take this as a criticism of the men and women in \nuniform, as well as their civilian counterparts in the field, who are \ndoing the best they can under the strategic and operational constraints \nthey face, especially in the face of the White House's desire to \nrevisit the Vietnam war tactics and to micromanage the military's \ncampaign.\n  It is not that we have done nothing against ISIL; it is that there is \nno compelling reason to believe anything we are doing will be \nsufficient to destroy ISIL. Thousands of airstrikes against ISIL's \ntargets have conjured the illusion of progress, but they have produced \nlittle in the way of decisive battlefield effects.\n  I noted with some interest that we provided some targeting for the \nFrench, who carried out airstrikes. I wonder why we hadn't done any of \nthat in the last year.\n  ISIL continues to dominate Sunni Arab areas in the world, in both \nIraq and Syria, and efforts to reclaim major population centers in \nthose areas, such as Mosul, have stalled, to say the least. Meanwhile, \nISIL continues to expand globally. It is now operating in Afghanistan, \nYemen, Libya, Lebanon, and Egypt, and other radical Islamist groups, \nsuch as Boko Haram in Nigeria and al-Shabaab in Somalia, have pledged \nallegiance to ISIL. This appearance of success only enhances\n\n[[Page S7993]]\n\nISIL's ability to radicalize, recruit, and grow.\n  In the past month, ISIL has commenced a new stage in its war on the \ncivilized world by unleashing a wave of terrorist attacks around the \nglobe. In Ankara, ISIL detonated two bombs outside a train station, \nkilling 102 people and injuring over 400 more. In the skies over Egypt, \nISIL destroyed a Russian civilian airliner with a bomb that killed all \n224 passengers aboard. In Beirut, ISIL conducted 2 suicide bombings \nthat killed 43 people and injured 239 more. In Baghdad, ISIL bombs \nkilled 26 people and wounded more than 60 others. Finally, in the \nstreets of Paris last week, as we all know, gunmen wearing suicide \nbelts attacked innocent civilians at restaurants, bars, a soccer \nstadium, and a concert hall, killing at least 129 and wounding 352 \nother people.\n  The American people have experienced this kind of terror before, and \nwe stand together with the people of Turkey, Russia, Lebanon, Iraq, \nFrance, and nearly 20 other nations whose citizens were murdered by \nthese brutal atrocity committers. These attacks reveal nothing new \nabout ISIL's character. ISIL is the face of evil in our world today. It \nhas crucified its enemies, beheaded innocent journalists, burned a \nMuslim pilot alive in a cage, and it has condemned women and children \nand girls to slavery and torture and unspeakable sexual abuse. And when \nwaging war on the living has failed to satisfy its savagery, ISIL has \ndesecrated and destroyed many of the monuments to civilization that \nremain across the Middle East.\n  ISIL's latest attacks also reveal nothing new about its intentions. \nEverything that ISIL is doing is what their leaders have long said they \nwould do. They have stated their aims explicitly and clearly. All we \nhave to do is listen to their words. Indeed, as one author put it, ISIL \nhas ``toiled mightily to make their projects knowable.''\n  What these attacks have demonstrated and what now should be clear is \nthat ISIL is at war with us whether or not we admit we are at war with \nthem. What should now be clear is that ISIL is determined to attack the \nheart of the civilized world--Europe and the United States--that it has \nthe intent to attack us, the capabilities to attack us, and the \nsanctuary from which to plan those attacks. What should now be clear is \nthat our people and our allies will not be safe until ISIL is \ndestroyed--not just degraded but destroyed, and not eventually but as \nsoon as possible.\n  Unfortunately--unfortunately-- almost tragically, President Obama \nremains as ideologically committed as ever to staying the course he is \non and impervious to new information that would suggest otherwise, as \nhe made quite clear during his incredible press conference yesterday in \nTurkey. According to the President of the United States, anyone who \ndisagrees with him is ``popping off''--popping off.\n  I guess Michael Morell, former Deputy Secretary of the CIA, was just \n``popping off'' when he said recently that ``the downing of the Russian \nairliner, only the third such attack in 25 years, and the attacks in \nParis, the largest in Europe since the Madrid bombings in 2004, make it \ncrystal clear that our ISIS strategy is not working.'' That comes from \nMichael Morell, the former deputy head of the CIA under this President.\n  I guess Senator Dianne Feinstein, vice chair of the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, was just ``popping off'' when she said that \n``ISIL is not contained, ISIL is expanding'' and that we need new \nmilitary strategy and tactics.\n  I guess GEN Jack Keane, one of my heroes and architect of the \nsuccessful surge strategy in Iraq, was just ``popping off'' when he \nsaid, ``We are, in fact, losing this war. Moreover, I can say with \ncertainty that this strategy will not defeat ISIS.'' This strategy will \nnot defeat ISIS. That comes from the author of the surge which \nsucceeded, which the President, by withdrawing all troops, allowed to \ngo completely to waste, and the lives of brave young Americans were \nwasted.\n  I guess Hillary Clinton, the President's former Secretary of State \nand desired successor, was just ``popping off'' when she declared her \nsupport for a no-fly zone in Syria to ``stop the carnage on the ground \nand from the air.''\n  I guess GEN David Petraeus was just ``popping off'' when he testified \nto the Committee on Armed Services that the President's strategy has \nfailed to create the military conditions to end the conflict in Syria \nand that ISIL will not be defeated until we do so.\n  I guess James Jeffrey, a career foreign officer and the President's \nAmbassador to Iraq, was just ``popping off'' when he wrote in the \nWashington Post today that the President needs to send thousands of \nground troops to destroy ISIL.\n  What all of these national security leaders recognize is the reality \nthat is staring us right in the face. It is the President who is once \nagain failing to grasp it. He fails to understand even now that wars \ndon't end just because he says they are over, that our terrorist \nenemies are not defeated just because he says they are, that the threat \nposed by ISIL is not contained because he desires it to be so, and that \nmaybe, just maybe, the growing group of his bipartisan critics might \njust be right. And why won't he listen to them? Why won't he listen to \nthese people of experience and knowledge and background? Whom does he \nlisten to? Whom does the President listen to? He couldn't be listening \nto anybody knowledgeable and then make the comments he made at that \npress conference.\n\n  The President has had to go back on everything he said he would not \ndo to combat the threats now emanating from Syria and Iraq. He said he \nwould not arm moderate Syrian rebels because that would militarize the \nconflict. He was wrong. He said he would not intervene militarily in \nIraq or Syria. He was wrong. He said he would not put boots on the \nground in Syria. He was wrong. Now he says that his strategy is \nworking, that all it needs is time, and that no further changes are \nrequired despite ISIL's campaign of terror. Now, get this straight. \nAfter the bombing in Paris, after the Russian airliner, after the other \nacts of terror, he needs time--he needs time--and no further changes \nare required. Does anybody believe him anymore?\n  What the President has failed to understand for nearly 5 years is \nthat unless and until he leads an international effort to end the \nconflict in Syria and Iraq, the costs of this conflict will continue to \nmount. Those consequences have grown steadily, from mass atrocities and \nhundreds of thousands of dead in Syria, to the repeated use of weapons \nof mass destruction, to the rise of the world's largest terrorist army \nand its rampage across Syria and Iraq, to destabilizing refugee flows \nthat have shaken the stability of Syria's neighbors and are now \npotentially changing the character of European society. Now we see the \nlatest manifestation of this threat: global terrorist attacks directed \nand inspired by ISIL that killed hundreds around the world.\n  The Paris attacks, obviously, should be a wake-up call for all \nAmericans, most of all for the President. If we stay the course, if we \ndon't change our strategy now, we will be attacked. I don't know where, \nwhen, or how, but it will happen. Do we need to wait for more innocent \npeople to die before we address the reality that is right before us? \nISIL has said it intends to attack Washington, DC. Do we not take them \nat their word? Do we think they are not capable of it? Do we think time \nis on our side? It is not. Time is not on our side.\n  The lesson of the September 11 attack was that mass murderers cannot \nbe permitted safe havens. They cannot be permitted safe havens from \nwhich to plot our destruction. Do we really have to pay that price \nagain through the blood of our citizens?\n  For nearly 5 years, we have been told there is no military solution \nto the conflict in Syria and Iraq, as if anyone believes there is. In \nfact, one of the things that is most frustrating about the President's \nrhetoric is that he sets up straw men. He says we either should do \nnothing or the Republicans or critics--now Democrats as well--are \nwanting to send in 100,000 troops. We do not. We do not. We believe and \nI am convinced that we can send in a force composed of Sunni Arabs, of \nEgyptians, of Turks, and Americans--about 10,000--establish the no-fly \nzone, allow the refugees a sanctuary, and make sure that no barrel \nbombing will be allowed in those areas. We can succeed. ISIS is not \ninvincible. The United States of America and our allies are far \nstronger. We are the strongest Nation on Earth.\n\n[[Page S7994]]\n\nTo say we can't defeat ISIL--it is a matter of will, not a matter of \nwhether or not it is a capability.\n  So I say to my colleagues and the American people, we can defeat ISIS \nand we can wipe them off the face of the Earth, but we have to have a \nstrategy, and this President has never had a strategy.\n  For nearly 5 years we have been told that there is no military \nsolution; that there are no good options; that our influence is \nlimited, as if that is not always the case; that we won't succeed \novernight, as if our problem is one of time, not policy; and that we \ncan't solve every problem in the Middle East, as if that absolves us of \nour responsibility to make the situation better where we can. This \nisn't a question of our capacity, our capabilities, or our options. We \nhave always had options to address this growing threat. But the longer \nwe wait, the difficulty and risk and cost increase.\n  Four years ago, Lindsey Graham and I came to this floor and said: We \nneed to have a no-fly zone and we need to arm and train the Free Syrian \nArmy, once Bashar al-Assad crossed the redline. We could have done it \nthen, and it would have been one heck of a lot easier. But this \nPresident didn't want to do it, and we are faced with a more complex \nsituation. Tens of thousands or a couple hundred thousand Syrians dead \nand millions of refugees later, the President of the United States \nstill won't act. He still believes, as he stated in his press \nconference yesterday, that, somehow, everything is going fine--what \ndelusion.\n  After the attack on France, article 5 of NATO's founding treaty \nshould be invoked, which states that an attack on one is an attack on \nall. That is what we did after 9/11. The United States should work with \nour NATO allies and our Arab partners to assemble a coalition that will \ntake the fight to ISIL from the air and on the ground. My friends, air \nattacks only will not succeed. It will not succeed. I am sorry to tell \nyou. I apologize ahead of time. We need boots on the ground--not \n100,000 but about 10,000, with the capabilities that are unique to \nAmerican service men and women. We can defeat ISIL.\n  We have to step up the air campaign by easing overly restrictive \nrules of engagement. At the same time, we have to recognize that ISIL \nwill only be defeated by ground combat forces. Those don't exist today. \nWe must recognize that our indirect efforts to support our partners on \nthe ground--the Iraqi Security Forces, the moderate Syrian opposition \nforce, the Kurdish Peshmerga, and the Sunni tribal forces--are \ninsufficient to outpace the growing threat we face.\n  As I mentioned, the United States must therefore work to assemble a \ncoalition and ground force with a commitment on the order of 10,000 \nU.S. troops.\n  In Syria, we must hasten the end of the civil war. We must accept \nthat Russia and Iran are not interested in a negotiated solution that \nfavors U.S. interests. Russia and Iran have entirely different goals \nthan the United States of America in Syria. Russia wants to keep Bashar \nAssad or his stooge in power, they want to keep their major influence \nin the region, and they want to protect their base there. The United \nStates of America has none of those interests. They want to prop up the \nguy who has killed 240,000.\n  I appreciate the outpouring of concern of all my colleagues and all \nAmericans about these refugees. The refugees are the result of a \nfailure of Presidential and American leadership. They are not the cause \nof it. The cause of these hundreds of thousands or millions of refugees \nis because our policy failed. Bashar al-Assad slaughtered them with \nbarrel bombs, and we are now faced with the threat, in some respects, \nof a possibility that one or more of these refugees, having gone \nthrough Greece, now are or possibly could be--as the Director of the \nCIA said yesterday--in ongoing operations to try to orchestrate attacks \non America.\n  It is often said that America doesn't go abroad in search of monsters \nto destroy. But that doesn't mean there are no monsters in the world \nthat seek to destroy us. The longer we wait to accept this reality, the \ngreater is the cost we will pay.\n  One of my great heroes and role models, as is the case with many of \nour colleagues, is Winston Churchill. I would never compare myself to \nWinston Churchill in any possible way, except that I do sometimes have \nempathy with Winston Churchill, who, during the 1930s, came to the \nfloor of the Parliament and made comments and speeches that were very, \nvery moving, but no one paid any attention to him. In fact, he was \nridiculed. In fact, Lindsey Graham and I have been ridiculed from time \nto time because of our assessment of the situation and what needed to \nbe done.\n  Winston Churchill, after the crisis had been resolved to some degree \nand the people of Britain and the world had awakened, said--and there \nis a parallel between the situation 4 years ago and what Winston \nChurchill had to say:\n\n       When the situation was manageable, it was neglected, and \n     now that it is thoroughly out of hand we apply too late the \n     remedies which then might have effected a cure. There is \n     nothing new in the story. It is as old as the Sibylline \n     Books. It falls into that long, dismal catalogue of the \n     fruitlessness of experience and the confirmed unteachability \n     of mankind. Want of foresight, unwillingness to act when \n     action would be simple and effective, lack of clear thinking, \n     confusion of counsel until the emergency comes, until self-\n     preservation strikes its jarring gong--these are the features \n     which constitute the endless repetition of history.\n\n  I say to my colleagues, we are observing the endless repetition of \nhistory--what once upon a time was a manageable situation. When the \nPresident of the United States said that it is not a matter of when \nBashar al-Assad leaves but it is a matter of when, when the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff and then-Secretary of Defense testified \nbefore our committee that it is inevitable that Bashar Assad will go, \nwhen the President of the United States continuously said time after \ntime that we have a strategy and it is not anything to worry about, \nwhen we get out of Iraq and we draw redlines in Syria and don't do it, \nwhen we don't take any action after the redline is crossed, when his \nnational security team, composed of Secretary of State Clinton, \nSecretary of Defense Panetta, and then-Director of CIA David Petraeus \nall recommended training and arming the Free Syrian Army, he rejected \nit.\n  So now we find ourselves with 240 thousand dead in Syria and more \nSyrian children in school in Lebanon than Lebanese children. Jordan, \none of our best friends, has their very fabric threatened and unstable \nbecause of the huge number of refugees. We find a very unstable Middle \nEast, and we find ISIL spread now to Libya, Lebanon, Yemen, and other \nnations. ISIL has now even established a foothold in Afghanistan, and \nthe Iranians are doing the same.\n  It is not too late. It is not too late. We have to take up arms. We \nhave to tell the American people what is at stake here. We have to \ninform the American people that what happened in Paris can happen here. \nMr. Baghdadi, who was once in our prison camp at Camp Bucca for 4 years \nin Iraq, when he left said: ``I'll see you guys in New York.'' He was \nnot kidding. There is no doubt that what ISIL has just proved is that \ncontrary to what this President believed, contrary even to what our \nintelligence told us, they have a reach. They have had a reach to make \nsure that a Russian airliner was destroyed. They have a reach to Paris. \nThey have a reach to Beirut. They have a reach in northern Africa and \nother places in the world. There is no reason why we should not suspect \nthat they have a reach to the United States of America. It is time we \nacted. It is time the United States of America, acting with our allies, \ntakes out ISIL. We must go both to Iraq and to Syria and take them out. \nTheir total defeat is the only thing that will eliminate this threat to \nthe United States of America.\n  Yes, after they are destroyed there is a lot to do. Yes, there are \nthings such as building economies and free societies and all of that. \nBut there is only one thing that Mr. Baghdadi and his legions \nunderstand, and that is that we kill them and that we counter with \neverything we can this spread of this perverted form of an honorable \nreligion called Islam. This is radical Islamic terrorism, whether the \nPresident ever wants to say it or not.\n  There is one additional point. The refugees are a huge problem. \nObviously, we have to pause until we are sure that nobody is doing \nexactly\n\n[[Page S7995]]\n\nwhat--apparently, at least--one of the terrorists who attacked Paris \ndid, and that is, to go through Greece and into France. But at the same \ntime, we need to understand that the refugee problem is an effect of a \nfailed policy, not the cause of it.\n  Finally, I would say the President should do two things: One, call \ntogether the smartest people that we know. I named some of them: \nGeneral Petraeus, General Keane. There are a number of people. There is \nGeneral Maddox, General Kelly, Bob Kagan. The names are familiar to \nmany of us who follow national security. These people are the ones who \nmade the surge succeed. Call them together over at the White House and \nsay: Give me your advice. He must do that. What he has been listening \nto and what he is doing is failing.\n  I know that my friend and partner, Lindsey Graham, knows more about \nthese issues than any other Member of this body--certainly anybody who \nis running for President of the United States. We will go over. We \nwould be glad to go over and sit with the President. I want to \ncooperate with him. I want to work with him. We need to do that. I \noffer up my services and my advice and counsel, and anybody else on \nthis side of the aisle.\n  This is a threat to the lives of the men and women who are living in \nthis Nation. They deserve our protection, and they deserve a bipartisan \napproach and a bipartisan action in order to stop that.\n  So I stand ready. But right now, I have not been more concerned.\n  I leave my colleagues with two fundamental facts:\n  No. 1, there are now more refugees in the world than at any time \nsince the end of World War II. No. 2, there are now more crises in the \nworld than at any time since the end of World War II. We cannot sustain \nthe failed policies that have led us to the situation that America and \nthe world are in today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n          Authorization For Use of Military Force Against ISIL\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, over the weekend France suffered the worst \nattack that it has seen since World War II. The day before that, Beirut \nwas rocked by two suicide bombs perpetrated by ISIL that killed more \nthan 40 civilians. We just had confirmation that the Russian plane \nflying over Sinai was taken down by a terrorist bomb. Again, ISIL has \nclaimed credit. These attacks have followed on the heels of an \nannouncement 2 weeks earlier by the President that he has authorized \ndeployment of up to 50 Special Forces in Syria. They will be there to \nsupport U.S.-backed Syrian rebels in the campaign against ISIL.\n  More than 1 year after the announcement of Operation Inherent \nResolve, a mission to ``degrade and ultimately defeat'' ISIL, this \nconflict has escalated dramatically. The facts on the ground in the \nMiddle East have changed dramatically. Russia is intervening militarily \non behalf of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. Hundreds of thousands of Syrians \nleft their homes and their country to escape ISIL and Assad, \nprecipitating a massive humanitarian crisis that has brought the \nEuropean Union under great strain.\n  In addition to the deployment of U.S. Special Forces in Syria, news \nreports indicate that the United States will increase supplies and \nmilitary weapons to U.S.-backed Syrian rebels fighting ISIL.\n  For all the changes that we have seen over the past year, one thing \nhas not changed: The Congress of the United States has not voted to \nauthorize the use of military force against ISIL. That needs to change. \nThat is why I have come to the floor today. The Senator from Virginia, \nMr. Kaine, who will speak in a moment, has come as well. We need an \nauthorization for the use of military force.\n  The President maintains that the legal underpinnings of his \nauthorization come from an AUMF provided to our previous President in \nthe 107th Congress, back in 2001. The 2001 AUMF allowed the President \nthe authority to use ``all necessary and appropriate force'' against \nthose he determined ``planned, authorized, committed, or aided the \nterrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such \norganizations or persons.''\n  More than 10 years later, two provisions of the massive Fiscal Year \n2012 National Defense Authorization Act expanded the 2001 AUMF to \ninclude ``associated forces'' of Al Qaeda and the Taliban. This is the \nexpansion from which the administration derives its authority for \ntoday's actions to go after the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\n  I am not standing here today to debate the merits of the \nadministration's argument as to whether they have the legal authority. \nThat is not what is at issue right here. What is at issue is the ease \nwith which Congress happily defers to old statutes and abdicates its \nauthority to weigh in on what history will record as a long, complex, \nbrutal conflict. This conflict has been going on for more than a year \nwith very mixed results, and the consequences will change the \ngeopolitical landscape in that region for decades.\n  Ten American servicemembers have died supporting Operation Inherent \nResolve--one of them recently killed in action. Five others have been \nwounded. With thousands of servicemembers in support of Operation \nInherent Resolve and attacks happening all over the world, the notion \nthat a 14-year-old statute aimed at another enemy is any kind of a \nsubstitute for congressional authorization is insufficient. Operation \nInherent Resolve warrants its own authorization not just because of its \nsize and duration, because Americans are dying in pursuit of it, or \nbecause it is directed at an enemy that is a threat to our security; \nthis mission warrants its own authorization because we want it to \nsucceed. We want the world to know that the United States speaks with \none voice.\n  Nearly a year ago, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee pressed the \nadministration to come forward with a draft AUMF against ISIL. When it \ndid not do so, the committee proceeded with its own AUMF, which spurred \nthe administration to take action. Two months after that exercise, the \nadministration sent up its own draft AUMF. That was more than 8 months \nago. But efforts to produce an AUMF here in Congress have since \nstalled. In an effort to break the gridlock, as I mentioned, the \nSenator from Virginia, Mr. Kaine, and I introduced a resolution that we \nthink represents a good compromise. It may not be perfect. It may \nrepresent only a starting point. But we need a starting point here, and \nwe need to move forward. This issue is far too important not to try to \nget an agreement to move ahead.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider the importance of this operation \nagainst ISIL and the implications to foreign policies for many years \nahead--specifically, the implications to this body, the Congress of the \nUnited States and the U.S. Senate. If we are not even willing to weigh \nin and authorize the use of force here, what does that say to our \nadversaries? What does that say to our allies? What does that say to \nthe troops who are fighting on our behalf? How much longer can we go \nwithout an authorization for the use of force?\n  I wish to yield time to my colleague, the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arizona for \nworking so closely. This does not have to be a partisan issue. In fact, \nit should not be a partisan issue. My sense is that in this Congress, \nin both Houses, 80-plus percent of the Members believe strongly that \nthe United States should be engaged in military action under some \ncircumstances against this horrible threat of ISIL. Yet, despite that \noverwhelming consensus and despite the clear constitutional command in \narticle I that we should not be at war without a vote of Congress, \nthere has been a strange conspiracy of silence about this in the \nlegislative branch for the last 16 months.\n  The Senator from Arizona and I introduced a resolution in January to \nauthorize military force, building upon previous efforts in the Foreign \nRelations Committee, the President's submitted authorization. We did it \nknowing that it is not perfect, knowing that not everyone would agree \nwith every word, but we did it to show that we can be bipartisan and \nstand up against a threat such as ISIL.\n  As the Senator did, let's review what has happened since August 8, \n2014. The President on that day started airstrikes against ISIL and \nsaid he was\n\n[[Page S7996]]\n\ndoing it for two reasons: first, to protect American personnel who were \njeopardized at a consulate in Erbil, and second, to provide \nhumanitarian support for members of a minority religious sect, the \nYazidis, who were basically being hemmed in by ISIL in Sinjar in \nnorthern Iraq. Those were the two reasons.\n  At that point in August of 2014, ISIL and their activities were \nlimited to Iraq and Syria. Sixteen months later, we have lost four \nAmerican hostages who have been executed by ISIL. We have lost 10 \nAmerican service men and women who were deployed to that theater. We \nhave about 3,600 American troops who are deployed thousands of miles \nfrom home, risking their lives every day. We have spent $5 billion--$11 \nmillion a day--in the battle against ISIL. We have flown nearly 6,300 \nairstrikes with American aircraft against ISIL--ISIL, which was at \nfirst limited to Iraq and Syria and now has presence in Afghanistan, \nLibya, Yemen, and Somalia. They have undertaken attacks that they claim \ncredit for in the Sinai in Egypt and in Lebanon.\n  This threat is mutating and growing. At the end of last week, on \nFriday the 13th, we saw the horror of ISIL with the grim assassination \nof innocents as they were enjoying dinner or going to music concerts or \nwatching soccer games in Paris. ISIL put out a video a few days ago \nthreatening similar attacks on Washington. ISIL is not going away. This \nis a threat.\n  The President started military action for a narrow and limited \nreason, but the threat has mutated. Like a cancer, it has grown, and it \nis now affecting nations all over the world. The question is, How long \nwill Congress continue to be silent about this? I will say that I think \nthis is a malady you can lay at the feet of both parties in both \nHouses. Congress has seemed to prefer a strategy of criticizing what \nthe President is doing. And look, I am critical of some of the things \nthe President is doing. In an earlier speech, the senior Senator from \nArizona laid out some challenges with this strategy. But it is not \nenough for this body that has a constitutional authority in matters of \nwar to just criticize the Commander in Chief. What we have done is sat \non the sidelines and criticized, but we have not been willing either to \nvote to authorize what is going on, vote to stop what is going on, or \nvote to refine or revise what is going on. It is easy to be a critic. \nIt is easy to sit in the stands and watch a play and say: Well, why \ndidn't the coach call a different play? But we are not fans here, We \nare the owners of the team. We are the article I branch, and we are not \nsupposed to be at war without a vote of Congress.\n  I will hand it back to my colleague from Arizona, and then perhaps I \ncan say a few concluding words that would be more about the kind of \nemotional rather than the legal side of this as we are thinking about \nthe challenges in Paris.\n  I think the events of last week--Egypt, Beirut, Paris--demonstrate \nthat the voice of Congress is needed. The voice of Congress is needed \nto fulfill our article I responsibility. The voice of Congress is \nneeded, as the Senator from Arizona mentioned, because we send a \nmessage by our voice to our allies, to the adversary, and to our \ntroops. The voice of Congress is also needed because it has the effect \nof solving some of the problems Senator McCain mentioned earlier. To \nthe extent that the administration's strategy is not what we would want \nit to be, they have to present a strategy to Congress. We ask tough \nquestions of the witnesses, and we refine it and it gets better. We do \nthat all in the view of the American public so they can be educated \nabout what is at stake. When you don't have the debate, you don't put \nbefore the American public the reasons for the involvement, and that is \ndesperately needed.\n  With that, I thank my colleague from Arizona. I would like to say a \nfew words at the end about why this is a matter of emotional \nsignificance to me.\n  I now defer to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Virginia.\n  Let me say that we both mentioned the importance of the message that \nneeds to be sent from the U.S. Congress, the article I branch, the \nmessage to our troops who are fighting on our behalf and the message to \nour adversaries. They need to know that we are resolved, that we speak \nwith one voice.\n  Let me talk for a second about the message to our allies. An \nauthorization for use of force will dictate and will set the parameters \nfor that use of force. Our allies need to know if we are all in or \nwhether there are certain limitations. If we decide--if the Congress \ndecides there are certain limitations to that use of force, our allies \nneed to know that. They need to know their role and what they are \nrequired to do. That will be useful. If there are limitations, we need \nto spell them out. If there aren't, we need to let our adversaries know \nthat as well.\n  But whatever the case, we need to debate this. We need to authorize \nthis use of force. We have waited long enough. Frankly, we have waited \nfar too long. We have asked the President for language. The President \nsent up language. I think that it is lacking in a few areas. I like \nsome parts of it. But it needs to be debated here. If we asked the \nPresident for that language, then we need to take it up and actually do \nsomething with it. It is our responsibility. We are the article I \nbranch. We are the branch that is supposed to declare war. We need to \ndo that here.\n  Again, I invite my colleague from Virginia to close. I thank the \nPresident and say that it is time--it is well past time that we move on \nthis. Hopefully the events of the past couple of weeks--the attacks \nthat happened in Paris, the bombing of a plane, the other suicide \nbombings that have occurred--our commitment of new resources will \nconvince us all that it is time to act here in Congress.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for \njoining together in this important area.\n  I had a sad epiphany on Friday as I was thinking about this. I think \nSenator Flake and I have children who are about the same age. I was \nthinking about young people--looking at our pages here, thinking about \nyoung people. Like many, when the attacks happened Friday, my first \nthoughts were, whom do I know in Paris? A lot of folks have relatives \nor have family or coworkers or former coworkers who were in Paris.\n  Like a lot of people, I got on the phone and I got on text to try to \ntrack down my niece. I have a niece who is a student at law school, a \nthird-year law student. She is in Paris for a semester studying at the \nSciences PO. She was in the restaurant area where the shootings \noccurred so close that she could hear them. She was not immediately \naffected, but she and her friends had to barricade themselves in the \nrestaurant for a while, wondering what was going on.\n  We were able to determine that Elizabeth was fine. She assured all \nthe family and the people who wanted to send her a plane ticket to come \nhome that, no, she was fine. But over the weekend I started to think \nabout how fine she really is, how fine our young people really are. \nElizabeth was a Peace Corps volunteer in Cameroon a few years ago. \nAfter she came home, the village she lived in was essentially wiped out \nby Boko Haram. The next door neighbor, who was her protector and the \nprotector of all the Peace Corps volunteers who came before, was \nkilled, along with a lot of her other friends. Boko Haram has now \npledged allegiance to ISIL.\n  She had the experience of losing friends in a terrorist attack in \nCameroon, and now she has had the experience of being near a terrorist \nattack in Paris. It started to work on my conscience a little bit that \nthis for her is now a norm. For me, at age 57, these events are not the \nnorm. They are the extreme. But for Elizabeth or for my children--I \nhave three kids, one in the military, and they all came of age after 9/\n11--we are living in a world that for so many of our young people, the \nnorm is not peace and safety and complacency; the norm is war or \nterrorist attacks all over the globe. If that can be said about \nAmerica's young people, it is certainly the case for young people in \nFrance and young people in Syria and all over the region.\n  I hate that we are living in a world where young people are starting \nto think this is the norm rather than the exception. It seems to me as \nan adult, as somebody in a leadership position,\n\n[[Page S7997]]\n\nthat a part of what we need to do is rather than just allow us to drift \nwithout taking a position into the world where this is more and more \nnormal, while acknowledging that we are humble people and we can't \ncompletely control our destiny, we have to take charge of a situation \nand not stand by and lob in criticism but try to shape it to the best \nof our ability. I think that was the genius of the drafters of the \nConstitution.\n  James Madison, a Virginian who drafted many of these provisions, was \ntrying to do something incredibly radical. At the time, war was for the \nKing or the Monarch or the Emperor, and Madison and the others who \ndrafted the American Constitution, said: We are going to take that \npower to initiate war away from the Executive. Nobody else has really \ndone this, and we are going to put the power in the hands of the \npeople's elected representatives so that they will debate and soberly \nanalyze when you should take that step of authorizing military action \nwhere, even under the best of circumstances, horrible things can happen \nand people can lose their lives.\n  Well, we have allowed this war to go on long enough without putting a \ncongressional fingerprint on it. For our young people, for our troops, \nfor our allies, and for our adversaries, it is my prayer that we in \nCongress will now take up that leadership mantle and try to shape this \nmutating and growing threat to the greatest degree we can.\n  With that, I yield the floor and again thank my colleague from \nArizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, the Obama administration's war on energy \nisn't just a war on coal, it is a war on American jobs, American \nfamilies, and our national security. That is why it is no surprise that \nthe President's anti-energy agenda is gaining opposition from both \nsides of the aisle. I am thankful for the bipartisan leadership \ndemonstrated by leader McConnell, Senator Capito, two Republicans, as \nwell as Senator Manchin, Senator Heitkamp, two Democrats, in standing \nup against the President's harmful regulations on our Nation's coal-\nfired plants. I am proud to have joined them as a cosponsor of the two \nbipartisan resolutions to stop the EPA from imposing its anti-coal \nregulations.\n  The Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval we are \nconsidering today will block the Obama administration's regulations on \nexisting coal-fired plants. We are also seeing strong opposition from \nmore than half of the States in the country, including my home State of \nMontana, which through three different lawsuits have requested an \ninitial stay on the rule.\n  The Obama administration's reckless agenda is shutting down coal-\nfired powerplants across the United States. It is killing family waged \njobs for union workers and for tribal members in Montana, and it is \nstifling investments that could lead to innovations to make coal even \ncleaner here in the United States. President Obama calls it the Clean \nPower Plan. It is not named correctly. It should be called the \nunaffordable energy plan. President Obama's unaffordable energy plan \nwill have a negligible impact on global coal demand and global \nemissions, but it will lead to devastating consequences for affordable \nenergy and these good-paying union and tribal jobs.\n  Here are the facts: The United States mines just 11 percent of the \nworld's coal and consumes about 10.5 percent of the world's coal. Said \nanother way, approximately 90 percent of all the coal that is mined and \nconsumed occurs outside of the United States. Global demand for coal-\nfired energy will not disappear even if the United States were to shut \ndown every last coal mine and coal-fired plant.\n  Coal use around the world has grown four times faster than \nrenewables. There are plans for 1,200 coal plants in 59 countries. Let \nme say that again: 1,200 coal plants are planned in 59 countries, about \nthree-quarters of which will be in China and India.\n  China alone consumes 4 billion tons of coal each year. Compare that \nto the United States, which is at 1 billion tons. In other words, \nChina's coal consumption is four times greater than that of the United \nStates. In fact, China will be building a new coal plant every 10 days \nfor the next 10 years.\n  Look at Japan, for example. After the great earthquake in Japan, they \nlost their nuclear power capability. Japan is currently building 43 \ncoal-fired plants.\n  By 2020, India may have built 2\\1/2\\ times as much coal capacity as \nthe United States is about to lose.\n  The Obama administration's reckless war on energy will have little \nimpact on global emissions, but here is what it will do: It will \ndevastate significant parts of our economy. It will cause energy bills \nto skyrocket. It will be a loss of tax revenues for our schools, roads, \nand teachers. And it is going to destroy family-wage union and tribal \njobs.\n  If this rule moves forward, countless coal-fired plants like the \nColstrip powerplant in Montana will likely be shuttered, thereby \nputting thousands of jobs at risk. It will also make new coal-fired \nplants incredibly difficult to build.\n  The bottom line is this: Coal keeps the lights on in this country, \nand it will continue to power the world for decades to come. In fact, \nin my home State of Montana, it provides more than half of our \nelectricity.\n  I have told my kids--we have 4 children--when they plug in their \nphones, odds are it is coal that is powering that phone. Rather than \ndismissing this reality, the United States should be on the cutting \nedge of technological advances in energy development. We should be \nleading the way in powering the world, not disengaging. Unfortunately, \nPresident Obama's out-of-touch regulations take us in the opposite \ndirection, and the people who can afford it the least will be impacted \nthe greatest.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to join in this bipartisan effort to stop \nthe President's job-killing regulations on affordable energy and join \nus in standing up for American energy independence. With what we have \nseen happen in the world in the last week, our national security and \nenergy independence are tied together. Stand up for American jobs. \nStand up for hard-working American families.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there is a desperate need for the Senate \nto address one of the greatest national security and public health \nrisks we face as a country, something that has the ability to affect up \nto 3.4 percent, or $260 billion, of U.S. economic output annually. What \nis this threat? It is climate change.\n  In its 2010 and 2014 Quadrennial Defense Reviews, the Department of \nDefense identified climate change as a risk that must be incorporated \ninto the Nation's future defense planning. Last year, I held a hearing \non this issue as chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  Pentagon experts explained the far-ranging effects of this threat . . \n. putting the U.S. at risk around the world . . . changing the \nlandscape and vegetation of training areas . . . accelerating regional \ntensions and conflict. This summer, the Department issued a new report \noutlining in even greater detail the threats we face. It states, ``The \nDepartment of Defense sees climate change as a present security threat, \nnot strictly a long-term risk.'' It goes on to say that climate change \nis introducing ``shocks and stressors'' in the Artic, the Middle East, \nAfrica, Asia, and South America.\n  The report argues that global warming has had ``measurable impacts'' \non vulnerable areas and regional conflicts, like Syria. Due to these \nimpacts, military leaders are now forced to include ways to respond to \nthe risks and challenges of climate change in their planning.\n  So if our Nation's senior military leaders are doing their part to \naddress climate change, isn't it about time that we did the same? Well, \nwe can start by supporting the Environmental Protection Agency's \nefforts to limit carbon pollution from power plants--which account for \nover 40 percent of U.S. carbon pollution emissions. The rules would cut \ncarbon pollution from power plants by over 30 percent and reduce \nemissions of the pollutants that cause soot and smog by 25 percent. \nThat is equivalent to removing over 160 million cars from the road--or \nalmost two-thirds of U.S. passenger vehicles.\n  The rules will also drive new investment in clean energy generation \nand energy efficiency technologies while growing the economy, shrinking \nhousehold electricity bills, and putting the\n\n[[Page S7998]]\n\nU.S. on a pathway to lead the world in creating new clean energy jobs. \nIn addition, EPA's rules would lead to climate and health benefits \nworth up to $54 billion annually, including avoiding 3,600 premature \ndeaths; 90,000 asthma attacks in children; and up to 3,400 heart \nattacks and hospital visits. This is a win-win for America.\n  The State of Illinois has already started taking steps to reduce its \nemissions by adopting laws that promote the use of renewable energy and \nenergy efficiency.\n  Our ``community choice aggregation'' law allows Illinoisans to choose \ntheir energy providers. Since the program was started, more than 90 \ncommunities have chosen to use 100 percent renewable electricity \nsources for their residential power.\n  Illinois's Renewable Portfolio Standard requiring the State to use 25 \npercent renewable electricity resources by 2025 is one of the strongest \nin the country.\n  And State law also requires utilities to reduce Illinois's energy \ndemand by 2 percent each year through efficiency improvements.\n  With the support of these laws, Illinois now employs approximately \n100,000 people in the clean energy industry--and meeting EPA's new \ntargets would put even more Illinoisans to work designing, \nmanufacturing, and installing clean energy systems. Most importantly, \nEPA's rules will allow the U.S. to face the challenge of climate change \nhead on instead of ignoring the problem until it is too late.\n  Leading scientists warn that the world is running out of time to make \nthe cuts in carbon emissions that are needed to prevent irreversible \ndamage to the Earth's climate. According to the United Nations's \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, at least half the world's \nenergy supply needs to come from low-carbon sources such as wind, \nsolar, and nuclear by 2050 if we are going to avoid catastrophic \nclimate changes. That gives us just 35 years to save the planet for \nfuture generations.\n  This may seem like a long time, but we have a lot to do. We need to \nstart now, and EPA's rules are a great first step.\n  But I know some of my colleagues are opposed to the EPA's plan and \nanything this administration does to acknowledge the existence of \nclimate change. So they have introduced two resolutions of disapproval \nto prevent EPA from listening to over 97 percent of climate scientists \nand acting to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. If the resolutions were \nto become law, they would prohibit EPA from proposing any new \nregulations that are ``substantially the same'' as their current rules \nfor new and existing power plants.\n  But even supporters of these resolutions have to admit that we have a \nresponsibility to be good stewards of our planet.\n  So I have to ask, if you don't like what the President is doing, what \nis your plan to make sure we leave future generations with a brighter, \ncleaner future? How do you propose we address the threat of climate \nchange? And what is your plan to make sure that America leads the world \nin creating the well-paying, green jobs of the future? Denying the \nharmful effects of greenhouse gas emissions, as these resolutions do, \nis shortsighted and declares war on science and on public health. So I \nhope my colleagues will vote ``no'' on the resolutions of disapproval \nfrom Senator McConnell and Senator Capito.\n  The evidence is clear: we need to get serious about addressing the \ncauses and effects of climate change. America has the resources and the \ninventiveness to create a new energy system that can protect our \nenvironment and economy and allow us to continue to choose our own \ndestiny. But we can only do it by focusing on policies that address \nboth the economic and environmental challenges facing the country by \nsupporting critical, sustainable infrastructure. And we need to do it \nsoon--our generation has a moral obligation to leave the world in as \ngood of shape as what we inherited from our parents and grandparents.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there is irrefutable evidence, with more \naccumulating all the time, that humans have altered not just the \nweather of a region, but the climate of our entire planet.\n  From flooding felt across the country to extreme temperatures from \nnorth to south and east to west, these severe events are happening more \nand more frequently. Droughts are proliferating, wildfires are bigger, \nand more expensive, tropical storms and hurricanes are more intense. \nYou can look no further than the damage wrought in Vermont in the wake \nof Tropical Storm Irene--a storm that had greatly weakened since first \nmaking landfall, but still so powerful as to deliver hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in damage to our small State. It was enough to \nconvince many Vermonters of the reality of climate change as they \nwatched roads washed away and iconic covered bridges yanked out of the \nfootings that had supported them for generations.\n  The science and the data by now are clear that human activities are a \nfactor in the climate change that is unfolding all around us and in \nevery corner of the globe, but common sense alone should tell us, as we \nlook about us and see all of the carbon and pollution that is being \npumped into our thin and fragile atmosphere, that all of these human \nactivities are contributing factors.\n  We must address the root causes of climate change, and that is what \nthe administration's Clean Power Plan, bolstered by the rules for new \nand existing power plants, will do.\n  Today, we won't vote about how to support our roads and bridges. We \nwon't vote to further advance educational opportunities for young \nchildren. We won't vote on ways to keep our government--of the people, \nfor the people--open. Rather, we are summoned to heed the call of \npressure groups, wealthy corporations, and moneyed interests and vote \non a resolution of disapproval that denies the impact and the causes of \nclimate change. These challenges under the Congressional Review Act \nfail to recognize the true cost of carbon pollution. The Clean Power \nPlan sets clear and flexible rules that signal to the marketplace that \nwe cannot continue to spew harmful carbon pollution without limit. It \nfinally puts an end to the free lunch for the fossil fuels industry.\n  These rules offer commonsense solutions that will not only address \nclimate change, but will protect Americans' health with cleaner air. \nThey will also unleash the creativity and inventiveness of American \nentrepreneurship and support investments in new technology. They will \nfurther set the stage for our vibrant and job-rich energy future. The \nflexibility in these rules means that States and companies will be able \nto decide the best ways to reduce their carbon emissions, whether \nthrough gains in efficiency and new technologies or through an \nincreased use of natural gas or renewable fuels.\n  Vermonters are encouraged by these rules and about the Clean Power \nPlan--not only because together these proposals move the country \nforward to finally address climate change, but also because the plan \nand rules recognize the important work that Vermont and other Northeast \nStates have been doing for the last decade through the Regional \nGreenhouse Gas Initiative, RGGI, to cap carbon emissions and offer \ncredits to cleaner producers. In Vermont, we can breathe easier knowing \nthat under these rules, we will have less pollution blowing into the \nState from power plants in the Midwest.\n  The majority in the Senate would rather roll back some of the most \nmeaningful environmental initiatives of our time, rather than help to \nimprove the health of Americans across the country. The science is \nclear: Failing to address climate change will lead to more dangerous \nand costly extreme weather events and threaten the health and well-\nbeing of our families and our communities. We must stop putting the \ninterests of polluters above public health. It is time to stop putting \nthe future of our planet and of generations to come in danger and to \nact now to halt the devastating effects of climate change. Let us move \nbeyond the energy policies of the last two centuries and move forward \ntoward America's energy future.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, strong clean air protections remain very \nimportant for our health and environment. I have voted previously to \nprotect the EPA's ability to take action to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions, and I will oppose the two resolutions of disapproval under \nthe Congressional Review Act which would permanently\n\n[[Page S7999]]\n\nblock EPA from limiting carbon pollution from existing and new fossil \nfuel fired powerplants.\n  Finalized on August 3, 2015, the Clean Power Plan sets the first \nnational limits on carbon pollution from existing fossil fuel fired \npowerplants, the Nation's single largest stationary source of \ngreenhouse gas emissions. According to EPA estimates, the Clean Power \nPlan will reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the electric power \nsector by 32 percent, from 2005 levels, by 2030. The final plan \nincludes additional flexibility and provides States with more time to \nsubmit plans and to achieve compliance with the requirements. The \nstandards to limit carbon dioxide for new, modified, or reconstructed \npowerplants were also finalized on August 3. On November 4, 18 States, \nincluding Maine, and several cities asked a Federal court to allow them \nto defend the Clean Power Plan against legal challenge.\n  I am encouraged that the emissions targets under the Clean Power Plan \nfor Maine are more realistic than were originally proposed in \nrecognition of the fact that Maine already ranks first in the Nation in \nthe percentage reduction in greenhouse gases due to the State's \nparticipation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, RGGI. Through \nRGGI, Maine has already made substantial progress in reducing carbon \nemissions, increasing energy efficiency, spurring the adoption of clean \nenergy technologies, and improving air quality and public health. By \ncontrast, the EPA's original proposal would have unfairly disadvantaged \nand asked more of States that took action early than it would have from \nStates that had not yet acted to reduce their emissions. The final rule \nrepresents a considerable improvement in this regard.\n  I continue to have some concerns, however, with the Clean Power \nPlan's treatment of renewable biomass energy. Biomass energy is a \nsustainable, responsible, renewable, and economically significant \nenergy source. Many States, including Maine, are relying on renewable \nbiomass to meet their renewable energy goals. Because the final rule \nplaces the onus on States to demonstrate the eligibility of biomass for \nthe Clean Power Plan, this approach will lead to more regulatory \nuncertainty. The EPA must appropriately recognize the carbon benefits \nof forest bioenergy in a way that helps States, mills, and the forest \nproducts industry and recognizes the carbon neutrality of wood. I will \ncontinue to seek regulatory certainty and clarity on this issue.\n  Climate change is a significant threat both here in the United States \nand around the world. It is a challenge that requires international \ncooperation, including from large emitters like China and India, to \nreduce greenhouse gas pollution worldwide. The upcoming climate summit \nin Paris provides a new opportunity for international efforts to curb \ngreenhouse gas emissions in countries around the globe.\n  I have had the opportunity to meet in the field with some of the \nworld's foremost climate scientists. I have traveled to Norway and to \nAlaska where I saw the dramatic loss of sea ice cover and the \nretreating Arctic glaciers. In Barrow, AK, on the shores of the Arctic \nOcean, I saw telephone poles leaning over because the permafrost was \nmelting, and I talked with native people who told me that they were \nseeing insects that had never before been this far north. I returned \nfrom this trip believing that U.S. leadership to slow climate change \nwould be vitally important--in order to prevent the worst extreme \nweather events, shifts in agricultural production and disease patterns, \nand more air pollution.\n  For Maine, climate change poses a significant threat to our vast \nnatural resources, from working forests, fishing, and agricultural \nindustries, to tourism and recreation, as well as for public health. \nWith heat waves, more extreme weather events, and sea level rise, the \ngreenhouse gasses that drive climate change are a clear threat to our \nway of life. As a coastal State, Maine is particularly vulnerable to \nstorm surges and flooding, and unpredictable changes in the Gulf of \nMaine threaten our iconic fisheries. Climate changes also raise \nsignificant public health concerns for Maine's citizens, from asthma to \nLyme disease. Maine has one of the highest and fastest growing incident \nrates of Lyme disease, and its spread has been linked to higher \ntemperatures that are ripe for deer ticks and their hosts. Sitting at \nthe end of the air pollution tailpipe, Maine also has some of the \nhighest rates of asthma in the country.\n  The Clean Air Act remains vital for protecting our health and the \nenvironment, and I will continue to support responsible and realistic \nefforts to reduce harmful pollution that affects us all.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to speak in favor of the Clean \nPower Plan. This plan shows real American leadership when it comes to \nclimate change, proof that we are taking responsibility for the world \nwe leave to our children.\n  The debate over the Clean Power Plan is a question of whether we \nshould take any action at all on climate change, a shocking question \nconsidering how long we have known about the ways we are harming the \nplanet.\n  A recent report by Inside Climate News shows that Exxon scientists \nwere warning the company's leadership about climate change as early as \n1977. The Exxon scientists wrote: ``There is general scientific \nagreement that the most likely manner in which mankind is influencing \nthe global climate is through carbon dioxide release from the burning \nof fossil fuels.''\n  Even before that, scientific advisers first cautioned the President \nabout climate change in 1965--50 years ago this month--explaining that \ncarbon dioxide from fossil fuels would ``almost certainly cause \nsignificant changes'' and ``could be deleterious from the point of view \nof human beings.''\n  And as far back as 1956, the New York Times reported early evidence \nconnecting climate change with greenhouse gases from fossil fuel \ncombustion. That prescient article concluded with a sad commentary: \n``Coal and oil are still plentiful and cheap in many parts of the \nworld, and there is every reason to believe that both will be consumed \nby industry as long as it pays to do so.''\n  Today, decades later, we not only have even more scientific evidence \nof climate change, we are actually seeing the real-world consequences \nof inaction.\n  This past September was the planet's warmest September in the 136-\nyear history of weather records. The last 5 months in a row all set \nworld records for hottest average temperatures.\n  Last year was the planet's hottest recorded year, and the last two \ndecades include the 19 hottest years on record. Global sea levels rose \n7 inches in the last century. And since the beginning of the industrial \nera, the acidity of the oceans has increased by 26 percent, which could \ndestabilize the food chain.\n  My own home State of California is seeing firsthand the effects of \nhigher temperatures and changing precipitation patterns. We are in the \nmidst of an epic drought, which scientists say has been made 15 to 20 \npercent worse due to human-induced changes in the climate. This has \nmade a drought into a disaster.\n  The Sierra snowpack, which accounts for a third of the State's \ndrinking water, is down to 5 percent of its usual levels, the lowest in \n500 years.\n  The wildfires in California are made even more terrifying by the hot, \ndry conditions. And the fire season now lasts 75 days longer than just \n10 years ago, resulting in more and larger fires.\n  Southern California and the Central Valley have the worst air \npollution in the country, home to six of the top seven regions of worst \nozone smog pollution. This is made worse by hotter conditions.\n  But this is just the beginning. Unless we dramatically change course, \nchildren born today will witness calamitous changes to the world's \nclimate systems in their lifetimes.\n  Sea levels will rise another 1 to 4 feet this century based on \nthermal expansion of the oceans and continued melting of land-based \nice. This would inundate Miami Beach, the Ports of Los Angeles and Long \nBeach, and 85 percent of New Orleans.\n  In addition, a portion of the west Antarctic ice sheet large enough \nto raise global sea levels by 4 feet has begun an irreversible \ncollapse. We have to slow down this process as much as possible and \nmake sure the same doesn't happen to the rest of Antarctica or \nGreenland.\n  By midcentury, ice-free summers in the Arctic Ocean could be routine. \nThe global volume of glaciers is projected\n\n[[Page S8000]]\n\nto be reduced by up to 85 percent this century. And massive numbers of \nspecies will go extinct because many plant species cannot shift their \ngeographical ranges quickly enough to keep up with the rate of climate \nchange.\n  This future is unacceptable. We cannot leave future generations a \nplanet in such terrible disrepair.\n  I will not see California become a desert State, with aquifers \noverrun by salt water and coastal cities overwhelmed by storm surges. \nMy colleagues must understand that we will never relent in the fight to \nsave the planet.\n\n  I understand some States are afraid of an economy without fossil fuel \nextraction. But I assure you that transitioning to a new economy will \nbe easier than coping with the devastating effects of global warming.\n  That brings me to the issue we are debating today: the Clean Power \nPlan. Although the final rules were only recently completed by the EPA, \nthe Supreme Court set us on this path 8 years ago when they found in \neffect that the Clean Air Act compelled the regulation of greenhouse \ngases.\n  It puts us on a path to cut national emissions from the electricity \nsector by 32 percent over the next 15 years, using tools that each \nState can tailor to its own unique situation. It is a remarkably \nflexible regulatory approach that will harness the ingenuity of the \nAmerican people to confront and roll back the effects of climate \nchange.\n  I know this approach can work because I have seen it work in \nCalifornia. In the last 10 years, the State has implemented a number of \nchanges: an economywide cap-and-trade program to return statewide \nemissions back to their 1990 levels by 2020; a renewable portfolio \nstandard requiring 50 percent renewable electricity by 2030; \nregulations to double energy efficiency by 2030; a low carbon fuel \nstandard to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels \nat least 10 percent by 2020; and a program to reach 1 million zero-\nemission vehicles by 2020.\n  Here is the thing: even though California is making these changes, \nthe State continues to grow. The economy grew by 2.8 percent last year, \nwith a 1.3 percentage point reduction in the unemployment rate. Both of \nthose figures are better than the national average.\n  As a result, California is already on track to meet or exceed the \nClean Power Plan's targets. And more importantly, California's \nleadership is showing others just how much we can accomplish.\n  Internationally, California's cap-and-trade program was used as a \nmodel for China's cities and provinces. Now, President Obama has \nleveraged the ambition of the Clean Power Plan to convince the Chinese \nto combine their regional cap-and-trade programs into a national carbon \nstrategy.\n  This is how bold leadership achieves results. And this December in \nParis, the Clean Power Plan will serve as the keystone of America's \nnational climate ambitions, helping convince the world that we will be \nthe leaders we promise to be in combatting climate change.\n  The Senate shouldn't be considering a rejection of the Clean Power \nPlan. Our real responsibility is to find ways to be even more \nambitious.\n  Today's vote changes nothing. If Congress were to pass this \nresolution to disapprove of the Clean Power Plan, the President's veto \nwould not be overridden. The Clean Power Plan will be implemented.\n  I believe the Clean Power Plan will not only reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions, but that process won't be nearly as difficult as some now \nfear. The Clean Power Plan will be seen as one of the many important \nsteps we took to stabilize global temperatures.\n  I truly think we are making headway in the fight against global \nwarming. Environmentally conscious individuals are marking changes in \ntheir own lives, and those are driving changes in the economy and in \nState policies. Those changes spurred reform on the national level, and \nnow, we are seeing real action on the global stage.\n  Today's ``show vote'' on the Clean Power Plan won't diminish those \nsuccesses.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I join many of my colleagues in \nopposing S.J. Res. 23 and S.J. Res 24.\n  These measures are an attack on the Clean Power Plan's carbon \npollution protections for new and existing power plants.\n  Not only would these measures undo the health and economic benefits \nof the Clean Power Plan, they would also bar the EPA from issuing any \nstandards in the future that are substantially similar.\n  The Clean Power Plan is an important step in reducing carbon \npollution and taking action on climate change. It seeks to protect \npublic health, cut energy costs for consumers, and create jobs in the \nclean energy economy. Additionally, these reductions--the first of its \nkind in our country for carbon pollution from power plants--are vital \nto meeting the commitments the United States has made to lowering \nemissions. Our country is not alone in making these commitments. China \nand other nations are also doing so--as will be discussed and hopefully \nfurthered at the climate negotiations taking place next week in Paris. \nBecause pollution crosses borders, protecting air quality is a globally \nshared responsibility.\n  Let me also emphasize that EPA has the legal authority to set \nstandards on carbon pollution. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that \nthe Clean Air Act authorizes the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas \nemissions from sources including power plants.\n  Despite criticism from the opposition, we have seen, since the \nenactment of the Clean Air Act 45 years ago, that economic growth and \nenvironmental protection are not mutually exclusive. According to the \nDepartment of Commerce, environmental laws including the Clean Air Act \nhave made the U.S. the largest producer of environmental technologies \nin the world, supporting close to 1.7 million jobs and $44 billion in \nexports annually.\n  The Clean Power Plan will build on this progress and help accelerate \nthe development of renewable energy, creating thousands of jobs in the \nclean energy sector.\n  The Energy Information Administration, EIA, finds that the Clean \nPower Plan will increase the use of renewable energy, leading to \nthousands of clean energy jobs across the country, including in my home \nState of Rhode Island.\n  The 2015 Rhode Island Clean Energy Jobs Report states that Rhode \nIsland's clean energy economy currently supports nearly 10,000 jobs and \nsuggests that the State is expected to add approximately 1,600 new \nclean energy jobs over the next year.\n  Renewables, like wind and solar, are already generating power \nreliably and cost-effectively across America. Wind power is already \nshowing it can be integrated onto the grid at a large scale while \nensuring reliability.\n  Wind power plays an important role in Clean Power Plan compliance, \nwith wind electricity generation capacity more than tripling over 2013 \nlevels by 2040, according to the EIA.\n  This is why in Rhode Island we are building the first offshore wind \nfarm, which is projected to increase energy capacity for the residents \nof Block Island.\n  Our commitment to clean energy is not only cost-effective, but vital \nto supporting our Nation's health. Climate change is impacting air \npollution, which can cause asthma attacks, cardiovascular disease, and \npremature death, and fostering extreme weather patterns such as heat \nand severe storms, droughts, wildfires, and flooding that can harm low-\nincome communities disproportionately.\n  The Clean Power Plan makes America healthier by improving the well-\nbeing and productivity of our children, workforce, and seniors through \nsuch benefits as reducing asthma attacks in children, lowering the rate \nof hospital admissions, and reducing the number of missed school and \nwork days.\n  Action is needed to protect not just our economy's growing renewable \nenergy field, but also our public health. This is why I stand with my \ncolleagues in supporting the Clean Power Plan.\n  We must make clean air a priority.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Clean Air Act and vote ``no'' on \nboth S.J. Res. 23 and S.J. Res 24.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                         Syrian Refugee Crisis\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, on Friday, ISIS terrorists massacred 129 \npeople in Paris. Just the day before, ISIS terrorists massacred 43 \npeople in Beirut. While these are merely the latest\n\n[[Page S8001]]\n\nin a series of horrific attacks launched by ISIS over the last few \nyears, these twin tragedies have riveted the attention of the world.\n  These events test us. It is easy to proclaim that we are tough and \nbrave and good-hearted when threats feel far away, but when those \nthreats loom large and close by, our actions will strip away our tough \ntalk and reveal who we really are. We face a choice--a choice either to \nlead the world by example or to turn our backs to the threats and the \nsuffering around us. Last month Senator Shaheen, Senator Durbin, \nSenator Klobuchar, and I traveled to Europe to see the Syrian refugee \ncrisis up close. I come to the Senate floor today to speak about what I \nsaw and to try to shed some light on the choice we face.\n  Over the past 4 years, millions of people have fled their homes in \nSyria, running for their lives, searching for a future for themselves \nand their families. Official estimates indicate that 2 million Syrians \nare now living in Turkey, more than 1 million in Lebanon, and more than \none-half million in Jordan. The true numbers are probably much larger.\n  The crisis has put an enormous economic and political strain on those \ncountries. In late 2014, I traveled to Jordan where I visited a U.N. \nrefugee processing center. I also met with Jordan's Foreign Minister, \nU.N. representatives, and American military personnel stationed in \nAmman. Even a year ago, it was clear that the humanitarian crisis was \nstraining these host countries and that there was no end in sight.\n  In recent months, the crisis has accelerated. The steady stream of \nrefugees fleeing Syria has become a flood, and that flood has swept \nacross Europe. Every day refugees set out on a journey of hundreds of \nmiles from Syria to the Turkish coast. When they arrive, they are met \nby human smugglers who charge $1,000 a head for a place on a shoddy, \noverloaded, plastic raft that is floated out to sea, hopefully in the \ndirection of one of the Greek islands.\n  I visited one of those islands last month. Lesbos is only a few miles \nfrom the Turkish coast, but the risks of crossing are immense. The \nwater is rough, the shoreline is rocky, and these overcrowded, paper-\nthin rafts are dangerously unsteady. Parents do their best to protect \ntheir children. Little ones are outfitted with blowup pool floaties as \na substitute for lifejackets in the hope that if their rafts go down, a \n$1.99 pool toy will be enough to save the life of a small child--and \nthe rafts do go down. According to some estimates, more than 500 people \nhave died crossing the sea from Turkey to Greece so far this year.\n  Despite the risks, thousands make the trip every day. Greek Coast \nGuard officials told us that when refugees see a Coast Guard ship, they \nmay even slash holes in their own rafts just so they will not be turned \nback.\n  I met with the mayor of Lesbos, who described how his tiny Greek \nisland of 80,000 people has struggled to cope with those refugees who \nwash ashore--more than 100,000 people in October alone. Refugees are \nprocessed in reception centers on the island before boarding ferries to \nAthens, but Greece plainly lacks the resources necessary to handle \nthese enormous numbers. Refugees pile into the reception centers, \noverflowing the facilities and sleeping in parks or beside the road. \nLast month, a volunteer doctor in Lesbos was quoted as saying: ``There \nare thousands of children here and their feet are literally rotting, \nthey can't keep dry, they have high fevers, and they're standing in the \npouring rain for days on end.'' Recently, the mayor told a local radio \nprogram that the island had run out of room to bury the dead.\n  Greece's overwhelmed registration system is not only a humanitarian \ncrisis but also a security risk. In meeting after meeting, I asked \nGreek officials about security screening for these migrants, and time \nafter time I heard the same answer. It was all Greece could do simply \nto fingerprint these individuals and write down their names before \nsending them off to Athens, and from there, to somewhere else in \nEurope. Now Greece's Interior Minister says that fingerprints taken \nfrom one of the Paris attackers may match someone who registered as a \nrefugee at a Greek island entry point in early October. Whether this \nultimately proves to be true, there is no question that a screening \nsystem that can do no more than confirm after the fact that a terrorist \nentered Europe is obviously not a screening system that is working.\n  The burden of dealing with Syrian refugees cannot fall on Greece \nalone. Greece and the other border countries dealing with this crisis \nneed money and expertise to screen out security threats. Europe needs \nto provide that assistance as quickly as possible, and if we are \nserious about preventing another tragedy like the one in Paris, the \nUnited States must help. We must build adequate procedures to make sure \nthat refugees, especially those who have entered Europe through this \nslipshod screening process, can enter the United States only after they \nhave been thoroughly vetted and we are fully confident that they do not \npose a risk to our Nation or our people.\n  The security threat is real and it must be addressed, but on our \nvisit to Lesbos, we also had the chance to meet with refugees processed \nat the Moria reception center to see who most of them really are. From \nthe outside, with its barbed wire and guard towers, Moria looks like a \nprison. At the entrance, the words ``Freedom For All'' are etched into \nthe concrete encircling the facility, but speaking with refugees inside \nfeels more like a 21st-century Ellis Island. We met doctors, teachers, \ncivil engineers, and college students. We met young, educated, middle-\nclass Syrians seeking freedom and opportunity for themselves and their \nfamilies. They were seeking a safe refuge from ISIS, just like the rest \nof us.\n  The most heartbreaking cases are the unaccompanied children. These \nboys and girls are separated from the other refugees in a fenced-in \noutdoor dormitory area. I met a young girl in that fenced-in area--\nyounger than my own granddaughters, sent out on this perilous journey \nalone. When I asked how old she was, she shyly held up seven fingers. I \nwondered, What could possibly possess parents to hand a 7-year-old girl \nand a wad of cash to human smugglers? What could possibly possess them \nto send a beloved child across the treacherous seas with no more \nprotection than a pool floatie? What could make them send a child on a \njourney knowing that crime rings of sex slavery and organ harvesting \nprey on these children? What could possess them to send a little girl \nout alone with only the wildest, vaguest hope that she might make it \nthrough alive and find something--anything--better on the other side?\n  Today, we all know why parents would send a child on a journey alone. \nThe events of the last week in Paris and in Beirut drive it home. The \nterrorists of ISIS--enemies of Islam and of all modern civilization, \nbutchers who rape, torture, and execute women and children, who blow \nthemselves up in a lunatic effort to kill as many people as possible--\nthese terrorists have spent years torturing the people of Syria.\n  And what about the Syrian Government? President Bashar al-Assad has \nspent years bombing his own people. Day after day, month after month, \nyear after year, Syrian civilians have been caught in the middle, \nsubjected to suicide attacks, car bombings, and hotel bombings at the \nhands of ISIS or Assad or this faction or that faction--each assault \nmore senseless than the last. Day after day, month after month, year \nafter year, mothers, fathers, children, and grandparents are \nslaughtered.\n  In the wake of the murders in Paris and in Beirut last week, people \nin America, in Europe, and throughout the world are fearful. Millions \nof Syrians are fearful as well, terrified by the reality of their daily \nlives, terrified that their last avenue of escape from the horrors of \nISIS will be closed, and terrified that the world will turn its back on \nthem and their children.\n  Some politicians have already moved in that direction, proposing to \nclose our country for people fleeing the massacre in Syria, but with \nmillions of Syrian refugees already in Europe, already carrying \nEuropean passports, already able to travel to the United States--and \nwith more moving across Europe every day--that is not a real plan to \nkeep us safe, and that is not who we are. We are a country of \nimmigrants and refugees, a country made strong by our diversity, a \ncountry founded by those crossing the sea, fleeing religious \npersecution and seeking\n\n[[Page S8002]]\n\nreligious freedom. We are not a nation that delivers children back into \nthe hands of ISIS murderers because some politician doesn't like their \nreligion, and we are not a nation that backs down out of fear.\n  Our first responsibility is to protect this country. We must embrace \nthat fundamental obligation, but we do not make ourselves safer by \nignoring our common humanity and turning away from our moral \nobligation.\n  ISIS has shown itself to the world. We cannot and we will not abandon \nthe people of France to this butchery, we cannot and we will not \nabandon the people of Lebanon to this butchery, and we cannot and we \nmust not abandon the people of Syria to this butchery. The terrorists \nin Paris and in Beirut remind us that the hate of a few can alter the \nlives of many. Now we have a chance to affirm a different message--a \nmessage that we are a courageous people who will stand strong in the \nface of terrorism. We have the courage to affirm our commitment to a \nworld of open minds and open hearts. This must be our choice--the same \nchoice that has been made over and over again by every generation of \nAmericans. This is always our choice. It is the reason the people of \nSyria and people all around this world look to us for hope. It is the \nreason ISIS despises us, and it is the reason we will defeat them.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague Senator Warren \nfor those very eloquent remarks. She and the Senators she traveled with \nhave taught us a lot. We have heard her comments, and she is right. Our \nvalues in the United States of America are accepting and open to \nrefugees who flee violence and persecution, and that is the country we \nare.\n  So I thank very much the Senator from Massachusetts for her remarks. \nAs I have said, we all have learned very much from her and the trip she \ntook and from what she shared with us.\n\n\n                    Terrorist Attacks Against France\n\n  Mr. President, before I begin my remarks today, in addition to the \ncomments I have just made, I wanted to first pause for just a moment \nand say a few words about the Paris attacks last Friday.\n  The people of New Mexico and the people the world over are grieving \nfor those who were killed and injured in the horrific attacks that have \njust been spoken about by Senator Warren and others who have come to \nthe floor today. Earlier today, we had a moment of silence to recognize \nthem. I just want to say that our thoughts are with the French people, \nand we are united in our resolve to fight the murderous thugs of \nterrorism who thrive on hate, intolerance, and fear.\n  I met today with the French Ambassador to give him New Mexicans' \nheartfelt condolences. All of us on the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee and the Senate leadership met today with the French \nAmbassador to say to him that we stand together with him against these \nmurderous thugs.\n  Mr. President, today, because we are on this resolution of \ndisapproval, we are discussing the issue of climate change and global \nwarming. It is one of our greatest challenges and we have a choice. We \ncan deny the reality. We can ignore the danger to our planet, to our \neconomy, and to our security--that is one choice--or we can move \nforward. We can work together. We can find common ground with a \ndiversified energy portfolio that includes clean energy, with an energy \npolicy that makes sense, that creates jobs, that protects the \nenvironment, and that will keep our Nation strong. That is the choice \nwe should make, that is the choice we must make and, once again, that \nis the choice we are failing to make.\n  This year is almost over. It will likely be the warmest year on \nrecord. The current record holder is last year--2014. The impact is \nclear. People are seeing it all over the world, with rising sea levels \nand increased droughts.\n  The Southwest is at the eye of the storm. In New Mexico, temperatures \nare rising 50 percent faster than the global average, not just this \nyear or last year but for decades. This has strained my State with \nterrible droughts and wildfires. When the rain does come, it often \nbrings floods as well. In 2011, we had the largest fire in our State's \nhistory--the Las Conchas fire. Then, in 2012--just a year later--we had \nan even larger wildfire. The Whitewater-Baldy fire burned 259,000 \nacres. We have seen massive droughts. Our crops and natural resources \nare at risk.\n  Through all of this, Congress has failed to act. There have been many \nattempts in the past. We have had many bipartisan bills introduced in \nthe Senate, including the McCain-Lieberman cap-and-trade proposal, the \nBingaman-Specter cap-and-trade proposal, the Cantwell-Collins cap-and-\ndividend proposal, the Lieberman-Warner bill, the Kerry-Graham bill, \nand others. In the House of Representatives, I had my own bipartisan \nbill with Representative Tom Petri. In 2005, over half the Senate voted \non a resolution affirming the need to implement mandatory reductions of \ngreenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Each and every time \nCongress failed to make it to the finish line--failed to pass \ncomprehensive legislation in both Houses to curb our greenhouse gas \nemissions. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking. Time is growing short, and \nwe are going from bad to worse.\n  So the President and the EPA have used their authority under the \nClean Air Act to implement restrictions and to control the pollution. \nThey have done what needs to be done with the support of many of us in \nCongress and, as we know, with the support of the American people. The \nproposals are reasonable, they are critical, and they will make a \ndifference to restricting emissions from new and existing powerplants. \nSome in the Senate have argued these proposals do too much and others \nargue they don't do enough, but instead of rolling up our sleeves and \ndeveloping a comprehensive energy and climate strategy of our own, we \nare here today voting on a Republican resolution of disapproval of the \nClean Power Plan rules. What a waste of our time, the American people's \ntime, and the time we have left to seriously address this very \nimportant problem.\n  I started this speech talking about choices and again we are making \nthe wrong one. We are wasting time when we should be working together \nand developing proposals that would address global warming and help \npush forward clean energy jobs. There are now more solar jobs in the \nUnited States than coal jobs. There are currently more than 98 solar \ncompanies in New Mexico, employing 1,600 people. Renewable energy jobs \nand solutions are in abundance in New Mexico, and this is true for many \nother States. A renewable electricity standard, which I have long \nfought for, would create 300,000 jobs. Most of these jobs are high-\npaying, local, and cannot be shipped overseas.\n  Congress could be using this time moving forward. Our country can \nlead the world in a clean energy economy. We have the technology, we \nhave the resources, and we need the commitment. Instead, the Republican \nleadership in Congress is doubling down, trying to overturn the \nPresident and derailing the progress we are making. They do so knowing \nthey will fail, knowing the President will veto it, and knowing the \nvotes aren't there to override the veto. Once again, this is a lot of \nsound, a lot of fury, and a lot of wasted time. It makes a false claim \nthat support for climate action does not exist in the United States, \nand it does so ahead of the Paris Climate Conference, where 153 \ncountries, it is my understanding at this point, are going to gather \nand sign on to positive climate proposals.\n  Action on climate change is under attack in the U.S. Senate. That is \ntrue, make no mistake about it, but also make no mistake that all of \nthese attacks will fail.\n  I have led the charge in our Appropriations Committee, on the \nsubcommittee of which I am the ranking member, to fight against \ndangerous environmental riders. I will continue to fight them, and they \nwill fail.\n  My colleagues and I are here today in opposition to this resolution \nof disapproval and we also are here to ask that we move on, to ask that \nwe work together and face the very real threat of climate change.\n  We will go to Paris next month, and we will get a solid, strong \nagreement from the international community. The United States will \ncontinue to lead on this issue even if our Republican colleagues \ncontinue to fight it each step of the way.\n\n[[Page S8003]]\n\n  With that, I yield the floor to my good friend from Massachusetts \nSenator Ed Markey, who has been an incredible champion in terms of \nworking legislation and who had a big part a Congress or two ago \ngetting climate change legislation out of the House of Representatives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for \nhis historic leadership on these issues.\n  The consequences of climate change are evidenced around the world. \nTemperatures are increasing, sea level is rising, glaciers are \nreceding, rainfall is changing, and people's health is suffering. These \nimpacts can worsen the tensions that are fueling terrorism and \nconflicts around the world. The Pentagon and the CIA have both issued \nreports that found that instability from changes in the climate can \ncontribute to conditions that breed insurgencies.\n\n  As we look around the world, we can see how climate change is a \nthreat multiplier and a catalyst for conflict today. That is why \npartnering with developing countries so they can grow their economies \nin a climate-smart way is a crucial part of our foreign policy. That is \nwhy we need to support the Green Climate Fund and other financing and \naid programs that will help countries increase their resiliency in the \nface of climate change impacts, because those impacts are very real, \nand scientists agree that it is humans who are causing them.\n  The year 2014 was the hottest year in a global record that stretches \nback to 1880. The first half of this year is now the hottest January to \nJune in that same record. As temperatures continue to soar upwards on \nland, our seas are getting hotter as well.\n  While we have to deal with the consequences of climate change that \nare already gripping our Nation and our planet, there is still time to \nprevent future catastrophes. That is why President Obama has been using \nthe tool he has in the Clean Air Act to reduce carbon pollution. He has \nused it to further increase the fuel efficiency of America's cars and \ntrucks.\n  He has released the historic Clean Power Plan, but Republicans want \nto undo that plan with the Congressional Review Act. Undoing the Clean \nPower Plan would be bad for our economy, for our national security, and \nfor our health. The Clean Power Plan captures the scientific urgency \nand the economic opportunity needed to avoid the worst consequences of \nclimate change. The Clean Power Plan provides flexibility to the States \nto find solutions to reducing carbon pollution that work best for their \nsituations. The Clean Power Plan will be at the heart of a supercharged \nrenewables renaissance in every single State in the Union. It will \ncreate jobs and save consumers billions on their electricity bills. It \nwill avert almost 100,000 asthma attacks a year and prevent thousands \nof premature deaths. The climate and health benefits of this rule are \nestimated to be $34 to $54 billion every year by the year 2030.\n  With the Clean Power Plan, we can create wealth and health for our \ncountry. In Massachusetts, we know firsthand that by cutting carbon \npollution, we can grow our economy and save families money. It is a \nformula that works. We did it through the Regional Greenhouse Gas \nInitiative, or RGGI, which is a model for the Clean Power Plan. Since \nthe program went into effect in 2009, the program has added on the \norder of $3 billion worth of economic value to participating States and \nit has saved consumers more than $1.5 billion.\n  Massachusetts now has nearly 100,000 people working in the clean \nenergy sector in our State. It is the fastest growing job-creation \nsector in our economy. All of this has happened just over the last 10 \nyears.\n  As a nation, we have a choice: We can continue to pump harmful carbon \npollution into our skies and foreign oil into our cars or we can pump \nnew life into our economy, creating jobs and saving Americans money on \ntheir energy bills.\n  Climate deniers call this plan a war on coal, but it is really a war \non carbon pollution. The Clean Power Plan is a signal to the \nmarketplace to invest in clean energy, and it is a signal to the world \nthat America will lead the global effort for climate action and be the \nglobal leader. You cannot preach temperance from a bar stool. If we \nwant to be a leader, we have to stand up and say: Here is what we are \ngoing to do.\n  By reducing U.S. carbon pollution, the United States will be the \nleader and not the laggard in the international climate negotiations \nbeginning at the end of this month in Paris. U.S. leadership has helped \nsecure climate pledges for Paris from more than 150 countries. We now \nhave the opportunity to forge an international climate agreement that \nincludes all countries doing their fair share for a global solution to \nglobal warming.\n  We aren't tackling climate change alone. Efforts are underway in \nlegislatures around the world to develop laws and develop national \nresponses to climate change. But without the Clean Power Plan, America \nwould not be able to have any credibility in Paris in 2\\1/2\\ weeks in \nsaying: We are going to reduce our greenhouse gases. You must, as \nanother sovereign country, reduce your greenhouse gases.\n  Coal companies, the Koch brothers, and other allies of the fossil \nfuel industry may oppose the United States and the world acting on \nclimate, but scientific facts, economic opportunity, and history are \nnot on their side.\n  Today we are debating a resolution to overturn the Clean Power Plan, \nand should it pass, the President will veto it and Republicans won't \nhave the votes to overturn the veto. What the Republicans are doing \ntoday is nothing more than a political Kabuki theater. Instead of \nwasting time tilting at legislative windmills, we should be passing tax \nextenders to help build more wind turbines and more solar panels in the \nUnited States of America. That is what we should be debating out here \non the floor of the Senate today.\n  If the Republicans don't like the Clean Power Plan, then I ask them \nwhat is their plan to prevent climate change, expand energy, and create \njobs. That is the real question we should be debating on the Senate \nfloor today. The reality is that they have no plan. The reality is that \nas a party they are in denial that the planet is dangerously warming. \nThe reality is that they want to keep the wind and solar tax breaks off \nof the books, giving incentives for Americans to innovate in this area. \nThe reality is that the fossil fuel industry is still driving the \nagenda of the Republican Party here in Congress. That is the reality. \nThat is why we are having this vote here on the floor of the Senate \ntoday, because the Republican Party is siding with Big Coal and Big \nFossil Fuel in order to keep us on a pathway that does not allow us to \nunleash this renewable energy revolution.\n  The green generation--the young generation in our country--wants to \nbe the leaders. They are innovators and they can find investors to help \nthem with their new technology. They are professors and they are \nproducers who want to work together in order to unleash this \nrevolution.\n  The next generation already did this with telecommunications. They \nmoved us from a black rotary dial phone to an iPhone in about 8 years. \nThe technology was locked up. There was no innovation that was \npossible. The utility industry that was the telephone industry had a \nstake in everyone still renting a black rotary dial phone. The utility \nindustry, which is the electrical generating industry, has a stake in \nslowing down the pace at which we move to wind and solar and to new \ntechnologies of the 21st century that are the match for the iPhone in \nthe telecommunications sector. That is what we are debating on the \nfloor--the path to the future. That is what we are debating on the \nfloor--the 19th-century technologies versus the 21st-century \ntechnologies.\n  That is what we are debating on the floor--the status quo or an \ninnovation economy where young people are able to move into these new \nsectors and invent these new technologies and exploit them around the \nplanet. We did that in telecommunications. It is branded Google, eBay, \nAmazon and YouTube, around the planet. We did it in the blink of an eye \nonce we unleashed the potential. We can do the same in the green energy \nsector, but defeating the Clean Power Plan vote the Republicans brought \nout on the floor is the key to unleashing this potential not only in \nour own country but across the planet.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on this historic set of regulations that \nPresident Obama is\n\n[[Page S8004]]\n\nputting on the books. It is what will give us credibility when he goes \nto Paris in the beginning of December in order to negotiate this \nhistoric deal.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I rise today to oppose the Congressional Review Act to derail the \nClean Power Plan.\n  It was Theodore Roosevelt who said, ``Of all the questions that can \ncome before this nation, short of the actual preservation of its \nexistence in a great war, there is none which compares in importance \nwith the great central task of leaving this land even a better land for \nour descendants than it is for us.''\n  Theodore Roosevelt was at the core of the conservation movement in \nthe Republican Party. It is a Republican Party far removed from the \nparty it is today. Roosevelt's determination to ``leave this land a \nlittle better'' has been replaced by complete abdication of responsible \nleadership for the stewardship of our planet.\n  The Clean Power Plan that this resolution concerns is the single most \nsignificant step this country has taken now or in the past to combat \nclimate change. Many citizens do not know that over the past few \ndecades we have seen the carbon pollution rise in the atmosphere, and \nit is now in the upper level of 400 parts per million. As that carbon \ndioxide concentrates and comes to a higher level, it traps the heat, \nand that heat is producing profound consequences. We haven't had this \nlevel of carbon pollution for 3 million years--long before humans \nwalked this planet and when sea levels were as much as 80 feet higher \nthan they are today. So this is no ivory tower issue; it is very real, \nnot only in the measurement of pollution in the air but in the facts on \nthe ground.\n  In my home State of Oregon, we are seeing impacts on our forests. We \nsee impacts of pine beetles spreading and creating a big red zone of \ndead trees. We see it in impacts in terms of fiercer forest fires and a \nlonger forest fire season--a season that has grown 60 days in 40 years. \nWe see it in terms of the diminishing snowpack in the Cascades, which \nnot only makes our trout streams warmer and smaller, but it decreases \nthe water we have for agriculture, and we have a massive drought year \nafter year. The three worst ever droughts have been in the last 15 \nyears in the Klamath Basin in the south. We see it in terms of our sea \nproduction--our oysters, which are struggling to create shells when \nthey are small because the Pacific Ocean is 30 percent more acidic now \nthan it was before the industrial revolution.\n  Carbon pollution is really a war on rural America. It is a war on \nforestry, our fishing, and our farming, and that cannot be allowed to \nstand.\n  There is no question that we have conclusive evidence of global \nwarming. Globally, 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all \noccurred in the last 15 years. They have all occurred in this century, \nand 2014 was the warmest year ever on a global basis. This year, 2015, \nis on course to be even warmer yet. This translates into damage to our \nrural economy not only in terms of our forestry, our fishing, and our \nfarming, but also in terms of the economic impact that occurs from the \ndamage. The damage we see today is going to only get worse in the years \nahead. These rural industries will suffer, and American livelihoods \nwill suffer.\n  It is irresponsible to continue business as usual. We need to \ndramatically change course. We need to pivot from a fossil fuel energy \neconomy to a renewable energy economy.\n  The Clean Power Plan sets achievable standards to reduce carbon \ndioxide emissions by 32 percent of 2005 levels by the year 2030--strong \nbut achievable standards. We have the technology today, but do we have \nthe political will? Or is this body going to be ensnared by the \npowerful lobbying of the Koch brothers and the fossil fuel industry, \nwhich have announced they are going to spend $1 billion in the next \nelection to make sure their policies are the ones adopted in this room \nand that their policies will guide our future.\n\n  Well, how about this? How about we have policies that are the \npolicies related to the welfare of American citizens, related to the \nwelfare of our farmers, our fishing industry, and our forest industry? \nHow about we fight for rural America instead of being led astray by the \nKoch brothers and the fossil fuel industry?\n  We know the Clean Power Plan will have a powerful, positive impact \nthat will provide significant public health benefits, reducing \npremature deaths from powerplant emissions by nearly 90 percent, and \nthat will avoid 3,600 premature deaths, will lead to 90,000 fewer \nasthma attacks for children, and will prevent 300,000 missed work and \nschool days. We know this plan will create tens of thousands of jobs \nwhile driving new investments in cleaner, more modern, and more \nefficient technologies. We know it will save the American family nearly \n$85 on their annual energy bill.\n  Fewer deaths are a good thing. More jobs are a good thing. Saving \nfamilies money is a good thing. So let's fight for good things. Let's \nnot follow the path my Republican colleagues are proposing, in which \nthey are saying no to reducing bills for families, they are saying no \nto creating good-paying jobs, they are saying no to improving public \nhealth, and they are saying no to saving lives. Well, let's say yes.\n  It has been said that we are the first generation to feel the impacts \nof global warming and the last generation that can do something about \nit. This is a moral challenge to our generation of humans on this \nplanet--on our beautiful blue-green planet. This responsibility rests \nnot with some future generation or some past generation but with all of \nus right now. This resolution to try to torpedo the most effective \nmeasure America has ever adopted in the past or in the present is, in \nfact, deeply, deeply misguided.\n  Let's turn back to the test President Theodore Roosevelt put before \nus when he said that there is no more important mission than leaving \nthis land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us. Our \nchildren and our children's children are counting on us to act. They \nare counting on us to save jobs, to save lives, and to save our planet. \nWe must not fail this test.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nadministration's Clean Power Plan. I think the first thing that must be \nsaid--and said over and over, especially this week, with so many \ncritical issues facing our country, with appropriations bills pending, \nwith the transportation bill pending, with perhaps a motion to go to \nconference on the education reauthorization--is that we are wasting \nfloor time, that this piece of legislation has no chance. The threshold \nunder the Congressional Review Act is 51 votes, and while it is very \nlikely the threshold will be met, let's take this through the \nlegislative process.\n  This will eventually, if it passes the House--when it passes the \nHouse--reach the President's desk. Can you imagine that President Obama \nis going to enact legislation that overturns his signature and \nenvironmental achievement? Whether you agree or not with the Clean \nPower Plan, the idea that he is going to sign this into law is \npreposterous. So it faces a veto. So then the only question is this: \nCan you get 67 votes in the Senate? And the answer is a resounding no.\n  So let's put this in context. This is an important debate, but this \nis not likely to result in any kind of legislation one way or the \nother. But here is what this is about. The Clean Air Act requires the \nEPA--it doesn't authorize the EPA; it requires the EPA--to regulate \nairborne pollutants. So it doesn't allow the EPA to pick among airborne \npollutants and place limits; it requires that any airborne pollutant \nhave limits.\n  In 2007 the Supreme Court of the United States determined that \nCO2--carbon--was in fact an airborne pollutant, which is \nkind of intuitive and consistent with what every expert in the field \nunderstands. So the only question is this: Do you believe in the Clean \nAir Act? Do you believe there should be an exception in the Clean Air \nAct for carbon pollution? Do you disagree with the consensus among \nscientists that carbon is a pollutant? That is what we are voting on \ntoday. So carbon is a pollutant, and this is a pretty straightforward \npolicy issue, and it is a pretty straightforward scientific issue. The \nEPA must regulate emissions.\n\n[[Page S8005]]\n\n  Let's also understand how CRA works. This vehicle is to overturn the \nClean Power Plan. The way the statute runs is that it doesn't give the \nadministration--or any future administration--any flexibility to do a \ndifferent version of the same thing. It prohibits the administration \nfrom doing anything that is ``substantially similar.''\n  So the difficulty, of course, is that hasn't actually been tested too \nmany times in court. But the assumption most attorneys on both sides of \nthis question are operating under is that it would not just invalidate \nthis Clean Power Plan but prohibit the EPA from regulating carbon on a \ngoing-forward basis.\n  So if you have a specific concern, if you have a specific objection \nto the way this thing is administered, that is fair enough, but you \ndon't have the ability to tell EPA to go and do this again and submit \nit again. It will actually be illegal under a CRA. So CRA is an \nextremely blunt instrument. It is an extremely radical thing to do, and \nthat is what we are contending with.\n  So why, if all of that is true, is there a CRA vote this week? My \ninstinct is that it is designed to create confusion, to kick up dust, \nand to raise the possibility that the American government does not \nstand behind the Clean Power Plan as we go into the final throes of the \nParis climate talks.\n  Now, we have an opportunity here. We have 160 countries for the first \ntime in history committing to different versions--all executed from \nwithin their own governmental systems, but they are all committing to \ndifferent versions--of emissions reductions. Some of them have cap and \ntrade, some have incentives, some of them have regulations, some have \nfinancing programs, but all of them are committing to various programs \nto reduce carbon emissions. This is a significant international \nachievement.\n  In previous climate negotiations, folks who opposed international \nclimate action would actually go to these negotiations to create \nconfusion, to imply the American government was somehow not going to \nstand by its commitments. That is why I wanted to go through how the \nCRA works and what the inevitable outcome of this piece of legislation \nwill be, which is that it will be vetoed and that veto will be \nsustained.\n  The hope, I think, among people who oppose international climate \naction is that there is enough confusion going into Paris that someone \ncan point to America's national legislature and say: Well, there is no \nconsensus. That is true. There is no political consensus. But there is \nno practical way to overturn the Clean Power Plan, and there is no \ngoing back. I mean that is the most important aspect of this. This \nyear, 2015, of all the new power generation in the United States, the \nmajority of it was clean energy. The majority of new power generation \nin the United States was clean energy--how exciting.\n  I am not exactly sure why people fear the clean energy future so \nmuch. I understand we need to make a transition. The State of Hawaii \ndepends on low-sulfur fuel oil for the vast majority of its \nelectricity. I understand we can't make that transition overnight, and \nI understand there is going to be disruption and there is going to be \ndifficulty as we make a transformation of this magnitude, but we are \ngoing to have to make this transformation. It doesn't have to be a bad \nthing. It can create innovation jobs, it can attract investment \ncapital, and it can be a new American economy.\n  This is already happening. This is not pie in the sky any more. This \nis already underway. The majority of new power generation in the United \nStates is clean energy. Let's keep the momentum up. Let's support the \nClean Power Plan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I first want to thank very much the \nSenator from Delaware for his courtesy in this regard.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Vitter pertaining to the introduction of S. 2284 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. VITTER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                            Syrian Refugees\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I come to the floor to address the issue \nof climate change, but I am inclined to follow up on comments by our \nfriend from Louisiana who has just spoken.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, I am no longer the chairman of the \nhomeland security committee, but I am the senior Democrat. I have \nserved on the committee for about 15 years. The issue of the security \nof our homeland, whether from cyber attacks or terrorists or any other \nof number of threats, is something I care a whole lot about.\n  I am sure all of us recall when we had a special visitor who \naddressed a joint session of the Congress on the other side of the \nCapitol. His name is Francis, and he is the Pope. It was a Papal visit. \nHe addressed a joint session of Congress. I am not Catholic, but I was \nmoved, and I know a lot of our colleagues were moved, especially when \nhe invoked the Golden Rule in front of a national television audience, \nwhen he called on all of us to treat other people the way we would want \nto be treated, and also when he invoked the words of Matthew 25: When I \nwas hungry did you feed me, when I was naked did you clothe me, when I \nwas thirsty did you give me to drink, when I was a stranger in your \nland did you take me in?\n  When I hear of the prospect of a thousand or so Syrian refugees \ncoming to this country this year--and more next year--I think of the \ndesperate plight of people who are trying to escape the hellacious \nsituation in Syria and who have been living, in some cases months or \nyears, in refugee camps. What kind of moral imperative do we have with \nrespect to them? What kind of moral imperative? What kind of moral \nimperative do we have at the same time to ensure that the folks we \nallow to come in as refugees to this country--that we are going to \nprotect those of us who live here from possible threats that might be \ncaused by that immigration?\n  This week I learned a few things I didn't know before. There is a lot \nmore I have to learn. Among the things I have learned this week is that \nwhen refugees--whether in Turkey or someplace else in that or the other \nside of the world, in Pakistan or any other place--seek to come to this \ncountry, they don't get to just come. It is not like they say: I am \napplying under refugee status to come to the United States, and I would \nlike to come this week or this month or even this year. The average \nwait for folks in refugee status trying to get someplace out of a \nrefugee camp--and it could be here, but especially here, the average \nwait for refugees is not a week, it is not a month, it is not a year. \nIt is 1.5 years. For those of Syrian descent, the wait could be even \nlonger.\n  I am not going to go through all the hurdles folks have to go \nthrough, but it is a screening process that begins not with the \nDepartment of Homeland Security in this country. It is a screening \nprocess that begins way before that with the U.N. High Commissioner for \nRefugees. They first register refugees, they gather biometric data, and \nthey gather other background information. Only those who pass the U.N. \nassessment are ever referred to the United States for possible \nresettlement. Where they are looking to accept maybe 1,000 Syrian \nrefugees this year, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees may \ninterview 3,000, 4,000, 5,000 refugees, or more, to come up with a list \nof 1,000 that we would even consider. Those refugees are interviewed \nnot when they get off a plane here, but overseas, before they ever get \non a plane. Before they ever get on a plane, they go through multiple \nbackground checks and vetting and use biographical checks conducted by \nthe State Department, security advisory opinions from intelligence and \nother agencies for certain cases, National Counterterrorism Center \nchecks with intelligence agencies for support, the Department of \nHomeland Security and the FBI biometrics checks, and the Department of \nDefense biometric screening.\n  Then, after going through all of that, if they get here, they have \nthe opportunity to be interviewed again face-to-\n\n[[Page S8006]]\n\nface by the Department of Homeland Security folks who are trained to \ninterview people alleging to be refugees. They could be something else. \nThen, if they get approved to stay here as a refugee, we continue to \nmonitor them for an extended period of time.\n  A year or so ago there was great concern with Ebola. We had a lot of \npeople coming across the border from Mexico, and they were going to \nhave Ebola and infect us all and a lot of people were going to die. Not \none American died from Ebola contracted here.\n  So I would have us take a deep breath, try to gather the facts, and \nreally understand what somebody has to go through as a refugee to get \nhere. It is not overnight; it is not a 1-week or a 1-month deal. If I \nwere a bad guy wanting to come here and create mischief, I sure \nwouldn't go as a refugee. I wouldn't cool my jets for a year and a \nhalf, trying to get through that process. I would find another way.\n  Mr. President, that is not what I wanted to talk about. I want to \ntalk a bit about one of our favorite subjects, climate change and \nglobal warming.\n  I will start off with a map here of New Jersey, Maryland, \nPhiladelphia. In between Philadelphia and the Delmarva Peninsula is my \nState, the State of Delaware. This is probably hard to see from up \nthere or on television, but the outline of this map is Delaware today. \nA couple hundred years from now, if we don't continue to make progress \nin reducing carbon dioxide, Delaware will not look like the outline of \nthat map. It is not going to look like the green. It will be somewhere \nbetween the outline of that map and the green that we see here that \ndepicts Delaware. For us, this is real. These are our homes, these are \nour farms, the places we live and raise our families. So for us, this \nis something that is serious.\n  Long before I ever moved to Delaware, I served as a naval flight \nofficer in the Navy during the Vietnam war and served in Southeast Asia \nand other places. Long before I ever did that, long before I went to \nOhio State to study economics, long before I moved to Virginia, I was \nborn in West Virginia. I was born in a coal mining town. My dad, coming \nout of Shady Spring High School in Beaver, WV, was for a short while a \ncoal miner. Even after my sister and I had grown up and left West \nVirginia--she after being in the third grade and I in the second \ngrade--we would come back and visit my mom's parents, my grandparents, \nin Beaver, WV, right outside of Beckley. A coal miner named Mr. Meaders \nlived next door to my grandparents. He had a big field of about 2 to 4 \nacres right next to my grandparents' house. He would come home from \nwork at about 4 or 5 in the afternoon. He always had his coal mining \nclothes on. He had mined coal for decades. He also owned a cow, and he \nkept his cow in a shed on that 3-, 4-, 5-acre field. When he would come \nhome, he would clean up, and then he would milk his cow and he would \nlet us milk his cow. Mr. Meaders didn't make his living off the milk \nfrom that cow. He made his living as a coal miner. And he wasn't the \nonly person in West Virginia who made their living mining coal. There \nare still a number of people in West Virginia whose income is derived \nfrom mining coal.\n  West Virginia is one of the top five coal-producing States in the \ncountry, among Wyoming, Kentucky, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. The \nnumber of people employed in the coal mining business in each of those \nStates today--as opposed to when I my sister and I were little kids \nrunning out with Mr. Meaders to milk his cow--has come down a whole \nlot. But for these people, these are good-paying, life-sustaining jobs \nfor their families.\n  So we try to figure out--not just in Delaware, not just in America, \nbut around the world--how do we reduce the threat from high levels of \ncarbon in our atmosphere? Is there a way to do that? Is there a way to \ndo that that is also respectful of the needs of people in Wyoming, West \nVirginia, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Kentucky, who are trying to make \na living and all they want to do is mine coal? That is what they have \ndone maybe all their lives and want to be able to continue to do that. \nThe Golden Rule--again, is there a way we can somehow adopt a policy or \npolicies that are mindful of their needs to be able to sustain and \nsupport their own families, and at the same time to make sure in doing \nthat, they don't endanger the rest of us? That is the dilemma we are \nin. We have a moral imperative to look out for the coal miners and \ntheir families in those States I mentioned, and we have a moral \nimperative to look out for everybody else, including the folks here and \nup and down the east coast and west coast, and others whose lives are \ngoing to be changed if we don't continue to make progress. We want to \ncontinue to make progress with respect to reducing the amount of carbon \nin our air.\n  I think we can try to at least address both moral imperatives--to try \nto make sure the folks who for generations have mined coal can continue \nto do that in a way that is not just economically sustainable but \nenvironmentally sustainable, and do so in a way that actually looks out \nfor the legitimate interests of a whole lot of us who come from States \nwhere we don't mine coal.\n  One of the biggest sources of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere \ncontinues to be coal-fired plants. We generate electricity. It used to \nbe that about 40 percent of the electricity in the United States came \nfrom coal-fired plants, maybe another 20 percent or so from nuclear \npowered plants, another 20 percent or so from natural gas-fired plants, \nand the rest from hydroelectric, solar, wind, and so forth. That mix \nhas changed a little bit. Today, coal is down to about 30 percent. \nNatural gas, in terms of generating capacity, is up to about 30 \npercent. Nuclear is still in there at about 20, adding a couple nuclear \nplants in the next few years, maybe building some smaller, modular \nplants. We are generating ever more electricity from wind, a bit more \nfrom solar and from geothermal and hydro. But coal is down from 40 to \nmaybe 30 percent, and the projection is that maybe by 2030 it will be \ndown from 30 percent to as low as 20 or 25 percent. That is going to \ncreate some hardship for the folks in those States, including my native \nState. Is there some way that we can actually help them while at the \nsame time helping those of us who aren't from those five States?\n  For as long as I can remember, I have heard people, including from \nthis floor, for many years talking about Robert Byrd, who was the \nformer majority leader, dean of the Senate, and maybe the longest-\nserving person in the House and Senate in the history of our country. \nHe was a big champion of clean coal technology. Since approximately \n1997, we have pursued clean coal, carbon capture, and sequestration. I \nam told that just in this last decade we have spent about $20 billion, \nsince maybe 2005--something like that, in the last decade--and we have \na success story. We have had a lot of disappointments, but we have a \nsuccess story. I want to share that with our colleagues today.\n  The success story on U.S. clean coal is a project in Southwest Texas, \nin Houston, where there is NRG, a big utility company. That project is \na clean-coal project generating electricity. It is going to come online \nsometime next year. There are other projects under way, and we are \ncontinuing to invest a lot of money in clean-coal technology. We need \nto continue to do more.\n  The last thing I want to say is this. We face many threats to our \nNation these days. ISIS is certainly one of those. There are also other \nterrorist threats. Cyber security is certainly a threat we face. We \nhave an obligation to our grandchildren and their grandchildren to be \nable to make sure we address those threats.\n  This is not a battle that the United States can win alone on those \nfronts--nor with respect to our climate change concerns. It is going to \ntake a coalition of many nations, and we are one of those nations. We \nare one of the nations that put as much CO2 in the air as \nanybody else. We have an obligation to try to figure out how to reduce \nthat amount and how to reduce the threat. We need to be a leader and \nnot just say to other nations that they should do this but also that \nthey follow our example. What we are trying to do is to lead by our \nexample.\n  At our church, our pastor sometimes will say: I am preaching to the \nchoir, but even choirs need to be preached to. The other thing he will \nsay from time to time is this: I would rather see a sermon than hear a \nsermon. For the rest\n\n[[Page S8007]]\n\nof the world, they don't want to hear a sermon from us on climate \nchange. They want to see the sermon.\n  What we are trying to do over the next 15, 20 years is to reduce our \nCO2 emissions since 2005 by about 30 percent and leave it up \nto the States--not EPA calling shots and not micromanaging--to figure \nout what works best in their States and to help them help us meet that \nnational target. Thirty percent reduction from 2005 to 2030--that is \nthe deal. That is the goal. My hope is that we will do our part. We \nwill provide the leadership that is needed, not by what we say but by \nwhat we do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:30 \np.m. today, all time on S.J. Res. 24 be considered expired and the \nSenate vote on passage of S.J. Res. 24; further, that following the \ndisposition of S.J. Res. 24, the majority leader be recognized to make \na motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 23; that if the motion to proceed is \nagreed to, then all time under the Congressional Review Act be \nconsidered expired and that the Senate vote on passage of S.J. Res. 23.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for such time as I shall consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, at 5:30 p.m. today, two votes are going to \ntake place on the two CRAs--one by Senator Capito and one by Senator \nMcConnell, as he just referred to.\n  The Congressional Review Act is something really good that has come \nalong for a reason. A lot of people don't understand that the \nbureaucracy gets out of hand sometimes. I was listening very \nattentively to my friend from Delaware. When I see some of the \nregulations that come through, I am wondering: How in the world could \nthis happen? These are things that we have voted on over and over, as \nwith the case of cap and trade, which is what we are talking about now. \nOur first one was the McCain-Lieberman act of 2003, then again in 2005, \nand then the Warner-Lieberman act of 2008. And Waxman-Markey didn't \neven come to the Senate floor because they knew they didn't have the \nvotes for it. Each one of these was rejected by the elected Members of \nthe Senate and by a larger margin each year.\n  It is interesting what this President has done. He has taken the \nthings that people don't want and has said: Well, if we can't do it \nthrough legislation, we will do it through regulation.\n  We have seen time and again that he has followed this. It is really \ngoing to come to a screeching halt this time because there are some \nthings that are going on that people are not aware of. There are a lot \nof legal problems with Obama's carbon rules--especially his power plan.\n  Right now we have 27 States, 24 national trade associations, 37 rural \nelectric co-ops, 10 major companies, and 3 labor unions representing \njust under 1 million workers. They are now challenging the final rule \nin court. This chart shows you the States that are challenging the rule \nin court. A lot of these entities have requested a judicial stay, which \nwould likely put these rules on hold until early next year. While the \ncourts work through the numerous other challenges, time is going to go \nby and time is certainly not their friend.\n  I was listening carefully to what my friend from Delaware was saying. \nOne observation I have is that the people have caught on. In 2002 it \nwas very lonely standing here at this podium in this Chamber, and no \none else wanted to be a part of that discussion. Yet, at that time, the \nranking of people, insofar as what they thought about the legitimacy of \nthe argument that the world was coming to an end because of global \nwarming, was either No. 1 or No. 2. I am talking about the polls that \nwere across the nation at that time.\n  Now that same poll last March that said that global warming was the \nNo. 1 concern back in 2002 is now No. 15. People have caught on. They \nrealize that the cost is going to be exorbitant, and they realize it is \nnot going to accomplish anything. I don't have any doubt that once the \ncourts assess the merits of these challenges, the Obama \nadministration's power plan will not survive judicial scrutiny.\n  President Obama and Administrator McCarthy are equally aware of their \nlegal vulnerabilities, which is why Obama's Agency deliberately slow-\nwalked the implementation process to try to prevent any CRAs or \nnegative court rulings prior to the International Climate Conference in \nDecember. It has already been done over there. It is going to get very \nactive here in a matter of just a few days.\n  POLITICO had an article a week ago that reported that the \nadministration has asked the DC Circuit to postpone decisions until \nafter December 23. What does that tell you? It tells you that they \ndon't want to go over to the International Climate Conference for the \nbig show and then walk in and find out that nothing is going to happen \nover here in this country and where the people are in terms of this \nissue.\n  The Agency's lack of legal authority is not the only reason for \nbipartisan opposition to the administration's carbon regulations. The \nPresident's power plan alone would cost $292 billion, resulting in \ndouble-digit electricity price increases in 46 States. That is \nconservative. We have documentation from MIT and from many of the \norganizations saying that the cost of this type of cap and trade is \nsomewhere in the range of between $300 billion and $400 billion a year.\n  The Presiding Officer and I are very concerned about the State of \nOklahoma. In the State of Oklahoma, every time I hear a figure that \ntalks about trillions or billions of dollars, I find out how many \nfamilies in my State of Oklahoma paid Federal income tax, and I do the \nmath. This would cost somewhere around $3,000 a family--an average \nfamily in Oklahoma. You couple that with the fact that nothing is \nhappening only here. If you believed in all the dangers that you hear \nabout with CO2 emissions, if you really believe that to be \ntrue, that would not be true in terms of what we are talking about now. \nThe first Administrator of the EPA who was supported by President Obama \nwhen asked the question if we were to pass this regulation or pass the \nlegislation on cap and trade, would this have the effect of reducing \nCO2 emissions worldwide, said no, it wouldn't because it \nwould only affect the United States of America. If that is the case, \nthen it is not going to affect the other countries.\n  In fact, you can carry it one step further. If we have very tight \nrestrictions in this country where our manufacturing base is forced to \ngo to other countries, and then there are countries that don't have any \nemission requirements at all, it has the effect of increasing, not \ndecreasing, the emissions.\n  We had a hearing in the Environment and Public Works Committee, which \nI chair, and we had as one of the witnesses Harry Alford. Harry Alford \nis the President of the National Black Chamber of Commerce. He talked \nabout how any type of a cap-and-trade scheme is unfair to very poor \npeople. He estimated that the Obama power plan would result in an \nestimated job loss of nearly 200,000 jobs for Black Americans and more \nthan 300,000 jobs for Hispanics. The increased energy cost undermines \nglobal competitiveness for American small business and energy-intensive \nindustries. These companies will ultimately shut down here at home \nwhere the electricity bill becomes unaffordable and create jobs instead \nfor our competitors, such as China.\n  I can remember talking to China at the various meetings such as the \nInternational Climate Conference meeting that is coming up at the end \nof next month. They are hoping that something will happen where we are \ngoing to restrict our manufacturing base because they are the \nbeneficiaries of that.\n  The EPA has consistently acknowledged this. The former Administrator, \nLisa Jackson, says that U.S. action alone is not going to have any \nreduction. Her job didn't last too long after she made that statement.\n  The current Administrator, Gina McCarthy, testified that the \nPresident's power plan is not about pollution control but rather about \nsending a signal to the rest of the world that the United States is \nserious about addressing global warming. The minuscule\n\n[[Page S8008]]\n\nbenefits that might come would be hardly measurable to this country.\n  Lastly, I would like to mention something that people don't talk \nabout very often, and that is, there is something good about the \nprocess that we have available to us, the CRA--the Congressional Review \nAct. There are a lot of people who are of liberal nature, and they like \noverregulation. They don't mind it a bit. I am talking about Senators \nand House Members now. They go back to their States, and they get hit \nby all the business communities that say: We can't compete because of \nthe overregulation of EPA. The response is always this: Well, I have \nnothing to do with that; the unelected bureaucrats are doing that.\n  That is not true. You need to carry this message back with you. The \nCRA is there so that a person cannot tell the people at home that he is \nopposed to regulations that he is really supporting, because what is \ngoing to happen tonight--I can tell you right now--is that both of them \nare going to pass. But they are not going to pass them by a two-thirds \nmargin. That means that they will go to the House, and they will pass \nthem. They will go to the President's desk, and he will veto them. \nTherefore, it is going to take two-thirds to override a veto. They will \ncome back for a vote. Those individuals who always rejoice in not \nhaving to vote and getting on record are going to have to vote on them. \nThat is a neat deal. It is going to happen. You are here in on it right \nnow.\n  That reminds me a little bit about Copenhagen, back in 2009. I \nremember so well that they were all going over there. That was back \nwhen the Democrats controlled the House, the Senate, and the White \nHouse. They made it a real issue. They put on quite a show over there. \nPresident Obama went over. Pelosi went over. John Kerry went over. They \nall talked about the 192 nations that were there and how we were going \nto pass cap and trade as legislation. This is 2009. I went over at the \nvery last conference and told them they were telling the truth. We are \nnot going to pass it. In fact, there weren't 30 votes in the Senate \nthat would pass it at that time. Of course, that is what ended up being \nthe case.\n  There is a real setback that happened 6 days ago. You may have \nnoticed that Secretary of State Kerry made the public statement that \nnothing would be binding on the United States that came out of the \nInternational Climate Conference. Immediately, the President of France \nand all the others were outraged, saying that he must have been \nconfused. They used the word ``confused.''\n  Right now the big fight that is going on is not Republican or \nconservatives and liberals. It is between those participants who are \nall for restrictions on emissions. That is what is going on now. I \nthink the vote this afternoon is going to be a very important one. I \ncan assure you that anyone who wants to vote against this can go ahead \nand do it. But keep in mind that this is going to pass. It is going to \nbe vetoed by the President. It is going to come back for a veto \noverride. Everyone is going to be on record. Here it is. These are the \nStates that are currently anticipating the process of putting together \nlegal action to stop this outcome. It is a very important vote this \nafternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n          Terrorist Attacks Against France and Syrian Refugees\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I wish to begin by echoing the \ncondolences shared by millions around the world regarding last week's \nattacks in Paris. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and \nloved ones of those who died. As a nation, we remain committed to \nsupporting and defending the people of France in whatever way we can.\n  The attacks in Paris last week remind us again of the dangerous world \nin which we live. Although Paris has become the focus of attention, the \nday before the attacks in France, two ISIS suicide bombers in Beirut \nblew themselves up, killing 40 people in a bustling urban area. Our \nthoughts and prayers go out to the people in Beirut and to all those \nwho have suffered loss at the hands of this horrific terrorist \norganization.\n  ISIS remains one of the most brutal and indiscriminate terrorist \norganizations in recent history. Its campaign of violence is not \nlimited to a specific region, nationality or religion. As the events in \nParis have shown us, the threat posed by ISIS reaches well beyond the \nborders of Iraq and Syria. If it can, ISIS will spread its campaign of \nviolence to innocent people all over the world.\n  The United States, as a champion of freedom and democracy, has a duty \nto stand up against ISIS's brand of radical Islam and stomp it out \nwherever it exists. ISIS represents a clear and present danger to the \nAmerican people and our allies and it must be stopped.\n  President Obama, when asked about ISIS the day before the Paris \nattacks, made the following statement. He said:\n\n       I don't think they're gaining strength. . . . From the \n     start our goal has been first to contain, and we have \n     contained them.\n\n  ``We have contained them.'' Those were his words. Unfortunately, ISIS \ndoes not appear to be contained. My colleague from California, the \nranking member of the Intelligence Committee, responded this week by \nsaying:\n\n       I've never been more concerned. I read the intelligence \n     faithfully. ISIL is not contained. ISIL is expanding.\n\n  Yet yesterday President Obama, unbelievably, doubled down on this \nfailing strategy by stating: ``We have the right strategy and we're \ngoing to see it through. . . . '' And when referring to the Paris \nattacks, he called them a ``setback.'' Based on the number of \ncasualties and population of France, this attack was the equivalent of \na 9/11. I would hardly call such an attack a mere ``setback.'' When it \ncomes to the U.S. strategy against ISIS, one thing is clear: ISIS \ncannot simply be contained. ISIS must be defeated.\n  From what we have learned so far, most of the terrorists involved in \nlast week's Paris attack were individuals who already resided in France \nand Belgium. That means these are individuals who became radicalized at \nhome, received training or support from ISIS, and in some cases \ntraveled to Iraq or Syria for training and then returned to France to \ncarry out these attacks. Since ISIS first occupied territory in Iraq \nand Syria and began recruiting foreign fighters, the possibility of \nthese combatants returning home has been a concern to the United States \nand to our allies, and this attack in Paris demonstrates the validity \nof that concern. As a nation we must remain vigilant in defending our \nhomeland against this type of attack by radicalized individuals holding \nU.S. or European passports.\n  I also wish to speak for a moment about the Syrian refugee crisis \nbecause it ties into everything that has happened in that region of the \nworld. As we are all aware, the regime of Bashar al-Assad is \nresponsible for the civil war in Syria that allowed ISIS to gain a \nfoothold and to expand. Assad used chemical weapons on his own people \nand hundreds of thousands of lives have been lost as a result of the \nconflict he created. It is completely understandable that the peace-\nloving people of that country want out.\n  Just this week, several of my colleagues sent a letter to President \nObama expressing concerns about the possibility of ISIS infiltrating \nthe Syrian refugee population and asking what is being done to \nthoroughly vet these refugees. Over half the Governors in this Nation \nhave stated they don't want Syrian refugees resettled in their States. \nI share their concerns. The United States should not accept Syrian \nrefugees as long as there is a threat posed by ISIS. If we cannot be \n100 percent certain that additional refugees from Syria do not put \nAmericans at risk, the President's plan to accept up to 10,000 \nadditional refugees this year should be rejected. If the President \ntries to act unilaterally, Congress should cut off funding to prevent \nthe President from taking any action that would put the American people \nat risk.\n  If we are going to be serious about solving the Syrian refugee \ncrisis, the answer is not deciding which countries are accepting how \nmany refugees, the answer is to defeat ISIS and remove Basher al-Assad \nfrom power so the\n\n[[Page S8009]]\n\npeace-loving people of Syria can return home.\n  On that point, I want to speak about a realistic strategy for \ndefeating ISIS. So far the United States has relied almost entirely on \nairstrikes. Prior to the attacks in Paris, France was already the \ncoalition partner conducting the second greatest number of airstrikes \nagainst ISIS. Those airstrikes have been ramped up in recent days, but \nthis is not a fundamental shift in our strategy. Airstrikes are \nimportant, but ultimately they cannot be a solution in and of \nthemselves.\n  It was President Obama's politically motivated decision to withdraw \ntroops from Iraq that ultimately led to ISIS expanding into Iraq to \nbegin with. President Obama stated yesterday that boots on the ground \nwould be a mistake, but it was his decision to withdraw U.S. troops \nthat is partially responsible for creating this problem, and now we are \nat a point where retaking territory from ISIS will require ground \nforces. There is no way around it. If President Obama is going to be \nrealistic about defeating ISIS, he needs to form a coalition capable of \ntaking the war to ISIS on the ground. That does not require the United \nStates committing ground troops, but it does require the United States \nleading by example and forming a coalition capable of fighting both in \nthe air and on the ground. The President needs to stop talking about \ncontainment and start acting on a strategy that will root out and \ndefeat ISIS wherever it can be found.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I have the honor of being the ranking \nDemocrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and earlier today I \nhad a chance to be with the other Members of the Senate and the \nAmbassador from France to express our solidarity, our condolences about \nthose who lost their lives in the attack last Friday night, and to \nexpress America's resolve to work with our French partners to root out \nISIL.\n  Let it be clear, our policy is to degrade, defeat, and destroy ISIL \nwherever it may be, any place in the world. We will retake the \nproperties and lands they currently control, and we will destroy their \noperation. That is our commitment, and that is what we must do. We will \nprotect U.S. citizens, our homeland. That is one of our most solemn \nresponsibilities. We will do that by having the strongest possible \nsecurity screening measures for those who enter our country. We will do \nthat by enhancing our intelligence-gathering capacity not only here in \nthe United States because we have taken major steps since the attack on \nour country on September 11, but we need a seamless system with our \nallies in Europe and our global partners to share timely information so \nwe can track those who want to do harm to us and so we can apprehend \nforeign-trained fighters who have joined the terrorists and then go \nback to Europe or try to enter the United States. We need to know where \nthey are, apprehend them, and get them out of our community.\n  Let me mention a couple of issues that have come to light just \nrecently; that is, our policies with regard to refugees. I want to make \nit clear that we have to have the most stringent security screening, so \nthat when we are settling refugees, we don't allow anyone with any \nassociation to terrorist organizations to be able to enter the United \nStates.\n  I also think it is important that we understand the current \nprocedures and processes that are in place and how it differs \ndramatically from Europe. In Europe, they literally have millions of \nrefugees who are fleeing Syria and who get into Europe. They usually \nget in at a border country to the Middle East, over water, and then of \ncourse enter Europe and can travel throughout that continent. There is \nvirtually no screening.\n  In the United States, before we will resettle a refugee under the \nauspices of the United Nations, there is a requirement for an in-person \ninterview, biographic checks, interagency checks, biometric screening, \nincluding fingerprinting, initial case review by the Department of \nHomeland Security before an in-person interview, and it goes on and on \nand on.\n  My constituents and the Presiding Officer's constituents want to make \nsure that those security screenings are strong enough to make sure \nterrorists can't get into the United States, and we have a \nresponsibility to make sure that in fact is the case, but I also point \nout that millions travel to the United States freely through our \nborders because it is a small world and people travel. They travel here \nfor vacation, and they travel here for family. We have relationships \nwith many countries, a program known as the Visa Waiver Program, where \nindividuals can travel to the United States without obtaining a \nvisa. It is interesting that if a person has a French passport, they \ncan enter the United States without a visa. So we need to make sure \nthat anyone who attempts to come to America, we know that; that if they \nare dangerous, we have that information, and as a result we can prevent \nthem from entering our country.\n\n  I say all of this because I hope that what happened in France will \nenergize us in unity to carry out our most important responsibility, \nwhich is to keep America safe and keep Americans safe. We need to do \neverything we can, whether it is going after terrorists or protecting \nour homeland, to make sure Americans are kept safe.\n  Madam President, shortly we will be voting on the Congressional \nReview Act, the regulatory review act which will allow us to vote on \ntwo regulations on the Clean Power Plan rules that have been \npromulgated by the administration. I urge my colleagues to reject these \nresolutions that would prevent these regulations from going forward. In \nother words, I urge my colleagues to allow these regulations to go \nforward that deal with the Clean Power Plan rules.\n  There are four reasons I say that. First and foremost is the public \nhealth reason. We have a responsibility for the public health of the \npeople of this Nation, and clean air is critically important. The \nnumber of children who suffer from asthma will go up dramatically if we \ndon't clean up our air. Premature deaths will go up. There is a direct \ncost to our public health as a result of ignoring what we can do for \ncleaner air in America.\n  Clean air has an effect on our economy. When a parent can't go to \nwork because they have a child suffering from asthma because the air is \nnot clean to breathe, that is a day lost from work. It affects our \neconomy. We also know that if we rely more on clean energy and \nrenewable energy sources, that is stronger for economic growth. It \ncreates more jobs. So for the sake not just of our health but for the \nsake of our economy, it is important that we take the appropriate steps \nto make sure we have clean air.\n  Yes, there is also the issue of our environment. Climate change is \nreal. We should follow the recommendations of the experts, not \nnecessarily the politicians. The experts tell us that our activities on \nEarth are affecting the rate of change in climate, that they affect the \nstability of the world in which we live, and that we can do something \nabout it for a more positive outcome.\n  The extreme weather conditions that we have seen all too often--I \ncould talk about what has happened in my own State of Maryland and the \nimpact it has had on the Chesapeake Bay. We know that. Scientists are \ntelling us that. It is because the carbon emissions are accelerating as \na result of our activities on Earth. Scientists say we can do something \nabout it. Scientists have told us we can do better in the way we \ngenerate power in reducing carbon emissions. That is not a heavy lift; \nit is something we can do.\n  Shortly, the world will meet in Paris to come together, I hope, on a \nway that we can join, as an international global community, in a \nstrategy to reduce our carbon emissions. The United States must \nexercise leadership. President Obama has done part of that leadership \nby the promulgation of these power plan rules.\n\n[[Page S8010]]\n\n  Lastly, this is a matter of national security. We know that we have a \nlimited amount of fossil fuels. We know that. We also know that \nrenewable energy sources are becoming more energy independent, and that \nis smart for our national security concerns.\n  So for all of those reasons, I urge my colleagues to reject the \nresolution that would prevent these regulations from going forward.\n  I just want to give by way of example what is happening in my own \nState of Maryland. Maryland is well underway in complying with these \nrules. We are there. We will be there. We have shown that we can make \nthese types of investments, and by the way, we would create more jobs \nin doing this. Creating clean power generation will help our economy. \nAs I said earlier, it helped Maryland's economy. So we have been able \nto move forward in aggressive steps for clean energy production. But \nMarylanders breathe air that is polluted by the generation of power in \nother States. We need a national policy. It can't be done just by a \nState. We need a national policy, and that is what these clean power \nrules do.\n  I urge my colleagues to follow the best science. Allow America to \ncontinue to be the world leader. Do what is right for the public \nhealth, for our economy, for our environment, for our future, and \nreject these efforts that would block these rules.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's new rules on carbon dioxide, which I \nbelieve need to be rescinded.\n  On August 3, 2015, the EPA released its so-called Clean Power Plan. \nThis final plan will impose a 32-percent reduction nationwide in \nCO2 emissions in the existing electric power sector compared \nwith 2005 levels. This is an increase from a 30-percent reduction \noutlined in last year's proposed rule.\n  North Dakota's mandated reductions, however, far exceed those levels. \nThe EPA originally proposed an 11-percent reduction, but then in the \nfinal rule that went from 11 percent to a 45-percent reduction. Let me \nrepeat that. For our State, the EPA put out a proposed rule and said \nNorth Dakota has to reduce by 11 percent. Then, without reissuing a new \nproposed rule or anything else, EPA said in the final rule, no, it is \nnot an 11-percent reduction in the State of North Dakota, it is a 45-\npercent reduction. Not only does that create real problems in real \nterms as far as our industry addressing that level of reduction, but I \nthink it raises real questions as to whether EPA followed the law and \nregulation in promulgating the rule.\n  It is critical to communicate the impacts this rule will have on our \nState and across the country, especially in our electricity generation \nand mining sectors. People need to know that thousands of workers' \nfamilies and communities across the country will be negatively impacted \nby this rule.\n  On September 30, 2015, I hosted a meeting with North Dakota's coal \nindustry and regulators to meet with Janet McCabe, the EPA Assistant \nAdministrator in charge of issuing the new carbon dioxide rule. We \ndirectly communicated our State's opposition to the rule. We also \ncalled on the EPA to provide greater flexibility by recognizing the \ninvestments and advances made by industry in reducing CO2 \nlevels and North Dakota's unique coal and geographic resources.\n  As a result of the meeting, EPA officials agreed to provide \nflexibility for the State to submit its State implementation plan, its \nSIP. Essentially, instead of requiring a plan in 1 year, we will be \nable to provide a draft plan in 1 year, with 3 years to submit the \nfinal SIP. We also received a commitment from the EPA to send technical \nstaff to North Dakota so that the Agency can hear firsthand from North \nDakota regulators and officials about the challenges in complying with \nthe Agency's mandate.\n  Also, here in the Senate, I am working with colleagues on several \nlegislative efforts to halt and repeal this rule. As a member of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, I worked to include language in the \nfiscal year 2016 interior and environmental funding bill to block the \nEPA from implementing this rule. We are working to include this \npriority in the fiscal year 2016 Omnibus appropriations bill that \nCongress will take up in the coming weeks.\n  I have also joined with Senator Capito of West Virginia to introduce \na bipartisan bill, the Affordable Reliable Energy Now Act, or the ARENA \nAct. This legislation would empower State Governors to protect \nratepayers from increases and ensure the reliability of the electric \ngrid. At the same time, it would prevent the EPA from mandating \nunproven technology or withholding highway funds from States not in \ncompliance with the rule.\n  Further, I am cosponsoring the resolutions of disapproval under the \nCongressional Review Act to repeal the new EPA regulation which we are \nconsidering on the Senate floor right now and which we will be voting \non in a little more than half an hour. The Congressional Review Act, or \nCRA, authorizes Congress, by a majority vote, to repeal actions by a \nFederal agency after they are formally published and submitted to \nCongress.\n  In North Dakota, we have successfully adopted an ``all of the above'' \napproach to energy development, and we have demonstrated that we can \nutilize our natural resources to do it with better environmental \nstewardship. EPA's new rules on carbon dioxide neither reflects our \nState-led approach nor accounts for the significant investment our \nindustry and workers have already made to improve the way electricity \nis generated in our State, and that is true across the country.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote for Senator Capito's CRA which \ndisapproves the EPA's carbon rule for existing electric utility \nsources, as well as Leader McConnell's CRA to disapprove the EPA's rule \nfor new sources.\n  We can produce more energy with better environmental stewardship, but \nthe way to do it is not by shutting down powerplants and destroying \njobs as well as raising costs on hard-working families and small \nbusinesses. Instead, we need to create a business environment that will \nattract more investments so that the industry can develop and deploy \nnew technologies that help us produce more energy more dependably and \nmore cost-effectively while at the same time promote better \nenvironmental stewardship. That is the right way to do it. That is the \nway we are doing it in North Dakota.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise today to speak about this battle \nand regulatory war being waged by the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, the Senate considered two measures aimed at rolling \nback ill-thought-out rules by the EPA--the waters of the United States \nrule. The body did the right thing in stating our bipartisan resolve \nagainst the rule.\n  Unfortunately, here we are again, another week, another proposed rule \nto massively expand the EPA's power, and another attempt by this \nadministration to stomp out America's coal industry. That is exactly \nwhat the Clean Power Plan is--a miscalculated regulation aimed at \nkeeping coal in the ground at any cost.\n  This latest travesty of a rule, known as the Clean Power Plan, \nrequires States to develop and implement plans to reduce carbon \nemissions between 2022 and 2030 in order to accomplish interim and \nfinal emission goals established by the EPA. Let me clarify that. This \nis actually not one rule but three separate rules which, taken \ntogether, would be more aptly named the ``No Power Plan.'' The Clean \nPower Plan includes a final rule to revise carbon pollution standards \nfor new, modified, and reconstructed power plants; a final rule to \nrevise carbon pollution standards for existing power plants; and \nthirdly, a Federal plan for enactment and enforcement of the other two \nrules. Simple, right? No.\n  Under the guise of flexibility and cooperation, the CPP requires \nStates to choose between two types of plans, described by the EPA as an \n``emission standards'' approach or a ``state measures'' approach. Some \nStates, such as my home State of Wyoming, will have some terrible \nchoices to make under the CPP. Under the final rule, by the year 2030, \nWyoming's carbon emissions will have to be 44 percent lower than in \n2005, which is the baseline year the\n\n[[Page S8011]]\n\nEPA uses for the plan. That is more than double the 19-percent \nreduction the EPA imposed upon Wyoming in the proposed rule, which was \nreleased about 18 months ago, in June of 2014.\n  As Wyoming's Governor Matt Mead said recently when my home State \njoined 23 others in suing the EPA to strike down the rule, ``The fact \nthat the agency more than doubled the damage to Wyoming in the final \nrule shows arbitrary and capricious action.''\n  Not only that, this plan puts the onus on the States to figure out \nhow they are going to do it, and that is so the EPA can avoid a cost-\nbenefit analysis that they are required to do. But not if they force \nthe States to do it! But, of course, if the States don't do it, then \nthe EPA will have to do it, which means the agency should have done a \ncost-benefit analysis to begin with. But the EPA doesn't have a very \ngood track record on cost-benefit analyses.\n  One of the regulations, the mercury air toxins rule, is going to \nprovide about $500 million in benefits over a 10-year period. It is \nhard to determine what those benefits are or how the EPA did the \ncalculations. None of it is transparent. But the compliance cost for \nthat $500 million in benefits is up to $43 billion a year. Couldn't we \nincentivize somebody to come up with a better system for a whole lot \nless than $43 billion a year, to save $500 million over 10 years? That \nis another example of an arbitrary and capricious action.\n  So how does Wyoming wind up with such a huge burden under the Clean \nPower Plan? Because the Clean Power Plan supposes it will achieve \ncarbon emission reductions from electricity generating units that burn \nfossil fuels--coal, oil, and natural gas. States that produce these \nfuels are the hardest hit. Wyoming is the largest coal-producing State \nin the Nation. Wyoming produces 40 percent of the Nation's coal, and \ncoal represents almost 40 percent of the electricity generated in this \ncountry. It is abundant, affordable, clean and, most important, it is \nstockpilable. If the power plants that produce energy from fossil fuels \nlike coal are forced to shutter their doors to make dramatic structural \nchanges, it will have tangible negative impacts on fossil fuel \nconsumers. If that doesn't alarm you, it should, because according to \nthe National Mining Association, every person in America uses 20 pounds \nof coal a day.\n  Of course, when we are talking about CO2, we are also \nbreathing CO2, and plants need CO2. There is an \ninteresting invention in Wyoming. A guy figured out how to grow plants \nvertically, and Whole Foods has some of his mechanisms to be able to do \nthat, and you can actually cut your own vegetables while you are in the \nstore. I asked him why he isn't doing greenhouses with this. He said: \nNot enough CO2. Yes, plants rely on CO2 to live. \nI suggested that he locate near a power plant, where they can absorb \nthe CO2 and use the waste heat from any power plants and \nhelp feed America at the same time. We need to be more innovative in \nwhat we are doing instead of just trying to put businesses out of \nbusiness because we don't like the business.\n  As I said, under the Clean Power Plan, Wyoming will have to reduce \nits carbon emissions by 44 percent. That isn't just a problem for \nWyoming or the 27,000 people employed in the coal industry and the \nripple effect it has on people who work with the things that people in \nthe coal industry use. If you represent Illinois or Missouri, you \nshould be worried about CPP, too, because in 2013 each of those States \nreceived more than 10 percent of Wyoming's coal. Wisconsin, Kansas, \nArkansas, and Michigan each got 5 percent of Wyoming's coal. Wyoming's \ncoal was distributed to Georgia, Alabama, Colorado, Louisiana, \nMinnesota, and Arizona. If I didn't list your State, don't think this \nissue doesn't affect you. More than a dozen other States and foreign \nentities got smaller amounts of Wyoming coal in 2013.\n  According to the National Mining Association, which commissioned the \nreport on the Clean Power Plan after it was released, the plan would \ncost $366 billion and bring double-digit electric rate increases to 43 \nStates. That is more than a 10-percent increase to 43 States. All this \nbecause of the administration's vendetta against coal and power plants \nthat burn it and provide energy.\n  Just this week the EPA held a hearing in Denver and received public \ncomments on the proposed Federal plan to implement the Clean Power \nPlan. That is right. Even though 26 States are suing the EPA to block \nthe plan's implementation, the Agency is going ahead with a rule to \nimplement it. At that hearing, Mickey Shober, a county commissioner \nfrom Campbell County, WY, also known as the energy capital of the \nNation, had a chance to speak. Campbell County has 11 surface mines \nthat produce over 340 million tons of coal every year, the majority of \nwhich is delivered by train to about 30 States across the country for \nelectricity generation. All in all, Campbell County coal provides about \none-quarter of the Nation's electricity every year. That is one county. \nSo when a Campbell County commissioner gets up to talk about power \ngeneration, everyone should pay attention.\n  As Commissioner Shober pointed out, the coal industry has \nhistorically stepped up and dealt with every new regulation and \nchallenge the Federal Government has thrown at it, but the new \ntechnology and innovation--the type that will have to be utilized, if \nthere is any way for new and existing power plants to comply with this \nrule--takes time and takes money. As the commissioner said, America's \nenergy industry always rises to the challenge, but the EPA isn't \nfighting fair this time. This rule needs to be scrapped in its current \nform, and that is exactly what these joint resolutions of disapproval \nwill do.\n  Congress has provided billions of dollars in incentives for solar and \nwind energy. Wyoming produces a lot of solar and wind--primarily solar, \nbecause Denver is the Mile High City and you have to go uphill to get \nto Wyoming. There are high plateaus across the southern part of the \nState. The first wind turbines that went in Wyoming had to be \nredesigned because the wind blew so hard that it blew the rotors off. \nAt 80 miles an hour, the rotors on wind turbines will not stand up. \nThey will generate a tremendous amount of power. Most of that power \ngoes out of State, and other States use it but claim offsets from their \nwind power because it doesn't carry any of these bad connotations from \nthe EPA. Wyoming has to claim all of carbon emissions from the coal and \nthe coal-fired power plants, though most of the electricity produced is \nsent out of State. So Wyoming gets no credit for the energy it \nprovides, but we get all the disadvantages associated with providing \nenergy.\n  General Electric wanted to build a test facility in Wyoming to figure \nout better ways to burn coal. They went through all the permitting \nprocess to the point of building it. Then they said: Wait a minute. \nUnder this President, who is trying to get rid of coal, who would we \nsell our product to? So they postponed the project.\n  I have spoken of why this rule is bad for my home State of Wyoming \nand why it is bad for any State that consumes fossil fuels, but I would \nbe remiss if I didn't address the reasons the Clean Power Plan is bad \nfor the United States. At the end of this month, the President is going \nto send his team of environmental experts and negotiators to the U.N. \nClimate Summit in Paris. That summit aims to map out a global accord to \nlimit greenhouse gas emissions. The emissions goals described in CPP, \nwhich have been rejected by industry and rejected by almost half the \nStates, are at the heart of this administration's plan to contribute to \nthe overall global emissions reduction. To make commitments to our \nallies based on the plan which doesn't have the support of the American \npublic is nothing short of irresponsible and disingenuous. We are \nliving in a dangerous, complicated, frightening world--a world that \nforces our Nation to rely daily on its friends for priceless assets, \nsuch as shared intelligence and safe havens at which to strategically \nposition our military troops around the globe. The very least America \ncan give our allied partners in return is our candor.\n  Incidentally, I heard the comments about the growing cases of asthma. \nThere has been a reduction in the amount of CO2, so why \nwould these coal-fired power plants be elevating that health problem? \nOne problem that we have out West is called regional haze here, but we \ncall it smoke from forest fires. This summer we had tremendous smoke \nfrom forest fires and it\n\n[[Page S8012]]\n\nwasn't just smoke, it was ash as well. There hasn't been a power plant \nputting out ash in decades, but when we don't do the proper stewardship \nof our forests, we let them burn. If we allowed some of that to be cut \ninto boards for houses, it could reduce the cost of housing, and the \nCO2 would be trapped forever, not burned up and released \ninto the air and blamed on coal.\n  I am hoping my colleagues will come together today to show our \nconstituents where we and the world stand on the Clean Power Plan.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, I want to congratulate the \nstudents, faculty, and parents of Washington Elementary School, located \nin Valley City, ND, on being awarded the 2015 National Blue Ribbon \nSchool Award.\n  Founded in 1982, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program recognizes \npublic and private elementary, middle, and high schools where students \nperform at very high levels or where significant improvements are being \nmade in students' academic achievement. A National Blue Ribbon Schools \nflag overhead has become a mark of excellence in education recognized \nby everyone from parents to policymakers in thousands of communities. \nSince the program's founding, the U.S. Department of Education has \nbestowed this coveted award to just over 7,500 of America's best \nschools.\n  Washington Elementary School serves nearly 265 students in grades 4 \nthrough 6 and was the only school in North Dakota to receive the honor \nof exemplary high-performing school in 2015. Receiving recognition as a \nNational Blue Ribbon School signifies the hard work and dedication of \nthe educators, students, and parents involved, and I have no doubt its \nstudents are on a path to success. At Washington Elementary, every \nstaff member understands that every student, regardless of background, \nis important and deserving of the best. To support its students, the \nschool provides access to a reading program that has been vital in \nensuring targeted assistance for those students who require additional \nsupport. Through this program and others, the school continues to excel \nand surpass necessary benchmarks.\n  As school leadership states, ``The success of Washington Elementary \ncannot be attributed to one person, program, or initiative. Rather it \nis the collective effort of all the outstanding people involved--the \nstudents, staff, parents, and community members who continue to strive \nfor excellence each and every day.'' It is through this dedication that \nthe school provides access to a reading pilot program that enhances \nreading and language skills, a math and science curriculum supplemented \nby STEM activities, and history courses that emphasize creativity and \nflexibility in teaching.\n  The Valley City Public Schools mission statement reads, ``Together we \nare building a legacy of excellence, one student at a time.'' This \nmission embodies all that Washington Elementary is working to \naccomplish by looking at the needs of each individual student as well \nas providing a safe and respectful learning environment that breeds \nsuccess. I wish the very best to the community of Valley City and \ncongratulations to all engaged at Washington Elementary for achieving \nthis high honor. Thank you for your commitment to our children and \nleaders of tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/17/senate-section/article/S8013-4", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8013-S8014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING MELVIN HANCOCK\n\n Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize with \ntremendous pride the life and legacy of a very dear friend and an \nextraordinary West Virginian, Roy Melvin Hancock. Melvin was an \ninspiration to so many because of his deep-rooted passion for the city \nof Beckley. It is a privilege to formally recognize the impact that \nMelvin had on southern West Virginia through his dedication and \ndetermination to building a stronger community.\n  There was truly no one who loved Beckley more than Melvin. Throughout \nhis life, Melvin had a persistent calling to make Raleigh County a \nbetter place. His love of Beckley even earned him the title of ``Mr. \nBeckley.''\n  It was through the YMCA of Southern West Virginia that Melvin \nlaunched his lifelong mission of community improvement. After \ngraduating from Woodrow Wilson High School and Marshall University, Mel \nreturned to Beckley in 1970 and started his remarkable 25-year career \nat the YMCA.\n  Melvin's meaningful contributions and achievements during his career \nat the YMCA are truly immeasurable. As a leader at the YMCA, Melvin \nwanted to make sure that Beckley's finest residents were recognized for \ntheir inspirational work in the community; therefore, he created the \nSpirit of Beckley Award. For the past 29 years, this annual award has \nbeen given to those who strive to make Beckley a better place. This \nyear, Melvin was posthumously honored with the award. There is truly no \none more deserving.\n  Because of Melvin's leadership and guidance, there are numerous YMCA \nprograms that still exist today. Melvin understood that, in order to \ncreate a\n\n[[Page S8014]]\n\nstronger community, it is critical to inspire our young ones. That is \nwhy he concentrated many of the Y's programs on expanding opportunities \nfor our kids. He grew the organization's programs, camps, and \ntournaments in a variety of sports, and he established the Biddy-Buddy \nBasketball Tournament, the Annual Invitational Swim Meet, the YMCA Day \nCamps, and the YMCA Pre-School. He was also instrumental in the \ndevelopment of the Paul Cline Memorial Soccer Complex facility.\n  In addition to his efforts to promote Beckley's youth, Melvin also \nwas the organization's lead fundraiser, establishing the annual \ninternational dinner, coordinating the membership drive, and raising \nthe funds for the current YMCA facility that serves local families.\n  There is no doubt that the YMCA of Southern West Virginia would not \nbe what it is today without the dream and devotion of Melvin Hancock. \nHe went above and beyond in creating opportunities for Beckley \nresidents through the YMCA and in reaching the goals he wanted to \naccomplish for the organization and for the area's families and kids.\n  After ending a purposeful career at the YMCA, Melvin went on to lead \nthe fundraising efforts at Mountain State University. There, he helped \nfulfill many university development projects, including the Robert C. \nByrd Library, Carter Hall, the Max Lewin Bell Tower, the John W. Eye \nConference Center, the gymnasium, and the dormitories. The university \nflourished under his direction.\n  Melvin continued his great work after leaving Mountain State \nUniversity through fundraising efforts at Friends of Coal, the \nFellowship of Christian Athletes, and Ronald Blue and Associates.\n  After his retirement, he continued to be an active member of the \ncommunity by pushing for the renovation of the Bobby Pruett Stadium and \nthrough substitute teaching in Raleigh and Fayette County schools. He \nespecially loved the little ones in pre-K, kindergarten, special \neducation and physical education. The students loved ``Mr. Mel.''\n  Melvin was dedicated to giving back to the Beckley community until \nhis very final days. His last endeavor was a special project for the \nWomen's Resource Center to help those who have been victims of domestic \nabuse.\n  Melvin not only loved his community, but he was devoted to his \nfamily--his wife, children, and the many members of his extended \nfamily. He was active in his church, he loved history, he was \npassionate about antique automobiles, he enjoyed being outdoors, he was \nloyal to his alma maters, and, of course, he loved to dance.\n  It is such an honor to celebrate Melvin's life and recognize his many \naccomplishments that have helped to shape the Beckley community. I will \nforever be grateful for Melvin's unwavering leadership and for his \ncountless years of service. Melvin's memory will continue to serve as \ninspiration for me and so many others to dedicate ourselves to the \nbetterment of our communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/17/senate-section/article/S8014-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neimann, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/17/senate-section/article/S8014-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               2015 NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY--PM 32\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit the 2015 National Drug Control Strategy, my \nAdministration's 21st century approach to drug policy that works to \nreduce illicit drug use and its consequences in the United States. This \nevidence-based plan, which balances public health and public safety \nefforts to prevent, treat, and provide recovery from the disease of \naddiction, seeks to build a healthier, safer, and more prosperous \ncountry.\n  Since the release of my Administration's inaugural National Drug \nControl Strategy in 2010, we have seen significant progress in \naddressing challenges we face along the entire spectrum of drug \npolicy--including prevention, early intervention, treatment, recovery \nsupport, criminal justice reform, law enforcement, and international \ncooperation. However, we still face serious drug-related challenges. \nIllicit drug use is a public health issue that jeopardizes not only our \nwell-being, but also the progress we have made in strengthening our \neconomy--contributing to addiction, disease, lower student academic \nperformance, crime, unemployment, and lost productivity.\n  Therefore, we continue to pursue a drug policy that is effective, \ncompassionate, and just. We are working to erase the stigma of \naddiction, ensuring treatment and a path to recovery for those with \nsubstance use disorders. We continue to research the health risks of \ndrug use to encourage healthy behaviors, particularly among young \npeople. We are reforming our criminal justice system, providing \nalternatives to incarceration for non-violent, substance-involved \noffenders, improving re-entry programs, and addressing unfair \nsentencing disparities. We continue to devote significant law \nenforcement resources to reduce the supply of drugs via sea, air, and \nland interdiction, and law enforcement operations and investigations. \nWe also continue to partner with our international allies, helping them \naddress transnational organized crime, while addressing substance use \ndisorders and other public health issues.\n  I thank the Congress for its continued support of our efforts. I look \nforward to joining with them and all our local, State, tribal, national \nand international partners to advance this important undertaking.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, November 17, 2015.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/17/senate-section/article/S8014-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8014-S8015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:44 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 799.

A bill to suspend the admission and resettlement of aliens \nseeking refugee status because of the conflict in Syria until adequate \nprotocols are established to protect the national security of the \nUnited States and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to strongly urge the adoption of my \nbill, S. 2284, to stop the Syrian refugee resettlement program, unless \nand until we have complete and adequate safeguards in place for the \nsecurity of our homeland and all of our States. It is very clear to me \nthat we do not have those safeguards right now.\n  What my bill would do is stop the program for 270 days, demand a \nthorough review of all security issues related to the program, demand \nthat changes be made and brought before Congress, and that the program \nonly continue with the consent of Congress after we are assured the \nhomeland and all of our States will be fully protected. Again, it is \nvery clear to me that is not the case now.\n  I expressed strong concerns and opposition to this program from the \nvery beginning. When I first learned of it in September, I wrote \nSecretaries Kerry and Johnson regarding the real dangers of taking in \nthousands upon thousands of refugees from a country and an area of the \nworld where enemies of the United States are all around them, and that \nclearly it posed a danger of those terrorist enemies infiltrating the \nrefugee resettlement process. Tragically, we saw that happen and we saw \nthe horrible results in Paris last Friday. As we all know now, at least \none of those terrorists in Paris got into France under the Syrian \nrefugee resettlement program there, and that is the same danger that is \nposed to us.\n  Now, I have looked at this. I have had briefings on this. It is clear \nto me that we do not have adequate safeguards against this. Let me just \ncite one example of testimony in this regard. FBI Director James Comey \nhas testified that the Federal Government doesn't have the ability to \nfully vet 10,000 or more Syrians refugees. Recently, during a hearing \nbefore the House Committee on Homeland Security, Mr. Comey stated:\n\n       We can only query against that which we have collected. And \n     so if someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in \n     a way that would get their identity or their interest \n     reflected in our database, we can query our database until \n     the cows come home, but there will be nothing show up because \n     we have no record of them.\n\n  That puts in simple, straightforward terms the real danger--that we \ncannot properly vet all of these refugees. And this is not from just \nany part of the world or any country. This is from a hotbed of anti-\nAmerican terrorist elements.\n  There is an additional grave danger with the program as it stands \nnow, and that is our complete inability to track these individuals once \nthey are in our country. Unfortunately, I have an example of this right \nfrom my home\n\n[[Page S8023]]\n\nState of Louisiana. Just last week, a Syrian refugee was resettled into \nBaton Rouge. As of today, he is no longer there. He has gone missing. \nAllegedly, he, on his own, is relocating to Washington, DC. But from \nthe briefings I have had from the State police, no one is in contact \nwith him, no law enforcement or government agency is tracking him in \nany way, and he may or may not check in to a social service agency in \nWashington, DC. They have his information. Apparently, they are not in \ncontact with him.\n  Now, this is within a week of his being resettled into where he was \nsupposed to be, in Baton Rouge, LA, which I object to as a Louisianian. \nAgain, he allegedly is coming to Washington. By the way, our Nation's \ncapital is under high security alert. And no one knows exactly where he \nis. No one is tracking him adequately at all.\n  This clearly underscores the inadequacy of our current program. We \nneed to put a stop to this until proper, full, and aggressive \nsafeguards are in place. My bill, S. 2284, would do that. I am very \nhappy the House of Representatives is acting and considering similar \nlegislation.\n  I believe Congressman Graves will be introducing my legislation in \nthe House, and the House may take up this matter as soon as Thursday. I \nhope that they do, because it is very time sensitive and our security \nis at stake. I hope that we do, by considering this and similar ideas \nabsolutely as soon as possible. We must put a stop to this. We must put \nreal security measures in place. We must not allow the flow to continue \nuntil we do.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Schatz, and Mrs. \n        Murray):\n  S. 2289. A bill to modernize and improve the Family Unification \nProgram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, children raised in loving and supportive \nhouseholds grow up to become more productive individuals, benefiting \nboth the individual child and society at large. However, housing \ninstability is linked to poor outcomes for children. Unsafe housing \nconditions and homelessness can threaten a child's safety. These \nconditions are often the reason for an investigation by the local child \nwelfare agency, out-of-home placement, or a delay in family \nreunification.\n  Homelessness can also lead parents to voluntarily place their \nchildren in foster care while they search for housing. Families may \nalso be separated because of shelter policies that exclude teenagers, \nespecially boys. Further, youth aging out of the foster care system are \nparticularly vulnerable to homelessness because they must make the \ntransition to adulthood without support, financial or otherwise, from \nparents or other trusted guardians.\n  In Virginia, the Governor's office reported that as of September 2015 \nthere were 5,140 total children in the Virginia foster care program. \nFor fiscal year 2015, the average annual cost of foster care in \nVirginia was almost $47,000. Further, in 2013 Virginia had \napproximately 550 youth age out of the foster care system at age 18 \nwithout being connected to families. Nationally, over one-fifth of \nchildren who age out of the foster care system will experience \nhomelessness at some time after age 18.\n  The Family Unification Program, FUP, an interagency collaboration \nbetween the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to provide housing vouchers to \nyouth aging out of foster care and families involved with the child \nwelfare system. Some of these vouchers also include supportive \nservices, such as money management skills, job preparation, educational \ncounseling, and proper nutrition and meal preparation. Research has \nshown that housing vouchers, coupled with supportive services, promotes \nfamily stabilization and reduces youth homelessness.\n  While these vouchers have yielded some success, the connections \nbetween HUD and HHS are often inadequate to provide effective \nassistance. Further, no dedicated source of funding is available for \nthe supportive services promised, and too often families and youth are \nleft without the help they need.\n  That is why I am pleased to introduce with my colleagues Senator \nCollins, Senator Schatz, and Senator Murray, the Family Unification, \nPreservation and Modernization Act. This legislation modernizes and \nimproves FUP vouchers, as well as creates and provides supportive \nhousing for at-risk youth and families involved with the child welfare \nsystem. By utilizing a housing first model, similar to the one used to \ncombat veterans' homelessness, this legislation will ensure safe and \nstable housing for youth and families. This bill also strengthens the \nconnections between local public housing agencies and child welfare \nagencies to promote family stabilization and reunification, replaces \nthe arbitrary 18-month time limit for youth vouchers with a more \nworkable 36-month time limit, expands youth eligibility to those who \nare 18 to 24 who have left foster care at age 14 or older or will leave \nfoster care within 90 days and are homeless or at risk of becoming \nhomeless, provides competitive grants for supportive services \nspecifically targeted to FUP recipients, and promotes self-sufficiency \nby providing incentive payments to successful, data-driven \ninterventions that improve outcomes.\n  My wife Anne and I have been long-term supporters in improving our \nchild welfare system. When I served as Governor, we worked together to \nreform Virginia's foster care system. I am proud to introduce this \ncommonsense, bipartisan legislation that will ensure family \npreservation and reduce youth homelessness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/17/senate-section/article/S8023-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8023-S8024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 314--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR DESIGNATION OF THE THIRD \n         TUESDAY IN NOVEMBER AS ``NATIONAL ENTREPRENEURS' DAY''\n\n  Mr. MORAN (for himself and Mr. Booker) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, it was 1 year ago this week that President \nObama announced he would use his Executive authority to reform our \nbroken immigration system. The President said we should prioritize the \ndeportation of those who have been convicted of serious crimes or those \nwho pose any threat to America's security. The Department of Homeland \nSecurity only has funding to deport a small fraction of the \nundocumented immigrants in the country.\n  So the President said: Let's make a priority. Let's focus our limited \nresources on deporting those who could do us harm. It seemed like \ncommon sense to most people. At the same time, the President said we \nshould not waste our resources deporting young immigrant students who \ngrew up in this country and would, in fact, if they were deported, tear \ntheir families apart.\n  The President's policies focused on deporting felons, not families--\ncriminals, not children. In 2012 President Obama established the \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, known as DACA. DACA provides \ntemporary--let me underline the word ``temporary''--immigrant status to \nimmigrant students who arrived in the United States as children. This \nprogram is based on the DREAM Act, a bill I introduced 14 years ago in \nthe Senate. That bill was introduced to give undocumented students who \ngrew up in America a chance to earn their path to citizenship. We call \nthem DREAMers. It was known as the DREAM Act. They were brought to the \nUnited States as kids, some as infants. They grew up in our country \npledging allegiance every day in the classroom to the only flag they \nhave ever known--the U.S. stars and stripes. They are proud and \npatriotic Americans in every sense but one: They are undocumented. They \nonly want a chance to work, to be part of America's future.\n\n  We have already invested in these young people. We have put quite a \nbit of our resources into making them what they are today. It makes no \nsense to walk away from this investment, does it, if that child, grown \nup now, could be an asset to the future of America?\n  So far, more than 700,000 of these young people have received the \nDACA protection, temporary status to stay in the United States. What \nhave they done with this opportunity? They have decided to do more to \nhelp our country--to become engineers, teachers, small business owners.\n\n[[Page S8028]]\n\n  DACA, I am sorry to say, is not a popular program with many of my \nRepublican colleagues. They have tried to shut it down. They want to \ndeport these DREAMers--2\\1/2\\ million young people who were brought to \nthe United States as infants and children, who have grown up in this \ncountry, have no serious criminal record, and who only want to be part \nof our future. Instead, the critics say, turn them away, deport them--\nmany times to countries they cannot even remember.\n  A year ago this week, President Obama established a new program that \nbuilt on DACA's success. It is called the Deferred Action for Parental \nAccountability, or DAPA. Under that program, undocumented immigrants \nwho have lived in the United States for more than 5 years and have \nAmerican children would be required to come forward, register with the \ngovernment, pay a fee, submit themselves to a criminal and national \nsecurity background check, and pay their fair share of taxes. This is \npotentially 11 million people. Are we safer as a nation if these 11 \nmillion--or a large part of them--come forward, register with the \ngovernment, pay their taxes, and submit themselves to a criminal \nbackground check? If they have a serious problem, if they have \ncommitted a crime, out they go. I am not going to defend them. But \nlet's give these people a chance to get temporary status in this \ncountry by paying their taxes, paying a fee, submitting to a background \ncheck, and registering with our government. If the government \ndetermines these parents haven't committed any serious crimes and don't \npose any threat to us, the President's order, on a temporary basis, \nsays they can work and will not be deported--temporary.\n  President Obama also expanded this to cover all DREAMers who came to \nthe United States as children and have lived here for at least 5 years. \nWhy did he take these actions? Because for years Congress has failed to \nfix our broken immigration system.\n  I remember the day--it was June 27, 2013, 2\\1/2\\ years ago--the \nSenate passed comprehensive legislation to fix our broken immigration \nsystem. The vote was 68 to 32. A substantial number of Republican \nSenators joined with Democrats in voting for this comprehensive reform. \nWe had spent, eight of us--the group of 8, as we were called--months \nnegotiating back and forth and back and forth on the toughest issues \ninvolving immigration. We reached a bipartisan agreement, brought the \nbill to the floor, and it passed. We were in the majority at that time \non the Democratic side, but we reached across the aisle to make sure \nenough Republicans could support us so that we could have a bipartisan \nsolution to our immigration challenge.\n  Unfortunately, the Republican majority in the House of \nRepresentatives at that time would not even consider--wouldn't even \nconsider--the immigration reform bill we passed. In the face of that, \nthe President had no choice. He could allow our broken immigration \nsystem to continue or step forward and try to make America safer and \nmore just.\n  The Center for American Progress, incidentally, says the economic \nbenefit of the President's Executive orders would have been \nsignificant. Both DACA for children and DAPA for their parents would \nincrease my State's gross domestic product by almost $15 billion over \n10 years and increase the earnings of all Illinois residents by almost \n$8 billion.\n  Unfortunately, both DAPA and the expansion of the earlier DACA have \nbeen blocked by lawsuits that have been filed by Republicans who oppose \nthe measure. These Republicans, who have the majority in the House and \nSenate, refuse to even consider any legislation to fix our broken \nimmigration system.\n  Well, last week, in a decision that was no surprise, a Republican-\nappointed judge--actually, a bank of judges on the Fifth Circuit Court \nof Appeals--sided with the Republicans who had filed a lawsuit and \nupheld an injunction that blocks DAPA and the expanded DACA Program. \nThe Obama administration announced they will appeal to the Supreme \nCourt. The Supreme Court has been clear in the past that Presidents \nhave the authority to set Federal immigration policy. I believe the \nPresident's actions will ultimately be upheld.\n  Over the years, I have come to the floor more than 60 times to tell \nstories about DREAMers. I used to give speeches about the general \nissue, and people didn't pay much attention. But then I started telling \nthe stories of the actual people who would be affected by the DREAM Act \nand by DACA. Today, I want to tell you another one.\n  This is Fernando Meza Gutierrez. Fernando's family came to the United \nStates from Mexico when he was 9 years old. He grew up in Los Angeles, \nCA, and he was an outstanding student. In high school, he was an \nadvanced placement scholar, and he received an international \nbaccalaureate diploma and the Achievement Award in Foreign Language for \nFrench. He was a student athletic trainer, president of the French \nclub, and tutored his fellow students in French, Spanish, and in math.\n  Fernando was also active in his community. He volunteered at nursing \nhomes, participated in canned food drives, beach cleanup, and \nThanksgiving dinners for the homeless.\n  Fernando continued his studies at Santa Clara University. Remember, \nas an undocumented student, he didn't qualify for a penny in Federal \nassistance--no loans, no Pell grants. But at Santa Clara University, \nFernando graduated cum laude with a double major in biology and French. \nDuring his time at Santa Clara, Fernando won the award for the best \npresentation in molecular biology at the West Coast Biological Sciences \nUndergraduate Research Conference. He worked at a research laboratory, \nwhere he studied how cells choose what kind of tissue they will become \nduring their development. Unlike the other students, Fernando could not \nbe paid for his work because he was an undocumented immigrant.\n  Fernando also continued to be active in his community. He was a \ncertified emergency medical technician, responding to on-campus medical \nemergencies. He participated in food drives, tutored high school \nstudents, worked with HIV patients in San Francisco, and volunteered \nfor soup kitchens.\n  Fernando is currently a third-year doctoral student at the University \nof California in San Francisco, studying biochemistry and molecular \nbiology. He is working in a lab in the Hellen Diller Comprehensive \nCancer Center. He focuses his research on how cancer cells get rid of \nproteins that are defective and potentially harmful or proteins that \nare no longer needed. His work could provide valuable insights into \nmany diseases and disorders, including cancer and autism. Fernando also \nmentors high school students and undergraduate students pursuing \ncareers in biomedical science.\n  Fernando sent me a letter, and this is what he said:\n\n       I'm thankful to this country for giving me the opportunity \n     to grow up in a safe environment, for the education I \n     receive, for the amazing people that have been a part of my \n     life, and for the culture in which I grew up. All these \n     factors have shaped my world view, my aspirations. . . . DACA \n     will allow me to contribute to America's biomedical research \n     work and potentially make discoveries that could improve the \n     lives of Americans and people around the world. This country \n     has given me an opportunity to pursue my passion for \n     biomedical research. In the future, I want to use my \n     expertise to contribute to this country and to make sure that \n     the United States remains the world's leader in biomedical \n     discoveries.\n\n  Fernando and many DREAMers like him have a lot to contribute to \nAmerica. I don't understand those who want to deport this young man, \nwho say: We don't need you, we don't need your talents, we don't need \nyour hard work, and we don't need your research. Of course we do. \nAmerica will be a better country if Fernando becomes a part of its \nfuture. That is what the DREAM Act does. That is what DACA does. That \nis what we are trying to achieve.\n  Instead of trying to deport young men and women like Fernando, I hope \nthe other party will support meaningful immigration reform that is fair \nand comprehensive.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/17/senate-section/article/S8028-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
