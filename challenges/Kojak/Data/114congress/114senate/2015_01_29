Mr. President, in the past few weeks we had a \nwhirlwind, but the Keystone jobs debate has been important for the \nSenate and for our country. We took about one dozen more rollcall votes \non amendments yesterday. That means the Senate has now taken more than \ntwice as many of these amendment votes on this bill alone than were \noffered or allowed all of last year.\n  We obviously had a busy afternoon yesterday, and we will continue it \nagain today. It has been an instructive exercise, too, because we \nlearned about more than just the lesser prairie-chicken. We also \ndiscovered something about this body. We learned that open floor \ndebates and open amendment processes require hard work, they require \ndedicated Members, and they require constructive cooperation from \nacross the aisle.\n  I thanked Senators Hoeven and Murkowski for their work before. I \nthank them again now. I note the efforts, once again, of colleagues \nsuch as Senator Cantwell.\n  The debate over these American jobs has shown that with bipartisan \ncooperation, it is possible to get Washington functioning again. This \ndebate is also proving the new Congress is ready to work and work hard \nfor the middle class, even in the teeth of opposition from powerful \nspecial interests.\n  Let's notch one more win for the middle class by passing this \nimportant infrastructure project. Constructing Keystone would pump \nliterally billions into our economy. It would support thousands of good \nAmerican jobs. As the President's own State Department has indicated, \nit would do this with minimal environmental impact.\n  The Keystone infrastructure project has been studied endlessly--\nendlessly--from almost every possible angle. The same general \nconclusion keeps becoming clear, build it. We need to build it.\n  Let's make some progress for the American people by voting to pass \nthe Keystone jobs and infrastructure bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/29/senate-section/article/S611-7", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me say at the outset while the \nmajority leader is still on the floor, it is true we have had a \nconstructive relationship during the last several weeks as we have \nconsidered this bill. Although\n\n[[Page S612]]\n\nthose of us on the Democratic side don't want to get comfortable in our \nminority status, we are determined to make sure it is, as described, a \nconstructive relationship.\n  To that end we have not used some of the tactics we have seen in past \nyears. We have not insisted on burning 30 hours and 60 hours at a time, \ncausing people who subscribe to C-SPAN to call their cable operators \nand say why am I paying for the Senate; nothing is happening. Instead, \nwe have tried to use that time to put together packages, bipartisan \npackages of amendments and we have been successful.\n  I hope we can continue with that. As long as there is mutual respect, \ngood faith, and cooperation, I look forward to in my role--as soon as \nSenator Reid returns--as the whip on the Democratic side to do our best \nto continue this constructive relationship.\n  I have said it before and I will say it again. What we have seen over \nthe last several weeks is the Senate I remember, the Senate I was \nelected to, the Senate where there was active debate, deliberation, \namendments. For some Members, it is a new experience. I hope in our \nrole as the minority we can work with the Senators with a feeling of \nmutual respect to achieve at least debate on the floor, if not some \nsignificant legislation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If the Senator would yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Illinois for his comments. I \nagree, this has been good for the Senate, good for both parties, and \ngood for America. We are getting back to normal, and I thank the \nSenator for his comments and for his cooperation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/29/senate-section/article/S612-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S612-S613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 29 days from today, on February 27, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security of the United States of America will \nrun out of money. The only way to prevent this is for Congress to pass \nlegislation to fund this Department. We should not even be debating \nwhether we are going to fund the Department that protects America from \nterrorism threats, but that is fact.\n  Republicans in the House, when we did the budget bill, insisted that \nwe would fund the entire Federal Government through September 30, \nexcept for the Department of Homeland Security. The reason they \nwithheld regular budget funding for that Department was they wanted to \nmake a political point. They are angered at President Obama for \nstepping forward with Executive orders on the issue of immigration, \neven though the same House Republicans have refused for over a year and \na half to call the comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed \nthis Senate on a bipartisan basis and refused for over a year and a \nhalf to address any aspect of immigration. In a fit of pique they said: \nWe are so angry President Obama is going to do something by way of \nExecutive order, we are going to withhold regular funding from the \nDepartment that protects America from terrorism.\n  What were they thinking? Look at the world we live in: a world of \nCharlie Hebdo, a world of beheading of Japanese journalists, a world \nthat is in danger of terrorist threat, and the United States has felt \nthat danger. We will never forget what happened on 9/11. After that \nexperience, we made the Department of Homeland Security a critical, \nviable part of America's defense against terrorism.\n  The Republicans have said: No, before we fund this agency, we have to \nhave five riders on the appropriations bill that attack President \nObama. Then we might consider giving regular funding to this \nDepartment. One aspect of those riders is particularly troubling.\n  It was 14 years ago that I introduced the DREAM Act, a simple \nconcept. Children brought to the United States by their parents who are \nundocumented should be given a chance--simple. Children who were \nbrought to the United States as infants and toddlers and had no voice \nin the decision of their family and end up here undocumented should be \ngiven a chance--a chance to complete school, to be good citizens, to go \non to college, to serve in the military, and then a path to legal \nstatus. It is not a radical idea.\n  At times many Republicans have openly supported the DREAM Act. When \nwe couldn't pass it I appealed to the President, at least protect these \nDREAMers from being deported. These kids did nothing wrong. They were \nbrought here by their parents. Why hold these children accountable? The \nPresident agreed and 2\\1/2\\ years ago created DACA.\n  DACA is an Executive order that says to these young people who would \notherwise qualify for the DREAM Act, you come forward, you identify \nyourself, you let us make sure you have no criminal record that would \nbe of worry to anyone, pay your fee, and we will allow you to \ntemporarily stay in the United States as a student or a worker without \nbeing deported. It is just that simple.\n  We estimate 2 million young children are eligible for the DREAM Act--\n2 million--and 600,000 have already registered under DACA, the \nPresident's Executive order.\n  What did the House Republicans say? They said, before we will fund \nthe Department of Homeland Security protecting America against \nterrorism, you have to deport the DREAMers, refuse to renew the DACA \nprotection for 600,000 who have signed up, and refuse to allow any new \nyoung person to sign up for this protection.\n  I have come to the floor for a long period of time and I will \ncontinue to because I want people to know what the DREAM Act means. It \nis something, I guess, of significance to stand and give a speech, but \nit truly doesn't touch people until they hear actual stories.\n  The story I wish to tell today is of a young woman whom I know. I was \njust with her in Chicago. Her name is Karen Villagomez. She was brought \nto the United States at the age of 2. Incidentally, that was the same \nage my mother was brought to the United States as an immigrant.\n  Karen was brought here at the age of 2 from Mexico. She grew up in \nChicago. She was an outstanding student, and she always had an interest \nin public service. In May of 2012 she graduated from the University of \nRochester in New York with a major in political science. She was not \nonly the first person in her family to graduate from a 4-year college--\nbecause Karen Villagomez is undocumented, she didn't receive one penny \nof government assistance. She made it through college on her own \nwithout any help because as an undocumented young woman that was the \nonly chance she had.\n  Just 1 month after she graduated, President Obama created the DACA \nProgram. After she applied and cleared and received DACA protection \nfrom deportation, she found a job as a paralegal in a law firm in \nChicago, where she has been working for the last 2 years.\n  I saw her 1 week ago Friday. She was in Chicago, and she is amazing. \nShe served as an intern in my office. She is one of the brightest, most \nengaging people one could meet. She looked me in the eye and said: \nSenator, I am going to law school. I have just been accepted. She is \nsupposed to start this fall. But if the House Republicans have their \nway, this fall she will find herself being deported from the United \nStates of America.\n  Think about it. All we have invested in her, all we have put into her \nlife in terms of education, not only K-12 but a college degree now, and \nthe House Republicans would say to Karen Villagomez: Thank you for \nbeing part of America, but no thanks, leave. Take whatever skills you \nhave, whatever determination you have to make a difference and take it \nsomeplace else. America doesn't need your idealism, the House \nRepublicans say.\n  I couldn't disagree with them more. If they have their way, Karen \nwould never attend law school. She will never be an attorney. She will \nbe deported back to Mexico, a country she hasn't lived in since she was \n2 years old.\n  Karen got up every morning in the classroom--just as we do on the \nSenate floor--and pledged allegiance to that flag. That is the only \nflag she knows. When she sings the national anthem, it is not the \nnational anthem of Mexico, it is the national anthem of the United \nStates of America. Karen wants to be part of the future of this \ncountry.\n  Two weeks ago when she joined me at Erie House in Chicago for a press \nconference, this is what she said:\n\n\n[[Page S613]]\n\n\n       DACA represents the values and heritage of this country of \n     immigrants; it was the right thing to do and it has changed \n     my life by replacing fear with hope. This executive action \n     gave me an overwhelming sense of relief and hope. It lifted \n     me from the shadows.\n\n  Karen's is one of 2 million stories of eligible young people who want \nto be part of the future of America.\n  It is time for the Senate to say no to the House on a bipartisan \nbasis. It is time for us to reject this hate-filled amendment process \nthey engaged in that put five riders on this appropriations bill to \npenalize young people such as Karen Villagomez.\n  Is that the face of the Republican Party of America--deporting Karen \nVillagomez and saying to her and others: You are not welcome in \nAmerica. Leave.\n  I don't think so. There are many Republicans who come to me and say: \nI support the DREAM Act. So let's support the DREAM Act. This is their \nchance. Step up and defeat these horrible riders that were attached to \nthis appropriations bill by the House Republicans. Step up and give us \na chance as a nation to renew our commitment to our diversity, to our \nheritage as a nation of immigrants, and to renew our commitment to \nyoung people such as Karen, whom we have told: If you work hard against \nthe odds and succeed, we want you to be part of our future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/29/senate-section/article/S613-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  CUBA\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, earlier this month I had a chance to visit \nCuba with a delegation of Senators and House Members. We met with Cuban \nArchbishop Jaime Ortega, who shared the wonderful story of Pope \nFrancis's efforts to improve relations between the United States and \nCuba and to secure the release of American prisoner Alan Gross.\n  We met with many Cuban reformers and activists, Cuban Foreign \nMinister Bruno Rodriguez, foreign ambassadors from many countries, \nvarious ministry officials, agriculture, telecommunications, science \nand technology, and the environment--all areas of considerable \npotential for the greater U.S.-Cuban cooperation.\n  Our visit came 1 month after President Obama secured the release of \nAlan Gross and made the historic decision to restore full diplomatic \nrelations with Cuba and begin rolling back over 50 years of failed \npolicies toward that island.\n  As I have said many times, I am not a fan of the Castro regime. It \nhas a troubling history of human rights abuse and suppressing peaceful \npolitical dissent. It has squandered the talents of so many of its own \npeople with a frozen economic and political system, and it has refused \nto provide a full accounting of the tragic death of Cuban activist and \npatriot Oswaldo Paya.\n  But I have also argued that our policy toward Cuba, which has spanned \n11 different U.S. Presidents, has failed--and failed miserably--to \nbring reform and change in Cuba. Our policy toward Cuba has also hurt \nthe United States and our diplomatic standing in the rest of Latin \nAmerica and the Caribbean, where many--fairly or unfairly--regard U.S.-\nCuban policy as an outdated relic of the Cold War.\n  So I was delighted and fully supportive when President Obama took \nthis bold move. During my visit I could already see the dividends, most \nnotably in the expressions of hope by the Cuban people. If you go down \nthe streets of Havana, on their pedicabs there are American flags. That \nwould have been unthinkable 2 months ago. Now it is part of their \nstatement that it is time for a new relationship between Cuba and the \nUnited States.\n  As one Cuban activist starkly told me, her talks with others around \nthe island highlighted something she thought had been lost to the Cuban \npeople--a sense of hope.\n  We need to do all we can to fulfill the hopes of the Cuban people, \nand one easy way is to provide greater engagement with America, with \nideas, with energy, with the vibrancy that our Nation can offer.\n  I am going to join today with my colleagues: Republican Senators \nFlake, Enzi, Moran, and Boozman, as well as Democratic Senators Leahy, \nUdall, and Whitehouse, to introduce legislation that will lift the \nremaining travel restrictions on American travel to Cuba. \nRepresentatives Sanford and McGovern will have a similar bill in the \nHouse.\n  President Obama recently eased these restrictions, but we need to do \nour part in Congress. It is not only the right thing for the Cuban \npeople; it is the right thing for America. Americans shouldn't have \nrestrictions on their freedom to travel. We don't restrict Americans \nfrom traveling to nations with whom we fought wars such as Vietnam, and \nwe don't restrict Americans from traveling to countries with troubling \nregimes--North Korea, Iran, and Uzbekistan.\n  During the height of the Cold War, Americans were allowed to travel \nto the Soviet Union. So why not Cuba? Why do we still isolate this \ncountry? Some say that this is a repressive regime, and we don't want \nto show recognition to this regime.\n  It is just within this week that our President visited Saudi Arabia \nto attend the memorial service for the late King of that country. I \nwould daresay there are aspects of the human rights policy of Saudi \nArabia which aren't even close to American standards, and yet we \nconsider them a valuable ally.\n  There is also a lesson in history. When the Soviet Union started to \ncome down, it was cracking on the edges, in the Baltics, and in the \nWarsaw Pact. As the other republics saw the outside world, they saw the \nopportunity and the need for change.\n  We have not prevailed with isolation. Let's engage the Cuban people. \nLet's engage their economy. Let's engage their minds in thinking about \na 21st century far different than the dark days of communism which they \nhave lived under for so many decades.\n  I know that several of my colleagues here--particularly those of \nCuban descent--have strong, strong personal and family feelings about \nour relationship with Cuba. I don't diminish that one bit. There is \nreal suffering that has taken place by their families and many others.\n  But I hope we can look to the future, look to the next generation, \nand look to the possibility that we can engage Cuba in a positive way. \nUltimately, it will be this new flow of American engagement and ideas \nthat will help open Cuba and improve the lives of their people.\n  Certainly, we ought to try something different. There have been 50 \nyears of isolation, and those 50 years have not worked. Today we are \ntaking the first few steps on a path which I strongly support.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/29/senate-section/article/S613-2", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The \nmornings I stay here, I run down to the Lincoln Memorial, come back by \nthe Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and I am reminded of the 55,000 lives \nthat we lost in that war. Yet we enjoy normal diplomatic relations with \nthat country, and they\n\n[[Page S614]]\n\nenjoy most-favored-nation status with us.

Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to bring a clean \nfiscal year 2015 bill for the Department of Homeland Security to the \nSenate floor as soon as possible.\n  Earlier this month the world watched in horror as terrorists \nmassacred journalists and other innocent civilians in and around Paris. \nIn December we were stunned as computers at a major corporation, Sony \nEntertainment, were attacked by North Korea. Over the past year, as \nrecently as last week, in fact, we witnessed brutal executions at the \nhands of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.\n  These events illustrate all too well that the threats faced today by \nAmerica and by our allies are real. As a former chairman and now \nranking member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, I know this to be the case.\n  Nearly 12 years ago, in the wake of the terrorist attacks of 9/11, \nCongress created the Department of Homeland Security--we call it DHS--\nto help secure our Nation and to help ensure that our Nation is \nprotected against these continuing and evolving threats.\n  Given the origins of the Department, the work the men and women do \nthere every day to keep us safe, and the grave nature of the threats \nour country faces, it is shocking to me and disappointing to me that we \nare here today having this debate.\n  We are now discussing ways we can make the Department and its \nemployees more effective. We are not discussing how we can enable them \nto work better. Senator Coburn and those with whom we served in the \nlast Congress did that throughout the year.\n  Senator Johnson and I did that just yesterday with our first hearing \non the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee this year. \nUnbelievably, as we focused on cyber security attacks, we are debating \nwhether to give this key national security agency funding for the \nremainder of the fiscal year.\n  In order for that Department to efficiently and effectively carry out \nits critical role, it needs adequate and reliable funding. They need \nit. Another short-term budget--or even worse, another shutdown--would \nbe bad for the Department and bad for employee morale--very bad. More \nimportantly, though, it would pose a grave threat to our security.\n  Instead of sending us a straightforward clean funding bill for the \nDepartment, the House has unfortunately sent us a bill that includes a \nnumber of amendments aimed at undermining the President's immigration \npolicies.\n  Many of our colleagues on both sides have significant concerns with \nthese amendments, and the President has indicated that he would veto \nthe funding bill if the amendments stay attached to it. Thus, these \namendments jeopardize passage of the bill, and they threaten to prolong \nthe crippling budget uncertainty the Department of Homeland Security \nhas operated under.\n  The Department of Homeland Security already has a lot to say grace \nover. We do them no favor by playing games with their budget.\n  I understand why some of our colleagues are upset about the \nPresident's immigration policies, and we should have a debate about \nthose concerns. But first we should be doing what we have been asked to \ndo by giving the Department of Homeland Security the resources that it \nneeds to keep Americans safe in an ever more dangerous world.\n  Two of our colleagues, Senator Jeanne Shaheen and Barbara Mikulski, \nhave introduced a clean appropriations bill that mirrors funding \nprovisions of the House bill. Overall, funding provisions in their \nbill, S. 272--which I understand both Democrats and Republicans on the \nAppropriations Committee agreed to last year, last December--in fact, \nprovides for $39.6 billion in discretionary funding for the Department \nof Homeland Security. That is an increase of $400 million above last \nyear's funding, but this measure is more than just a funding bill.\n  To my colleagues who want to do what we can now to protect our \ncountry from the kinds of attacks we have been seeing around the world \nof late, I say: Support a clean DHS funding bill.\n  To our colleagues who want reforms at the U.S. Secret Service, I say: \nSupport a clean DHS funding bill. A clean bill would provide the \nresources the Secret Service needs to carry out much-needed reforms in \nthe wake of the most recent White House fence-jumper incident and other \nsecurity lapses.\n  To my colleagues whose States need to recover from this week's \nblizzards or to prepare for the next storm, let me just say: Support a \nclean DHS funding bill.\n  We need to ensure that FEMA and our States have access to nearly $2.6 \nbillion in grants to respond to future disasters--both natural and \nmanmade.\n  To my colleagues who want stronger border security and immigration \nenforcement, a clean DHS funding bill is what we ought to be rallying \naround. The clean bill put forward by Senator Shaheen and Mikulski \nwould take additional measures to secure our border and enforce our \nimmigration laws, something I know is a priority to me and, I think, to \nall of our colleagues. In fact, most of the funding increase in the \nShaheen-Mikulski bill would go to border security and immigration \nenforcement.\n  The bill our colleagues have put forward contains a little more than \n$10 billion for Customs and Border Protection, an increase of \napproximately $118 million above last year's enacted level. This \nfunding level would support the largest operational force level for the \nAgency in its history--maintaining over 21,000 Border Patrol agents and \nsupporting the new funding level for nearly 24,000 officers.\n  The Shaheen-Mikulski bill would also enable Customs and Border \nProtection to fly more patrols along our maritime and land borders and \nto continue purchasing new force-multiplying gear and equipment. It \nwould also increase funding for critical surveillance technologies \nalong our border, especially along areas such as the Rio Grande Valley, \nby some $20 million.\n  As our colleagues will recall, last year our Nation saw tens of \nthousands of unaccompanied minors and families from Central America \ncome to our southern border. This clean full-year funding bill would \nprovide Immigration and Customs Enforcement $689 million more than last \nyear's funding to help address the additional needs associated with \nthat surge. Specifically, it includes $3.4 billion for immigration \ndetention and funds 34,000 adult detention beds.\n\n  The Shaheen-Mikulski bill would also fully fund the employment \neligibility verification system, known as E-Verify, which helps \nbusinesses to ensure they are hiring legal employees.\n  Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson recently said--and I fully \nagree with him--that to deny his Department full-year funding would \nactually hurt our border security.\n  We cannot continue to default to short-term continuing resolutions \nand force the Department to cut corners and scramble to fund its \nhighest priorities. As we have learned over these years, stopgap crisis \nbudgeting is an egregious waste of money. Let me say that again--an \negregious waste of money. By shutting down the Department or keeping it \non a continuing resolution, we will waste tens of millions of taxpayer \ndollars, including the cost of renegotiating contracts, lost employee \nand contractor productivity, and lost training. For example, it would \ndelay the award of a $600 million contract to build a national security \ncutter that the Coast Guard needs.\n  But there is more than just a financial impact. The dramatic \nconsequences of failing to provide full-year funding for the Department \nwill be felt throughout our country. While most of the Department's \nworkforce will continue to perform essential functions in the event of \na shutdown, the bulk of its management and administrative support \nactivities would cease and frontline personnel would not receive the \nsupport they need. It would be like trying to fight a war without \nplanners,\n\n[[Page S615]]\n\nwithout logistics, and without supplies. It would be like us here in \nthe Senate working without our staffs. We might be able to find a way \nto get our work done, but we wouldn't be as effective. And those at DHS \nwho are required to come to work if a shutdown were to occur would not \nbe paid until Congress restores funding. Essentially, a large part of \nour Federal homeland security efforts would be operating under an IOU.\n  A stopgap budget or a shutdown would also further degrade employee \nmorale at the Department of Homeland Security. As many of us know, the \nDepartment continues to rank dead last--dead last--among all other \nlarge Federal agencies when it comes to workforce morale.\n  While Secretary Johnson, Deputy Secretary Mayorkas, and their team \nare taking important steps to make the agency a better place to work--\nand we are helping them--the Department still lacks a strong sense of \ncohesion and a sense of team. But Congress too has a responsibility. \nProviding this large and complex agency the funding it needs would be a \nterrific next step.\n  If my colleagues and I expect the Department of Homeland Security and \nother Federal agencies to show improved outcomes, we cannot continue to \nplay games with their budgets and expect them to not feel the negative \nconsequences. No business owner or manager could be expected to be \neffective and efficient under these conditions. The leadership of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security is no exception.\n  A clean Homeland Security funding bill for the rest of the fiscal \nyear is the fiscally responsible step to take. If we deny them that \nfunding, we will not be punishing the President. In a sense, we will be \npunishing a number of the employees. But most of all we will be \npunishing taxpayers because we are wasting their money and we are \ndiminishing and reducing the kind of security they need in this country \ntoday.\n  Let me just say, don't take my word for this. Our good friend Tom \nRidge, the first Secretary of Homeland Security and a former Republican \nGovernor, with whom I served, said:\n\n       I would be very, very disappointed if I were Secretary, and \n     the Democrats did it to me . . . It's pretty difficult to \n     plan long term when you don't know exactly how much you're \n     going to have available and what strings might be attached to \n     it. Give them the funding they need.\n\n  And I would say to our Republican colleagues, give them the funding \nthey need.\n  For these reasons, I urge our colleagues in the Senate to join me in \ndoing the right thing in supporting passage of a clean full-year \nappropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security and \nrejecting the amendments approved by the House. It would be \nirresponsible for us to continue kicking the can down the road when it \ncomes to national security, and we certainly cannot afford to let this \nvital agency's funding run out.\n  I ask my colleagues to think about what we are trying to accomplish \nby failing to provide the Department of Homeland Security with the \nfunds they need to operate. The American voters sent Congress a clear \nmessage on election day. This is what they said: They want us to work \ntogether. They want us to get things done. And they especially want us \nto enhance our economic recovery. Given recent events around the world, \nthey also want us to do all we can to keep them and their families \nsafe. We need to show Americans through our actions here in Washington \nthat we have heard them.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me first thank Senator Carper for his \ncomments on the need for us to pass a homeland security appropriations \nbill.\n  I think our constituents would be surprised to learn that we have not \npassed an appropriations bill that funds for this fiscal year the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, a critically important agency that \nkeeps us safe.\n  We know the challenges around the world. We know the challenges to \nour homeland. Yet we haven't passed a full-year Homeland Security bill. \nInstead, we have legislation that has come over from the House that is \nmore interested in picking political fights on immigration policy--when \nwe should be together on immigration policy--and holding up the funding \nfor Homeland Security.\n  I thank Senator Carper, who is the ranking Democrat on that \ncommittee, for bringing to our attention that the best thing for us to \ndo is to take up the Shaheen-Mikulski bill, which is a clean \nreauthorization of the appropriations for this year, so we can get \nthrough this year, and then we can debate immigration on an immigration \nbill, debate next year's budget on a budget bill, and not have the \npolitics of the House interfere with the funding for Homeland Security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/29/senate-section/article/S615-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S615-S616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      70TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LIBERATION OF AUSCHWITZ AND BIRKENAU\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time to bring to my \ncolleagues' attention that January 27 represented the 70th anniversary \nof the liberation of Auschwitz and Birkenau--Auschwitz, the \nconcentration camp that became a death camp; and Birkenau, a death \ncamp, located in Poland, that was liberated by the Allied Forces on \nJanuary 27, 1945.\n  There were 1.3 million Jews, Poles, and other minorities who were \ndeported to Auschwitz and Birkenau between 1940 and 1945. Of that 1.3 \nmillion, 1.1 million died in these camps.\n  I had a chance in 2004 to visit both Auschwitz and Birkenau, and it \nwas emotionally draining. It was a site that is hard to imagine, to see \nthe cruelty and the barbaric activities of humans against other humans. \nFrom looking at the rooms in which medical experiments were done on \nhuman beings, who ultimately died, to seeing the gas chambers, it very \nmuch affected my perspective on humanity and life.\n  In the United States we are blessed. I can practice my religion and \ndon't have to fear losing my head. I can disagree with my government \nand know I am not going to be locked up for doing it. We should never \ntake those liberties for granted. I think our freedoms give us a \nspecial responsibility to make sure that when we say never again, that \nit becomes a reality, that it becomes real.\n  We also have a responsibility to remember the victims of the \nHolocaust. In the Jewish religion, we have Yom Hashoah, a separate day \nset aside to recognize that. We need to learn from the survivors. I \nwill always remember the times I had a chance to talk to Leo Bretholz. \nHe was a constituent of mine who escaped the trains taking him to \nAuschwitz. He was an inspiration to all of us who learned more about \nthe circumstances surrounding the Holocaust. Unfortunately, he passed \naway last year. Leo advocated for the repatriation of victims, \nparticularly from the French railway SNCF, and we were ultimately \nsuccessful in getting those funds.\n  This all underscores the importance of Holocaust education. When we \nsay never again, let's always remember what happened over 70 years ago \nunder Nazi rule. Let's have Holocaust education so young people \nunderstand the consequences of the cruelty and the consequences of not \ngetting engaged.\n  Let's also help the survivors. I very much want to acknowledge that \nin the United States we have many survivors from the Holocaust, and \nover half of them live under the Federal poverty line. They are so \nfearful of being institutionalized, and we can understand that. I thank \nSenator Mikulski and the appropriators for putting money in the omnibus \nappropriations bill last year to help provide assistance so these \nsurvivors can get the services they are entitled to under our law. \nSometimes they can't work their way through it. I was proud to help in \nthose efforts.\n  I also thank Vice President Biden for his leadership in the Obama \nadministration.\n  I thank those on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \nin the Older Americans Act reauthorization that was acted on this week \nbecause they include services for Holocaust survivors so that they will \nhave easier access to government services.\n  Lastly, let me thank Senators Mikulski and Kirk. I joined both of \nthem in a Senate resolution to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the \nliberation of Auschwitz and Birkenau. The Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee that I serve on unanimously approved that resolution for \nconsideration on\n\n[[Page S616]]\n\nthe Senate floor, and I thank Senators Corker and Menendez for their \nhelp.\n  As I think most Members of this body know, I have been an active \nparticipant in the Helsinki Commission. I am the democratic leader, \nworking with Senator Wicker. The Helsinki Commission is known for its \nparticipation in the Organization for Security and Co-operation in \nEurope, but I think it is best known because we put a spotlight on \nhuman rights issues. We try to live up to that motto ``never again.'' \nWe try to say we will not let violations of basic human rights go \nunchallenged.\n  So on this 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz and \nBirkenau, which are the iconic symbols today of the Holocaust, let's \nrededicate ourselves to making sure that ``never again'' becomes a \nreality.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise first to thank my colleague from \nMaryland for his eloquent words on the Holocaust and the survivors of \nthe Holocaust and the compelling voices that came out of those death \ncamps.\n  In addition, my colleague has always been a champion for human \nrights, whether it is on the Helsinki Commission, whether it is his \nadvocacy to let Soviet Jews get out of the Soviet Union. Where people \nare repressed or facing attacks or persecution, he has always been on \ntheir side, and also actually meeting with the Holocaust survivors in \nour own community to bring a lot of attention to what we can do and to \nactually putting money in the Federal checkbook.\n  With all that effort at survival and making it to the United States, \nthe survivors of the Holocaust, who were children then and would now be \nin their eighties and nineties--imagine that--should not live in \npoverty, they should not fear institutionalization, and they should not \nfear destitution. So I thank my colleague for his advocacy, and I look \nforward to working with him on this and also say ``never again.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/29/senate-section/article/S616-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S616-S617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I come to the floor as the ranking \nmember of the Appropriations Committee, and I come to ask my colleagues \nto bring to the floor and pass a clean Homeland Security appropriations \nbill for fiscal year 2015.\n  This isn't just Senator Barb Mikulski calling for this but also the \nformer heads of Homeland Security under President Bush and also under \nPresident Obama. The very first head of that agency, Gov. Tom Ridge, \nalong with Mr. Chertoff and Janet Napolitano, have written to Harry \nReid and Mitch McConnell and said: Please, as former Secretaries of \nHomeland Security, we write to you today to respectfully request that \nyou consider decoupling critical legislation to fund the Department of \nHomeland Security for fiscal year 2015 from a legislative response to \nPresident Obama's actions on immigration.\n  They feel that:\n\n       . . . by tethering a bill to fund DHS in FY 2015 to a \n     legislative response to the President's executive actions on \n     immigration . . .\n\n  --it could lead to a shutdown of Homeland Security.\n  We don't want a shutdown.\n  I won't go through the entire letter. They conclude with:\n\n       It is imperative that we ensure that DHS is ready, willing, \n     and able to protect the American people. To that end, we urge \n     you not to risk the funding for the operations that protect \n     every American and to pass a clean DHS funding bill.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate Majority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate Minority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n       As former U.S.Secretaries of Homeland Security, we write to \n     you today to respectfully request that you consider \n     decoupling critical legislation to fund the Department of \n     Homeland Security (DHS) in Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 from a \n     legislative response to President Obama's executive actions \n     on immigration.\n       As the recent terrorist attacks in Paris and the cyber-\n     attacks on a major American corporation and on the U.S. \n     Military's Central Command remind us, the threats facing the \n     U.S. are very real. The national security role that DHS \n     plays, and by extension the funding that allows it to carry \n     out its vital national security mission, is critical to \n     ensuring that our nation is safe from harm. Funding for the \n     DHS is used to protect our ports and our borders; to secure \n     our air travel and cargo; to protect the federal government \n     and our nation's information, technology, and infrastructure \n     from cyber-attacks; to fund essential law enforcement \n     activities; to guard against violent extremists; to mobilize \n     response networks after emergencies; and to ensure the safety \n     of the president and national leaders.\n       Moreover, we appreciate that Congress possesses the \n     authority to authorize and appropriate funds expended by the \n     federal government. We do not question your desire to have a \n     larger debate about the nation's immigration laws. However, \n     we cannot emphasize enough that the DHS's responsibilities \n     are much broader than its responsibility to oversee the \n     federal immigration agencies and to protect our borders. And \n     funding for the entire agency should not be put in jeopardy \n     by the debate about immigration. The President has said very \n     publicly that he will ``oppose any legislative effort to \n     undermine the executive actions that he'' has taken on \n     immigration. Therefore, by tethering a bill to fund DHS in FY \n     2015 to a legislative response to the President's executive \n     actions on immigration, the likelihood of a Department of \n     Homeland Security shutdown increases.\n       It is imperative that we ensure that DHS is ready, willing, \n     and able to protect the American people. To that end, we urge \n     you not to risk funding for the operations that protect every \n     American and to pass a clean DHS funding bill.\n       Sincerely,\n     Michael Chertoff.\n     Tom Ridge.\n     Janet Napolitano.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the Department of Homeland Security was \nestablished right after the terrible attack on the United States of \nAmerica on September 11, 2001.\n  The Department of Homeland Security is a big agency, but protecting \nthe homeland is a big job, and DHS employees are on the job every day: \nthe Coast Guard safeguarding our waterways; Secret Service, not only \nprotecting the President, the First Family, the Vice President, but \nalso doing other important tasks; the Border Patrol and ICE--\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement--securing our borders against \nsmugglers, traffickers, and other illegal immigrants; cyber warriors--\npeople protecting us against bio and nuclear threats, and then also \nworking with the first responders; FEMA--everything to protecting us in \nthe event of an attack on the homeland, to having readiness and \nresponse and shelters and so on, to helping us now in hurricanes and \nblizzards such as we are facing in the northeast. It all helps State \nand local responders to have the resources they need to be able to \nrespond at the local level.\n  The Firefighters Grant Program is so beloved in our communities \nwhere, through competitive exercise, they can go for grants to buy \nrespiratory equipment, the new firetrucks and so on that they need. In \nmy community, they can't come up with this equipment on just fish fries \nand pancake breakfasts. We need a government on our side. \nUnfortunately, the Department of Homeland Security funding runs out on \nFebruary 27.\n  Now let me give the background.\n  When we came back in September, facing the fact we had to have a \ncontinuing resolution to get us through the fiscal year and the \nelection cycle, the Congress passed legislation, and then on December \n13 when we did the omnibus, we passed an omnibus bill for every single \nagency with the exception of Homeland Security. So every single agency, \nfrom the Department of Defense to the Department of Health and Human \nServices, Education, the weather services, all of these important \nprograms, NIH, were funded through the fiscal year. But we put Homeland \nSecurity on a CR because there was an intense and actually very prickly \nconcern over the President's Executive action on immigration. So rather \nthan hold up the whole funding of the United States of America over \ntemper-tantrum politics over Obama's Executive action on immigration, \nwe went to a CR, a continuing resolution, on Homeland Security. The \nHomeland Security was to take us to February 27, where wiser heads--and \nnow complete control by the Republican Party--would be able to move \nthis for full funding.\n  So where are we? Well, during that time in December, as the chair of \nthe\n\n[[Page S617]]\n\nCommittee on Appropriations, with my vice chairman Senator Richard \nShelby, Senator Dan Coats, and the Subcommittee on Homeland Security, \nSenator Dan Coats and Senator Mary Landrieu, we came up with a fiscal \nframework. So did the House. They came up with it. So the very money \nthat we put into the CR and the clean bill that Senator Shaheen--now \nthe ranking member--and I had, has the funding for Homeland Security \nthat Homeland Security says it needs and we have arrived at on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  If in fact we are allowed to bring up a clean bill, we have agreed on \nthe money. There is no dispute over the money. We have looked very \ncarefully at it. We worked on a bipartisan basis. We worked on a \nbicameral basis. We are ready to go. What will slow us down is if we \nget into an intense debate on immigration and riders to try to stop the \nactivities of President Obama.\n  I strongly recommend to my colleagues: Do not play politics with the \nsecurity of the United States of America. We were all horror stricken \nat what happened in Paris. We are repulsed at what is going on with \nISIL. We are very concerned about lone-wolf attacks. We worry--and the \nchair of the authorizing committee on Homeland Security in the House \nhas said: They are coming here, they are coming here, they are on their \nway. We have got to be ready. Well, one of the ways we have got to be \nready is to make sure the resources in Homeland Security are funded and \nthat they are not worried about a shutdown, showdown, slamdown politics \nover a fight on immigration.\n  Should we have a discussion on immigration? You bet. Should we even \nhave an outright robust debate on it? I am all for it. But leave \nHomeland Security alone. Pass the money bill. If you disagree with the \nmoney, argue over that. But if you want to fight over immigration \npolicy, that is another debate for another day in another way.\n  The Nation faces growing threats where Americans are endangered at \nhome and abroad. Terrorists are threatening us with bombs and guns, and \nlone wolves in Ottawa, organized radicals in Paris, cyber criminals \nwith backing from nation states and organized crime.\n  In terms of the Secret Service, we have the need to reform the Secret \nService. We have fence jumpers at the White House, drones landing on \nthe White House lawn.\n  In the face of these threats, the Republican majority's response is \nto hold the funding of Homeland Security up to pick a fight with the \nPresident over immigration. Uncertainty undermines security. Let's give \nthe Agency certainty of funding.\n  We are 4 months into the fiscal year. Another continuing funding \nresolution would be the fifth continuing resolution. That is no way to \nrun an agency so big, so complicated.\n  Senator Coats and Senator Landrieu and our House colleagues worked so \nwell to come up with the bill. They provide resources for DHS, with the \ntotal funding of $39.7 billion, an increase of over $400 million above \nthe fiscal year 2014. We could pass that today. We could pass it on \nMonday, we could pass it on Tuesday.\n  All of my Democratic colleagues and I wrote a letter to Senator \nMcConnell asking him to schedule an immediate vote on a clean vote on \nHomeland Security. Well, let's see where we go on that.\n  What we have here, the clean bill offered by Senator Shaheen--now the \nranking member on the Homeland Security Subcommittee on \nAppropriations--and I have a compromise funding bill that gives \ncertainty to the people who work on the front lines to secure the \nNation, whether it is securing the border, whether it is building \ncapacity to meet agricultural and biological threats, whether it is \nreplacing aging nuclear detection equipment, also helping our Coast \nGuard build their national security cutter so the Coast Guard can \nprotect us against drug runners, pirates, terrorists.\n  More than any other specific increase, enacting a clean Homeland \nSecurity bill shows the Congress and the Nation value. We do value \nsecurity, and we value the men and women who work every day to provide \nus with that security. Uncertainty jeopardizes security. We value them.\n  I urge my colleagues to put their money where their mouths are to \nenact a clean homeland security bill, and not to get into this whole \ndebate with immigration.\n  I look forward--as we wrap up the debate on the Keystone Pipeline, we \nthen take up Homeland Security and we take up a clean bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator from \nArkansas, my time was delayed. I hope I have not slowed the Senator \ndown this morning. I didn't realize you were here.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. No, No. I thank the Senator. Everything is fine. We \nappreciate the Senator, as always.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

His passion and advocacy has resulted in \nbetter service offerings at veterans facilities across Arkansas. It is \nreflected in the lives that he has helped make better by solving an \nindividual's problems at the VA.\n  If Steve was able to track down military medals a veteran earned but \nnever received, those medals weren't just dropped in the mail. Steve \nwould crisscross the State, personally delivering them, dressed in his \nAir Force blues, and present them with the stories of the veteran's \ntime in service.\n  A veteran himself, Steve served honorably in the Air Force as a \ntactical air controller, with assignments as director of operations and \ncommander in Virginia, Vietnam, California, Utah, Florida, Colorado, \nKansas, and Iceland.\n  He also served as national director for the National Guard \nrecruiting, retention, and advertising at the Pentagon. His final \nassignment before retiring with the rank of lieutenant colonel was in \nGermany where he served as an adviser to the commander and chief of the \nAir Force in Europe.\n  Along with the work he does in an official capacity, Steve is active \nin a number of veterans service organizations, including the American \nLegion and the Wounded Warrior Program.\n  He has served as vice president of the Arkansas Council of Military \nOfficers Association of America.\n  I am excited for Steve as he embarks on the next chapter of his life, \nbut we are losing a fantastic advocate for Arkansas veterans. However, \nI know that my staff will continue to provide the best possible service \nto Arkansas's veterans as we have the blueprint on how to do it right, \nthanks to Steve. He has literally set the gold standard on how to \ndeliver for veterans.\n  I know also that in retirement Steve does not mean to fade from \nsight. Steve is not the slowing-down type of personality. Certainly he \nwill take some time to travel with his wife Sharon in their retired \nlife. But along with the relaxation, Steve has grand plans to travel \nthe country singing at veterans retirement homes, and he intends to \nstay active with the Arkansas Veterans Coalition. This is his calling, \nhis passion, and I am quite certain Steve will continue to work with \nthe veterans community for years to come.\n\n  Thank you, Steve, for your service in uniform, your dedication to \nyour fellow veterans, and most of all thank you for your friendship.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). The senior Senator from South \nDakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/29/senate-section/article/S617-2", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S617-S619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HELPING THE MIDDLE CLASS\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, last week President Obama came over to \nCongress to deliver his annual State of the Union Address. His speech \nfocused heavily on something Republicans have\n\n[[Page S618]]\n\nbeen talking about for the last 6 years: helping the middle class. \nOccasionally the President even sounded as if he had stolen a line from \nRepublicans, which I can assure you Republicans were happy to provide.\n  Seriously, Republicans were glad to hear the President pivoting back \nto the middle class. Providing relief for the middle class is the \nRepublican priority in the new Congress and we are eager to work with \nthe President to get things done for American families.\n  Unfortunately the President's speech didn't show the same willingness \nto work together. In fact, Wolf Blitzer from CNN said: ``I don't \nremember a State of the Union Address where I heard a President issue \nso many veto threats to the opposite party in the United States \nCongress.''\n  While it was good to hear the President focus on the middle class, \nhis actual proposals for helping them left much to be desired, because \nunfortunately they were more of the same top-down, big government \npolicies that have failed to help Americans over the past 6 years. For \nexample, the President proposed a new tax on middle-class families' \ncollege savings accounts--the last thing families need when they want \nto save for their children to go to college. Fortunately, the President \nbecause he received so much pressure has been forced to withdraw this \nparticular proposal, but his speech contained a lot of other proposals \nthat would not provide the help American families need.\n  If there is anything the past 6 years have shown, it is that big \ngovernment is not the solution to our economic challenges. In fact, it \nis the cause of many of our economic problems.\n  Take a look at ObamaCare. A Gallup poll released last week found that \nhealth care costs are one of American families' top two concerns. It is \nno wonder. ObamaCare was supposed to help our Nation's health care \nproblems. It was supposed to drive down premiums and make health care \nmore affordable. Instead, it has generally done the opposite.\n  Since ObamaCare became law in 2010, health care premiums have risen. \nMillions of Americans have lost their health insurance plans. Others \nhave lost access to doctors or to convenient hospitals. Still others \nare stuck in insurance plans paying more for less coverage. Then of \ncourse there are all the problems the law has created for workers and \nbusinesses and the pain millions of Americans will be feeling this tax \nseason when they discover they owe the government money from their \nObamaCare subsidies or that they must pay a tax penalty for failing to \nhave government-approved health insurance.\n  The American Action Forum recently ran the numbers and estimated that \n6,000 people in South Dakota will have to pay the ObamaCare tax penalty \nfor not having government-approved health insurance. According to a \ncalculator on the Wall Street Journal's Web site, the average \nindividual in South Dakota will pay a $394 penalty this year, while the \naverage family of four in South Dakota will pay a $650 penalty. Now \nthat is a lot of money. That is a lot of money for a family in South \nDakota, and it is only going to go up because the tax penalty will rise \nin 2016.\n  As we can see on this chart, South Dakotans could be spending that \ntax money on a number of essential items if they didn't have to pay the \npenalty. In fact, for $394 in South Dakota you can buy 201 gallons of \ngas at current South Dakota prices, buy 6 weeks of groceries or make \n1.1 car payments with that amount of money. That is for an individual \nand the amount they can be basically hit with in terms of the tax \npenalty.\n  If we look at how this impacts a typical South Dakota family--and the \ndistinguished Chair knows exactly what I am talking about--if they \ndidn't have to pay that $650 tax penalty, it could be used for 332 \ngallons of gas in South Dakota at South Dakota prices, 3 weeks of \ngroceries or almost two car payments. If we think about 332 gallons of \ngas in South Dakota, that would cover a lot of trips to school or to \nfootball practice or to dance practice. These are real-world impacts on \nreal people. As ObamaCare has demonstrated, big government is not the \nanswer.\n  While it is great the President wants to focus on helping the middle \nclass who suffered for years under his policies, he cannot help them if \nhe insists on pushing more of the same failed top-down, big government \npolicies. The last few years have involved laying a lot of burden on \nAmerican workers and on the American economy to fund big government \nprograms and the President's pet projects.\n  Take the ObamaCare tax on lifesaving medical devices such as \npacemakers and insulin pumps. This tax was put in place to help pay for \nthe President's health care law, but it has ended up negatively \naffecting jobs in this industry. Even Democrats who voted for the \nPresident's health care law are pushing to get rid of this tax.\n  Take the Obama Interior Department's recent decision to push for \nclosing off large swaths of Alaska to energy development that would \ncreate jobs and benefit Alaska's economy, as well as strengthen \nAmerica's energy independence or take the crippling new energy rules \nthe President's EPA has proposed, such as a new tax on coal-fired \npowerplants that could result in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs \nand devastate entire communities; likewise, the EPA proposal to lower \nthe ozone standard that would be the most expensive EPA regulation in \nhistory.\n  I intend to reintroduce my bill, the bipartisan CASE Act, to make \nsure we tackle places with the worst smog in the country before forcing \ncleaner areas to meet what is an impossible standard.\n  If we want to fix the economy, we have to stop weighing it down with \ntaxes and regulations. We have to reject yesterday's stale policies \nwith their focus on taxing, spending, and regulating. Instead of \npushing big government solutions, we need to rebuild our economy from \nthe bottom up.\n  Republicans are focused on the future that embraces and fights for \nthe potential of the people, not government. That means passing \nlegislation to free businesses to create jobs. It means reforming our \nTax Code to put more money in the pockets of American families and to \nmake it easier for American businesses to compete around the globe. It \nmeans eliminating the kind of heavy Washington spending that is \nweakening the economy and piling up debt on the backs of the next \ngeneration of Americans. It means getting rid of redtape and \nregulations that are stifling energy development and the jobs that go \nalong with it and preventing more American businesses from growing and \nhiring new workers. It means opening new markets abroad for American \nmanufacturing and American farm products.\n  The past 6 years have not been kind to American families. A recent \nReuters story opened by saying, ``Barack Obama enters the final 2 years \nof his legacy with a blemish on his legacy that looks impossible to \nerase: the decline of the middle class he has promised to rescue.''\n  Household income has fallen by more than $2,000 on the President's \nwatch, according to Sentier Research. Meanwhile, prices have gone up. \nMillions of Americans are unemployed while millions more are stuck with \npart-time jobs because they cannot find more work. Millions of other \nAmericans are so discouraged with not finding work over the past 6 \nyears that they gave up looking and dropped out of the labor force \nentirely. Wage growth has remained stagnant during the Obama \nPresidency. As a CNN headline put it after the President's State of the \nUnion Address, ``Obama says wages are growing. They're not.''\n  It is no surprise middle-class families aren't feeling an economic \nrecovery or that Americans list lack of money and low wages as one of \ntheir top financial concerns.\n  A New York Times headline from Sunday read ``Middle Class Shrinks \nFurther As More Fall Out Instead of Climbing Up.''\n  It doesn't have to stay this way. Republicans don't believe in a \npermanent middle-class decline. If we stop government from weighing \ndown our economy with taxes and regulations and start freeing \nbusinesses to create new jobs and opportunities for American workers, \nour economy will rebound and the middle class will feel the effects.\n  Republicans are already working on legislation to help the middle \nclass and we will be sending our first job-creating bill with \nlegislation to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline and the\n\n[[Page S619]]\n\n42,000 jobs it will support during construction to the President very \nshortly. We hope the President will sign it.\n  American families have had to spend 6 years in this economy. They \nshouldn't have to wait any longer for relief.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to thank my \ndistinguished colleague from South Dakota, Senator Thune, for his very \ncomprehensive review of where we are with the economy and the need for \nthe Keystone Pipeline to pass. As always, Senator Thune in a very \narticulate manner made the case for our country to become more energy \nindependent and also touched on national security and the stagnant \nsituation we face with our economy.\n  I thank the Senator for his remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/29/senate-section/article/S619-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S619-S620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, in this new Congress we have an \nopportunity and a responsibility to address an issue of utmost \nimportance to every American: the current dysfunction at the Internal \nRevenue Service.\n  I do not use the word ``dysfunction'' lightly, but I reach that \nconclusion when I see the agency systematically suppress the political \nactivity and free speech rights of American citizens. I also reach that \njudgment when I see the agency unable to effectively police its \npersonnel, as seen in the tax delinquency levels of the agency's staff, \nwhen bonuses have been awarded to these same employees. These are \ncritical issues we must address, particularly as we in Congress face \nour obligation to reform our tax system.\n  The IRS targeting of conservative and other groups that came to light \nway back in May 2013 is neither a trivial issue, nor one we can \nignore--no more back burner. This is a front-burner issue.\n  We have hit many roadblocks in this investigation, and it is \ncertainly premature for us to reach any conclusions or to make concrete \nrecommendations on how to address the IRS targeting. That being said, \nwe have a pretty clear sense of what happened. In my view, this \negregious conduct and the condescending response by the top IRS \nofficials should come to a screeching halt. For over 2 years the IRS \ntargeted conservative and many other groups applying for tax-exempt \nstatus with inappropriately intrusive information requests. The IRS \nalso delayed processing these applications, and according to recent \nreports has continued to delay processing applications. It hasn't \nstopped--amazing, simply amazing.\n  When the targeting came to light, senior members of the agency tried \nto cover up the IRS' actions by providing incomplete and misleading \ninformation to Congress about what was being done. Very recently we \nlearned the agency has found tens of thousands of pages of information \nrelating to the targeting. The review of these documents has not yet \nbegun.\n  The good news is that the inspector general for the IRS has these \nrecords now. The bad news is that there are technical difficulties \nprocessing those records. The Senate Finance Committee has yet to \nreceive this information as the investigation continues. There is no \ndoubt the review will lead to further interviews with officials in the \nIRS and other government agencies.\n  The actions of the IRS and its leadership have profound implications \nfor reform of our overly complex and antiquated Federal tax system. Let \nme quote from the Internal Revenue Service mission statement: The IRS \ntries to provide America's taxpayers ``top quality service'' by helping \nthem understand and meet their tax responsibilities. They are meant to \ndo all this--this is the underlying, this is the one statement the IRS \nshould remember every day--``with integrity and fairness to all.'' With \nintegrity and fairness to all.\n  Now in the targeting scandal, I believe the IRS is no longer the \nneutral tax collector its mission states it to be and that the IRS is \ninappropriately open to a partisan political agenda of the White House \nand its allies, if not to working as a direct tool or means of \nsuppression to the right of free speech.\n  The other issue with the IRS also showing its dysfunction relates to \nthe tax compliance of IRS employees and in fact the compliance level of \nFederal employees all across our government. As of September 2013, \nFederal employees were delinquent on $3.4 billion in taxes. Yes, that \nis right--1,500 Treasury employees were delinquent, owing close to $10 \nmillion. While in the grand scheme of Federal finances it is a very \nsmall amount, it is tremendously galling and sends a terrible message \nto taxpayers to know that many of these employees were awarded \nbonuses--they were awarded bonuses--even though they owed back taxes.\n  Let me be perfectly clear. Any employee who deliberately ignores the \nprocess and procedures for fulfilling their tax obligations like every \nother American must be held accountable. This is a basic principle upon \nwhich I think we can all agree. When these public employees serve at \nthe IRS, their lack of willingness to pay their tax obligations calls \ninto question the integrity of the agency. It is unconscionable that \nthere are tax delinquents working as tax collectors.\n  In these two matters, it is very clear that the IRS is again not \nconducting itself with integrity and fairness--far from it. The crux of \nthe issue is that neither the Congress nor the tax-paying public can \nhave any confidence that the agency acts in an evenhanded manner or \nwith the best interest of the taxpayer at heart.\n  This is a very troubling at a time when the IRS's role in the economy \nand in people's lives has been greatly expanded by ObamaCare. From the \nvery first, the idea of using the IRS to implement and enforce \nObamaCare is an anathema to common sense.\n  It is bad enough now when taxpayers are audited. Nobody likes to hear \nthat knock on the door or receive a telephone call or email after being \ntargeted for their political beliefs and blocked from exercising their \nfree speech rights. But to expand the role of this agency into \neveryone's health care decisions is just plain wrong. That is a box \ncanyon we should not ride into.\n  Tax reform presents us with the opportunity to look at these issues \nmuch more closely. When we have completed these investigations and have \nissued reports, I will review the results very carefully to see what \nlegislative fixes to the IRS and the Tax Code may be necessary. Make no \nmistake about it, I am not going to let this slip from the radar, and \nwe should not let this slip from the radar with regard to the Senate \nFinance Committee. There are too many blips on the screen--large blips.\n  I hear from Kansans every day who are fed up with the IRS. I think \nmost Members in this body feel the same way. There is a lot of \ndiscontent with the tax system and its enforcement, and there are \nregular calls for even scrapping the whole collection apparatus. I \nagree we need to take a hard look at tax reform in the agency.\n  Of course we have an immediate obligation to take up tax reform, and \nthe Finance Committee will do so, but the question remains: If we are \nsuccessful in reforming the Tax Code--truly climbing that mountain--how \ncan we turn a reformed code over to an IRS that is so rife with \nscandal?\n  The other action we must take immediately is to block the IRS from \ntaking any further steps to restrict constitutional free speech rights. \nThis is why just yesterday I joined with my colleague from Arizona \nSenator Flake to again introduce legislation to prevent the IRS from \nmoving forward with a regulation project on the political activities of \nsocial welfare groups, the 501(c)(4) regulations.\n  It is completely inappropriate for the agency to move forward with \nthis project until we understand what went on and what structural and \nprocedural changes are needed at the Internal Revenue Service to \nprevent the targeting of political opponents from ever happening again. \nSenator Flake and I have proposed a very straightforward and \ncommonsense approach to this challenge. We simply halt further action \non the proposed regulations until the congressional investigations into \nthe IRS actions are completed.\n  The bill we have introduced freezes further IRS actions for 2 years \nand would make it clear the IRS can only enforce the regulations that \nwere in place before all the targeting began.\n  I also wish to make it clear that we can no longer tolerate rewarding \ngovernment workers who cannot be bothered to comply with our tax laws.\n\n[[Page S620]]\n\n  So today I am offering legislation to block Federal employees who are \ndelinquent on their Federal taxes--here is the key--and making no \neffort to pay their tax liability; we will block them from receiving a \nbonus or award from the Federal Government. If someone is a Federal \nemployee, they should not be receiving a bonus if they are not making \nan effort to pay back taxes.\n  I think the purpose of my bill is very simple. If someone is a \nFederal worker, they should be making a good-faith effort to pay their \ntaxes like everybody else or at least work with the IRS to pay down \ntheir debt. Holding Federal employees accountable for their tax debt \nmay even foster public confidence again in our tax system.\n  Amazingly there are Federal employees at almost every agency, \nincluding the Internal Revenue Service, who are significantly \ndelinquent in their taxes and not working to pay their debts. That is \nwrong. That is not fair. It is not good government practice. That is an \nunderstatement. My bill will put a stop to this practice.\n  It is no wonder, given the IRS's behavior and the behavior of these \nFederal tax delinquents, that Kansans and virtually every American \ndoubt that the government can administer the tax laws in good faith. \nThe lack of faith in the Internal Revenue Service is an important \nreason why Congress must rewrite the Tax Code, simplify how we pay \ntaxes, and reduce the government's intrusion into economic and other \naffairs of the public.\n  We don't need the IRS regulating constitutionally guaranteed free \nspeech and muzzling lawful political activity. We also do not need to \nreward Federal employees who do not even make the most minimal effort \nto pay their tax debt and then give them bonuses. The hypocrisy of IRS \nagents getting bonuses when they don't pay their taxes has to stop.\n  Finally, there are other issues at the Internal Revenue Service. \nThere was a recent statement by the IRS Commissioner warning--\nthreatening--the tax-paying public, during tax-filing season no less, \nthat the agency is drastically cutting taxpayer service functions. I am \ntalking about answering calls, tax return help, and other programs that \nassist the average American to fulfill their tax obligation.\n  The Commissioner blames the budget sequester. I understand that. \nEvery Federal agency is now upset about the sequester. I am upset about \nthe sequester with regard to our national security and the spending \ncaps setting these cuts. The IRS Commissioner is upset about that as \nwell. That is beyond amazing when we have learned that the agency has \nmade so many poor decisions, such as entering into a contract with the \nIT company that was just fired by Massachusetts, Vermont, and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services for its failure in implementing \nthe healthcare.gov Web site. The historic rollout was a total disaster. \nI expect we will get into this in detail next week when the \nCommissioner comes before the Finance Committee. I am going to be \nasking him questions about the same topics I brought up in these \nremarks.\n  In the meantime, just a suggestion to the IRS--from the Commissioner \non down--take a hard look at the mission statement, concentrate on \nserving the taxpayer, stop threatening the American public with the \nloss of service, and try to do the best you can in a most difficult \nbudget environment.\n  We have an obligation to have the IRS serve with integrity and \nfairness to the American public, and that is not happening now. Let's \nwork together to make sure it does happen.\n  I yield the floor, and after careful inspection, it appears to me we \ndo not have a quorum present. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning \nbusiness. I know the managers will be here shortly, and when they \narrive I will obviously yield the floor to them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/29/senate-section/article/S620-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY STANDARD\n\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, today we are voting in the 11 o'clock \nseries on the renewable electricity standard--a bill to promote 25 \npercent of our electricity to come by renewable sources by 2025.\n  From what we have heard these past few weeks, we are either on the \nfloor debating an energy bill or a jobs bill. This is what my \nRepublican friends and colleagues have been saying.\n  The Keystone Pipeline fits neither one of these descriptions. The \nKeystone Pipeline is not an energy bill. The bill lacks a comprehensive \nenergy policy; it lacks even trying to set one. This is not a ``do it \nall, do it right'' energy bill. It isn't even a ``drill, baby, drill'' \nbill. This is the ``drill, Canada'' bill.\n  If we are going to debate energy policy, we need to debate and adopt \na renewable electricity standard. The Keystone Pipeline is an \ninvestment in doing things the old way--importing foreign oil. Instead \nof doubling down on foreign oil, we should be talking about how we can \nmove America forward by investing in homegrown energy for the future. \nThe renewable electricity standard is such a bill.\n  I wish to point out that States already recognize this fact \nsignificantly. Colorado has a 30-percent target by 2020. Nevada has a \n25-percent target by 2025. Oregon has a 25-percent target by 2025. A \nnumber of other States have renewable electricity targets. Twenty-nine \nStates, in fact, are developing a national market. There are many \nStates that are meeting these goals and moving forward aggressively.\n  In 2013, the State of Iowa produced 27 percent of its electricity \nalone with wind power.\n  I see the chairwoman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee on \nthe floor. I promise to yield. I only have a couple of more minutes. I \nthank the chairwoman.\n  This amendment--the renewable electricity standard--is a start to a \ncomprehensive energy policy for the United States.\n  We are told the Keystone Pipeline is a jobs bill. We are told \nKeystone will create jobs. Of course, we are all for that. But how many \njobs? We are talking about 2,000, 3,000 construction jobs, but the \npermanent jobs are in the range of 50. How about a renewable \nelectricity standard that promotes long-lasting manufacturing and \ninstallation jobs--American jobs, permanent jobs--jobs that can't be \noutsourced?\n  The renewable electricity standard could create an additional 274,000 \nto 297,000 jobs in the United States in such areas as construction, \noperations, and engineering. Over 50 percent of these jobs would be \ncreated in the manufacturing sector. These are hundreds of thousands of \n21st century American jobs in my State and across the country. We owe \nit to all Americans to consider this and other amendments that would \nimprove the bill.\n  Right now, we are losing out to other countries in both solar and \nwind. China has the largest market share. A national renewable \nelectricity standard would help us move forward aggressively to get our \nmarket share in those two areas.\n  It is clear to me a national renewable electricity standard would \ncombat global warming while creating hundreds of thousands of jobs \nacross the country. It will help maximize our energy potential while \nstrengthening our economy and our energy security.\n  Let's vote on that.

Under the previous order, there will now be 15 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as we just heard, the House has sent \nover legislation they have moved through that body that would allow for \nexport of LNG. As we speak, in the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee downstairs, the committee is considering a bipartisan LNG \nmeasure. Five Republicans and five Democrats are coming together with \nan LNG export proposal that they have not only worked with the \nadministration on, but the administration is actually carrying out, \nwithout the law being in place. Certainly we are getting to a place \nwith our LNG and our natural gas opportunities where there are good, \nsubstantive developments being made in our laws and in how we can \nprovide for not only certainty through the regulatory process--\nefficiency, expediency--but assurance to the public--to families, to \nbusinesses, to manufacturers--that pricing issues will be addressed and \nthe opportunity for jobs in this country is put first and foremost. So \nI think there is good news going on today.\n  There is further good news as we begin the glidepath toward passage \nof the Keystone XL Pipeline. We have had a host of measures come before \nus in the form of some 35 amendments that we have considered as a body \nover the course of these several weeks. I think it has been good \ndebate. I think it has been a good process. We are now getting to the \nfinal closeout.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 80, as Further Modified\n\n  Some very important issues have been raised in this debate. I wish to \nthank Senator Vitter for bringing the very important issue of revenue \nsharing to the attention of the Senate. He offered an amendment that \nhas been before us for consideration. He has been very steadfast in \nensuring that there is a continued commitment to America's energy \nsecurity and increasing offshore energy production.\n  The American energy revolution has provided us with high-paying jobs \nfor millions of workers. It has led to lower gas prices. It has \nprovided a real stimulus to the pocketbooks of just about every \nAmerican. It is fundamentally changing our role on the international \nstage, which is so important.\n  The amendment Senator Vitter has offered to the underlying bill, \nwhich would increase access to our offshore energy resources and \nprovide revenue sharing for coastal producing States, is a very \nimportant one. Again, I thank him for that.\n  One of my top priorities as chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee is to help ensure the exploration and the \ndevelopment of Alaska's Outer Continental Shelf--OCS--which holds an \nestimated 236 billion barrels of offshore oil and 132 trillion cubic \nfeet of offshore natural gas. This is clearly an amazing resource base. \nIt is going to take a while--more than a decade--to develop, but it \nwill provide substantial government revenues for generations to come.\n  With the benefits that come with this resource development, there are \nalso impacts. There will be impacts both to the State of Alaska and to \ncoastal communities. It will require major investment in new \ninfrastructure, whether it be ports or pipelines or roads. That just \ncomes with this kind of resource production.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Vitter to address the revenue \nsharing not only for my State but for the gulf States and other States \nthat host energy development off of their coastline in legislation that \nthe energy committee will consider later this year.\n  I appreciate the continued support of my colleague from Louisiana and \nfor providing a fair share of the revenue from offshore oil and gas \nactivity to the States that are most affected. His State most clearly \nhas experienced the benefits of offshore activity. I have seen this for \nmyself when I have gone down to visit.\n  He is also working hard to ensure that others enjoy those benefits as \nwell. Again, we are having a great debate over energy policy. We are \nseeing many good amendments with ideas that could be included in future \nbills, and I certainly look forward to working on revenue sharing with \nmy colleagues from Louisiana, Senator Vitter and Senator Cassidy, and \nwith other Members of the Senate as we go forward in this Congress.\n  I will now yield to my colleague from Louisiana for any comments he \nmay choose to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I want to thank the Senator for her kind words and continuing \ncommitment to work on revenue-sharing measures. As her new role as the \nChair of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, that is going to \nhappen this year, which is exciting.\n  As the Senator mentioned, I filed an amendment to this bill with \nregard to revenue sharing and worked very closely with my new Senate \ncolleague, Bill Cassidy, and others. This is important now more than \never, particularly in light, unfortunately, of the Obama \nadministration's recently announced 5-year OCS plan. That plan is \ngrossly inadequate. It really chops up and goes down even lower than we \nhave been with regard to the development of our Outer Continental \nShelf.\n  Revenue sharing is one key way to reverse that trend and produce more \nAmerican energy in a safe and environmentally sensitive way and have \nall of this benefit, including, by the way, the Federal Treasury. My \nrevenue-sharing amendment and other revenue-sharing ideas--certainly \nincluding those Senator Murkowski is working on--would do just that. We \nhave three fundamental goals in mind.\n  First of all, we need to expand production activity on our U.S. Outer \nContinental Shelf.\n  Secondly, we need to treat host States right. They have benefits like \nthe economic benefits we enjoy in Louisiana, but there are also costs \nand burdens. There are absolutely impacts to coastal communities. That \nrequires that some portion of that revenue from that production stay in \nthe host States. That is what revenue sharing is all about. We need \nthat in Alaska. We need that in the gulf. We need that when we start \nproduction on the east coast.\n  Finally, we need that revenue sharing because it is the most powerful \nincentive tool out there to significantly\n\n[[Page S622]]\n\nboost production, to get more States into the act, to get more \nproduction online working toward American energy independence and an \neconomic renaissance. Revenue sharing, properly formulated, will do all \nof that.\n  I really do appreciate Senator Murkowski's focus on this issue and \ncommitment to proceeding with this issue in the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee in legislation this year.\n\n\n            Amendment No. 80, as Further Modified Withdrawn\n\n  With that having been said, I will withdraw my Vitter amendment No. \n80 on this bill and certainly will actively partner with Senator \nMurkowski, Senator Cassidy, and others to advance revenue sharing this \nyear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Louisiana.\n  I do think this is an area where those of us from coastal States can \nsit down together to truly map out a proposal that is fair and \nequitable, truly taking advantage of the benefits of accessing our \noffshore resources while recognizing those States that bear the \nresponsibility of these production and development activities should \nshare in some of the benefit there as well. I am looking forward to \nworking with him as well as members of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee.\n  At this time I ask unanimous consent that the votes on the Barrasso \namendment No. 245 and the Cardin amendment No. 124 occur after the \ndisposition of the Udall amendment No. 77, with all other provisions of \nthe previous order remaining in effect, and there be 2 minutes equally \ndivided before the vote on the Daines amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Just for Members' information, we will be prepared \nvery shortly to commence votes. The good news for Members is the list \nof amendments that we had scheduled prior to the lunchtime has actually \nbeen winnowed down somewhat. Some Members, such as we have just seen \nfrom the Senator from Louisiana, have chosen to withdraw. We may be in \na position to take some by voice. We will be having votes commencing \nhere very quickly. But the good news is there will be fewer than there \nwere when we started out this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I assume there is a little bit of time \nto make a couple of comments as we are waiting.\n  I would commend the chairwoman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, for she and the ranking Member have done an excellent job of \nmoving us through. I think we all appreciate it when we hear the words \n``an amendment has been withdrawn'' in terms of being able to move the \nprocess forward.\n  I did want to mention a couple of things. One, just to remind \neveryone, when we talk about this Canadian oil company bringing a \npipeline through the United States down to the Gulf--putting it on a \nship and sending it to China--they are not paying into the oilspill \nliability trust fund. Our amendment to say the oil should stay here if \nAmericans are taking all the risk was voted down. The amendment that \nwould require American steel was voted down. Any commitment to make \nsure these were all American jobs has also been voted down.\n  I did also--because the distinguished Chair of the committee \nmentioned a bill that came over from the House--want to take a moment \nto say as we look at energy policy in the energy committee today we \nare, in fact, considering what I consider to be one of the most \nfundamental questions for us moving forward with this new energy source \nin abundance called natural gas.\n  It is incredibly important we get this right. As opposed to the \npipeline going through the middle of our country, this is something \nthat can greatly increase our ability to have manufacturing jobs across \nthe country, to continue to lower and keep down the prices of heating \nand other energy costs for our citizens. If it is done right--the \ncommittee, I believe, dramatically does it the wrong way. The bill that \ncame from the House is very much, in my judgment, a China-first policy \nand not an America-first policy. I say that because right now China is \nwilling to pay more than three times for natural gas than we are. I \nunderstand that the gas and oil industry wants to rush it on ships over \nto China. But to add insult to injury for us, they were willing to pay, \nlast year, $16 and then turn around and subsidize their industry that \nis competing with us and only give it to them for I believe it was \n$1.78. Our folks who are forced to pay $16 because we don't have a \nprudent export policy--they just throw open the doors to send it to \nChina. Our folks pay $16. The folks competing with us for our jobs are \npaying $1.78.\n  I realize we have a lot more discussion on that at a later point. I \ndo want to say there will be a great debate on what I believe is one of \nthe most important issues in front of us in terms of continuing to \nhaving manufacturing renaissance and the ability to create good middle-\nclass jobs in this country. I am hopeful in the end we will have an \nAmerica-first policy, not a China-first policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we are just about ready to begin our \nvotes. Again, it was a very productive day processing amendments \nyesterday, and we have some good provisions included in the bill. We \nwere able to adopt by voice the provision of the Senator from Maine to \nbetter coordinate energy retrofitting assistance for schools. That was \ngood for us. I think we have been available to reach agreement on \nseveral of the measures that will allow the process to go quickly this \nmorning.\n  I am certainly prepared to yield back any time here so we can \ncommence with the voting, although I want to recognize my ranking \nmember and partner in this weeks-long effort if she wants to make any \ncomments before the vote.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I know originally we pushed the bill back, so I am \nhappy to move it back to reclaim some of that time and help us. I know \nthere are a few things which have been worked out, and we very much \nappreciate that.\n  I yield back our time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 246\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is now 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 246, offered by the Senator from Montana, Mr. Daines.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Daines amendment. \nWhile I respect the perspective of my colleague from Montana, this \namendment does nothing to support the Land and Water Conservation Fund. \nIf you really want to support LWCF, you ought to support the bipartisan \nBurr amendment which we will consider in a few minutes. Instead of \nactually solving the problem, the Daines measure creates more delay for \ndelay's sake and says LWCF should be a priority but undermines the very \nnotion by suggesting there is something wrong with the program.\n  For once we have a program where there actually is nothing wrong with \nit. It has been one of our Nation's most successful conservation \nprograms for 50 years, funding projects in every State and literally \nevery single county in the United States. These are projects that range \nfrom creating new parks for inner city kids, to providing new access to \nsportsmen, to protecting the Nation's historic battlefields. We don't \nneed to overhaul LWCF, we just need to reauthorize it and let the \nprogram's proven track record of success continue.\n  I would urge my colleagues to vote no on the Daines amendment before \nus now, but vote yes on the bipartisan Burr amendment to follow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I believe Senator Daines is still in \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee so I will attempt to speak \non his behalf in support of his amendment.\n  Reauthorizing the LWCF is something that I have said we plan to take \nup in the energy committee. We are going to make it a priority. But I \nagree\n\n[[Page S623]]\n\nthe sense-of-the-Senate, in order to ensure that this program can be an \neffective tool for management structural improvements to the program, \nis going to be needed.\n  For example, I know the LWCF has been used to acquire inholdings in \nexisting national parks, our national forests, and wildlife refuges. \nAcquiring inholdings can improve management. We should do more of these \nkinds of targeted land acquisitions.\n  Another structural change I know some are interested in making is \nsetting aside some of the LWCF funding to address the maintenance \nbacklog facing our Federal land management agencies. We have combined \nmaintenance backlogs, as much as $22 billion, according to CRS reports. \nWe have issues. We have to do that.\n  I will support the Daines amendment.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has \nbeen instrumental in increasing access to our public lands, growing \nopportunities for outdoor recreation, and protecting wildlife. And \nthere is great potential for the program to be used to increase access \nto our existing Federal lands.\n  My amendment expresses the sense of Congress that the Land and Water \nConservation Fund serves an important role in improving wildlife \nhabitat, increasing outdoor recreation opportunities, and facilitating \neconomic development on our public lands.\n  It will also convey that funding and reauthorizing the Land and Water \nConservation Fund should be a priority for Congress and as we consider \nits reauthorization, we should also look for improvements to the \nstructure of the program. The benefits and opportunities for \nimprovement to the Land and Water Conservation Fund should be \nthoroughly evaluated in a transparent legislative process.\n  My amendment would support authorization through the legislative \nprocess and allow for oversight and transparency in improving the \nprogram. My amendment is not intended to undermine the integrity of the \nprogram.\n  Montana's outdoors heritage is of great importance to our State's \neconomy and thousands of Montanans' way of life. Supporting and \nimproving the Land and Water Conservation Fund will help us ensure that \nthis legacy is continued for future generations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to the Daines amendment, No. 246.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there is now 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 92, as modified, offered by the Senator from North \nCarolina, Mr. Burr.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I will be brief, but I would like my \ncolleagues' attention because we have an opportunity today to take a \nprogram that functions well, that this body designed, funded from \nroyalties off of exploration of energy, that has never been fully \nfunded at what the statute said we would do, and every so often it \ncomes up for reauthorization. That is sort of stupid.\n  What this amendment does is it makes permanent the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. I say to my friends and colleagues, if you want to \nchange the makeup of the fund--what it does, how it works--that still \nexists, but let's not have the debate as to whether this is going to \ncontinue. Let's continue it permanently, and let's make sure that what \nthey do in their work, where they leverage a few Federal dollars with a \nlot of private dollars, not to acquire massive amounts of lands or \ncreate parks but to put adjoining lands together that stops \nencroachment on some very sensitive areas--this is a smart investment, \nand it is an investment we make off of the production of energy in this \ncountry.\n  I urge my colleagues to support amendment No. 92.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I would suggest that legislative \nproposals such as reauthorizing the LWCF should be considered under \nregular order, beginning with hearings in the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. Obviously, this is an issue in which many of us \nare interested. We have just had a measure before this which spoke to \nsome of the proposed policy changes that might be considered.\n  So whether we are seeking to reauthorize permanently or considering \ndifferent set-asides of funds that come in for different programs, I \nwould like to think we could do it through regular order. But I \ncertainly understand where the Senator from North Carolina is coming \nfrom, and I look forward to working with him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n92, as modified.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Madam President, this amendment creates a national market \nfor renewable energy. A bill similar to this has passed the Senate \nthree times and also passed the House once. These are the jobs of the \nfuture--renewable energy jobs. More than half of the new generation of \nenergy in the world is in renewables, and this amendment--it is \nestimated by the people who have studied it and the experts--would \ncreate about 300,000 new jobs.\n  So I ask my colleagues to support it. It is a good complement to the \nbill we are on, and it would create a lot of new jobs.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, this amendment is an issue that \nCongress has considered many times over the past 16 years, but we \ndeclined to impose a renewable electricity standard.\n  We called it several different names. We called it a renewable \nportfolio standard. Then it moved to renewable electricity standard. It \nwas later rebranded the clean energy standard. Now it is back to the \nRES. But this latest proposal that 25 percent of electricity supplied \nby a retail provider be generated by certain renewable resources by \n2025 is really no different than the EPA's move to impose a 30-percent \nreduction in greenhouse gases from existing powerplants by 2030 under \nthis proposed CPP regulation.\n  I would encourage Members to oppose this amendment.\n  Further, I would note to colleagues that we are very close to \nfinishing up these amendments. If we move quickly, if we stay on the \nfloor and stick to 10-minute votes, we can finish them all before \nlunch. I think that would be good, but it is going to require the \ncooperation of all Members.\n  With that, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 245, offered by the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Barrasso.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, this is an amendment Senator Barrasso \nand Senator Cardin have been working on together. This amendment \nprovides that the Federal Government must consult with the relevant \nIndian nations before modifying or breaking any trust or treaty \nobligation. This obligation is already required by Executive order. The \nFederal Government has been fulfilling its government-to-government \nconsultation responsibilities on the Keystone XL Pipeline project for \nover 6 years.\n  I think it is important for colleagues to recognize that this \namendment does not create any new law; it is merely an additional \nguarantee that the Federal Government will live up to its existing \nobligations to consult with the Indian nations, which is a matter I \nthink we should all be able to agree on.\n  This is an issue Senator Barrasso has been working on with the \nSenator from Maryland, and they have indicated that they will accept a \nvoice vote on this amendment.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 245, as Modified\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Barrasso amendment No. 245 be modified \nwith the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. CONSULTATION WITH INDIAN TRIBES.\n\n       Nothing in this Act relieves the United States of its \n     responsibility to consult with Indian nations as required \n     under executive order 13175 (67 Fed. Reg. 67249) (November 6, \n     2000).\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent that the 60-vote affirmative \nthreshold be vitiated, and I urge its adoption by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there further debate on this amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 245), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 124\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I take a \nfew minutes to debate the next amendment and save a little bit of time \nat the end by withdrawing the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, as we consider both the Barrasso and \nCardin amendments, I wish to remind my colleagues of the unique history \nthe United States has with Indian nations. This history includes over \n300\n\n[[Page S625]]\n\ntreaties that were negotiated with individual tribes and nations which \nremain in effect today.\n  For over two centuries our Nation disregarded the concerns of tribal \nnations with respect to expansion and development that affected their \ncommunities. This often included abrogating treaty rights and \ndisregarding trust obligations this country has to Indian nations and \nindividual Indians. But this is no longer how we work with Indian \nnations in our country. We now have laws and Executive orders requiring \ndeliberate and meaningful consultation on any actions taken by the \nFederal Government that affect tribal interests. We have also signed on \nto the United Nations Declaration Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which \nstates that the rights of indigenous peoples cannot be abrogated \nwithout their free and informed consent.\n  I want to make it crystal clear that nothing in this bill is meant to \nabrogate the rights of any Indian nation or any individual Indian. So \nwhile I believe we could say more to affirm these policies in this \nbill, I am happy that at a minimum, Senator Barrasso's amendment \nguarantees that Indian nations continue to have a voice through \nmeaningful consultation on this project.\n  It has been necessary to have this discussion because the Great \nPlains Tribal Chairman's Association does not believe that the \nconsultation required is occurring with respect to KXL. It is helpful \nto remind the executive branch agencies involved in this process just \nwhat their obligations are. I would like to quote from a letter the \nassociation recently sent to Interior Secretary Jewell, which states in \npart:\n\n       As our Trustee, DOI has a specific duty to insure that its \n     comments and positions on this National Interest \n     Determination accurately reflect the very real potential \n     impacts that this Project may have on our historical Tribal \n     homelands, sacred sites, cultural resources and water rights, \n     all of which are protected by applicable federal law and our \n     Treaties with the United States. While many of our Tribes \n     have submitted comments on this document, the State \n     Department's unwillingness to sit down with us on a \n     government to government basis to discuss our concerns has \n     led us to question whether that Department really respects \n     our legal roles as elected officials of federally recognized \n     sovereign tribes. These concerns are so serious that the \n     Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, \n     the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, and the Yankton Sioux Tribe have all \n     become party interveners in the South Dakota Public Utility \n     Commission's proceedings challenging its 2010 action permit \n     for this project.\n       Madam Secretary, we know that you have many important \n     demands on your schedule, but meaningful government to \n     government consultation, especially on matters of this \n     importance, is assured to us by President Obama's Tribal \n     Consultation policy of November 5, 2009, as well as by \n     Executive Order 13175. President Clinton issued that \n     Executive Order to ``establish regular and meaningful \n     consultation and collaboration with tribal officials in the \n     development of Federal policies that have tribal implications \n     [and] to strengthen the United States government-to-\n     government relationship with Indian tribes''. President Obama \n     re-committed federal agencies to this duty through a \n     Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and \n     Agencies issued on November 5, 2009, in which he declared: \n     ``My Administration is committed to regular and meaningful \n     consultation and collaboration with tribal officials in \n     policy decisions that have tribal implications including, as \n     an initial step, through a complete and consistent \n     implementation of Executive Order 13175''. To prepare final \n     DOI comments on a document of this magnitude without \n     affording us the opportunity for a meaningful face to face/\n     government to government meeting is a flagrant violation of \n     President Obama's directive in 2009 and of the commitments \n     President Obama has made to us as recently as last December.\n\n  Now, what is meant by the term ``consultation''? When the world \ncommunity of nations, including the United States, worked with \nIndigenous Peoples over a 15-year period to develop the United Nations \nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, they used the \nconsultative standard of ``free, prior and informed consent'' in \nArticle 11, 2: which reads: ``States shall provide redress through \neffective mechanisms, which may include restitution, developed in \nconjunction with indigenous peoples, with respect to their cultural, \nintellectual, religious and spiritual property taken without their \nfree, prior and informed consent or in violation of their laws, \ntraditions and customs.''\n\n  This language was necessary because the Federal Government and the \nStates once ran roughshod over the rights of Native peoples and simply \ntook and used land and other property of Native nations and persons, \nand there was a need to make sure that this would not happen in the \nfuture. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, Native peoples were confined \nto reservations and could not leave without permission of the Federal \nIndian agent. Even in the 1950s and 1960s, Native delegations to \nWashington were not supposed to go to Capitol Hill without checking in \nat the Bureau of Indian Affairs, BIA. Native people tell me that they \nused to think BIA stood for ``boss Indians around.'' Out of this sorry \npast have come new policies that give true meaning to the nation-to-\nnation relationship. Key to this relationship is ongoing consultation \nthat is meaningful and worthy of trust, and agreements that are made \nare transparent and consensual.\n  There are many laws mandating consultation with Indian tribes and \npersons, regarding areas on tribal, individual trust and original \nlands, among them the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, the \nArchaeological Resources Protection Act, the Native American Graves \nProtection & Repatriation Act, and the National Historic Preservation \nAct. Unless the consultation required under these and other statutes is \nopen and based on informed consent, it is not meaningful and cannot \nlead to a good end. When we refer to consultation in the modern era, we \ndo not mean some sleight of hand; rather, we intend fair, good faith \ndealings that honor the high standards of the United States' treaty and \ntrust relationship with the Native peoples.\n  I will close my remarks simply by including excerpts from just two \nrecent judicial decisions regarding the nature of Federal-tribal \nconsultation. First, from the U.S. District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of California ruling in the case of Quechan Tribe v. United \nStates Department of the Interior, et al (December 15, 2010), citing \nthe National Historic Preservation Act: ``The consultation requirement \nis not an empty formality; rather, it `must recognize the government-\nto-government relationship between the Federal Government and Indian \ntribes' and is to be `conducted in a manner sensitive to the concerns \nand needs of the Indian tribe.' ''\n  Second, from the case of Comanche Nation, et al v. USA, et al \n(September 23, 2008), involving the Army's failure to consult with the \nComanche Nation regarding a sacred place, Medicine Bluff, the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Western District of Oklahoma found that the \nNational Historic Protection Act, NHPA:\n\n     . . . requires an agency to make a reasonable and good faith \n     effort to identify historic properties that may be impacted, \n     and to identify . . . issues in connection with such \n     potential impact. . . . The reasonable and good faith efforts \n     requirement extends to consultation with Native American \n     tribes which may attach religious and cultural significance \n     to potentially affected property . . . It has been said that, \n     in a general sense, the NHPA requires agencies to `stop, \n     look, and listen' before commencing actions which could \n     impact historic or culturally significant properties. . . . \n     The evidence submitted during the preliminary injunction \n     hearing substantially demonstrates Defendants' actions were \n     contrary to the letter and the spirit of the NHPA and its \n     implementing regulations. . . . Defendants virtually ignored \n     the concerns regarding the viewscape up to the Bluffs from \n     the southern approach. . . . Contrary to the direction of the \n     Ft. Sill Garrison Commander . . . to `get with the tribes' \n     about their viewscape issues, that same day the Section 106 \n     letter was sent out without a reference to Medicine Bluffs \n     and without mentioning the potential impact on viewscapes. \n     Instead, the details of the TSC project were buried in \n     technical attachments, and the consulting parties were left \n     to ferret out for themselves the adverse impact on viewscapes \n     then known by Defendants to exist. . . . Moreover, the \n     requirement of good faith consultation suggests that the \n     consulted Native American tribes would have considered it \n     important to know, and therefore should have been told, that \n     the TSC warehouse was the tip of the iceberg regarding plans \n     to build within the southern approach to the Bluffs. . . . In \n     reality, the area in question is also slated for construction \n     of a DRMO facility (which will occupy about 20 acres), \n     construction of a fire station, and a widening of Randolph \n     Road on its north side. Had this cumulative impact been \n     disclosed to the area tribes, their initial reaction may well \n     have been different. As it was, the Comanche Nation began \n     complaining in earnest in the fall of 2007 and early 2008. \n     These protests, asserted after the close of the 30-day \n     comment period announced in the August 10, 2007 Section 106\n\n[[Page S626]]\n\n     letter, were brushed off by defendants as untimely. Having \n     concluded that they technically complied with the Section 106 \n     process, Defendants decided to proceed with the TSC project \n     despite the mounting objections from the Comanche Nation. . . \n     . it has been said that the NHPA requires an agency to `stop, \n     look and listen' Coliseum Square Ass'n, Inc., 465 F.3d at \n     225; the evidence in the present case suggests that \n     Defendants merely paused, glanced, and turned a deaf ear to \n     warnings of adverse impact. Thus, Defendants' efforts fell \n     short of the reasonable and good faith efforts required by \n     the law. Where a plaintiff shows that an agency failed to \n     comply with the NHPA requirements, injunctive relief may \n     issue.\n\n  The bottom line is that for over two centuries, our Nation \ndisregarded the concerns of tribal nations with respect to projects \naffecting tribal communities. We now have laws and executive orders \nrequiring deliberate and meaningful consultation on any actions taken \nby the Federal Government that affect tribal interests. This certainly \napplies to the Keystone pipeline.\n  I want to thank Senator Barrasso for working with us on the amendment \nwe just approved that makes it very clear that the consultation \nobligations must be adhered to. I also want to thank Senator Heinrich, \nSenator Tester, and Senator Cantwell for their incredible help on this \nissue so we could get a compromise.\n  The work that Senator Barrasso and I have done in consultation with \nother Members, with the amendments that have been filed, to try to find \ncommon ground exemplifies what I hope we would do more of here in the \nSenate: finding common ground.\n  So I am pleased we were able to adopt the Barrasso amendment.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 124 Withdrawn\n\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Under the previous order, the motion to proceed to the motion to \nreconsider the vote by which cloture was not invoked on S. 1 is agreed \nto, and the motion to reconsider is also agreed to.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending \ncloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on S. 1, a bill to \n     approve the Keystone XL pipeline.\n         Mitch McConnell, Lisa Murkowski, Richard Burr, Jerry \n           Moran, John Thune, Marco Rubio, Johnny Isakson, Kelly \n           Ayotte, Ben Sasse, Deb Fischer, John Boozman, David \n           Vitter, Tim Scott, Roger F.

The Senator from North Carolina, Senator Burr, and I \nare here to speak about an important and exciting development that is \nabout to occur in our Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. \nWhat we are talking about and we will describe in our remarks today is \na report entitled ``Innovation for Healthier Americans'' which will \nlaunch a bipartisan effort to look at how Congress can help to get \ncutting-edge treatments, drugs, and devices to America's patients more \nquickly while still preserving this Nation's gold standard for safety \nand quality. This report and the actions we hope to take will affect \nvirtually every American.\n  I am especially glad today to be here with the Senator from North \nCarolina. While there are a number of Senators on this body who worked \nhard on these issues--which in our government are usually dealt with by \nthe Food and Drug Administration and by the National Institutes of \nHealth--no one has been more effective, no one has worked harder, and \nno one has had more foresight and vision on these issues than Richard \nBurr, the Senator from North Carolina. The report today is \nsubstantially his work product, and he will be deeply involved in the \nnext year as we work with Senator Murray, our Democratic friends, and \nwith President Obama to try to bring this to a result.\n  In 2013, Dr. Francis Collins, Director of the National Institutes of \nHealth, wrote the following:\n\n       Drugs exist for only about 250 of the more than 4,400 \n     conditions with defined molecular causes. And it takes far \n     too long and far too much money to get a new drug into our \n     medicine cabinets. This is an old problem that cries out for \n     new and creative solutions.\n\n  Since Dr. Collins said that, the number of conditions with defined \nmolecular causes has increased now to about 5,390, yet the number of \nnew drugs approved has not kept pace with these discoveries.\n  The President of the United States has recognized this problem. In \nhis State of the Union message a few days ago, President Obama said \nthis:\n\n       21st century businesses will rely on American science, \n     technology, research and development. I want the country that \n     eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new \n     era of medicine--one that delivers the right treatment at the \n     right time. In some patients with cystic fibrosis, this \n     approach has reversed a disease once thought unstoppable.\n\n  The President said:\n\n       Tonight, I'm launching a new Precision Medicine Initiative \n     to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and \n     diabetes--and to give all of us access to the personalized \n     information we need to keep ourselves and our families \n     healthier.\n\n  Senator Murray and I had breakfast yesterday with Secretary Burwell \nand talked with her about the President's statement and about Secretary\n\n[[Page S627]]\n\nBurwell's own desire to help implement that initiative.\n  Today Senator Burr and I released a report titled ``Innovation for \nHealthier Americans.''\n  Next, Senator Murray--who is ranking member of the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions--and I will start examining the \nissues in this report and other issues raised in comments, through a \nbipartisan HELP Committee staff working group.\n  I emphasize that we are going to be working together, Democrats and \nRepublicans. We are going to be working with Secretary Burwell, we are \ngoing to be working with the President of the United States, and we are \ngoing to be on a parallel track with the House of Representatives, \nwhere Chairman Upton and his team have been working for several months \non what they call 21st century cures. In our committee in the Senate we \nwill begin hearings in March.\n  We are releasing the report today in order to ask for comments. \nSurely we missed something in the report. If someone who is listening \nor reading it may have an idea or solution, we would like to know about \nthat. We have opened an email account just to hear from those outside \nof Washington, DC, that is: innovation@help.senate.gov.\n  Improving medical device and drug development is not a new topic for \nthe HELP Committee. Legislation was passed in 1997 and different \nlegislation was passed in 2012 to try to get at the same goal of \nspeeding delivery of drugs and devices while ensuring they are still \nsafe. Our goal will be to give bipartisan legislation to the President \nthis year.\n  It is encouraging to have the House, the Senate, and the President \nworking on such an important common goal that affects virtually every \nAmerican during the same Congress. That greatly increases our \nlikelihood of securing a result.\n  We want to improve and modernize how drugs and medical devices are \ndiscovered, developed, and approved. We will examine the work of the \nNational Institutes of Health, which funds and enables much of the \nresearch that leads to medical breakthroughs and the Food and Drug \nAdministration which regulates all the medical products we come in \ncontact with.\n  As I mentioned, this work will touch the life of almost every single \nAmerican--from a very ill patient who has run out of treatment options \nand is counting on the most cutting-edge drug to an active child with \nasthma who is hoping to run faster and farther with the aid of a new \ndrug.\n  Today our scientists and researchers are making discoveries at a pace \nthat our development process is not equipped to match. Patients wait \nwhile treatments languish in laboratories, going through our drawn out, \ninefficient, and outrageously expensive development process.\n  FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg has acknowledged that ``we are \nleft relying on the 20th century approaches for the review, approval \nand oversight of the treatments and cures of the 21st century.''\n  There is no time to waste in solving this problem. The mapping of the \nhuman genome opened a whole new world of individualized medicine in \nwhich a person's genetic makeup can drive the doctor's plan for disease \nprevention, diagnosis, and treatment.\n  In the words of Andrew von Eschenbach, the former Commissioner of the \nFDA and Director of the National Cancer Institute:\n\n       We stand on the cusp of a revolution in health care. \n     Advances in molecular medicine will allow us to develop \n     powerful new treatments that can cure or even prevent \n     diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer. Tomorrow's high-tech \n     cures can also slash health-care costs and eliminate \n     ineffective treatments. What will it take to realize the \n     potential of the new medicine?\n\n  Today's report is the first step of our initiative. It seeks to \nanswer the questions: What today is driving innovation? What barriers \nare standing in the way? What can we improve?\n  The report has five main themes:\n  No. 1, it costs too much to bring medical products to patients; No. \n2, as science and technology advance, the discovery and development \nprocess takes too long; No. 3, the Food and Drug Administration's \nresponsibilities have grown to include many unrelated to regulating \nmedical products; No. 4, science outside the FDA is moving at a faster \npace than ever; No. 5, an effective FDA is essential to maintain the \nU.S. leadership in biomedical innovation.\n  Some of the report's key findings include that complex medical \ndevices approved in the U.S. were available to patients in Europe on \naverage four years earlier than in the U.S., and increased competition \nfor NIH grants may be discouraging researchers from proposing risky \nprojects. Further, the average cost to develop a drug is disputed-some \nsay $1 billion, some say $2 billion, some more-but all agree it is \nrising, and unpredictable and inconsistent development requirement \nstandards in the FDA review process drive product developers to design \nclinical trials that are unnecessarily expansive.\n  Since World War II, the U.S. has dominated the biomedical industry \nspace. Even 20 years ago, studies suggested that the U.S. share of \nglobal biomedical research funding was as high as 70-80 percent.\n  However, from 2007 to 2012, the U.S. share of research and \ndevelopment declined from about 51 percent to 45 percent. While the \nU.S. continued to lead the world in public sector investment during \nthis time, private sector investment shrank by almost $13 billion and \nlargely reallocated to Asia.\n  This is a chance to step back and look at where we are and how all \nthe different reauthorizations have added up. We need to ensure that \nlegislative efforts over the last 30 years are helping and not getting \nin the way of having the best treatment and technology available for \nthe right patient at the right time. Our goal is simple but ambitious--\nto work in a bipartisan way with members of the HELP Committee to make \nsure policies support medical innovation and patient access to \nimportant medicines and medical technologies.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the copy of the \nexecutive summary from the report that Senator Burr and I are releasing \ntoday.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       ``We stand on the cusp of a revolution in health care. \n     Advances in molecular medicine will allow us to develop \n     powerful new treatments that can cure or even prevent \n     diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer. Tomorrow's high-tech \n     cures can also slash health-care costs and eliminate \n     ineffective treatments. What will it take to realize the \n     potential of the new medicine?''\n     --Andrew von Eschenbach, former FDA Commissioner, 2012\n       The federal government has been an enthusiastic investor in \n     biomedical research for five decades. That investment has \n     helped drive rapid innovation and bring us to a crossroads: \n     Will we use what we have learned to transform the discovery \n     and development of new drugs and medical devices, or will we \n     maintain the status quo, depriving patients of cutting-edge \n     products?\n       With the release of this report, the Senate Health, \n     Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee is beginning \n     an inclusive and transparent process to:\n       Candidly assess the status quo: What works? What's not \n     working? What can we do better?\n       Identify how Congress can improve public policies to \n     promote the efficiency and effectiveness of medical product \n     development to cut down on the total time it takes for these \n     products to get to American patients.\n       Pass transformational legislation that the President can \n     sign this year.\n       Every American is personally affected by the U.S. Food and \n     Drug Administration (FDA) and National Institutes of Health \n     (NIH). Anytime we take medicine, have a routine check-up, or \n     undergo a serious procedure for a health problem, like \n     surgery or cancer treatment, we are using medical products \n     regulated by the FDA. In many cases, the research leading to \n     the discovery and development of these products has been \n     advanced, funded, or enabled in some way by the NIH.\n       These two agencies have an enormous influence on our \n     economy. FDA-regulated products account for about 25 cents of \n     every dollar spent by American consumers each year.\n       For generations, America has led the world in medical \n     innovation. The dedicated professionals at the NIH and FDA \n     have helped to instill confidence in FDA-approved products. \n     Scientists from across the globe take seriously the findings \n     and caliber of research that NIH funds, as well as the safety \n     and efficacy of products FDA approves.\n       But our global edge is slipping.\n       Medical discoveries and advancements to treat and cure \n     diseases, including new targeted drugs, could, and should, be \n     reaching American patients more quickly and with less cost to \n     developers, without lessening the\n\n[[Page S628]]\n\n     standards of safety and efficacy. Too many patients with no \n     treatment options wait while potential treatments languish in \n     laboratories awaiting further development, testing, and/or \n     approval. At the same time, each additional $1 billion spent \n     on pharmaceutical research and development results in fewer \n     drugs than in years past. The time and cost of developing \n     medical products is increasing without a discussion of \n     whether there is enough incremental assurance of safety and \n     effectiveness for the additional delays and costs.\n       Over the past several decades, FDA's mission and regulatory \n     reach has expanded dramatically. This has resulted in an \n     increasingly complex bureaucracy while the science of \n     discovery and development has evolved more rapidly than ever \n     in academia and private industry. FDA has struggled to \n     regulate the most cutting-edge medical products. The \n     disparity between the pace of scientific discovery and \n     development outside of the FDA and FDA's scientific knowledge \n     threatens America's position as a global leader in medical \n     innovation.\n       FDA Commissioner, Dr. Margaret Hamburg, has acknowledged \n     that ``. . . we are left relying on the 20th century \n     approaches for the review, approval and oversight of the \n     treatments and cures of the 21st century.'' While the FDA has \n     reviewed drugs in as little as three months, and meets the \n     timelines set for medical device reviews the majority of the \n     time, the inability of medical product developers to predict \n     what questions will be asked during the review forces a \n     multi-year process simply to get an application ready for FDA \n     consideration. This lack of predictability is driven by fast \n     changing and complex science, inefficient and inconsistent \n     processes, and difficulty in hiring and retaining review \n     staff and managers. This challenge will grow as new medical \n     products and the clinical methods used to test them continue \n     to evolve at an exciting pace.\n       This report aims to examine the current process of drug and \n     device development and identify the inefficiencies that stand \n     in the way of a modern development and review process. We \n     take a close and honest look at what is, and is not, working \n     well at the NIH and FDA. We want to know what successes we \n     can replicate, and what failures must be learned from and \n     fixed.\n       This report is organized to follow the process it \n     examines--in other words it takes us from discovery to \n     approval. We outline key problems, partnerships, initiatives, \n     dollars, and data involved in helping to bring promising \n     medical products through the research, development, and \n     regulatory review process. We identify the challenges at the \n     NIH and FDA--inefficiencies, unnecessary regulatory burden, a \n     lack of predictability, and ever increasing regulatory \n     costs--that must be addressed. We identify ways to facilitate \n     stakeholder engagement in these processes, and we intend to \n     continue regular and responsible congressional oversight.\n       Our goal is simple and ambitious--to work in a bipartisan \n     way with members of the HELP Committee to align public \n     policies to support accelerating medical innovation and \n     patient access to important medicines and medical \n     technologies.\n       Science has never held greater potential to improve the \n     quality of life and outcomes for America's patients. In order \n     to fully realize this exciting potential, we must identify, \n     candidly assess, and confront existing factors that may be \n     stifling efforts to innovate. We have identified five guiding \n     principles for this effort:\n       (1) It costs too much to bring medical products through the \n     pipeline to patients.\n       (2) As science and technology advance, the discovery and \n     development process takes too long for medical products to \n     make their way to patients.\n       (3) FDA's responsibilities have grown to include many \n     activities unrelated to the core function of regulating \n     medical products to advance the public health.\n       (4) The disparity in scientific knowledge at FDA and the \n     fast pace of biomedical innovation are slowing, and in some \n     cases, stifling, innovation in American medicine.\n       (5) A working FDA is essential to continuing biomedical \n     innovation in the United States and maintaining America's \n     global leadership in medical innovation.\n       For us to succeed, we need your help. The full spectrum of \n     stakeholders here is incredibly large and diverse, so it may \n     be challenging to identify specific challenges and/or best \n     practices that would have wide-ranging impact. We wish to \n     solicit ideas on how to address these challenges in order to \n     inform action in the 114th Congress. This report and the \n     feedback we receive in response to it will inform what we \n     expect will become a bipartisan legislative package to \n     address the challenges we identify through this process. \n     Please send your ideas to us at Innovate@help.senate.gov not \n     later than February 23, 2015. These comments will be shared \n     with Ranking Member Patty Murray and all of our colleagues on \n     the HELP Committee as we work to achieve this important goal.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I look forward to the remarks from the Senator from \nNorth Carolina. As I have said, no Senator has done more on either side \nof the aisle in this area of helping us think about creative new ways \nto move treatments, medical devices, and drugs through our safety \nprocess into the medicine cabinets and into the hands of patients who \ndesperately need them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I am pleased to talk about an issue that as \nSenator Alexander said is near and dear to my heart; that is, ensuring \nthat America's patients have access to the most cutting-edge medical \nproducts in as timely a manner as possible. I look forward to the \npartnership that Chairman Alexander and I have in what I think is one \nof the most crucial studies and processes we will go through in this \nsession of Congress.\n  Many of my colleagues know that holding the National Institutes of \nHealth and the Food and Drug Administration accountable for their work \non behalf of America's patients is not a new area of focus for either \none of us. After I was first elected to serve in the House of \nRepresentatives, I was tasked with modernizing the Food and Drug \nAdministration, a Federal agency that controls 25 cents of every $1 of \nour economy. This work culminated in the Food and Drug Administration \nModernization Act of 1977, FDAMA, a total revamp of that agency.\n  FDAMA sought to ensure that the FDA had the tools it needed to keep \npace with modern scientific advances. We modernized the agency in a way \nthat supported regulating in the least burdensome manner, while \nensuring that innovative products would reach patients in as timely a \nmanner as possible. As many of my colleagues remember, these reforms \nwere adopted at a critical point in the fight against the HIV/AIDS \nepidemic. But while we have made great strides in certain areas, \nFDAMA's tools haven't been fully leveraged, and the challenges of \nkeeping pace with the cutting-edge technologies have only increased.\n  Today the timely and predictable review of medical products is key to \npromoting and protecting the public health, just as it was 18 years \nago. But the agency's mission and responsibilities have expanded \ndramatically over that same period of time. The size and the scope of \nthe FDA as an organization has never been more complex than it is \ntoday. By its own admission, FDA has struggled to regulate the most \ncutting-edge medical products at the same time our understanding of \nmedicine and the ability to target treatments to individualized \npatients has never been greater. The growth of the agency and its \nresponsibilities presents serious management challenges.\n  Our report, as the chairman said, entitled ``Innovation for Healthier \nAmericans: Identifying Opportunities for Meaningful Reform to Our \nNation's Medical Product Discovery and Development,'' takes a hard look \nat the current status quo and poses targeted questions that can help \ninform how we do things better. We need to identify how we can improve \nour policies to promote more efficient and effective medical product \ndevelopment and review processes to cut down on total time it takes for \nthese lifesaving products to actually reach America's patients.\n  We have seen how regulatory burden and uncertainty results in \ninnovation going overseas, while America's patients wait for the FDA to \ncatch up. The day-to-day actions and in many cases inaction at the \nagency has a profound effect on our Nation's patients and our health \ncare.\n  It also directly impacts our economy, as FDA-regulated products \naccount for about 25 cents of every $1 spent by American consumers. The \nimportance of holding the agency accountable for its actions and \ninactions--all the way from the frontline reviewers to the \nCommissioner--has never been more important than now.\n  This is what the current landscape tells us:\n  No. 1, it costs too much to bring medical products through the \ndevelopment pipeline to patients. There is no disputing that the costs \nto bring medical products through the development pipeline have grown \nover time.\n  No. 2, as science and technology advance, the discovery and \ndevelopment process takes longer for medical products to make their \nways to patients. We need to look at the total real time it takes for \nmedical products to reach a patient, not only the time of FDA review.\n  In 2004, FDA's Critical Path Report warned that:\n\n\n[[Page S629]]\n\n\n       Today's revolution in biomedical science has raised new \n     hope for the prevention, treatment, and cure of severe \n     illnesses. However, there is a growing concern that many of \n     the new basic science discoveries made in recent years may \n     not quickly yield more effective, more affordable, and safe \n     medical products for patients. This is because the current \n     medical product development path is becoming increasingly \n     challenging, inefficient, and costly.\n\n  More than a decade later, these challenges continue to confront us. \nWe must find a way to embrace our advances and to cut down on the total \ntime it takes medical products to reach an American patient. Our report \nasks for feedback, as the chairman said, on how we do that.\n  No. 3, FDA's responsibilities have grown to include many activities \nunrelated to the core function of regulating medical devices to advance \nthe public health. Today there are more than 12,000 employees at the \nFood and Drug Administration. This growth has exacerbated the \nmanagement challenges of the agency, and the question is, How do we \nensure that FDA is equipped to fulfill its mission?\n  No. 4, the disparity in scientific knowledge at FDA and the fast pace \nof biological innovation are slowing and in some cases stifling \ninnovation in American medicine. To ensure that medical product \ninnovation continues to benefit America's patients, our report asks how \nwe could better leverage the regulatory science initiatives to ensure \nthat the novel medical products are reaching America's patients in that \ntimely fashion.\n  No. 5, we know that a working FDA is essential to be continuing \nbiomedical innovation in the United States and maintaining America's \nglobal leadership in medical innovation. Therefore, we ask for feedback \non how Congress and the FDA can work to align public policy and \nregulation to support biomedical research as a vibrant and healthy \ncomponent of the U.S. economy.\n  We have a unique opportunity this Congress to take a hard look at \nwhat is and is not working and advance solutions that will ultimately \nensure that the NIH and the FDA serve America's patients better. We \nhave an opportunity to focus on these issues without a crisis demanding \naction, such as the unfortunate meningitis outbreak in 2012.\n  The drug and medical device user fee negotiations have not yet begun. \nI should add that these negotiations should not begin until everyone \nhas the data to inform how well the agency is currently meeting what \nwas agreed to in the last round of negotiations. It makes no sense to \nme why anyone would rush to engage in a negotiation before they have \nthe data to know what they are getting or what they are currently \npaying for.\n  It is my hope that looking at these issues without the pressure of an \neminent, expiring, user fee reauthorization will help to facilitate \ncandid dialogue among all stakeholders about where we are, where we \nneed to go on behalf of America's patients.\n  While we do not have these pressures upon us today, we do bring an \nurgency to this work because of what is at stake. These issues impact \nevery single one of our constituents and every single American, but \nthey affect not only our patients but our economy and our global \ncompetitiveness.\n  Our goal is simple, to align public policies to support accelerated \nmedical innovation and patient access to medicines and medical \ntechnologies, because when we advance innovation, we help America's \npatients be able to access the most cutting-edge, lifesaving medical \ndevices, and products in as timely a fashion as possible.\n  We foster and facilitate the next generation of cutting-edge products \nwhich, in turn, help to ensure America's continued standing as the \nworld leader of innovation.\n  This is good for our innovators, it is good for our patients, and it \nis good for North Carolina.\n  Dr. Paul Howard of the Manhattan Institute's Center for Medical \nProgress was right when he pointed out that innovation is not an \noption, it is a national imperative. Innovation is central to \naddressing our Nation's unsustainable health care costs. It is also \ncentral to improving the treatments, outcomes, and ultimately the \nquality of life for the American people.\n  Former FDA Commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach was kind enough to pen \nthe foreword of this report. The chairman has already alluded to some \nof his statements, but in that foreword he writes:\n\n       Government policy can either inhibit or accelerate the next \n     revolution in science and technology. The time has come to \n     examine whether our nation has the right public policies in \n     place to realize the full promise of discovery, development, \n     and delivery of 21st century medicine.\n\n  Toward that end, I really do look forward to working with my good \nfriend Chairman Alexander, with our ranking member, Senator Murray, and \nwith all the members of the HELP Committee as we begin this important \nprocess of ensuring that the National Institutes of Health and the Food \nand Drug Administration work as well as they can for patients today \nand, more importantly, into the future.\n  I thank the chairman for the opportunity to work with him on this \nissue. It won't be an easy road, but it is one we are committed to \ntackling. I urge those who might have input for the purposes of this \nstudy and this initiative to please visit the HELP Web site and submit \nfeedback to innovation@help.senate.gov. I am glad to see we have put \nthat in place.\n  I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, health care \ndoesn't distinguish between parties. Health care requires us to come \ntogether and to put policies in place that drive innovation and drive \nquality outcomes. If we can do that, we might set a new pathway for how \nwe cure disease, for how we bring down health care costs, and for how \nAmericans look forward to a generation that grows up with less \ngenetically transmitted diseases.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. COTTON. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Florida, Mr. Nelson, and I be permitted to proceed for up to 20 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Retirement Security Act\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today Senator Nelson and I rise to \ndiscuss S. 266, the Retirement Security Act, legislation we filed \nearlier this week and first introduced last year. Our bill would \nencourage more small employers to offer retirement plans that would \nprovide incentives for employees to save more for retirement and would \nensure that low-income and middle-income taxpayers are able to claim \ntax benefits for retirement savings that are already authorized in law.\n  Our bill is the product of the work that Senator Nelson and I did \ntogether on the Special Committee on Aging. In the fall of 2013, the \ncommittee conducted a hearing on retirement security where we heard \nfrom witnesses that far too many American seniors have real reason to \nfear they will outlive their savings. According to the nonpartisan \nCenter for Retirement Research at Boston College, there is an estimated \n$6.6 trillion gap between the savings that American households need to \nmaintain their standard of living in retirement and what they actually \nhave. The group that was surveyed were those Americans between ages 32 \nand 64.\n  Nationally, one in four retired Americans has no source of income \nbeyond Social Security. In the State of Maine the number is one in \nthree. While 4 in 10 rely on this vital program for 90 percent of their \nretirement income, Social Security provides an average benefit of just \n$1,294 per month--less than $16,000 per year.\n  It is hard to imagine stretching those dollars far enough to pay the \nbills. Certainly a comfortable retirement would be out of the question \nfor most Americans.\n  A recent Gallup poll shows there is an increase in concern among the \nAmerican people about their standard of living in retirement. This has \ngone up over time. Two decades ago 34 percent of Americans were \nconcerned. Now 60 percent of Americans are worried about their standard \nof living in retirement.\n\n[[Page S630]]\n\n  Sadly, they are right to be concerned. Projections published in 2014 \nby the Employee Benefit Research Institute showed that nearly half of \n``early boomers''--those between ages 56 and 62 when the study was \nconducted--are at risk of not having enough money to pay for basic \ncosts in retirement, including health care costs not covered by \ninsurance.\n  There are many reasons for the decline in retirement security facing \nAmerican seniors, including the demise of many defined-benefit pension \nplans in the private sector, the severity of the financial crisis we \nrecently endured, rising health care costs, the greater and expanding \nneed for long-term care, which is so expensive, but most of all the \nfact that Americans are living far longer than they did in the past. \nMany of us are also reaching retirement age with far more debt than \nretirees of previous generations.\n  Another contributing factor we found is that employees of small \nbusinesses are much less likely to participate in employer-based \nretirement plans. According to a July 2013 GAO study, more than half of \nthe 42 million Americans who work for businesses with fewer than 100 \nemployees lack access to a work-based plan to save for retirement. Cost \nand complexity are among the reasons that plans are not more widely \noffered by smaller employers.\n  These employers would very much like to offer plans, but oftentimes \nthe cost and the complexity make the plans out of reach. Therefore, \nmaking it easier for smaller businesses to provide access to retirement \nplans for their workers would make a significant difference in the \nfinancial security of many retirees. That is why the bill that we \nreintroduced earlier this week focuses on reducing the cost and \ncomplexity of retirement plans, especially for small businesses, and on \nencouraging individuals to save more for retirement.\n  Let me now go into detail about the provisions of our bill.\n  First, our bill would allow small businesses to enter into multiple \nemployer plans, MEPs, to offer retirement programs jointly to their \nemployees. This allows small companies to share the administrative \nburden of a retirement plan, which helps lower costs. Current law \ndiscourages the use of MEPs because it requires a connection, or \n``nexus,'' between unrelated businesses in order to join a MEP, such as \nmembership in the same trade association. Our bill would waive the \nnexus requirement for businesses with fewer than 500 employees. So as \nnot to discourage growth, our bill provides a long phase-out under \nwhich businesses are not automatically disqualified from a MEP when \nthey hire their 500th employee.\n  Second, our bill makes joining a MEP a more attractive option for \nsmall businesses. Under current law, if one employer in a MEP fails to \nmeet the minimum criteria necessary for retirement plans to obtain tax \nbenefits, all employers and their employees could lose these tax \nbenefits, which are substantial. For employees, they include delaying \nthe taxation of income contributed to a plan until funds are withdrawn. \nFor employers, plan disqualification could result in limited deductions \nand a higher tax burden. Our bill directs Treasury to issue regulations \nto address this uncertainty, and protect members of a MEP from the \nfailure of one bad apple to meet its obligations.\n  Third, our bill reduces the cost of maintaining a retirement plan. \nCurrent law requires that participants in a retirement plan receive a \nvariety of notices. Our bill would direct Treasury to simplify, \nclarify, and consolidate these required notices, to lessen costs.\n  Fourth, the Retirement Security Act encourages those still in the \nworkforce to save more for retirement. Retirement plans are often \ndesigned to comply with existing safe harbors to prevent the IRS from \nchallenging the tax benefits that flow to employees and employers. The \nexisting safe harbor for so-called ``automatic enrollment'' plans \neffectively caps employee contributions at 10 percent of annual pay, \nwith the employer contributing a ``matching'' amount of up to 6 \npercent. Our bill creates an additional safe harbor for these plans \nthat would allow employees to receive an employer match on \ncontributions of up to 10 percent of their pay.\n  I recognize that businesses that choose to adopt a plan with this new \noptional safe harbor may face additional costs due to the increased \nemployer match. That is why our bill helps the smallest businesses--\nthose with fewer than 100 employees--offset this cost by providing a \nnew tax credit equal to the increased match.\n  Finally, our bill ensures that current measures to encourage savings \nare functioning as they were intended. One such measure is the so-\ncalled ``saver's credit,'' which reduces the tax burden on low- and \nmiddle-income individuals who contribute to retirement plans, including \nIRAs and 401(k) plans. Yet the credit cannot be claimed on a form \n1040EZ, which is frequently used by these individuals. A 2013 \nTransamerica Center for Retirement Studies survey found that only 23 \npercent of people with household incomes of less than $50,000 per year, \nthe group most likely to qualify, were aware of the saver's credit. To \naddress this, our bill directs Treasury to make the credit available on \nForm 1040 EZ.\n  I do want to emphasize in closing that is there is nothing in our \nbill that would force a small business to offer a 401(k) plan. That may \nbe impractical for some small employers. What we are trying to do is to \nprovide incentives for them to do so, to reduce the cost, and to make \nit possible for them to join together with other employers to offer \nretirement plans. We are trying also to provide incentives for \nemployees to save more for their retirement.\n  During my time on the Special Committee on Aging, I have heard \ncountless stories of retirees whose savings did not go as far as they \nhad anticipated. Adequate savings reduce poverty among our seniors in \nwhat should be their golden years. As the HELP Committee noted in a \nJuly 2012 report, poverty among the elderly also increases Medicare and \nMedicaid costs and strains our social safety net. Giving those not yet \nat retirement age more opportunities to save--and to save more--would \nhelp ease this additional burden on entitlement programs that are \nalready projected to be unsustainable.\n  In light of the positive impacts this bill would have in \nstrengthening retirement security for millions of Americans, I urge our \ncolleagues to join Senator Nelson and me in supporting the Retirement \nSecurity Act of 2015. This bill has been endorsed by the Maine State \nChamber of Commerce, the American Benefits Council, the American \nCouncil of Life Insurers, Fidelity Investments, Lincoln Financial \nGroup, the National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors, \nthe Plan Sponsor Council of America, the Principal Financial Group, the \nSociety for Human Resource Management, TransAmerica, and the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record these as well \nas other letters of support.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Maine State Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                                     Augusta, ME, January 8, 2015.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: First, I want to wish you a Happy New \n     Year. I would also like to thank you for your continued \n     service to the state of Maine, particularly the business \n     community. Your efforts in Washington are most appreciated!\n       I am writing to you today about your efforts to enable more \n     businesses to offer retirement plans to their employees. The \n     Maine State Chamber of Commerce fully supports your efforts \n     on this front. As you know, small businesses drive Maine's \n     economy--80% of businesses here in Maine employ fewer than 20 \n     people--and their employees are like family to them.\n       I regularly hear from small businesses who want to offer \n     more retirement benefits to their employees, but are not in \n     the financial position to do so. Coming from a small business \n     state, you clearly understand this. Your proposed legislation \n     can. change this dynamic and make offering retirement plans a \n     more viable option for more small businesses--not only in \n     Maine, but across the country.\n       Again, thank you for your efforts on behalf of Maine's \n     business community. Please let me know if you have any \n     questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Dana F. Connors,\n                                                    President/CEO.\n\n[[Page S631]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                    American Benefits Council,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 21, 2015.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Bill Nelson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins and Senator Nelson: On behalf of the \n     American Benefits Council, I am writing to applaud the \n     introduction of the Retirement Security Act of 2015. We stand \n     ready to assist you in working toward enactment of this \n     important piece of legislation.\n       The Council is a public policy organization representing \n     principally Fortune 500 companies and other organizations \n     that assist employers of all sizes in providing benefits to \n     employees. Collectively, the Council's members either sponsor \n     directly or provide services to retirement and health plans \n     that cover more than 100 million Americans.\n       The private retirement system is a great success and has \n     helped ensure the retirement security of millions of \n     Americans. But there is still more work to be done, \n     especially with respect to the coverage of small business \n     employees and with respect to benefit levels.\n       Your bill would take major steps forward in addressing both \n     of these issues. We believe the bill's reforms of the \n     multiple employer plans rules will expand opportunities for \n     small businesses to band together to maintain plans at a \n     lower cost. In particular, we applaud the provision that \n     would prevent an entire multiple employer plan from being \n     disqualified by reason of a violation of the qualification \n     rules by one or more participating employers. This \n     inappropriate result under current law can deter many small \n     employers from joining a multiple employer plan.\n       The Council is a strong supporter of automatic enrollment, \n     and believes that the Retirement Security Act of 2015 would \n     substantially increase the use of automatic enrollment \n     through the establishment of an alternative safe harbor with \n     key incentives to adopt it. Moreover, the alternative safe \n     harbor would set default contributions at higher levels that \n     are better designed to achieve retirement security.\n       We thank you for your leadership in this important area and \n     look forward to working toward enactment of this important \n     bill.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lynn D. Dudley,\n       Senior Vice President, Global Retirement and Compensation \n     Policy, American Benefits Council.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            American Council of Life Insurers,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 21, 2015.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Bill Nelson,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins and Senator Nelson, The American \n     Council of Life Insurers (ACLI) would like to express our \n     appreciation for your leadership in the field of retirement \n     security, especially in your roles as Chairman and Ranking \n     Member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging. We support \n     you for reintroducing the Retirement Security Act of 2015, a \n     bill that would greatly expand the ability of Americans to \n     better save for their retirement.\n       ACLI represents approximately 300 legal reserve life \n     insurer and fraternal benefit society member companies \n     operating in the United States and abroad. ACLI member \n     companies offer insurance contracts and other investment \n     products and services to qualified retirement plans, \n     including defined benefit pensions, 401(k) and 403(b) \n     arrangements, and to individuals through individual \n     retirement accounts (IRAs) or on a non-qualified basis. Our \n     members and their products help Americans accumulate \n     retirement savings and turn those savings into guaranteed \n     lifetime income.\n       ACLI supports proposals that will help expand coverage and \n     encourage small businesses to sponsor retirement savings \n     plans for their employees. The Retirement Security Act of \n     2015 would help facilitate the use of private multiple \n     employer plans, encourage greater use of auto-enrollment and \n     auto-escalation features, and allow employers to use a \n     ``stretch match'' to incent employees to save even more. The \n     bill would expand tax incentives for small businesses to \n     offer retirement plans, an important consideration for many \n     employers. Likewise, the bill would make it easier for more \n     individuals to access the Savers' Credit, helping low-income \n     workers maximize their savings. These valuable reforms will \n     help to expand a system already important to millions of \n     Americans.\n       Again, we appreciate your continued support of the current \n     retirement security system. ACLI and its member companies \n     look forward to working with you and your staffs to improve \n     retirement security for all Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Dirk Kempthorne,\n     President and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         Fidelity Investments,\n\n                                     Boston, MA, January 20, 2015.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     Dirksen Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Bill Nelson,\n     Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Collins and Nelson: On behalf of Fidelity \n     Investments, I would like to thank you for your efforts to \n     improve retirement security and enhance pension coverage \n     among small employers. The private employer retirement system \n     has been a great success, yet more can be done to improve \n     retirement security and expand access to workplace savings \n     plans.\n       Fidelity supports provisions in the Retirement Security Act \n     of 2013 that would establish a new safe harbor from the \n     401(k) nondiscrimination rules for plans that automatically \n     enroll employees at a minimum contribution level equal to 6 \n     percent of pay. One of the key actions to boost retirement \n     security for workers is to save at the right rates in a \n     workplace savings plan. Automatic enrollment at a minimum of \n     6 percent of pay, along with annual automatic increases and \n     investing appropriately, puts workers on a better path toward \n     retirement security. Our data and analysis show that the \n     average participation rate among plans with automatic \n     enrollment is approximately 90 percent, regardless of the \n     default contribution rate and regardless of the salary level. \n     The 3 percent minimum contribution rate under the current \n     safe harbor is too low and woefully inadequate to put \n     employees on a path to reach their retirement savings goals. \n     Due to human inertia many employees who auto-enroll at 3 \n     percent are unlikely to take any action to increase their \n     savings. Raising the minimum contribution level from 3 \n     percent to 6 percent would go a long way toward increasing \n     savings rates and improving retirement security.\n       Furthermore, Fidelity supports provisions in the bill to \n     streamline and simplify regulations and reduce unnecessary \n     burdens that serve as an obstacle to retirement plan \n     coverage. Regulatory burdens are one of the biggest obstacles \n     to small employers that may otherwise want to offer a \n     retirement plan to their employees.\n       Fidelity applauds your leadership on retirement security \n     and appreciates your efforts to advance these reforms. We \n     hope to work with you as the bill moves through the \n     legislative process to further simplify the rules and \n     streamline duplicative or unnecessary regulations to help \n     achieve your goal of expanding pension coverage.\n           Regards,\n                                                Douglas B.

Susan Collins,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of Lincoln Financial Group, \n     I am writing to express our strong support for the Retirement \n     Security Act of 2015. We thank you for your leadership in \n     sponsoring this very important bill.\n       Congress has made great strides forward in enhancing \n     retirement security, but there are many challenges still \n     ahead. One of the key challenges is improving retirement plan \n     coverage among small businesses. The Act would help address \n     the small business issue by reforming the rules regarding \n     multiple employer plans, which help small businesses achieve \n     many of the economies of scale that large businesses have. \n     The Act would modify the rules to make multiple employer \n     plans more efficient and more workable for small businesses.\n       We also applaud the Act's new automatic enrollment safe \n     harbor and its important enhancement of access to the saver's \n     credit. These provisions will increase participation levels, \n     especially among low and middle-income individuals.\n       We strongly support your efforts and stand ready to assist \n     you in moving forward with this important piece of \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles C.

Susan M. Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: The National Association of Insurance \n     and Financial Advisors (NAIFA) applauds your efforts in \n     preserving and enhancing the voluntary employer-provided \n     retirement system and the tax incentives that support it. \n     These plans are helping millions of American families achieve \n     a secure retirement.\n       The employer-sponsored retirement plan system has \n     introduced tens of millions of American workers to retirement \n     saving. Employers voluntarily establish and promote these \n     plans to help their workers build assets for a secure \n     retirement.\n       NAIFA encourages support for the Retirement Security Act of \n     2015 introduced by Senator Susan M. Collins. The bill would \n     add a new more generous safe harbor for small business \n     retirement plans, establish a tax credit for employer matches \n     for plan sponsors using the new (optional) safe harbor, and \n     ease the rules allowing small employers to join multiple \n     employer pension plans.\n       Cost is often a factor in whether a business will offer a \n     plan for its employees to adequately save for retirement. \n     This bill lowers costs by waiving a requirement that there be \n     a nexus among businesses to join multiple employer plans, \n     thereby allowing more entities to share plan administrative \n     burdens.\n\n[[Page S632]]\n\n     The bill instructs Treasury to simplify, clarify and \n     consolidate notice requirements for retirement plans, and \n     instructs Treasury to provide taxpayers using a 1040EZ filing \n     the ability to report and receive a tax credit, if eligible.\n       We thank you for your leadership in helping employees plan \n     and prepare for a financially secure retirement.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Juli Y.

Bill Nelson,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins and Nelson: On behalf of Principal \n     Financial Group, I want to thank you for your leadership in \n     seeking to improve and enhance the existing voluntary defined \n     contribution system through the Retirement Security Act of \n     2015. Employer sponsored 401(k) plans and other worksite \n     retirement plans have helped millions of workers save \n     trillions of dollars. These plans have proven to be resilient \n     even in challenging times but more is needed to expand access \n     to worksite retirement plans. Your proposal builds upon the \n     strength of the existing system, providing main street \n     businesses the necessary tools to address retirement savings \n     adequacy and coverage challenges.\n       Principal Financial Group is a leading provider of defined \n     contribution plans with more than 70 years' experience \n     working with small to medium-sized employers and their \n     employees. We currently provide retirement services to more \n     than 41,000 retirement plans and 4.5 million employee \n     participants.\n       Principal was particularly pleased with your inclusion of \n     the enhanced automatic contribution safe harbor. We must find \n     ways to encourage far greater numbers of plan sponsors to \n     adopt automatic enrollment and escalation features with \n     substantive employer match contributions. To do this, we feel \n     more flexibility is needed in the existing safe harbor \n     requirements and your proposal offers a good starting point \n     for gaining that additional flexibility.\n       Thank you for your leadership in this area. We look forward \n     to working with you as the process continues. Seeking \n     solutions to these important policy considerations to expand \n     savings rates in the current employer based retirement system \n     is vital to the economic wellbeing of millions of future \n     retirees.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Gregory J. Burrows,\n     Senior Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Society for Human\n\n\n                                          Resource Management,\n\n                                  Alexandria, VA, January 9, 2015.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington,DC.\n     Hon. Bill Nelson,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington,DC.\n       Dear Senators Collins and Nelson: On behalf of more than \n     275,000 human resource professionals who belong to the \n     Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), I would like to \n     thank you for your leadership on the issue of retirement \n     security. The introduction of the Retirement Security Act of \n     2015, demonstrates your commitment to ensuring that all \n     Americans are given the ability to save for retirement.\n       Founded in 1948, SHRM is the world's largest membership \n     organization devoted to human resource management. \n     Representing more than 275,000 members in over 160 countries, \n     SHRM is the leading provider of resources to meet the \n     evolving needs of HR professionals, while advancing the \n     professional practice of human resource management. SHRM has \n     more than 575 affiliated chapters throughout the United \n     States.\n       As human resource professionals, it has been our members' \n     experience that a comprehensive and flexible benefits package \n     is an essential tool in recruiting and retaining talented \n     employees. Regardless of an employer's size, it is vitally \n     important that every employee be given the opportunity to \n     save and plan for retirement and to protect his or her \n     family's financial health. Steps the government can take to \n     facilitate and encourage voluntary employer-sponsored \n     retirement plans and individual savings plans are critical to \n     achieving this goal.\n       Removing barriers and disincentives, especially for small \n     businesses, is a tactic that can lead to greater \n     participation in employer-provided defined benefit retirement \n     plans. A variety of options including tax incentives, \n     increased contribution limits, catch-up contributions for \n     older workers and increased access for employees, are all \n     elements that have proven to increase participation and \n     contribution levels in retirement plans. SHRM believes that \n     the Retirement Security Act of 2015 would benefit both \n     employers and employees by expanding important tax credits to \n     small businesses as well as expanding auto-enrollment safe \n     harbor provisions. These elements are essential for small \n     businesses, who comprise an important segment of our \n     membership, to offer retirement plans that enable their \n     employees to save for retirement.\n       We look forward to working with you in the future to ensure \n     that retirement security for all Americans is preserved.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael P. Aitken,\n     Vice President, Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     Transamerica,\n\n\n                                           Government Affairs,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 22, 2015.\n\n                   Re Retirement Security Act of 2015\n\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins:  On behalf of Transamerica, I would \n     like to thank you for your leadership on retirement security \n     issues as most recently evidenced by your introduction today \n     of the Retirement Security Act of 2015.\n       Your bill addresses in a comprehensive manner problems \n     faced by small and large employers in providing their \n     employees the means to save for a secure retirement, as well \n     as by individuals in trying to achieve a secure retirement \n     through workplace savings. In particular, removing \n     impediments to the adoption of multiple employer plans, \n     expanding the auto enrollment safe harbor and making it \n     easier to claim the Saver's Credit are areas in which \n     Transamerica has been extremely active--from a policy, \n     participant education and market development standpoint. I \n     and others at Transamerica look forward to working with you \n     and your staff as you move the bill forward.\n       The Transamerica companies market life insurance, \n     annuities, pensions and supplemental health insurance, as \n     well as mutual funds and related investment products \n     throughout the U.S. and in selected countries worldwide. \n     Transamerica Retirement Solutions provides and services \n     workforce retirement savings plans in the small and mid-large \n     employer markets. As of December 31, 2014, these plans held \n     in the aggregate over $132 billion in assets for 3.7 million \n     participants. The Transamerica companies are ranked among the \n     top insurance groups in the U.S., based on admitted assets, \n     and employ approximately 11,000 people nationwide.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact either me if I can \n     provide any specific information regarding our retirement \n     plan business or market expertise to support your efforts.\n           Very truly yours,\n\n                                            Jeanne de Cervens,\n\n                                        Vice President & Director,\n     Federal Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Chamber of Commerce,\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 21, 2015.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Vern Buchanan,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins and Representative Buchanan: The U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business federation \n     representing the interests of more than three million \n     businesses of all sizes, sectors, and regions, as well as \n     state and local chambers and industry associations, and \n     dedicated to promoting, protecting, and defending America's \n     free enterprise system, thanks you for introducing the \n     ``Retirement Security Act of 2015.'' Retirement security is a \n     critical issue, and our members support all efforts to \n     encourage voluntary participation in retirement savings \n     plans.\n       The Retirement Security Act of 2015 includes key provisions \n     that the Chamber has set forth as important reforms to the \n     retirement system including eliminating barriers to the use \n     of multiple employer plans; providing optional safe harbor \n     alternatives; and simplifying notice requirements. Overall, \n     the Chamber believes that the Retirement Security Act of 2015 \n     would provide important reforms to encourage participation by \n     both plan sponsors and plan participants in the employer-\n     provided retirement system.\n       The Chamber looks forward to working with you on this bill \n     and urges Congress to take steps to further the enactment of \n     the bill.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              R.

Susan M. Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Bill Nelson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Collins and Nelson, The Plan Sponsor Council \n     of America (PSCA) is pleased to endorse the Retirement \n     Security Act of 2015. The Act removes several impediments \n     that restrict the ability of small businesses to participate \n     in multiple employer plans, or MEPs. Expanded MEP access will \n     open another important avenue for small business owners to \n     provide critically important retirement plans for hardworking \n     employees.\n       The small business arena is the last frontier for improving \n     access to an employer-provided retirement plan. The \n     Retirement Security Act of 2015 will help conquer this \n     frontier, providing a uniform, federal response. This is an \n     especially timely endeavor as states consider enacting new \n     legislation relating to employer-based retirement plans that \n     could result in a problematic patchwork of disparate laws \n     impacting plan sponsors and employees.\n\n[[Page S633]]\n\n       Thank you for your efforts on behalf of American workers.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Stephen McCaffrey,\n\n                                              Chairman, PSCA Legal\n                                        and Legislative Committee.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, this bill is borne out of the work Senator \nCollins and I did on the Special Committee on Aging. After we had a \nhearing on the condition of the American senior citizen, it was \ncertainly clear that something had to be done to give them better \naccess to retirement plans.\n  A lot of the situation that Senator Collins has just described is so \ntrue. Fewer than half of workers have access to any retirement plan at \nwork, and those numbers are even constricted when you start talking \nabout employees who work for smaller business. Only one quarter of \nsmall businesses with less than 100 employees offers any type of \nretirement plan for their employees.\n  The lack of a retirement plan at work means when an individual gets \nto be a senior citizen they are going to end up relying on Social \nSecurity, where we are talking about a benefit of maybe $1,300 a month, \nor $15,000 a year. That is simply not enough to pay for housing and \nmedical care and other expenses. In my State of Florida, one-third of \nthe senior citizens rely on Social Security income to get by in \nretirement. We have to fix this problem. There are too many people who \nwork too hard throughout their lives and get to be in those golden \nyears, and then they are faced with a real crisis.\n\n  So the legislation the two of us have worked on for well over a year \nwill offer retirement plans by encouraging small businesses to set up \nthose retirement plans. One example would be small businesses will be \nable to pool together their resources and take advantage of the \neconomies of scale. There is no reason that a very good retirement plan \ncan't be as a result of cobbling together the resources of many small \nbusinesses and still have a retirement plan that makes sense for the \nindividual retirement business because they are getting the economies \nof scale.\n  The bill is going to encourage the employees to save more with things \nsuch as providing automatic enrollment in retirement plans, and it is \ngoing to encourage increasing the employer match. Those things are all \ncommon sense.\n  I join Senator Collins in urging our colleagues to come together, and \nlet's try to do this for the American senior citizens.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Warren pertaining to the introduction of S. 320 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). The majority leader.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 203\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 4:30 \np.m. on Monday, February 2, the Senate proceed to the consideration of \nCalendar No. 6, H.R. 203; that the time until 5:30 p.m. be equally \ndivided in the usual form, and that following the use or yielding back \nof that time, the bill be read a third time and the Senate vote on \npassage of the bill, without any intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to speak in opposition to the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. This bill will not help our economy, it will not \ncreate permanent jobs, and it certainly is not a boon to the \nenvironment. On item after item, the Keystone pipeline just doesn't \nmake sense for the United States.\n  When we last debated Keystone in November, the price for a barrel of \noil was about $75. That price was already down from a peak of $100 in \n2014, and since then the price has dropped another $25, to less than \n$50 a barrel.\n  In November, the average price of gas was nearly $3 per gallon. This \nweek, gas averages around $2.20 per gallon--the cheapest in nearly six \nyears--and many States are seeing gas under $2 per gallon.\n  In fact, since this pipeline was first proposed in 2008, America has \ngone from the third largest producer of oil to the world's largest \nproducer, surpassing both Russia and Saudi Arabia. As a result of new \nproduction and increasing fuel economy, the final months of 2014 saw \nthe lowest net imports of crude oil since 1986.\n  The Keystone Pipeline is simply not necessary for America's energy \nindependence.\n  Even worse, the oil that moves through the pipeline isn't necessarily \nfor the benefit of the United States. Instead, the pipeline would be a \nconduit to move the oil from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, where it \nwill be refined and sold on the global market. Some individual barrels \nmay be kept in the United States, but much will be exported and prices \nwill be set by international supply and demand. The State Department's \nreview projected that building a pipeline would have ``little impact on \nthe prices U.S. consumers pay for refined products such as gasoline.'' \nI fail to see how the United States gains any economic benefit from \nthis project.\n  Finally, Keystone supporters often argue that the pipeline creates \nlarge numbers of jobs. It is great that this project will create nearly \n2,000 direct construction jobs over 2 years, and more indirectly. \nUnfortunately, those jobs are temporary. That means once the pipeline \nis complete in two years, operating the pipeline will support only \naround 50 permanent jobs.\n  The American economy won't benefit from this bill. American companies \nwon't benefit. American drivers won't benefit, and American workers \nwon't benefit. The economic policies behind the pipeline just don't \nmake sense.\n  Unfortunately, the problems also don't end with the lack of economic \nvalue. This project also comes with substantial hazards for the \nenvironment. Extracting oil from these tar sands would essentially mean \nthe destruction of huge swaths of land in Alberta. The tar sands are \nbeneath 54,000 square miles of boreal forest and peat bog, an area the \nsize of the state of New York.\n  An estimated 20 percent of the deposits require destructive surface \nmining, which entails clearing huge swathes of boreal forest and top \nsoil to get at the tar sands beneath. Already, 175,000 acres of forest \nhave been cleared, but an additional 1 million acres of forest have \nalready been leased for surface mining operations.\n  This destructive form of mining generates large volumes of toxic \nwastewater, which must be stored in vast tailings ponds that already \ncover around 70 square miles. These tailings contain high \nconcentrations of benzene and other carcinogens, as well as lead and \nmercury. Significantly higher levels of these pollutants have been \nfound downstream from tar sands refineries, leading to higher rates of \ncancers, including leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n  The development of these tar sands will have negative effects on the \nenvironment and public health, and it has also contributed \nsignificantly to Canada's failure to fulfill its Kyoto Protocol \nobligations. I believe that Canada should rethink its approach to tar \nsands development.\n  Finally, I wish like to address climate change. No matter how hard \nsome of my colleagues hope climate change isn't real, it is, and we are \nalready seeing harmful effects.\n  Transforming the oil from tar sands into useful gasoline is 80 \npercent more carbon intensive than the processing of typical crude oil. \nProducing, refining, and combusting the oil that Keystone would carry \nwill release up to 168 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions \nevery year. That is 27 million metric tons more greenhouse gas \nemissions than would be emitted from burning the same amount of typical \ncrude oil. To put this in context, those additional emissions over \nnormal processing are equivalent to the annual emissions from 5.7 \nmillion cars, 1.4 million homes or nearly 8 coal-fired power plants.\n  The economics of the Keystone Pipeline don't make sense, and the \nenvironmental risks could well be tragic. We\n\n[[Page S634]]\n\nare being asked to approve a project that will primarily benefit \nCanadian companies and foreign oil markets, while at the same time \naccepting the consequences of the harm the pipeline and tar sands oil \nwould create.\n  If this is about jobs, let's invest in clean energy. The Shaheen-\nPortman energy efficiency bill, for example, is estimated to create \n190,000 jobs. If our goal is to lower fuel costs for American families, \nlet's speed up improvements to fuel economy standards. If we want to \nmodernize our infrastructure, let's get to work on a real \ntransportation reauthorization bill. And if our aim is to exploit our \nenergy resources, let's focus on wind and solar, biofuels, or the \nfuture of batteries and fuel cells.\n  We can do better than the Keystone Pipeline, both for our economy and \nfor the environment. I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the \nKeystone Pipeline.\n  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, today I wish to speak on S. 1, legislation \nto approve the Keystone XL pipeline.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bipartisan bill, which will \napprove construction of the pipeline that has been under review for 6 \nlong years. By moving this project forward, we are helping to secure \nAmerica's energy future, improve our national defense, and create tens \nof thousands of jobs for Americans.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline is a commonsense jobs bill. It should never \nhave been a political issue. It goes far beyond the labor to construct \nthe pipeline--it will drastically increase employment across many \nindustries as we work to develop our North American energy resources. \nIt is disappointing that the President is threatening to veto its \napproval when building Keystone would create American jobs and help \nlower energy costs for families across the country.\n  The American people are still struggling in today's economy, and they \nexpect and deserve Washington to cut red tape and unleash America's \nenergy resources. Building the Keystone XL pipeline is an important \nstep toward meeting these goals, will help ensure America's energy \nsecurity, and reinforce relations with our largest trading partner.\n  Unleashing our Nation's full energy potential remains one of my top \npriorities in the U.S. Senate. I will work to advance serious policies \nthat responsibly develop all of our energy resources, create good jobs, \nand make America more energy independent.\n  It is time we start putting America's issues on the President's desk. \nI urge the President to reconsider his threat to veto the bipartisan \nKeystone jobs bill and to finally take the opportunity to work with \nCongress to find solutions the American people want.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                       Telephone Tracking Devices\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, there is a disturbing report in the \nWashington Post today about a major telephone company, Verizon, putting \nsupercookies on the phones that its customers are using which will \nallow those customers to be tracked, and if that information is turned \nover to third parties, to be utilized for purposes of advertising, even \nthough the customer has indicated they do not want that particular \ncookie placed on their device.\n  Our staff on the commerce committee will be investigating this, and \nwe certainly want to make sure that in this time of ubiquity of eyes \nprying all around in this electronic age we are living in that we \npreserve the rights of privacy for all individuals.\n  This is a matter of particular importance to the commerce committee. \nIt is of extreme importance to this Senator, and I will keep the Senate \ninformed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Department of Homeland Security Funding\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I know we are about to bring some final \nvotes on Keystone to the floor, but I want to take a few minutes to \nspeak on the topic we will be focused on next week, and that is the \nimpending crisis at the Department of Homeland Security should we not \ncontinue to fund their operations, which matters greatly to a State \nsuch as Connecticut--a State with expansive coastline, with natural \ndisasters as part of our recent history, and with a close connection to \nsome of the potential epicenters for terrorist activity and attacks, \nNew York City being at the top of the list.\n  It was just 3 weeks ago that terrorists staged a horrific attack in \ndowntown Paris. Before they were stopped by law enforcement, dozens of \npeople were killed or injured and the world was given another reminder \nof the threats that exist all around us. Across Europe countries \nstepped up their alert, increasing their law enforcement presence, \nraiding suspected terror cells, and requesting the assistance of the \nUnited States to help track down the people who carried out the \nattacks.\n  Astoundingly, though, here at home, it seems as though there are a \nlot of Republicans in Congress who would rather talk about deporting \nchildren who were brought to this country without documentation rather \nthan talk about funding the very agency that every day seems to keep \nour homeland safe from threats.\n  Even as our allies in Europe look for ways to improve their security, \nthe House of Representatives, in particular, has told us that the only \nway we can fund the Department of Homeland Security--keeping this \ncountry safe--is to start deporting young boys and girls who are here \ntrying to make it in the United States.\n  The United States is no stranger to the types of attacks that \nhappened in France. An Ohio man was arrested 3 weeks ago when it was \ndiscovered he was plotting to blow up the United States Capitol. I am \ncertain we have not already forgotten about the Boston marathon bombing \nor what happened before that in Oklahoma City. The threats against this \ncountry continue to evolve.\n  Why should we play politics with the agency that is most responsible \nfor responding and getting this country ready for those threats? It is \nthe height of irresponsibility to suggest, as some of my colleagues \nhave, that shutting down the Department of Homeland Security--the \nDepartment responsible for protecting the United States from terrorist \nattacks--would be no big deal.\n  This is what the Secretary of Homeland Security has said. Last week \nhe said:\n\n     . . . as long as we are on a CR, we cannot engage in new \n     starts, new spending, new initiatives, new grants to state \n     and local law enforcement to fund homeland security missions. \n     We can't put in place the independent panel that recommended \n     changes to the secret service. We can't do a lot of things \n     for border security. Our counterterrorism efforts are \n     limited.\n\n  In 28 days, the Department of Homeland Security, the agency charged \nwith border security, aviation security, cyber security, Presidential \nsecurity, and counterterrorism efforts, is going to run out of funding. \nInstead of working with the Senate, which overwhelmingly passed a \nbipartisan bill to fix our immigration system and secure our border, \nRepublicans are willing to hold up this funding bill so they can deport \nDREAMers against the President's Executive order. It is not just \nirresponsible, it is dangerous.\n  In my State, as I said, it matters greatly. Over the past several \nyears, we have seen, as the northeast has been battered by hurricanes \nand superstorms and blizzards, the indispensable nature of agencies \nfunded in the Department of Homeland Security budget. Failing to pass \nthis bill would delay upgrades to critical and necessary emergency \ncommunication systems for first responders in my State that are \nresponding to emergencies and disasters. Whether we like it or not, \nthey are happening with greater frequency.\n  Fortunately, thanks to the leadership of Senator Mikulski and Senator \nShaheen, there is a path forward. Yesterday they introduced a clean, \nfull-year funding bill that has been endorsed by every Democratic \nSenator. This is the same bipartisan, bicameral bill that was \nnegotiated by the House and the Senate last year.\n  This agreement includes critical assistance, critical increases in \nfunding for our border security, cyber security, air and maritime \nsurveillance, and biological and explosive detection at our borders. \nAll of these things keep us\n\n[[Page S635]]\n\nsafe at a time when we know that terrorism is a more real threat than \never, not just to the United States but to our partner countries all \naround the world.\n  Last week, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution I was proud to \nhave written, declaring that we stand in solidarity with the people in \nFrance, that we mourn the loss of innocent victims and condemn the \natrocity of these attacks.\n  I submit that just as important as our words, which we all came \ntogether to support, are our deeds. Will our response now be to engage \nin a partisan fight over immigration or do we come together as \nRepublicans and Democrats to fund the law enforcement personnel who are \ncharged with keeping our citizens safe?\n  Next week when we return to this body, I strongly urge my Republican \ncolleagues to quickly bring a clean, bipartisan Department of Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill to the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Children's Health Insurance Program\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Children's Health \nInsurance Program. This Congress 20 years ago passed CHIP. It was an \ninvention of Senator Kennedy and Senator Hatch, both Senators who cared \na lot about what we do to help low-income children.\n  I was at Mercy Health Clinic in Cincinnati late last week, and early \nthis week I was at Dayton Children's Hospital, talking to families who \nhave benefitted from the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  In the great majority of cases, the parents of these children have \nfull-time jobs--often two jobs. They typically make significantly less \nthan what we would call a living wage. They rarely have any kind of \nhealth insurance, although now they are entering the exchanges or \nperhaps Medicaid--more likely the exchanges--but their children are not \ngetting health insurance except through CHIP. It has been around for 20 \nyears, and there are about 10 million children in the United States who \nbenefit from the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program is law. It has been \nreauthorized up through 2019, but the funding for it expires this \nSeptember. I have spoken with members of the Senate Finance Committee, \nincluding my colleague here, Senator Nelson from Florida, who has been \na big supporter of the Children's Health Insurance Program. Senators \nCasey and Stabenow have been very involved, Senator Gillibrand, and as \nI said, Senator Hatch was one of the founders of this program, along \nwith Senator Kennedy.\n  It is so important that we move as quickly as possible, in part \nbecause the States need to budget these dollars--this Federal \npassthrough--so that it directly goes to the Children's Health \nInsurance Program. There are a few things we can do that are even more \nimportant than that.\n  In closing, I will add that it is not just the right thing to do, to \nfund the Children's Health Insurance Program, it is also a smart thing \nto do because it means that parents will take their child who has an \nearache to the family doctor because they have insurance, instead of \nwaiting a week, when the pain is unbearable, and taking that child to \nthe emergency room and costing all of us more as taxpayers and perhaps \ncausing that child some hearing loss.\n  In addition to helping these families with health insurance and \nsaving money, it also makes a big difference in schools. The children \nare less likely to miss school and children will be better able to \nlearn if, in fact, they have better health insurance.\n  We know that is the case for our own children. All of us here have \ngovernment health insurance, if you will, as Members of the Senate, and \nit is important that we do what we ought to do for the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program. It matters for so many families in North \nDakota, the Presiding Officer's State, and my State of Ohio.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Thune and Mr. Nelson pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 304 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements \non Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 \nminutes equally divided after each vote and that all after the first \nvote in the series be 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 155\n\n  The question occurs on the Booker amendment No. 155.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, my amendment No. 155 ensures that Federal \nagencies disclose to the public, landowners, and communities any \nsignificant new circumstances learned about the impact of the Keystone \nXL Pipeline.\n  The National Environmental Policy Act--NEPA--is one of the most \nemulated statutes in the world. It is used as a model around the world. \nNEPA in fact is often referred to as the modern-day ``environmental \nMagna Carta.''\n  These are very commonsense ideas. NEPA regulations really do require \nagencies to actually supplement already issued environmental impact \nstatements when significant new circumstances or information is found \nto exist relating to the environmental impacts of a project.\n  The pending Keystone bill, however, would deem the final \nenvironmental impact statement issued last January to fully satisfy \nNEPA. In other words, if new circumstances come up that are germane and \nimportant, they do not get a chance to alter that statement. My \namendment would change that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BOOKER. I respectfully request 25 more seconds to conclude my \ncomments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOOKER. My amendment would change that and would preserve the \napplications of agencies to supplement the EIS. For example, if the \nproposed route of the pipeline was to change, it could mean drinking \nwater supplies and other critical resources would have a higher risk of \ncontamination from a spill. People should know that.\n  When American companies are building projects, they comply with this \nimportant NEPA safeguard. Foreign companies should not be given a \nshortcut. If American companies do it, foreign companies should do the \nsame.\n  This amendment is supported by the Natural Resources Defense Fund, \nthe Sierra Club, and a number of other organizations. I ask my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we are here today because the Keystone \nPipeline border crossing permit has been pending for years. There are \nno shortcuts at play.\n  The Booker amendment, drafted as a savings clause, would withhold the \napproval the bill seeks to confer if there are any new circumstances, \nnew information relevant to environmental concerns. That is the whole \npoint here.\n  The Keystone administrative record is already thousands of pages \nlong. We have had 6 years of dos and redos. If this amendment is \nadopted, it begs the question as to whether there will ever be a \ndecision.\n  I think the obvious strategy of pipeline opponents is to drag out the \napproval process until everybody gives up on it; everyone walks away. \nThat is certainly not the intent of those of us who support this \nbipartisan bill. We don't want to see an endless round of further \nconsiderations. I think the majority here in the Senate believes it is \ntime to move forward. Let's not have continued delays.\n  I urge a rejection of this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call for the regular order with \nrespect to the Boxer amendment No. 130.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. It is my understanding that Senator Boxer is willing \nto forgo a rollcall vote, but she would like to speak to her amendment.\n  I turn to Senator Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I could ask for the attention of my friends.\n  The reason I so wanted have this 1 minute even though I am not asking \nfor a rollcall vote is because I want to make clear what we are doing \nin this underlying bill.\n  This is the only time in the history of the Senate that we have given \nsuch a big hug and kiss to a private company--any private company, \nAmerican or foreign.\n  My amendment simply says that if TransCanada breaks the rules related \nto any permit they have--for example, there is an oilspill and they \ndon't follow the oilspill plan or they don't handle hazardous waste in \nthe right way--a whole list: They use the wrong steel. It is dangerous. \nThey are dangerous to their workers. It doesn't matter what they do, \nunder the underlying bill, S. 1, they can never lose their permit. We \ndon't do that for any other company, let alone a foreign special \ninterest company that is going to take this oil and siphon it right out \nof America. There are 35 permanent jobs. A trail of misery follows the \ntar sands.\n  I am not going to ask for a rollcall vote because I get the writing \non the wall. I would hope we would have a voice vote, and I would urge \nmy folks to yell a ``yes'' if they can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think it is clear that the good \nSenator from California and I disagree on whether the Keystone XL \nPipeline should proceed. It is apparent that we disagree on the reach \nof the section on permits as currently in the bill and also, more \nspecifically, the substitute amendment we are discussing.\n  I am willing to agree that the permits which have already been issued \nshould not be affected. That was the intent of the provision within the \nsubstitute. I am going to be voicing my opposition through a loud \n``nay'' and would encourage my colleagues to do the same.\n  With that, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  I withdraw my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 130) was rejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 141\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided before a vote on the Markey amendment No. 141.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, my amendment is very simple. It would \nrequire that before the Keystone XL Pipeline is deemed approved, we \nshould determine whether carbon pollution, including the carbon \npollution from tar sands oil production, will contribute to an increase \nin more extreme weather events. We should know if carbon pollution is \ngoing to put another climate change card in a deck that is already \nstacked for more extreme rainfall and snowfall and for more dangerously \nhot summer days.\n  Since 2010 there have been 49 weather and climate disasters in our \ncountry that caused at least $1 billion in damages across the United \nStates. We should not be making energy policy decisions that increase \nthe risk of costly, extreme weather events.\n  I urge an ``aye'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I would suggest that this amendment is designed to \nfurther delay this pipeline. It requires that a study be done by all \nFederal agencies with even a smidgen of review authority to determine \nwhether increased greenhouse gas emissions are likely to contribute to \nan increase in more extreme weather events. It doesn't specify that the \nincreased greenhouse gases that are under study are only related to the \npipeline project. So, for instance, the President's deal to allow an \nincrease in greenhouse gas emissions until 2030--if it caused the \nimpacts listed in this amendment, it would stop the pipeline. That is \nnot what we want to do.\n  I am going to be urging my colleagues to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There are now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to the Markey amendment No. 178.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, right now the Canadian pipeline company is \nreceiving a ``get out of Canada free'' slip. They do not have to pay \ntaxes into the oilspill liability fund.\n  My colleagues may remember that last week the Republicans objected \nbecause they said the amendment of Senator Wyden had a blue slip \nproblem from the House because the tax has to originate in the House. \nYou might remember that last Thursday night Senators on the Republican \nside objected to my amendments--late at night and, again, on procedural \ngrounds. Well, the good news is we have been able to find a way to have \na straight up-or-down vote on the substance of whether the Canadians \nhave to pay into the oilspill liability fund. So this is going to be \nthe vote that determines whether they are going to be able to build a \npipeline right through our country--where we are running all the \nenvironmental risk--and if a spill occurs, they have not contributed to \nthe oilspill liability fund.\n  This is a pure vote. It is not procedural. It is yes or no--do they \ncontribute or not to that fund. I urge an aye vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I will be opposing this amendment. I \nbelieve it is unnecessary. We already debated and dispensed with this \njust last week. We voted for the sense of the Senate amendment which \ncalled for a loophole within the oilspill liability trust fund to be \nclosed. We set us on a path to work with the House on that. That \namendment is now part of this bill.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his support in making sure \nwe did adopt that. I think most of us believe this loophole should be \nclosed, and I am confident that we will close it well before the \nKeystone XL Pipeline goes into operation.\n  We have to remember, my friends, that before any oil flows through \nthis pipeline which can be put into the oilspill liability trust fund, \nit has to be built. That is what this bill before us does. I want to \nmake sure that we address this with the House. We will do so.\n\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am very pleased that we are at this \npoint after three solid weeks of debate. The Presiding Officer \nintroduced this bill on January 8, 2015, and it is now January 29. \nAfter weeks of good, solid debate, we have officially passed our \nbipartisan bill to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  This legislation was not only important to pass so we could add more \njobs, have energy security, and good trade relationships with our \nneighbor in Canada, but also we were able to return to what we call \nregular order in the Chamber. The Senate has been given the title of \nthe world's most deliberative body. I think it is fair to say that in \nrecent years we have not really worn that title very well. We have not \nbeen able to engage in the deliberation and debate that I think Members \nof the Senate and the public at large expect.\n  What we have seen over these past few weeks was a return to regular \norder where a Member is free to call up an amendment, have it debated, \nand have it fall or succeed based on a process that has been long \nestablished in this Chamber. That is a good thing to see.\n  Boy, did we have our share of ideas. By last count, I believe there \nwere close to 250 amendments that Members had offered from both sides \nof the aisle. That is a lot of ideas. There was a lot of pent-up \ndemand, if you will, on energy-related legislation.\n  All in all, we voted on just over 40 amendments. I believe the final \ncount was 41 amendments. We made a lot out of the statement that we \nhave surpassed--with just this one bill in 1 month--all of the recorded \nvotes that we had throughout 2014. In fact, we surpassed it with nearly \nthree times more votes than we had in all of 2014.\n  Senator Cantwell and I have been here in the well during this last \nvote, and we have received thanks from Members who said: Thank you for \ngetting us to this point. We appreciate that. Good job.\n  But I think we all recognize there were some points of very clear \ntension around here, and that is just part of the process. Fortunately, \ncooler heads prevailed, and we were able to come back together. We were \nable to get the process moving forward and keep this bipartisan \ncoalition in tact.\n  I will just point out to the Members that with the help of the \nranking member on the energy committee--with the exception of one \nnight--we did it all during daylight hours. Not to get real personal \naround here, but we have gotten into a habit in recent years of not \ntaking up votes until just about the dinnertime hour. I don't know \nabout the rest of you, but when I call the family in for dinner, we \nkind of expect it is dinnertime.\n  I am pleased that we were able to work with everyone's schedule and \nmove through amendments in a fashion that was reasonable and \nstructured. Yesterday was not exactly convenient with the numbers that \nwe processed, but we did it. So I appreciate the great level of \ncooperation we have had. It is not easy to start out a new Congress in \na new majority as the manager of the first bill brought to the floor, \nbut I had a lot of phenomenal help.\n  I wish to take a brief moment to thank those who have provided \ncounsel and assistance to us. This is kind of like the Academy Awards \nfor the first bill coming through the Senate.\n  I would like to recognize my staff on the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee who have done a fabulous job with every part of \nthis process: My staff director, Karen Billups, Pat McCormick, Kellie \nDonnelly, Colin Hayes, Lucy Murfitt, Tristan Abbey, Kate Williams, \nRobert Dillon, Chelsea Thompson, Chuck Kleeschulte, Cathy Cahill, Chris \nKearney, Mike Pawlowski, Chester Carson, Mike Tadeo, Isaac Edwards, \nJason Huffnagle, and Brian Hughes, on the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee and on my personal staff as well. Our interns on the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee, Samin Peirovi and Will Treadwell, also \ndid a great job assisting my staff, including putting together binders, \nmaking sure we had the current amendments and the modifications that \nwere in front of them. So they did a great job as well.\n  I also want to thank the members of the natural resources team in the \nSenate Office of the Legislative Counsel. These folks are kind of the \nunsung heroes. These are the ones who helped prepare the more than 240 \namendments that were offered to this bill. We never see these folks, \nbut they are churning out amendments as quickly as we can move ideas to \nthem. Gary Endicott, Heather Burnham, Christina Jacquet, Michelle \nJohnson-Weider, Deanna Edwards, and Heather Lowell.\n  It is absolutely not possible to do what we did in moving this \nmeasure through--or any measure--without recognizing the work our floor \nstaff does for us. I wish to thank Laura Dove and the entire cloakroom \nstaff, including Robert Duncan and Chris Tuck. The Parliamentarians and \nthe clerks really worked hard.\n  Also I wish to recognize on the Democratic side of the aisle Gary \nand--everybody has just done a phenomenal job and we so appreciate it.\n  I truly must say the opportunity to start with this first bill and to \nbe working with my ranking member, Maria Cantwell, on this effort, \nknowing that she was just getting her staff in line as we moved to this \nbill--the staff director on the ranking side I don't even think had \nofficially been brought on--and it was full on. They have done \nextraordinary work, working with us.\n  I want to recognize Angela Becker-Dippmann and Sam Fowler and all the \nrest of the team because they were extraordinary.\n  I also want to recognize Barbara Boxer and her staff as well. There \nwas so much that needed to be coordinated.\n  I thank my ranking member for her patience, for her partnership, and \nfor really the very good-faith efforts she has made as we have worked \nto get this bill to a conclusion, and offer a continued gesture of \nwanting to work together with her. I want her to know that I will be \nwith her this weekend rooting for the Seahawks at the Super Bowl. So \nyet one more area of her operation, but a grand thanks to my ranking \nmember and my partner on this bill.\n  With that, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor to Senator \nCantwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Capito). The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I wish to speak also for a few minutes \nabout what an incredible process this has been. As the Senator from \nAlaska stated, this was all a very unique experience, coming to a new \nCongress and being the very first bill up and everybody moving to that \ndiscussion. So I thank the Senator from Alaska.\n\n[[Page S642]]\n\n  Let's just say both sides of the aisle tested people on amendments \nand the amendment process, but I would say it was the trust we could \nnegotiate that got us through a couple of rough spots and the fact that \nI could count on the Senator from Alaska for negotiating and trusting \nwhat she had to say about how we could move forward in getting those \nvotes and getting things done. So I thank her for that and I thank her \nfor her leadership. I certainly can't wait to work with her on broader \nenergy policy legislation, because while I think people probably still \nlook at us as representing the States of Washington and Alaska, what \npeople may not realize is how intertwined Alaska's and Washington's \neconomies are. So if there is anybody who can find commonality on \nenergy policy, even given the difference of our States and the \ndifferences on each side of the aisle, I think the Senator from Alaska \nand I will have a chance to do that. I think this process we just went \nthrough bodes well for us trying to say to both sides of our aisles \nthat there are things we can put on the table and discuss and a process \nwe can go through, and that process can work. So I thank her for that.\n  I look forward to the many initiatives--in fact, we just had a \nhearing this morning. I said, with two women heading up this leadership \non the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and two women staff \ndirectors, multitasking is front and center in the U.S. Senate. I don't \nthink a lot of people would see either of us out in the halls making \ndeclarations. I think we just hustled our way to the floor to try to \nget things done. I hope that is what we can do as we move forward \nthrough this process.\n  I too wish to thank certainly Karen Billups on the majority side \nstaff. I hadn't had a chance to work with her yet in this capacity and \nI certainly appreciated her steady hand on that. I want to thank on our \nside our staff director, Angela Becker-Dippmann. The very first day--\nlike sometime in mid-January, I think--to come back to the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee and then have the first bill and have it \nright in front of us and not be totally staffed up, I certainly \nappreciate her leadership and her dedication to energy policy. Also, I \nthank Sam Fowler and David Brooks and Jared Leopold on my staff for \ntheir hard work on this.\n  I too have a list of staff that I wish to read quickly: Will \nDempster, Clayton Allen, Renae Black, Elizabeth Weiner, Tara \nBillingsley, David Gillers, Al Stayman, Dan Adamson, Elizabeth \nCraddock, Nick Sutter, Aisha Johnson, Caroline Bruckner, Bryan Petit, \nFaye Matthews, and Carl Seip. There are also a couple of other people \nfrom my staff, Nicole Teutschel and Travis Lumpkin who also helped.\n  I really want to thank the floor staff. This is the first time I have \nmanaged a bill on the floor, so thanks to Gary Myrick and Tim Mitchell \nand Tricia Engle; and Reema in Senator Durbin's office, and Emma, \nthanks so much for helping us through a process that, as my colleague \nsaid, for the most part didn't take us way late into the night and we \ngot a lot of things accomplished when we could during the day.\n  Needless to say, I am not as excited about the passage of this \nlegislation as my colleague on the other side of the aisle, but we did \nfind out some things during this process. We found out that the \nmajority of the Senate doesn't think that climate change is a hoax. We \ncouldn't quite agree on whether it is significantly caused by man, or \njust caused by man in some areas, but that was a step. We saw huge \nenthusiasm for energy efficiency. We saw that people were willing to \naccept voice votes or receive 95 votes on things that were energy \nefficiency items, so I think that bodes well for the Senator from \nAlaska and me thinking about more energy efficiency policy.\n  Obviously, I remain concerned about the holes in the legislation, \neverything from the things we didn't get to pass--the trust fund--and \nthe fact that we still need to figure out oilspill cleanup processes on \nsomething like tar sands.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Alaska mentioning some of these issues \nas areas for continued work because we will definitely take her up on \nthat process. And, certainly, we want to try to take up some of the \nissues our colleagues, such as Senator Peters, brought up and work on \nthem moving forward. I hope this process, as it relates to this \nlegislation--I hope our colleagues--coming from the State of Washington \nwhere we have so many coal trains and oil trains coming through our \narea, I wish the pipeline would be some remedy for us, but it is not. \nEven according to railroad statistics and other statistics, a pipeline \nis not going to make one dent in the number of oil trains coming to the \nPacific Northwest. So the fact that the Commandant of the Coast Guard \nsays we don't have a solution for cleaning up tar sands is something we \nwant to work on and push forward on.\n  I hope we can get our colleagues around the fact that the number of \ncrude oil incidents has been growing since 2009. It used to be we were \nhaving a decline and now, according to the Associated Press, we are \nseeing an increase; at least 73 different accidents in 2014, an 87-\npercent increase over 2009.\n  We are seeing these new sources being developed and new ways of \ntransporting them, and huge acceleration, and I hope Congress will take \na deep breath and get to these issues as it relates to safety and \nsecurity outlined and into law. I hope we will have a chance to do \nthat.\n  I still hope the President of the United States vetoes this \nlegislation because, frankly, I want him to be able to negotiate. I \nwant him to be able to negotiate with this company the terms and \nagreements by which this pipeline is going to be built. I want him to \nprotect the American economy, I want him to protect the American \nfarmers, and I want him to protect the American environment.\n  Again, I say to my colleague from Alaska that if she and I can get \nthrough these few weeks on a bill that a lot of our colleagues were \npredetermined on, but have so many different amendment discussions, \nthen, yes, maybe it bodes well for a bigger bipartisan energy bill. I \nwill certainly look forward to working with her on that.\n  I thank her for her leadership during a time period where she had \nmany things on her plate, and this was just one of them. I hope we can \nget some of the issues we care about on our side of the aisle that I \nthink really do lead to job growth, such as the energy tax credits, a \nfocus on energy efficiency, and a focus of diversification also on the \nenergy agenda.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from \nWashington for her comments. I think it is clear that we have a great \ndeal of work in front of us, but I think we also have a better idea of \nwhere some of that common ground may be as a result of the discussions \nthis past month. So I am looking forward to advancing an energy \ninitiative through the committee and, hopefully, through the full \nprocess, that will speak to the attributes of affordability, abundance, \na clean energy supply, diverse and secure. We have a lot of work to do.\n  In the comments I made, I thanked a lot of people, but I think it is \nimportant to recognize that the Senator from Washington and I would not \nhave been able to do the job we did--managing this bill on the floor, \nworking with other Members, working with staff on the floor and our \nrespective staffs--if there had not been a very clear and a conscious \ndecision that management of what was going to happen on the Senate \nfloor was going to be a little bit different, that there would be an \nopportunity for debate, and some have described free-wheeling debate. \nWhat is free-wheeling debate? I think we have just kind of defined it \nhere with the Keystone XL Pipeline. I don't know whether that is going \nto be the course for everything going forward, but this was a pledge \nthat the majority leader Senator McConnell made when he became the \nmajority leader. I think we have seen that play out in a process that \nhas been respectful, where at the end of the discussion we can still \nagree to disagree on the bill itself, but the process that has gotten \nus through final passage has been one that, again, was respectful and \ndid allow for full and civil discourse. I think that is what the Senate \nshould be all about and I am proud to have been a part of it.\n  With that, I know my good friend from North Dakota, the prime sponsor \nof this bill, is waiting to speak and I congratulate him for a \nphenomenal job. He and his staff--I should have mentioned his staff. \nRyan and the others\n\n[[Page S643]]\n\nwho have been working behind the Senator from North Dakota have been \ndoing a great job. Senator Hoeven has been articulate, persistent, and \nreally has done a phenomenal job moving this through the process.\n  I congratulate the Senator from North Dakota, and I yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from Alaska \nand the Senator from Washington as the bill managers. I think they have \ndone an exceptional job. I know that is not just my opinion, but it is \nthe opinion on both sides of the aisle. It is not just that they were \nable to do the work on this bill, but actually to facilitate the debate \nthat really enabled us to move through an open amendment process and a \nreturn to regular order. It is not easy to do. Because, obviously, we \nhad people who had ideas on a whole variety of issues, and, clearly, we \nhave strong support for legislation, but there are those who oppose \nlegislation as well. So to find a way to keep that amendment process \ngoing and with more than 40 amendments and, of course, to get to a \nfinal vote and pass the legislation is a real testament to both of the \nbill managers.\n  I thank all of the Members of this body who supported the \nlegislation. A bipartisan vote getting more than 60 votes is no small \nachievement for any piece of legislation. Of course this bill already \npassed the House.\n  We are already conferring now with the House on whether we will need \nto go to conference or hopefully get their concurrence, but obviously \nour objective is to put it on the President's desk as soon as possible. \nThis is an important step in building the kind of energy plan this \ncountry needs. We can't get to energy independence or energy security \nwithout building the infrastructure we need to move that energy from \nwhere it is produced to where it is consumed.\n  We have to remember that, yes, this is about working with our closest \nfriend and ally, Canada. Some of the oil in the pipeline will be moved \nfrom oil production in Canada, but it is also about moving our domestic \noil in this country from States such as mine and from the State of \nMontana and moving that oil as safely and as efficiently and \neffectively as possible and moving it in a way that actually produces \nless emissions than if we try to move all that oil on trains, which is \nwhat is being done now.\n  Moved on trains, we are talking 1,400 railcars a day instead of \nmoving it through a pipeline. It is not only a safety issue, it is not \nonly a cost issue, it is not only an efficiency issue, it is about \nproducing less emissions and making sure we don't create congestion on \nour railroads to move all of the other goods we want to move. This is \nabout building the kind of infrastructure plan for energy and other \nthings we want for this country. I hope the President now will join \nwith us. Clearly we are going to move this to his desk, and I hope he \nwill work with us. That is what the American people want.\n  If we look at this legislation, if we look at this Keystone XL \nPipeline project, it is about energy. It is about jobs. It is about \nhelping to grow our economy. It is about working to achieve national \nsecurity in terms of energy security. It is about building the right \nkind of energy plan for the future of our country.\n  Here is where we are. This process was started over 6 years ago. Not \nonly has this Congress, both the House and the Senate, now advanced \nthis bill in a bipartisan way with strong bipartisan majorities in both \nChambers, but every State on the route, all six States on the route \nhave approved this project as well. We have the Congress that has \napproved it on a bipartisan basis. We have all six States that are \nincluded on the route. They have approved it through their processes. \nWe have the supreme court in the State of Nebraska which has \nadjudicated, legislated in that State. That has been resolved.\n  Our closest friend and ally, Canada, wants us to work with them on \nenergy security for North American energy security, but most important \nof all the American people want this done. In poll after poll, the \nAmerican people overwhelmingly support this project. Over the last 3 \nyears, the support has ranged from 65 percent to 75 percent. Even in \nthe most recent poll that came out this month, 3 to 1, 65 percent to 22 \npercent, the people want the President to sign this bill. Again, I hope \nthe President will join with us and work with us and support this \nlegislation as we work with our leader on the energy committee and with \nour ranking member.\n  We don't agree on everything, obviously, but there are things we can \nwork on together. We are working to build the right kind of energy plan \nfor this country to get energy security. There will be more work to do, \nbut I hope the President will join us in a bipartisan way and sign this \nlegislation.\n  Again, my thanks to the bill managers, to the Members of this body \nwho supported the legislation. I appreciate it very much.\n  I know the good Senator from Texas has a few words, but I will first \nyield the floor back to the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, let me say to the Senator from Alaska \nand the Senator from North Dakota, congratulations, and tell them how \nmuch I admire and appreciate their tenacity. The 114th Congress had a \nlot to prove. Mainly what we had to prove is we weren't like the 113th \nCongress that was completely dysfunctional, particularly the Senate.\n  I have to say to our good friend, the Presiding Officer, it wasn't \nthe House. It was the Senate that was dysfunctional. The House passed a \nlot of legislation that came to die in the Senate because the then-\nmajority leader made the decision he wasn't going to move it. It is a \nnew day in the Senate. While I am sure the bill managers would tell us \nit wasn't easy, we actually have an accomplishment thanks to the \nleadership of the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from North \nDakota, and thanks to an awful lot of people. That is progress.\n  I hope the first efforts we have made by being able to pass \nlegislation--hopefully the House will concur, the Senate, and the \nPresident--we will have done our job. What the President decides to do \nis about him doing his job, but we can't fail to do our jobs just \nbecause he refuses to do his job.\n  In fact, when he has announced for seven different pieces of \nlegislation he is going to veto them, the easiest thing for us to do \nwould be to curl up in a fetal position and say we give up, we are not \neven going try. We haven't done that. Again, I think this is a great \naccomplishment.\n  I would say to my friends, the Senator from Alaska, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, and others who have gotten us here today, well done.\n\n\n                     President Obama's 2016 Budget\n\n  Madam President, I would like to turn to another topic. That seems as \nthough it is a metaphor for life in the Senate. We finished one \nimportant piece of legislation, and we turn the page to the next topic. \nI would like to talk about the budget.\n  Next Monday the President is expected to release his 2016 budget. \nBudgets are a time when you talk about and deal with your priorities. \nThis budget will reflect the President's priorities, I am sure. I hope \none of those priorities is to put the country on a more sustainable \npath. But one of the things I am very glad about is that for the first \ntime the President, in a long time, is actually going to propose his \nbudget on time. The President missed so many previous deadlines over \nthe years that people hardly ever notice anymore--but that is good, the \nPresident releasing his budget on time.\n  While I am happy to see he will finally meet his statutory deadline \nin submitting his annual budget, what I am interested in seeing is what \nhe has in the budget, to see if he is willing to meet the challenges of \nour day by drafting a serious budget, including realistic priorities. \nThat also means making tough decisions, but that is where budgets are \nso helpful.\n  I am an optimistic person, but if the President's State of the Union \nrhetoric is any indication as to what we will see next week, I am \nconcerned the budget will be loaded with more taxes, more spending, and \nmore debt. That certainly isn't a sustainable path forward for the \ncountry, but last year the President's 2015 budget would have raised \ntaxes by more than $1 trillion\n\n[[Page S644]]\n\nand increased our national debt by trillions more and his budget would \nhave never balanced.\n  I can't think of anything worse during a time of slow economic growth \nthan layering on $1 trillion of additional taxes on the people we are \ndepending upon to create jobs and make the investment to get the \neconomy growing again and get America back to work.\n  Here is another sort of sleight of hand the President has been using \nlately. He has been talking a little bit about deficits. Deficits, as \nwe all know, is the difference between the money that comes in and the \nmoney that is paid out on an annual basis. The debt is a different \ntopic. That is the long-term debt. Actually, it is the accumulated \ndeficits which represent the biggest challenge.\n  The President likes to say that, well, the deficit has come down--\nwhich is true--but primarily the reason for that is because of a huge \ntax increase he embraced a couple of years ago along with the sequester \nor discretionary spending caps that were in the Budget Control Act of \n2011. The combination of higher taxes the President sought and got and \nthe spending restraint that essentially was championed on this side of \nthe aisle resulted in lower annual deficits.\n  But the fact is we are still spending money we don't have. As the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee likes to say, we are \nstill overspending. We are still spending money we don't have as long \nas we have any deficit. But deficits will not hold up for long as a \nreliable red herring. Factors contributing to lower deficits will soon \nchange. Spending on ObamaCare and other broken entitlements will only \nramp up from here. On the President's current trajectory, it is only a \nmatter of time before those annual deficits start building again and \nadding even more to our national debt.\n  What the President is hoping is that they will be distracted by his \nhappy talk about lower annual defenses, and we will not pay attention \nto the looming elephant in the room, which is our national debt which \nhas grown more than $7 trillion in the 6 years he has been in office. \nMore than $1 trillion a year. The national debt is $18 trillion and \ncounting. It is set to explode over the long term.\n  I realize most of us can't possibly conceive of what $18 trillion is, \nbut if we consider the fact we have 320 million people in America and \nwe have an $18.1 trillion national debt, each one of us--from the \noldest American, most senior American, to the baby who was just born--\nowes $56,500 in debt.\n  Earlier this week the Congressional Budget Office released its annual \nBudget and Economic Outlook which provides an updated economic forecast \nfor the current fiscal year and for 10 subsequent years. According to \nthe Congressional Budget Office, under current law the national debt is \nexpected to grow more than $9 trillion in the next 10 years. The \nPresident added $7 trillion during the 6 years he has been in office. \nIf we don't do something quickly, we are on a trajectory to add $9 \ntrillion more over the next 10 years.\n  The Congressional Budget Office's report also shows that in 5 years \nthe Federal Government will spend more than $500 billion in interest on \nthe debt alone and $827 billion in 10 years.\n  Here is the ticking timebomb if you think about it. Because of slow \neconomic growth globally, a lot of the Federal Reserve Banks \nessentially for the United States and other countries have done the \nbest they can to keep interest rates low. In America they are next to \nzero. All we need to do is look at the return on our savings accounts \nto see what a meager interest rate is being offered by the bank or \ncredit union on our savings. That is because of Federal Reserve policy. \nThat is true of central banks throughout the world. But inevitably over \ntime those interest rates are unsustainable, so they are going to start \nticking back up. When they go from roughly zero to 4 percent or 5 \npercent, the amount of money we will have to pay on the current $18.1 \ntrillion in debt and on the additional debt that will be added over the \nnext 10 years--unless we get hold of this problem--is going to crowd \nout our ability to do everything from protecting the most vulnerable in \nour society through our safety net programs to jeopardizing our \nnational defense which is something we can't outsource to somebody \nelse. This is something only the Federal Government can do.\n  We had an office holder in Texas a few years ago who talked about the \nYellow Pages test. It always resonated with me. She used to say \ngovernment should not be doing things that we can find in the Yellow \nPages because that means the private sector is doing it. But the one \nthing you won't find in the Yellow Pages is national security, and so \nour ability to protect our way of life and our future is going to be \njeopardized by this debt. That is why Admiral Mullen--former Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff a few years ago--shocked all of us when he \nwas asked ``What is the single largest threat to our national \nsecurity?'' and he said ``The debt.'' That got a lot of us going to the \nbooks trying to figure out what he was talking about, and what he was \ntalking about is what I have been referring to here.\n\n  Let me repeat that second part again. In 2025 we will be spending \n$827 billion in interest on our debt alone. We won't be paying down the \nprincipal; we will just be paying interest on the debt by 2025--$827 \nbillion. That would be the third largest line item in the Federal \nbudget, just behind Medicare and Social Security.\n  The Director of the Congressional Budget Office, Doug Elmendorf, has \nbeen testifying on findings from this report. On Tuesday, before the \nHouse Budget Committee, Dr. Elmendorf stated that ``such large and \ngrowing federal debt would have serious negative consequences.'' He is \nexactly right. When we have to basically take up available credit to \nfinance our national debt, that leaves less credit available to the \nprivate sector to make investments that will actually create jobs. It \nacts like a wet blanket on economic growth. Nothing but fiscal \nuncertainty and crisis will come from our debt continuing to spiral out \nof control.\n  The bottom line is this: Under President Obama the Federal Government \nhas spent the past several years raising taxes. It has increased \nregulations. It is driving our national debt to unprecedented levels, \nand we have a growth rate which reflects that.\n  I know the President was celebrating. He was almost spiking the \nfootball at the State of the Union, saying: Well, we had a 5-percent \nspurt of growth in the gross domestic product last quarter.\n  Well, that is great, but all of the projections show that for the \nnext year, because of all of the factors I have mentioned, growth is \ngoing to continue to bounce along the bottom at a rate of roughly 2 to \n2.2 percent. That is not enough growth to get the economy moving again \nto create the jobs to create the prosperity and lift our economy needs \nto get Americans back to work.\n  In my opinion, the President's policies over the last year have \nactually made it more difficult for businesses to hire workers and for \nfamilies to plan for the future. I would argue that his policies have \nintroduced enormous uncertainty into our health care system, our tax \nsystem, and our financial system.\n  What our country needs now is the same thing which we have needed all \nalong but which we haven't had over the past 6 years. We need genuine \nPresidential leadership, the type of leadership that is required to \nrestore Americans' confidence in the future and to ensure better \nopportunities for the next generations and beyond. We don't need \nPresidential leadership that leads us into more debt, less opportunity, \nand a more dismal future.\n  It is my hope that the President's budget will be exactly what it \nshould be and exactly what the American people deserve; that is, a \nresponsible blueprint for robust, economic growth. There are not a lot \nof problems that face our country that couldn't be addressed in large \npart by robust economic growth. Our economy would grow. Revenues to the \nFederal Treasury would grow, thus reducing our deficits and giving us a \nbetter opportunity to address our debt. More Americans would be working \nagain instead of the lowest percentage of people in the workforce in \nthe past 30 years. That is what they call the labor participation rate.\n  I hope the President's budget will get behind some of these progrowth \npolicies, such as progrowth tax reform--something we are eager to work \nwith\n\n[[Page S645]]\n\nthe President on--and support serious efforts to save Social Security \nand Medicare. The dirty little secret in Washington is that if we don't \ndo anything to save Medicare and Social Security, they are going to \nfall off the fiscal cliff. So doing nothing is not an option, but we \nneed a bipartisan commitment to save Social Security and Medicare.\n  I hope the President's budget will be a balanced one and finally \noffer a long-term plan for controlling our national debt. If it is not, \nwell, we are not going to depend on the President alone; we are going \nto do our job in the Senate and the House and pass a responsible \nbudget. If the President does not propose one, we will show the \nAmerican people what one looks like because we cannot let the President \ncontinue to lead us down this path of unsustainable debt and a darker \nfuture for American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/29/senate-section/article/S645-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Madam President, I am delighted to have heard the speech \nfrom my good friend Senator Cornyn. As the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, I think we are going to have some very serious discussions \nabout the assertion Senator Cornyn and many other Republicans made.\n  Let me begin by saying I am delighted that some of my Republican \nfriends have expressed great concern about our deficit and our national \ndebt. I ask them where they were several years ago when we went to war \nin Iraq and forgot to pay for that war. I happen to think the war in \nIraq is not a war we should have ever gotten into, but be that as it \nmay, I find it interesting that some of the leading deficit hawks went \nto war--a war which will end up costing us some $3 to $6 trillion. For \nthe first time in the modern history of our country, they went to war \nand yet they chose not to pay for it. Then on top of that, in the midst \nof the war, during that period, they gave substantial tax breaks to the \nwealthiest people in this country. In addition to that, they passed a \nMedicare Part D prescription drug program--much more expensive than it \nshould be--written by the insurance companies, also not paid for. But \nnow these same Republicans who came to the floor having voted to spend \ntrillions of dollars on a war we should not have gotten into, having \nvoted to give huge tax breaks to billionaires, having voted for a \nMedicare Part D prescription drug program that was not paid for--lo and \nbehold, they have discovered we have a deficit problem and a national \ndebt problem. This country would be in a lot better shape if they had \nexpressed those concerns 7 or 8 years ago.\n  In my view, there is a war going on in this country. And I am not \ntalking about the war in Afghanistan or Iraq or the instability in the \nMiddle East; I am talking about the war being waged in America today \nagainst the American middle class, against the American standard of \nliving, and against the American dream.\n  Today in the United States of America we have more income and wealth \ninequality than any other major country on Earth.\n  Today in America we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any \nmajor country on Earth.\n  Today in America we are the only major nation not to guarantee health \ncare to all of our people as a right of citizenship.\n  The United States of America once led the world 40 years ago in terms \nof the percentage of our people who graduated from college. In short, \nwe were the best educated people in the world. Today we are in 12th \nplace, and millions of our young people are graduating from college \ndeeply in debt, while others are looking at the cost of college and \nsaying: I am not going to college. I am not going to get a higher \neducation. I can't afford it. I don't want to leave school in debt. Our \ncompeting nations--whether it is Germany, Scandinavia, whether it is \nmany of the European countries--are saying their kids are going to go \nto college regardless of the income of their families.\n  In terms of our infrastructure, we were once the envy of the world. \nToday, according to the World Economic Forum, we are in 12th place.\n  Today in America real unemployment is not the official unemployment \nrate of 5.8 percent; it is over 11 percent if we count those people who \nhave given up looking for work and are working part time.\n  Youth unemployment--an issue we do not talk about--is 18 percent. We \nhave over 5 million young people in this country who either dropped out \nof high school or graduated from high school. Do you know what they are \ndoing? They are doing nothing. They are hanging out on street corners \nin Vermont, Louisiana, and all over this country. There are no jobs for \nthem. In terms of African-American youth unemployment, that number, if \nyou can believe it, is close to 30 percent.\n  What the war against the middle-class and working families is about \nis that millions of our people are working longer hours for lower \nwages. In inflation-adjusted dollars, the median male worker today is \nearning some $700 less than that worker made 40 years ago. The median \nwoman worker--that woman right in the middle of the economy--made \n$1,300 less last year than she earned in 2007. Since 1999, the median \nmiddle-class family has seen their income go down by about $4,000.\n  The great recession, which was caused by the greed, recklessness, and \nillegal behavior on Wall Street, cost our country millions of good-\npaying jobs. It cost millions of Americans their homes and their life \nsavings. It destroyed marriages and left people so destitute that they \ntook their own lives. But the fact is, when people are in economic \ndespair and economic recession, suicide rates go up. While the worst is \nclearly behind us, millions are still trying to claw their way back to \nwhere they were before the greed and financial abuses of Wall Street \nripped the middle class apart.\n  The good news is that in the past 6 years our economy has made \nsignificant progress. We have created millions of jobs, and that is a \ngood thing. Our unemployment rate is down, and we have seen a whole lot \nof people return to work. But when we talk about the economy, we also \nhave to understand that the recovery we are seeing is extremely uneven. \nSome people--the people on top--have done remarkably, unbelievably \nwell. A tiny slice of the population has gobbled up all of the economic \ngains since 2009.\n  Let me repeat that because it is almost impossible to believe, but it \nis true. All of the new income gains after 2009--not 50 percent, not 80 \npercent, not 90 percent--100 percent of all of the income gains after \n2009 have landed in the pockets of the top 1 percent.\n  Today the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns more wealth than the bottom \n90 percent. Today the Walton family--six people--owns more wealth than \nthe bottom 41 percent. Here is the Walton family, six people who are \nworth $144.7 billion, and here is the bottom 41.5 percent of our \npopulation--131 million people who are worth about $123.4 billion. I \nask the American people, is this what our country is supposed to be \nabout--one family owning more wealth than the bottom 41 percent, the \nbottom 131 million Americans? Our economy and our distribution of \nwealth and income is completely out of balance, and this imbalance is \nnot only fundamentally immoral, it is wrong that so few have so much \nand so many have so little. But it is also detrimental to economic \ngrowth, it is dangerous for our financial stability, and in fact it \nthreatens our democracy. Our task is to rebalance this economy; to \ncreate an economy that works well for all of our people and not just \nwealthy campaign contributors--not just the Koch brothers but the \nworking class of this country.\n\n  There was a time after the Great Depression when we built an economy \nthat allowed workers to share in our Nation's prosperity. There was a \ntime when the economy grew to help all people--the rich got richer, the \nmiddle\n\n[[Page S646]]\n\nclass expanded, and poverty went down. That economy brought \nunparalleled prosperity and financial stability to our country and is \naffectionately remembered as the golden age of American capitalism. For \ndecades wages increased alongside rising productivity, and each \ngeneration could reasonably expect to do better than the last.\n  My parents worked very hard so their sons could do better than they \ndid. That was the American dream--a dream, by the way, which no longer \nexists.\n  After rising to more than $56,000 at the start of the 21st century, \nreal median household incomes today have fallen back to where they were \nin 1996, a decline in living standards of more than $4,000 a year. \nSomething is not right in our economy.\n  The good news is the economy is growing. It is much better than it \nwas 6 years ago, and we should be delighted by that. GDP is up. We just \nhad a very strong quarter--5-percent growth. Productivity is up, \nemployment is up, home prices are up, and the stock market is way up.\n  On the other hand, average hourly earnings have barely budged, \nleading economists to resurrect a Depression-era term--a Depression-era \nterm--called secular stagnation. For the first time since the Great \nDepression, our economy is growing in a way that is leaving most of our \ncitizens no better off. In other words, the economy is doing well, but \nthe people are not doing well.\n  In fact the distribution of wealth today is worse than at any time \nsince 1917--1917. The share of wealth owned by the top one-tenth of 1 \npercent is almost the same as the bottom 90 percent.\n  When we talk about the budget--and I will talk about the budget as \nthe ranking member of the Budget Committee--the budget has to be placed \nin a broader context of what is happening in America. What is happening \nin America is the people at the top are doing phenomenally well, the \nstock market is going off the wall, corporate profits are at an alltime \nhigh, while the middle class shrinks and we have almost more people \nliving in poverty than at any time in our history. That is the context \nin which in my view the Budget Committee has to accept its challenge.\n  Today half of all Americans are making less than $20 an hour, half \nthe kids in our public schools are living in poverty, and 62 percent of \nAmericans do not have the money to cover an unexpected emergency room \nvisit or a $500 car repair. In other words, all over this country \npeople are stressed. They are worried about what would happen if their \ncar were to break down. They are worried what would happen if they were \nto get sick because they have no money in the bank. They have nothing \nto rely upon. They are working longer hours and in many cases they have \nnothing in the bank.\n  As the recent elections in Greece demonstrate, ordinary people will \nnot stand by and watch as their economies unravel and as their \ndemocracies unravel. Left unchecked, widening disparities in wealth and \nopportunity here at home can give rise to dangerous levels of social \nunrest. We must rebalance the economy so prosperity is enjoyed by the \nmany--by the middle class, by working families--and not just a handful \nof people on top.\n  We must ensure that our economy continues to grow and that the \nbenefits of a growing economy are widely enjoyed. It is not growth \nversus fairness but growth and fairness. In other words, we can have \nall the growth we want and it doesn't mean anything to the middle \nclass. In fact, the converse is true: We can have all the fairness we \nwant, but if there is not growth, people are not going to gain \nprosperity. In fact, no society has ever flourished without a large, \nprosperous middle class, and that is what we must fight to bring about.\n  My Republican friends believe the economy will grow if we just give \nmore tax breaks to millionaires, to billionaires, and to the largest \ncorporations in America. They refer to this top 1 percent as the job \nmakers or the job creators. They insist if we rub their bellies just \nright--deregulating markets and slashing taxes and all of these nice \nthings for the wealthy and the powerful--we can coax them into building \nan economy that will work for everyone. That is called trickle-down \neconomics: bend over backward for the rich and the powerful, and when \nwe give them their tax breaks, we deregulate and let them destroy the \nenvironment, my God, they are going to create all these jobs for \nworking families.\n  That is what the first George Bush referred to as ``voodoo \neconomics.'' He was right then and that expression is right today.\n  I am sure the Presiding Officer has seen the Kevin Costner movie \n``Field of Dreams.'' These supply-side arguments, these trickle-down \ntheories are the economic equivalent of the field of dreams. The \nRepublicans tell us all we have to do is to build a friendly tax and \nregulatory environment and the ``job creators'' will come. They tell us \nwe just have to get the ``incentives'' right and the wealthy will \ncreate all the good jobs we need. They tell us that if we build the \nrich a better playing field, the jobs will come.\n  That is the mantra of supply-side economics, of the trickle-down \ntheory: If you build it, they will come. The only problem with that \ntheory is it has been tried and the evidence is overwhelming that it \nhas failed.\n  Since 1980 we have seen the marginal income tax rate--the top \nmarginal income tax rate--plunge from 70 to 35 percent. The wealthiest \npeople wanted a reduction in their marginal tax rate, and they got it. \nThe corporate income tax rate dropped from 46 to 35 percent--although, \nby the way, very few corporations pay 35 percent, but they did get a \nreduction in the corporate tax rate. Taxes on capital gains fell from \n28 to 15 percent. We have deregulated the airlines, deregulated \ntelecommunications, deregulated energy, and maybe, most significantly \nand most disastrously, we deregulated Wall Street.\n  We did all of the things the wealthy and the powerful wanted us to \ndo, but instead of unleashing the job creators and ushering in a new \ngolden age that benefits all people, these supply-side gimmicks brought \nus widening inequality and greater financial instability. In other \nwords, these experiments failed. They failed. Our economy has become \nmore unstable. The distribution of wealth and income has become more \nunequal, and it takes the system longer and longer to call back the \njobs that are lost each time we suffer a recession.\n  I am encouraged by some of the comments I have recently heard from my \nRepublican colleagues who recognize that income and wealth inequality \nin America is real. This is a step forward. However, the policies they \nare advocating to address income and wealth inequality will in fact \nmake a bad situation even worse.\n  As the ranking member of the Budget Committee, let me tell you what \nthe Republicans have in mind. They don't say this straightforward, so I \nwill help them and say it straightforward. What they intend to do is to \ncut Social Security, and they are going to tell us all the reasons we \nhave to cut Social Security. That is what they are going to do. That is \nwhat they are going to try to do. We are going to stop them, but that \nis what they are going to try to do. They are going to try to end \nMedicare as we know it and convert it into a voucher program. That is \nwhat the House Republicans voted to do last year. The result will be \nthat there will be more and more out-of-pocket medical expenses for \nolder Americans. They are going to make devastating cuts in Medicaid \nand throw some of the most vulnerable people in this country off of \nhealth insurance and onto the rolls of the uninsured. They are going to \ntry to cut taxes for millionaires, billionaires and large corporations \nand they are going to try to increase military spending.\n  That is what they are going to do. They are going to give long \nspeeches. They are not going to say these things directly, but if you \nlistened closely to the speech my friend and colleague Senator Cornyn \ngave, that is truly what they intend to do.\n  Einstein said it was the height of insanity to keep doing the same \nthing over and over again expecting different results. It is time to \naccept the facts. The facts are that trickle-down economics does not \nwork. It has failed. It is time to get back to doing what does work--\nwhat works for the middle class and working families. That is what we \nhave to get back to.\n\n[[Page S647]]\n\n  So what does work? What is a program we should be advocating that \nmakes sense and that will work for ordinary Americans? The plan is \nactually pretty simple. It is the way economics was taught and \npracticed during the golden age of capitalism, and it flips trickle-\ndown thinking on its head. To put it as simply as possible, our economy \nruns on sales, not a very difficult concept to understand. Sales create \njobs.\n  Businesses don't hire and invest because they want to. They hire \nworkers and invest in new machinery because they have to. They do it to \nkeep up with consumer demand, which is 70 percent of our economy, not \nvery complicated. When people have disposable income in their pockets, \nthey buy products, they buy services, and when they buy those services \nand products, companies hire workers to make those products and deliver \nthose services.\n  We hear a lot of talk about how we need to reduce spending to grow \nthe economy, but that doesn't quite make sense. Spending isn't just the \nright way to grow the economy. In fact, it is the only way to grow the \neconomy. After all, what is the economy? It is our economic pie, our \nGDP. What is that? It is a measure of how much we are spending as a \nnation to buy the goods and services we are producing. If we spend \nless, we don't grow our economy, we shrink it.\n  Contrary to what a lot of people believe, the government is not the \nbig spender in the economy, households are. Their spending accounts for \nroughly 70 percent of our total GDP. That means consumers play a \ncritical role in creating the demand that drives our economy.\n\n  It also means that when the middle class is in trouble--when people \nhave less disposable income--the American economy is in trouble. \nWhether we continue to grow and create jobs depends critically on the \neconomic well-being of the vast middle class. If the middle class is \nweighed down with debt and struggling to get by, the long-term health \nof the United States economy is in serious trouble.\n  Hardworking Americans with money to spend are the real job creators. \nThey are the customers who supply the demand of the vast majority of \nwhat our businesses are trying to sell.\n  This is not just Bernie Sanders speaking. Talk to many of the large \ncompanies out there and they say they are seeing a drying up of their \ncustomers because the economy is so bad. That is what the folks in many \nindustries will tell us today. Our economy does well when people have \nincome to spend. This is not a complicated theory. If people can't buy \nproducts, companies are not making products. Companies are not \nproducing services.\n  Since the Wall Street crash, many of the jobs that have been added to \nthe economy have been low-wage and part-time jobs. In fact, the jobs \ncreated during the recovery in the last few years pay 23 percent less \non average than those that were lost in the recession. In his State of \nthe Union Address, the President talked about ``middle class \neconomics,'' and that is an excellent way to put it. It is a powerful \nreminder of what drives growth and prosperity. When we understand this, \nwe understand why our economy cannot function when those at the very \ntop are pocketing 100 percent of the income gains.\n  Let me repeat that. The top 1 percent is not getting 50 percent of \nall new income, not getting 80 percent of all new income--they are \ngetting 100 percent of all new income. Our most important job creator, \nthe vast middle class, is disappearing. Squeezed by decades of rising \ncosts and stagnant incomes, they just can't do it. When those at the \nvery top take more and more of the gains, our job creators--i.e., the \nmiddle class--get squeezed. Debt becomes a substitute for income, and \nthe economy becomes even more fragile.\n  Let me show an incredibly revelatory chart. This chart talks about \ndistribution of average income growth during expansions and what the \nbottom 90 percent received versus what the top 10 percent of families \nreceive.\n  We go back from the period of 1949 to 1953, 1954 to 1957, 1958 to \n1960, 1961 to 1969, 1970 to 1973, 1975 to 1979, 1982 to 1990, 1991 to \n2000, 2001 to 2007, 2009 to 2012. That is the last we have.\n  What this chart shows is that in the first three decades after World \nWar II the vast majority of Americans did well when the economy did \nwell.\n  This is the percentage of new income that went to the bottom 90 \npercent, and this is what the top 10 percent got. They did OK. The top \n10 percent did pretty well. They got 20 percent of all new income. But \nthe bottom 90 percent got 80 percent of the income. Then 1954 to 1957 \nwent down a little bit, but the bottom 90 percent did pretty well. \nAgain, the bottom 90 percent did pretty well, and here the bottom 90 \npercent did pretty well. Then the bottom 90 percent begins to do less \nwell, and again less well, but they are still getting a majority of the \nnew income.\n  Whoa--what happens in 1982? Well, Ronald Reagan is President--and the \ngood news is we are into trickle-down economics. Here it is. This chart \ntells it all. This is what the top 10 percent got, and this is what the \nbottom 90 percent got.\n  Here we are in the last number here, where we are today, and, lo and \nbehold, the top 10 percent gets it all. And, frankly, this is a \nmetaphor. This is an example of exactly what trickle-down economics is \nall about.\n  So early on, in economics, when we have a recovery, most of the new \nincome goes to working families and to the broad middle class. Since \nthe 1982 period, almost all of the new income goes to the top 1 \npercent. Today, as I mentioned--rather unbelievably--all of the new \nincome is going to the top 1 percent.\n  Clearly, this is unacceptable. This trend of the rich getting richer \nand everybody else getting poorer is not what America is about, and it \nhas got to be changed. We have to rethink the fundamentals of supply-\nside, trick-down economic theory.\n  The difficulty we have, to be frank, is that, especially since \nCitizens United and especially since the millionaires and billionaires \ncan pour huge amounts of money into the political process, for them \nthis is great news. This chart is fantastic news. They have won. They \ncontribute to candidates, and candidates go out and tell us we need \nmore tax breaks for the rich, we need more deregulation. And these are \nthe results. So not only do we need to change our economic policies. \nClearly, we need to change campaign finance so the work being done by \nCongress reflects the needs of working families and not just the \nbillionaire class.\n  Now, let me say what I think we should do. I do not believe we should \ngive more tax breaks to the rich because they are getting richer and \ntheir tax rates have gone down. I do not believe we should give more \ntax breaks to large corporations, because there are huge loopholes in \nour corporate tax system and we are losing about $100 billion every \nsingle year because corporations and millionaires are stashing their \nmoney in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens.\n  We have a situation right now in this country in terms of our \nindividual tax breaks where hedge fund managers who make millions of \ndollars a year pay an effective tax rate lower than a truckdriver or a \nnurse. That makes no sense to me nor do I believe it makes sense to the \nAmerican people.\n  So I will very briefly say what I think makes sense and an agenda \nthat will put Americans back to work at decent wages.\n  No. 1, if we want to create jobs in America, we don't pass the \nKeystone Pipeline bill. That creates 35 permanent jobs. That creates \nseveral thousand construction jobs. And, by the way, that allows the \nCanadian firm to produce and transport some of the dirtiest fuel in the \nworld, which will only exacerbate the problems of climate change--doing \nexactly the opposite of what the scientific community tells us we \nshould do.\n  So if we want to create more than 35 permanent jobs, maybe we should \nbe serious about rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure; that is, our \nroads, our bridges, our water systems, our wastewater plants, our dams, \nour levees, our rail system, our airports. Think of what America would \nlook like when, instead of having a sub-par infrastructure--an \ninfrastructure now ranked 12th in the world--we lead the world with \ncutting edge technology. A $1 trillion investment could put 13 million \nAmericans back to work at good wages. In my view, that is exactly what \nwe should be doing.\n  Right now in this country we have a significant number of people \nworking\n\n[[Page S648]]\n\nat the starvation wage--the Federal minimum wage--of $7.25 an hour. We \nmust raise the minimum wage to a living wage. When we do that, we \nprovide a pay raise for some 25 million Americans who today are \nstruggling economically. And when we do that, we not only help them, \nbut we also help the economy because, as I mentioned earlier, when \nthese folks have money they can then spend some money.\n  We have to provide pay equity for women workers. It is not acceptable \nthat women today earn 78 percent of what male workers earn who do the \nsame job.\n  We have to deal with the scandal of overtime right now, where we have \nworkers in McDonald's who make $25,000, $28,000 a year and who are \n``supervisors'' and therefore are exempt from overtime regulations. So \nthey may be working 50 or 60 hours a week making very little money, yet \nbecause they are ``supervisors,'' they don't get time and a half. \nEnding that and raising that $23,000 threshold to something like \n$56,000 would provide a huge pay increase for millions and millions of \nworkers.\n  We live in a very, very competitive global economy, and it makes no \nsense to me that in that economy we have large numbers of young people \nwho are giving up on the dream of getting a good education and going to \ncollege or graduate school. Others are leaving school deeply in debt. \nWe should learn from many of our competitors who say to their young \npeople: You want to go to college? You can go to college, regardless of \nyour income because tuition is free.\n  A few months ago, one of the States in Germany was the last State in \nGermany to do away with tuition. What one of their political leaders \nsaid was: Look. We believe all of our people have the right to go to \ncollege, and income should not be an impediment. I agree with that.\n  We need finally to do what I know is very, very difficult for many of \nthe Members of this body, and that is take on Wall Street. We have a \nhandful of huge financial institutions that have assets equivalent to \n60 percent of the GDP of the United States of America. They issue half \nof the mortgages in this country and two-thirds of the credit cards in \nthis country. I believe that is just too big. I fear very much about \nanother too-big-to-fail scenario where we have to bail them out.\n  As we know, Republicans recently have pushed through language to take \naway some of the protections that taxpayers had in Dodd-Frank and once \nagain leave them exposed to bailing out Wall Street when they engage in \ndangerous derivative speculation.\n  Lastly--and this is not just an economic issue, although it is; it is \na moral issue--we have millions of senior citizens and people with \ndisabilities in this country who are struggling with incredible courage \nevery single day to buy the food they need and to buy the medicine they \nneed, and, in cold States such as mine in Vermont, to heat their homes. \nThis is not just rhetoric. This is reality. There are--God knows how \nmany--seniors who say: Well, I can't buy my medicine if I am going to \nheat the house. I can't heat the house if I am going to buy my \nnutrition. We know that all over the country the Meals On Wheels \nprograms have waiting lines because it is a place for low-income \nseniors to get nutrition. Yet we have an effort right now on the part \nof Republicans to say that, well, yeah, we have millions of seniors \ntrying to get by on $12,000, $13,000 a year, but we are going to cut \ntheir benefits. Well, they may make that effort, but I will do \neverything I can to stop it.\n  There are very simple remedies for the problems facing Social \nSecurity, and we should make a couple of things very clear. Despite a \nlot of the rhetoric that we hear, Social Security is paid for by the \npayroll tax and does not add to the deficit. So take that issue away.\n  The second issue is that Social Security is going broke. Well, the \nsimple truth is Social Security is not going broke. Social Security has \nabout $2.6 trillion in its trust fund and can pay out about all the \nbenefits owed to all eligible Americans for the next 19 years. If we \nwant to make Social Security solvent--not for 19 years, because I think \nwe have to extend that--if we want to make it solvent for 30 years or \n40 years and if we want, as I believe we should, not to cut benefits \nbut to expand benefits, and if we want to do the right thing for our \nparents and our grandchildren, then I think we defeat every effort out \nthere to cut Social Security. I think we lift the cap on taxable income \nso that millionaires contribute more into the Social Security trust \nfund. I think we have that moral obligation to our parents and our \ngrandparents.\n\n  Let me conclude by saying this. I think the evidence is overwhelming \nthat trickledown economics is a fraud. It works for the very wealthy; \nit does not work for working families. The job of this Congress is to \nprotect the middle class and working class, and not just billionaire \ncampaign contributors.\n  With that, I thank the Presiding Officer for your indulgence, and I \nyield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/29/senate-section/article/S648-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LINDA GIBBONS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am grateful for the opportunity to pay \ntribute to a wonderful staff member and dedicated public servant, Linda \nGibbons. Linda will be retiring this week after 22 years of devoted \nservice. I know I speak for everyone on my staff when I say she will be \ndeeply missed.\n  As a member of my constituent services team, Linda helped thousands \nof Utahns who contacted my office seeking assistance. In serving \nconstituents, she was always sympathetic to their needs and worked \ntirelessly to resolve their problems. Constituent casework is \ndifficult, often requiring hours of tedious research and coordination \nwith Federal and State agencies. But Linda was always equal to the \ntask, and I can say without reservation that she was among the best \ncaseworkers I have ever had.\n  Linda was passionate about public service. Her work ethic always \nimpressed me, and I was grateful for her willingness to assume new \nresponsibilities. She is tenacious, honest, and always believes in \ndoing the right thing.\n  Most importantly, Linda has a deep capacity to care for and love \nothers. Both constituents and staff know this well. She has always gone \nout of her way to listen to and help anyone in need.\n  I will always be grateful for Linda's work in helping me nominate \nUtah's most talented young students to military academies. Military \nacademy nominations can be laborious and cumbersome, but Linda always \nsaw candidates through the process with a remarkable degree of \nefficiency and professionalism. In doing so, she mentored some of \nUtah's best and brightest. She also built strong ties between our \noffice, the students, their families, and officials from military \nacademies.\n  Although Linda has achieved much in her professional life, perhaps \nher greatest success has been in the home. Linda has been married to \nher husband, Phil, for over 40 years, and together they have three \nchildren and seven grandchildren. She loves her family dearly and looks \nforward to spending more time with them in her retirement. Her \ncompassion and strength have shepherded them through some of life's \nmost difficult challenges.\n  I am truly grateful for the tremendous service Linda has rendered to \nmy staff, her community, and the great State of Utah. I will miss Linda \ngreatly, but I know that this next chapter in her life holds many \nexciting and wonderful opportunities. I will be forever grateful for \nher dedicated service and loyal friendship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/29/senate-section/article/S648-2", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S648-S649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SUBCOMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join \nme in honoring the life and work of Teamsters Local 350 Secretary-\nTreasurer Bob Morales, who died in South San Francisco on January 26 at \nthe age of 71. Bob was a great labor leader and a dear personal friend, \nand I will miss him terribly.\n  Born in El Salvador in 1943, Bob came to the United States with his \nfamily as a teenager. After completing his education in San Francisco, \nhe served in the United States Army for 2 years, reaching the rank of \nSergeant Fifth Class.\n  Bob began his extraordinary career with the Metal Polishers and \nPlaters Union of the AFL-CIO. He joined the Teamsters Local 350 in 1973 \nas a business representative, quickly becoming secretary-treasurer \nafter only 2 years. In this role, Brother Bob negotiated some of the \nbest union contracts in the Nation, providing his members with \noutstanding wages and benefits. A fearless advocate for California \nworkers, Bob held several positions within the Teamsters, serving as \nthe first and only director of the union's Solid Waste, Recycling and \nRelated Industries Division, secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Joint \nCouncil 7, and Chairman of both the California and National Teamsters \nHispanic Caucuses. As a testament of his successful leadership, Bob's \ncolleagues named him a trustee to the Western Conference of Teamsters \nPension Trust--the largest labor pension fund in the western United \nStates. In 1992, Bob was honored as Labor's Man of the Year in San \nFrancisco.\n  Beyond his tireless work in the labor movement, Bob was involved with \nnumerous charitable organizations, including the United Way of \nCalifornia, the Martin Luther King Jr. Society of San Francisco, the A. \nPhilip Randolph Institute, the Hispanic Foundation, and the San \nFrancisco Senior Centers.\n  On behalf of the people of California who Bob so diligently served, I \nsend my deepest condolences to his wife Maria, son David, their \nextended family, and Bob's many friends, colleagues, and \nadmirers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/29/senate-section/article/S650-3", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S650-S651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF SCHOOL CHOICE\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, the Senate passed a resolution \nthat I was proud to cosponsor recognizing this week as National School \nChoice Week.\n  As a former school board member, I understand that State and local \ngovernments are best equipped to make education decisions for their \ncommunities--not Washington. Students and parents deserve to choose the \neducation that meets their needs. I am committed to empowering parents \nwith the ability to choose the best education options for their \nchildren.\n  I asked Arkansans to share with me why school choice is important to \nthem. Crystal Holland of Beebe wrote to me about her son, Hunter, who \nhas high-functioning autism. She wrote that he was misdiagnosed with \nADHD when he was 4 years old and diagnosed with autism when he was 11 \nyears old. ``He missed out on some very important critical skills \nbecause of all the discipline problems he was having due to anxiety,'' \nHolland wrote. ``School choice allows me to homeschool him as a result \nand I am very thankful for the opportunity.''\n  Bob and Mary Anne Fielder of Hot Springs included competition in \ntheir email to me. ``Competition is always good. You would see a much \nimproved public school system,'' they wrote.\n  I agree with the Fielders. Competition among schools improves the \nstandards for everybody. This Congress\n\n[[Page S651]]\n\nwe will take important steps to improve education nationwide by fixing \nNo Child Left Behind. This is a key vehicle to providing flexibility to \nStates and to families so they can make the choices about education \nopportunities for their children.\n  This week I skyped with students at public charter schools across \nArkansas. The students said having educational options was important to \nthem because it allows them to be better prepared for their interests \nbeyond high school graduation.\n  I am proud to support National School Choice Week and the outstanding \neducational choices that Arkansas offers. When it comes to education, \nit is important that we get the job done right. Allowing the freedom to \nchoose between educational options for children is one way we can help \nparents make the best decision for their children's futures.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/29/senate-section/article/S651-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/29/senate-section/article/S651-2", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/29/senate-section/article/S651-3", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:09 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 351.

S. 302. A bill to establish in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, \nand Labor of the Department of State a Special Envoy for the Human \nRights of LGBT Peoples; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, throughout my career, I have been proud to \nstand up for equality for all Americans regardless of their sexual \norientation or gender identity. While I have seen much progress with \nrespect for the rights of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender, \nLGBT, community within the United States, the struggle for equality and \njustice abroad remains significant. Many countries have laws that \ncriminalize homosexuality, prohibit public support of the LGBT \ncommunity and persecute those who identify as LGBT. To adequately \naddress the challenges posed by these discriminatory laws, the United \nStates must make LGBT rights a priority in all of our foreign policy \nand there needs to be dedicated position responsible for coordinating \nthat effort. That is why, today, I am introducing the International \nHuman Rights Defense Act of 2015, which directs the Department of State \nto make international LGBT human rights a foreign policy priority and \nwould establish a Special Envoy position in the Bureau of Democracy, \nHuman Rights, and Labor responsible for coordinating that effort.\n  Over the past few years, conditions have deteriorated for LGBT \nindividuals in many regions of the world. Russia enacted a ban on \narbitrarily-defined ``homosexual propaganda,'' endangering the position \nof many LGBT individuals and their allies. Russia's law has been the \nbasis for similar legislation threatened or introduced in countries \nacross Eastern Europe and Central Asia, including Lithuania, \nKyrgyzstan, and Belarus. In December 2013, India's Supreme Court \nreversed a lower court ruling and reinstated the criminalization of \nhomosexuality in the second most populous nation on earth. Nigeria, \nUganda, and Gambia have all passed laws that make homosexuality a crime \npunishable with life imprisonment. While Uganda's law was overturned by \nits Constitutional Court, leaders have pledged to pursue similar \nlegislation. Conditions for transgender individuals are particularly \ntroubling in Brazil, where 113 transgender individuals were murdered in \na 1-year period.\n  In light of these alarming developments, I am introducing the \nInternational Human Rights Defense Act of 2015. It is critical that the \nUnited States fight for LGBT equality both at\n\n[[Page S655]]\n\nhome and abroad. The Obama Administration has taken great steps in \naffirming and strengthening the United States' commitment to LGBT \nequality as a critical component of our international human rights \nobjectives. However, our government does not yet have a comprehensive \nstrategy for addressing LGBT discrimination overseas and we lack a \ncentral individual office responsible for inter-bureau and inter-agency \ncoordination to achieve these objectives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Mr. Nelson, Mr. Heller, Mrs. \n        McCaskill, Ms. Klobuchar, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Moran, and Mr. \n        Blumenthal):\n  S. 304. A bill to improve motor vehicle safety by encouraging the \nsharing of certain information; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, last year we saw an all-time record number \nof motor vehicle recalls, including those by General Motors, Toyota, \nHonda, and others.\n  The commerce committee held five vehicle safety hearings, examining \nGM ignition switches, Takata airbags, and the related question of \nwhether the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, \nis up to the task of providing effective oversight of the auto \nindustry.\n  What is absolutely clear, from our hearings and other media coverage, \nis that we need to ensure potential vehicle safety defects are \nidentified as early as possible so we can protect consumers and \nhopefully prevent deaths and injuries. That is why earlier today \nSenator Nelson and I introduced the Motor Vehicle Safety Whistleblower \nAct.\n  I am pleased to note that Senators Heller, McCaskill, Klobuchar, \nAyotte, Moran, and Blumenthal have cosponsored this important \nlegislation. Senators Moran and Blumenthal being added as original \ncosponsors of this legislation is important because of their respective \nresponsibilities as the chairman and ranking member of our subcommittee \non consumer protection, which has played a large role over the years on \nvarious automobile safety efforts.\n  This afternoon I am pleased that Senator Nelson has joined me on the \nfloor as a lead sponsor to discuss this important piece of legislation \nand our ongoing work on vehicle issues. As the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, one thing that has remained constant on our committee \nis the spirit of bipartisanship.\n  With regard to S. 304, the Motor Vehicle Whistleblower Act, this \nlegislation will incentivize auto employees who uncover serious \nallegations of vehicle defects or violations of motor vehicle safety \nlaws that could lead to death or serious bodily injury to voluntarily \nprovide that information to the Department of Transportation.\n  If such information leads to the Department of Transportation or the \nDepartment of Justice enforcement action that totals more than $1 \nmillion in penalties, the whistleblower would be eligible to share in a \nportion of the total penalties collected. This bill will protect the \nwhistleblowers' identities and allow DOT to share information with the \nDepartment of Justice and other Federal agencies where appropriate.\n  Other agencies have similar programs, including programs that \nincentivize individuals to report information to the Securities and \nExchange Commission and to the Internal Revenue Service. NHTSA plays a \nkey role in ensuring the safety of vehicles that consumers drive on our \nroadways. Record fines have been levied against Toyota, General Motors, \nHonda, and other manufacturers.\n  In 2014, NHTSA issued more than $126 million in civil penalties, a \nrecord amount, exceeding the total amount collected by the agency in \nall of its 43-year history.\n  Ensuring the safety of American motorists is a priority, but the \npublic's trust has been shaken due to the record number of recalls this \npast year. Almost 64 million vehicles were recalled in 2014, which is \nabout 3 times the number of vehicles recalled in 2013--and the concerns \nmany have about problems in the industry and at NHTSA.\n  After my repeated calls on the President to fill what had been a \nlengthy vacancy regarding the Administrator position at NHTSA, which \noperated without a Senate-confirmed Administrator for 389 days, I am \nglad to say the commerce committee did its job to ensure that Dr. Mark \nRosekind was confirmed as Administrator before the end of last year. \nHowever, there is much more work that needs to be done.\n  The defects associated with the GM ignition switch recall and the \nTakata airbag recalls were apparent failures with serious safety \nconsequences that resulted in death and serious injury. As we learned \nfrom the GM incident, delays in reporting safety-related defects to the \ngovernment can cost lives.\n  In recent years, Congress has enacted, and NHTSA sought to implement, \na robust early-reporting regime. I believe we can do more to ensure \nthat NHTSA is informed of potential defects as early as possible. Some \nof the major automakers and other manufacturers have also instituted or \nsought to improve internal safety reporting systems that encourage \nemployees to report safety problems.\n  I applaud these efforts, but reports of employees whose concerns may \nhave been ignored, silenced, or possibly even covered up persist. If \nthere are potential whistleblowers with important information to help \nNHTSA identify more defects that are not being addressed, we want them \nto come forward so these problems can be identified much earlier in the \nprocess.\n  I think we would all agree it is better to address a problem before \ninjuries or deaths occur, if at all possible, rather than relying \nprimarily on fines imposed after the fact. This is a commonsense, \nbipartisan bill that will help to prevent injuries and deaths for \nAmerican drivers.\n  NHTSA and other stakeholders have provided input on this legislation. \nI look forward to working with these groups and my colleagues, and \nparticularly with Senator Nelson, as we move forward with the committee \nto process and pass this legislation.\n  I yield the floor to Senator Nelson for his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, in light of the late hour, just before our \nvotes, I will submit for the Record a statement which correlates with \nthe chairman of our committee, and I thank the Senator for so much of \nhis cooperation over last year and all the investigations and the \nhearings that we did, as well as now.\n  What I will say that is new is I will provide an update on the status \nof the committee's investigation into the defective Takata airbags. \nWhen we had the hearing last November which I had the privilege of \nchairing, we received testimony from several witnesses, including a \nsenior executive from the Takata Corporation, which manufactures the \nairbags involved in the rupture and the explosive incidents that \nbasically have lacerated people with pieces of metal. The airbag that \nis supposed to save their lives, in fact, is endangering their lives, \nand in some cases killing them. This has happened to two of my \nconstituents in Florida.\n  While the hearing produced some basic information about the problem, \nmany questions still remain.\n  Senator Rockefeller, then the chairman of the committee, other \nSenators, and I sent a letter to Takata requesting information and \ndocuments related to Takata's airbag defects. In their initial response \nprovided to the committee in early December, Takata included a list of \nall the incidents it was aware of that had allegedly involved a death \nor injury caused by a ruptured Takata airbag.\n  Takata's response reveals that the scope of injuries involved in the \nTakata airbags appears to be greater than we previously thought. In its \ninitial response, Takata identified 5 deaths and 64 injuries. Although \nsome of these incidents may be ultimately tied to other causes, this \npotential injury figure is far bigger than what had been reported in \nthe press. Unfortunately, 1 death and 17 of these injuries occurred in \nmy State of Florida--more than any other State. Among the alleged \ninjuries in my State, many were serious, including lacerations and \nfractures to the face, burns to the neck, face, and torso, and \ntraumatic brain injury and hearing loss.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n\n[[Page S656]]\n\n  Mr. NELSON. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute to \nconclude my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Sadly, I have even more bad news to report today. Through \npublic information, we have learned that an exploding Takata airbag \nappears to be responsible for yet another death. Less than 2 weeks ago, \na Texas man who was driving with his 11-year-old cousin was involved in \na low-impact crash. When the airbag deployed, instead of protecting \nhim, the airbag ruptured and sent a metal piece of shrapnel into the \nman's neck. When the police arrived, he was already dead.\n  We are awaiting more information from Takata and we are determined to \nget to the bottom of this.\n  I look forward to working with the chairman on this issue. We plan to \ncontinue the investigation until all of our questions have been \nanswered. We are going to do everything possible to get to the bottom \nof this issue so that consumers are made whole.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 312. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 regarding school libraries, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I join with my colleagues Senators \nCochran and Whitehouse in introducing the Strengthening Kids' Interest \nin Learning and Libraries, SKILLS, Act.\n  Fifty years ago, when President Johnson urged Congress to enact what \nwould become the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, he \nspecifically called for an investment in school libraries, decrying \nthat school libraries were ``limping along.'' Results from a recent \nNational Center for Education Statistics survey show that there are \nstill gaps in access to school libraries. Approximately 8,800 schools \ndid not report having a library media center, and only about \\2/3\\ of \nthe traditional public schools that did have libraries reported having \na full-time, certified librarian. One in five traditional public \nschools reported having no paid, State certified library staff at all.\n  Effective school library programs are essential supports for \neducational success. Multiple education and library studies have \nproduced clear evidence that school libraries staffed by qualified \nlibrarians have a positive impact on student academic achievement. \nKnowing how to find and use information are essential skills for \ncollege, careers, and life in general. A good school library, staffed \nby a trained school librarian, is where students develop and hone these \nskills.\n  Our bipartisan legislation would reauthorize and strengthen the \nImproving Literacy through School Libraries program of the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act, the only federal initiative explicitly \ndedicated to supporting and enhancing our nation's school libraries. \nThe key improvements to the program include ensuring that elementary, \nmiddle, and high school students are served; expanding professional \ndevelopment to include digital literacy instruction and reading and \nwriting instruction across all grade levels; focusing on coordination \nand shared planning time between teachers and librarians; and ensuring \nthat books and materials are appropriate for and gain the interest of \nstudents with special learning needs, including English learners.\n  The SKILLS Act would also strengthen Title I by requiring State and \nschool district plans to address the development of effective school \nlibrary programs to help students gain digital literacy skills, master \nthe knowledge and skills in the challenging academic content standards \nadopted by the State, and graduate from high school ready for college \nand careers. Additionally, the legislation would broaden the focus of \ntraining, professional development, and recruitment activities under \nTitle II to include school librarians.\n  Absent a clear Federal investment, the libraries in many of our high \npoverty schools will languish with outdated materials and technology or \ncease to exist at all, and in turn, students will be cut off from a \nvital information hub that connects them to the tools they need to \ndevelop critical thinking and research skills necessary for success. \nThis is a true equity issue, which is why I will continue to fight to \nsustain our Federal investment in this area and why renewing and \nstrengthening the school library program is of critical importance.\n  I urge our colleagues to join us in cosponsoring the bipartisan \nStrengthening Kids' Interest in Learning and Libraries Act, and to work \ntogether to ensure that it becomes a part of the upcoming \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself and Mr. Cardin):\n  S. 318. A bill to prioritize funding for the National Institutes of \nHealth to discover treatments and cures, to maintain global leadership \nin medical innovation, and to restore the purchasing power the NIH had \nafter the historic doubling campaign that ended in fiscal year 2003; to \nthe Committee on the Budget.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Accelerating \nBiomedical Research Act.\n  The bill allows more funding for the National Institutes of Health by \nallowing NIH funding to grow even while we continue to live under \naustere funding caps.\n  NIH funding has been a bipartisan effort working with Democrats--\nSenators Kennedy and Harkin, as well as Republicans--Senators Hatfield \nand Specter. We successfully fought to double NIH's budget from $13.6 \nbillion in 1998 to over $30 billion today. We supported it to speed the \ntransition of discoveries from science to treatment and maintain \nAmerica's global competitiveness.\n  But the NIH budget hasn't kept up with inflation. Its budget has been \ngrowing, but slowly. That means the NIH budget buys 20 percent less \nthan what it did when the doubling was completed in 2003. Which means \nwe are missing out. Missing out on potential treatments, potential \nbreakthroughs, potential cures. We have no shortage of ideas. \nScientists have ideas but they cannot test them without funding. What \nis the solution?\n  We need to redouble our commitment to medical research. This bill \ncreates a 6-year plan to put NIH back on stable ground. It is steady \ngrowth, it is predictable, and it is fiscally sound.\n  The bill allows for new spending for NIH that does not count against \nthe strict budget caps. So we can put more money into cures without \ntaking it away from other compelling human needs funded within the \nLabor-HHS Appropriations bill.\n  Why NIH? Why should we have new spending for NIH when other spending \nis stagnant or being cut? Personally, I would lift the sequester caps. \nI think they are doing real harm, but I recognize we do not all agree \non that. I think we do all agree that NIH research is worth increasing \nbecause it both helps the economy and saves lives.\n  First, let me talk about how NIH helps the economy. The NIH is a \nworld-class institution. I call it the National Institutes of Hope, \nserving as the foundation for U.S. medical innovation which employs 1 \nmillion U.S. citizens, including 19,000 at NIH and 14,000 NIH employees \nwho live in Maryland. NIH generates $84 billion in wages and salaries, \nexports $90 billion in goods and services. Every dollar we invest in \nNIH generates $2-$3 in economic activity. Every patent NIH generates \nprovides the foundation for 8 private sector patents. In 2013, products \nbuilt on licensed NIH and FDA inventions reported a total of $7 billion \nin sales. Investing in NIH is good for our economy\n  But I do not call NIH the National Institutes of Hope because of its \neconomic impact. NIH gives hope because of its human impact. Just look \nat what we have done with Federal investments in NIH, cutting the \ncancer death rate by 11 percent in women and 19 percent in men. HIV/\nAIDS is no longer a death sentence. Polio and small pox are essentially \neradicated in this country.\n  These medical breakthroughs did not just happen. They occurred \nbecause our government supported the NIH. And because the NIH supported \ndedicated scientists seeking knowledge and medical breakthroughs.\n  And now, that support is being eroded.\n  I have heard the American people say, they want Congress to be \nfrugal. But I haven't heard anyone say: ``Let's\n\n[[Page S657]]\n\ndelay finding a way to prevent Alzheimer's'' or ``Let's encourage our \nyoung scientists to work abroad'' or ``Let's put a hold on finding a \ncure for cancer'' or ``Let's discourage our universities from \nresearching treatments for rare pediatric tumors''.\n  I am for being frugal but we must not jeopardize or hamper America as \nthe gold standard, as the worldwide leader in medical research and \ninnovation.\n  I am for being frugal but not at the expense of the next generation \nof scientists and the health of American families.\n  Discovery is the genius of our country. When President Jefferson \ncommissioned Lewis and Clark to find water route to the Pacific, the \nmission was called discovery. Discovery is part of our Nation's DNA. It \nis what makes this Nation great.\n  To have innovation we must have discovery. This requires: Investing \nin our human capital, educating our people, and funding their research. \nThat is why I support funding for NIH. And that is why I am introducing \nthe Accelerating Biomedical Research Act today.\n  I hope my colleagues will agree and support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Sullivan):\n  S. 319. A bill to designate a mountain in the State of Alaska as \nMount Denali; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce legislation \nwhich has been proposed in the past by the Alaska Congressional \nDelegation to officially restore the traditional name of the nation's \nhighest peak, currently Mount McKinley, to its traditional Interior \nAlaska Athabascan name, Denali.' I am joined in sponsoring this bill by \nmy colleague from Alaska, Senator Dan Sullivan.\n  Since passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act \nin 1980 the Alaska Delegation has been trying to change the name of the \ntallest mountain in North America back to its Alaska name. In 1980 \nCongress did change the name of the national park and preserve where \nthe mountain is located to Denali National Park and Preserve, from its \nearlier name of Mt. McKinley National Park. But unfortunately the name \nof the peak itself continues to refer to a President who never set foot \nin Alaska.\n  While I have great respect for President William McKinley and great \nrespect for the wonderful State of Ohio where he was born, the peak at \n20,230 feet has always been called by Alaska's first Athabascan \nresidents as Denali, meaning ``the high one.'' It is simply fitting in \nthis day and age of greater awareness of Native history that the \nmountain return to a name that honors its Native ancestry.\n  Already there are a number of towns and institutions named in honor \nof the 25th President. He has a monument for him at his birthplace in \nNiles, OH, and another on McKinley Monument Drive where the McKinley \nNational Monument is located, not far from the Pro Football Hall of \nFame in Canton, OH. There is McKinley Heights in Ohio. There are more \nthan 20 schools in Ohio named for him. There is a county in New Mexico \nnamed after him. There are literally hundreds of streets, libraries and \nother institutions and businesses named for him nationwide. There is no \ndanger than Americans will not remember and honor the assassinated \nPresident.\n  But no official in the territory of Alaska actually named the \nnation's tallest mountain after the former President. That was done by \na prospector William Dickey, who took it upon himself to name the peak \nin 1896. The Alaska State Place Names Board in 1975 took official state \naction to rename the peak, restoring its traditional name of Denali. I \nclearly believe that there is every reason for this Congress to follow \nAlaskans' desires and the desires of Native Americans and restore the \nname to the English translation of what it has been called for \nmillennia, on Federal maps and documents.\n  I hope that this Congress will finally agree to this name change.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. WARREN (for herself, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Brown, and Ms. \n        Baldwin):\n  S. 320. A bill to authorize the collection of supplemental payments \nto increase congressional investments in medical research, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to announce the \nintroduction of the Medical Innovation Act, which is a commonsense \nproposal that could dramatically increase our Nation's investment in \nlifesaving medical research.\n  During much of the 20th century, America made significant investments \nin this area through the National Institutes of Health, and it has been \na remarkable success. We have transformed medicine across America and \naround the world. NIH support helps train each new generation of \nscientists and develop each new generation of medicine. NIH-supported \ndiscoveries often get picked up by small, creative, nimble \nbiotechnology companies, which in turn get picked up by large \npharmaceutical companies, which in turn sometimes result in wildly \nsuccessful blockbuster drugs. Each of these blockbuster drugs brings in \nmore than $1 billion a year for the drug companies, and each one \ntransforms lives.\n  Nearly everyone in Congress supports increased funding for NIH, but \nfor 10 years the NIH budget hasn't even kept up with the pace of \ninflation. Why? Because nobody wants to step up and find a way to pay \nfor it.\n  It is time to break the stalemate. The Medical Innovation Act would \nincrease NIH funding without raising taxes and without stealing support \nfrom other critical programs. Instead, support would come from \nblockbuster drug companies--only those that relied on government-\nsupported research to generate billions in sales and only those that \nbreak the law and enter into major settlement agreements with the \ngovernment. In such cases, the government settlements would go forward \nas they normally do, but the offending company would also be required \nto reinvest a relatively small portion of the profits it has generated \nas a result of taxpayer-supported research and put that money right \nback into the NIH.\n  We celebrate the accomplishments of our pharmaceutical industry--\nespecially the industry's billion-dollar blockbuster drugs. These drugs \nhave literally transformed the treatment of high cholesterol, diabetes, \nHIV, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, breast cancer, colon cancer, and \nleukemia. They help Americans live longer, healthier lives. But we also \nknow that blockbuster drugs don't just appear overnight as if by magic. \nRarely do they result from a single giant company's individual genius.\n  I agree with Republican Senators Alexander and Burr, who say in a \nreport released just this morning:\n\n       [I]n many cases, the research leading to the discovery and \n     development of these products has been advanced, funded, or \n     enabled in some way by NIH.\n\n  Drug companies make great contributions, but so do taxpayers.\n  The big drug companies are making billions as a result of these \ninvestments, but over the last 10 years a few of our wealthiest drug \ncompanies have been caught making money a second way--by skirting the \nlaw. These companies are not getting swept up in minor paperwork \nmistakes. They are not victims of overly eager regulators. They have \nbeen caught defrauding Medicare and Medicaid, withholding critical \nsafety information about their drugs, marketing their drugs for uses \nthat aren't approved, and giving doctors kickbacks for writing \nprescriptions for their drugs.\n  Between 2007 and 2012 the world's largest pharmaceutical companies \npaid over $13 billion in fines and settlements. Despite those numbers, \nit is clear that for the biggest drug companies this is simply a cost \nof doing business. In fact, several of the biggest drug companies have \nbeen caught breaking the law, have paid a fine, and then have broken \nthe law again. And why not? Even the biggest pharmaceutical settlement \never--a $3 billion penalty for withholding life-threatening safety data \nand engaging in illegal marketing practices--accounted for less than 10 \npercent of what the company made selling those drugs. In fact, the day \nthe settlement was announced, that company's stock price actually went \nup.\n  It doesn't have to be this way. The Medical Innovation Act would \nserve\n\n[[Page S658]]\n\ndouble duty--requiring more accountability from the biggest drug \ncompanies while giving medical research the support it deserves.\n  This isn't a tax; it is simply a condition of settling to avoid a \ntrial in a major case of wrongdoing. If a company never breaks the law, \nit will never pay. If an accused company goes to trial instead of \nsettling out of court, it will never pay. It is more like a swear jar. \nWhenever a huge drug company that is generating enormous profits as a \nresult of Federal research investments breaks the law, it has to put \nsome money in the jar to help fund the next generation of medical \nresearch.\n  Since we announced this proposal, we have seen an outpouring of \nsupport from hospitals, doctors, patient groups, and research \nuniversities. All of them want to break the stalemate on NIH funding \nand get back to the business of saving lives.\n  We have also heard some grumbling from the army of lobbyists that \nworks for some of the biggest drug companies--companies that would \nprefer not to pay a bigger penalty when they break the law. If they \nhave better ideas for ending this congressional stalemate and getting \nmore money into NIH, I am eager to hear them.\n  These lobbyists have also claimed that there is ``no logical basis'' \nfor asking these companies to pay up when they break the law. Well, I \ndisagree. If a company that is making literally billions of dollars as \na result of taxpayers' NIH investments turns around and engages in \nallegedly illegal conduct and wants to settle to make the case go away, \nthat seems like a pretty logical basis for asking them to invest a \nlittle in the next generation of medical breakthroughs.\n  Lobbyists have also written that the Medical Innovation Act might \ncreate ``unnecessary litigation.'' Well, it is illegal to defraud \nMedicare. It is illegal to pay kickbacks to doctors. It is illegal to \nhide safety data from the FDA or manufacture drugs in dirty, \ncontaminated facilities. Our biggest and most successful drug companies \nmake billions of dollars by inventing treatments and improving the \npublic's health, and when they do, we applaud them for it. But if they \nwant to avoid unnecessary litigation, then they should follow the law. \nIf they don't want to put a dollar in the swear jar, then stop \nswearing.\n  I don't kid myself. I know how difficult it is to get things done in \nWashington, and I understand that a handful of powerful actors with \nmoney and power likes things just the way they are and will fight any \neffort to change. But even if a few of the biggest drug companies don't \nlike it, I am hopeful that we can build support for this idea because \nthe Medical Innovation Act is a major move toward substantially \nincreasing Federal support for medical research in a way that doesn't \nraise taxes and doesn't cut other critical programs.\n  If this policy had been in place over the past 5 years, NIH would \nhave had nearly $6 billion more every year to fund thousands of new \ngrants to scientists and universities and research centers around the \ncountry. That is almost a 20-percent increase in NIH funding.\n  It has been 10 years of stagnant Federal investments followed by \nsequester cuts, 10 years of rejecting potentially life-changing \nresearch proposals at NIH, 10 years of telling young researchers that \ntheir innovative ideas have almost no chance of getting off the ground. \nWe are running out of time.\n  Today we are choking off support for projects that could lead to the \nnext major breakthrough against cancer, heart disease, Ebola, \nAlzheimer's, diabetes, or other deadly conditions. We are starving \nprojects that would transform the lives of our children on the autism \nspectrum. We are suffocating breakthrough ideas that would give new \nhope to those with ALS.\n\n  That is not who we are. We are not a nation that abandons the sick. \nAnd we are not a nation that says, ``I've got mine, the rest of you are \non your own.'' We are a nation of people who work together. We are a \nnation of people who invest in each other. We have done it for \ngenerations--and for generations we have led the world in medical \ninnovation.\n  It is time to renew that commitment--our commitment to our children, \nour commitment to our parents, our commitment to ourselves, by making \nit a little easier for the biggest drug companies to help develop the \nnext generation of cures and making it a little harder for them to \nprofit from breaking the law and defrauding taxpayers. It is time to \npass the Medical Innovation Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/29/senate-section/article/S658-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S658-S659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 53--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON \n                            ARMED SERVICES,\n\n  Mr. McCAIN submitted the following resolution; from the Committee on \nArmed Services; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                               S.

Res. 58\n\n       Whereas in 2002, the Harvard School of Public Health and \n     MENTOR: the National Mentoring Partnership created National \n     Mentoring Month;\n       Whereas the goals of National Mentoring Month are to raise \n     awareness of mentoring, recruit individuals to serve as \n     mentors, and encourage organizations to engage and integrate \n     quality in mentoring into their efforts;\n       Whereas a mentor is a caring, consistent presence who \n     devotes time to a young person to help that young person \n     discover personal strength and achieve his or her potential \n     through a structured and trusting relationship;\n       Whereas quality mentoring encourages positive choices, \n     promotes self-esteem, supports academic achievement and \n     introduces young people to new ideas;\n       Whereas mentoring programs have been shown to be effective \n     in combating school violence and discipline problems, \n     substance abuse, incarceration and truancy;\n       Whereas research shows that young people who were at risk \n     for not completing high school but who had a mentor were 55 \n     percent more likely to be enrolled in college, 81 percent \n     more likely to report participating regularly in sports or \n     extracurricular activities, more than twice as likely to say \n     they held a leadership position in a club or sports team, and \n     78 percent more likely to volunteer regularly in their \n     communities than young people who were at risk for not \n     completing high school and who did not have a mentor;\n       Whereas youth development experts agree that mentoring is \n     critical to the social, emotional, and cognitive development \n     of youth, helping them navigate the path to adulthood more \n     successfully;\n       Whereas mentors help young people set career goals and use \n     their personal contacts to help young people meet industry \n     professionals and find jobs;\n\n[[Page S661]]\n\n       Whereas mentoring is a proven cost-effective investment: \n     for every dollar invested in mentoring, there is a 3-dollar \n     return to society;\n       Whereas all of the above-listed benefits serve to link \n     youth to economic opportunity while also strengthening the \n     fiber of our communities; and\n       Whereas despite these benefits, 1 in 3 youth will reach age \n     19 without a mentor, constituting a ``mentoring gap'' that \n     demonstrates a need for collaboration and resources: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes January 2015 as ``National Mentoring \n     Month'';\n       (2) recognizes the men and women who serve as staff and \n     volunteers at quality mentoring programs and who help our \n     young people find inner strength and reach their full \n     potential;\n       (3) acknowledges that mentoring is beneficial because it \n     encourages educational achievement, reduces juvenile \n     delinquency, improves life outcomes, and strengthens \n     communities;\n       (4) promotes the creation and expansion of quality \n     mentoring programs across the country to equip young people \n     with the tools needed to lead healthy and productive lives; \n     and\n       (5) supports initiatives to close the ``mentoring gap''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/29/senate-section/article/S661-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 248.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor a couple of people \nwith Ohio ties who have dedicated much of their careers to public \nservice, Rob Lehman and Luke Albee. Rob Lehman served more than two \ndecades on Capitol Hill and in the executive branch most recently, and \nthat is when I got to know and work with him as chief of staff to my \ncolleague from Ohio, Senator Rob Portman. Rob Lehman served as chief of \nstaff when Senator Portman was the U.S. Trade Representative, so he \nunderstands why trade and enforcement of trade rules are such important \nissues to a State such as Ohio.\n  He was helpful when Senator Portman and I testified together before \nthe International Trade Commission on behalf of Ohio Steelworkers. \nFortunately, in this case the ruling was on the side of Ohio \nmanufacturers. In some cases China and now in other cases Korea have \nnot played fair and have broken trade rules. Rob Lehman provided \nbreadth and insight to Senator Portman on this issue and so many others \nthat are important to Ohio during my colleague's 4 years in the Senate.\n  I wish to also honor Luke Albee. Luke is a native Ohioan and long \ntime Senate aide. He is a Cleveland native and, like myself, a die-hard \nCleveland Indians fan.\n  Luke Albee had a long tenure in the office of Senator Patrick Leahy \nof Vermont, rising from an entry-level position to become his chief of \nstaff. He served in the same role--which he is about to leave--for my \ncolleague Senator Mark Warner of Virginia. He began in Senator Leahy's \noffice answering mail and later guided the office through the September \n11 attacks, the anthrax discovery on Capitol Hill, and other memorable \nevents while chief of staff--like a 5-hour dinner with Senator Leahy \nand Fidel Castro while on a trip to Cuba in 1999. Like Rob Lehman, Luke \nAlbee likes to bring people together and reach common ground so the \nSenate can move forward the way it should.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/29/senate-section/article/S662-6", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MARK POWDEN\n\n  Mr. BROWN. I wish to also say a few words about another career public \nservant. He is not leaving public service, but he is leaving the chief \nof staff's position in my office. Mark Powden has been my chief of \nstaff since 2009. He started with Senator Jeffords when Senator \nJeffords was a Republican and then became an Independent.\n  Mark Powden grew up in Vermont, where he worked for his own State \ncongressman and senator. Mark later became the staff director for the \nRepublicans. In fact, he was the staff director for the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee as it went through its \ntransition to a new name. He was with Senator Jeffords when Senator \nJeffords switched parties in 2001.\n  Mark, as I said, has served as my chief of staff for more than 6 \nyears now and will move over and be the staff director for the banking \ncommittee. At the same time, he will take with him Graham Steele, who \nserved ably as my legislative assistant, and will also take his \nassistant Megan Cheney to the banking committee. Graham will be chief \ncounsel, and Megan will be a legislative aide in the Senate banking \ncommittee.\n  My thanks especially to Mark Powden for the terrific work he has done \nas my chief of staff, and I am thrilled he is going to stay with me to \ndo the very important job of staff director as I become ranking member \nof the Senate banking committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/29/senate-section/article/S662-7", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S662-S663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, tomorrow, Friday, January 30, is Earned \nIncome Tax Credit Awareness Day. It is a day to highlight a vital tool \nfor Americans working--and I emphasize ``working''--their way out of \npoverty.\n  Too many Americans work hard, play by the rules, take responsibility \nfor their lives, but simply can't get ahead. They are in low-wage \njobs--sometimes two low-wage jobs--and don't really have much \nopportunity where they live or due to their circumstances to get a job \nthat pays closer to a living wage. There are millions of Americans \nliving in this situation. The EITC helps provide for their children, to \nbuild economic security to allow them to pursue the American dream.\n  Signed into law in 1975, expanded by every single President since \nthen, the EITC was created to make sure we have a tax system that \nprovides an incentive to work. That is what it has done.\n  EITC's expansion in the 1990s led more than half a million single \nmothers to move from cash welfare assistance to work, making it twice \nas effective--without the side effects, I might add--as welfare reform. \nSince its creation, EITC has lifted more children above the poverty \nline than any other government program.\n  I will emphasize that it rewards work, most importantly. In 2012, 28 \nmillion American households--almost 1 million from my State of Ohio--\nbenefited from the EITC with an average credit of more than $2,300.\n  I met Juanalicia Duran in Cleveland last year. She told me she lives \npaycheck to paycheck not because she overspends, not because she is \nirresponsible, but simply because she does not make a lot of money. She \nsaid receiving the EITC is the one time of year\n\n[[Page S663]]\n\nshe pays off her bills. She is barely making it, getting a little bit \nbehind week after week, month after month, then she gets that check \nof--I don't know how much Juanalicia Duran gets, but on average she \ngets a check for a little over $2,000. It helps her to pay her bills \nand maybe get a little bit ahead.\n  Rosa Olea of Toledo works as a manager of a fast food restaurant and \nmakes $9.35 an hour. Imagine that--a manager of a restaurant making \n$9.35 an hour. She said her family struggles to pay bills. The EITC has \nbeen a lifesaver since she found out about it through her local VITA \ncenter.\n  There are thousands of stories like this, and we hear hundreds and \nsometimes thousands of them from Ohioans.\n  In last week's State of the Union Address, President Obama laid out \nplans to reform the Tax Code by making the current earned-income tax \ncredit and child tax credit permanent by expanding credit for middle-\nclass families to raise children and save for retirement. Some in this \ntown responded--not surprisingly--by saying that reforming the Tax Code \nstarts with cutting taxes for big business. Think about that.\n  Most of the time, I hear people in this town--people with good \ntitles, paid well, dressed well, getting a good government pension and \nhealth care benefits--say that the first thing we need to do with tax \nreform is lower the corporate tax rate. It is all about trickle-down \neconomics. You cut taxes on big companies, you cut taxes on the \nwealthy, and maybe it will trickle down and help workers and families.\n  Well, the experience of the last 25 years doesn't really say that. \nThe one time we tried trickle-down for a decade--from 2000 to 2010--we \nhad no net private sector job gain in this country. Zero. But when we \ntried focusing on the middle class and growing the economy from the \nmiddle out during the Clinton years, we had a 22-million--it may have \nbeen almost 23 million--private sector net increase in jobs. And since \nthe auto rescue, when we have focused on the middle class for the last \n5 or 6 years by building the economy out, we have had job growth for 56 \nor 57 months in a row.\n  If we are going to reform the Tax Code, we need to draw a line in the \nsand: No tax breaks for corporations without tax breaks first for \nworking families.\n  There is one glaring hole with the earned-income tax credit. Under \ncurrent law, workers without children who are making minimum wage \nbarely receive any EITC. Childless workers under 25 don't qualify at \nall. That makes young people and workers without children the only \ngroup who can be taxed deeper into poverty.\n  My State of the Union guest was Jason Jacobs, a Cincinnati resident \nand paraprofessional. He is a college graduate. He went to Ohio \nUniversity. He has a degree to teach. He has not found a full-time \nteaching job. He is a paraprofessional in the West Clermont School \nDistrict who works with special needs students and does the kinds of \nthings people should be rewarded for. Last year he made less than \n$16,000. I believe he is paid hourly. He is obviously not paid in the \nsummer. He is not paid on nonschool days. Because he doesn't have \nchildren, he will miss out on this critical tax credit.\n  That is why my legislation, the Working Families Tax Relief Act, will \nnearly triple the size of the earned-income tax credit for workers \nwithout children, expand access to young workers, and will make \npermanent enhancements to the EITC to 2017.\n  We know what this will do. We know that children from low-income \nfamilies where the families are eligible and qualify and earn the \nEITC--and I say earned the earned-income tax credit. That is why it is \ncalled earned--because these are always working families who are \nplaying by the rules, doing the right thing, and taking responsibility. \nWe know that children from families who have earned the EITC have \nhigher test scores, higher high school graduation rates, and higher \ncollege attendance rates. Expanding EITC means more people attending \ncollege and more people getting GEDs. It means working more hours and \nhigher salaries. Why wouldn't we invest in the earned-income tax \ncredit? It means stronger communities.\n  If we fail to act to renew the provisions that expire in 2017, 50 \nmillion Americans would lose all or part of the EITC and CTC--50 \nmillion Americans who are doing the right thing. They are working hard \nand taking responsibility for their lives. We would just give up on \nthem? We would be glad to do corporate tax breaks, but we would give up \non the 50 million working Americans?\n  Sixteen million of them--including 8 million children, if we don't \nrenew--will be pushed into poverty or deeper into the poverty they are \nalready in. It is the worst kind of class warfare aimed at working \nfamilies. These workers need help to get out of poverty, not to be \ntaxed into it.\n  Renewing the expanded EITC will help so many people in this country. \nIt is not just the right thing to do; it is the smart thing to do \nbecause it will bring more wealth to our communities. They will spend \nthe money locally. It will help small businesses, and it will make a \nbig difference in a lot of lives.\n  While we work to renew and expand this program, I encourage Ohioans \nwho may be eligible for the EITC to visit the IRS Web site irs.gov or \ncall 1-800-906-9887 or find a local Volunteer Income Tax Assistance \nCenter, VITA. It is a vital and free resource for working families.\n  To receive EITC, all you have to do is file your taxes. That is it. \nYou have earned it; just ask for it. Spread the word about EITC. It is \na bridge out of poverty and serves millions of American families across \nOhio and across the Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/29/senate-section/article/S663-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10:30 A.M.
