Mr. President, just before the State work period, I \nasked Senators to consider some important questions: In a time of \nlimited Federal resources and tough choices, is it fair to treat \nlocalities that cooperate with Federal law enforcement or work hard to \nfollow Federal law no better than localities that refuse to help or \nactually actively flout the law? When a deputy sheriff puts her life on \nthe line every day, is it fair to make her live in constant fear of \nbeing sued for simply trying to keep us safe? When felons enter our \ncountry illegally and repeatedly, is it fair to victims and families to \nnot do what we can now to stop them?\n  The answer is that it isn't fair. That is why colleagues should \nsupport the legislation we will consider this afternoon. It aims to \nensure more fairness to cities and States that do the right thing, \nredirecting certain Federal funds to them from those that choose not to \ndo the right thing. It aims to support law enforcement officers who \nrisk everything for our safety, protecting them from lawsuits for \nsimply doing their federally mandated duties. It aims to deliver \njustice for victims and their families, substantially increasing \ndeterrence for criminals who commit felonies and then try to illegally \nreenter our country--endeavoring to save more Americans from the pain \nthese families continue to experience every day.\n  We all know the heartbreaking story of Kate Steinle. Kate was walking \narm in arm with her father one moment, begging for help the next as she \nbegan bleeding to death in his arms. The man who ended her life \nshouldn't have even been there that day. He had been convicted of \nseven--seven--felonies and deported five times, but San Francisco is a \nso-called sanctuary city that arbitrarily decides when it will \ncooperate with the Federal Government and when it will not, and it \nrefused to even honor the Federal Government's request for an \nimmigration detainer.\n  What happened to Kate is tragic, and it is not an isolated incident. \nConsider this letter from Susan Oliver, who lost her husband just last \nyear. Here is what she had to say:\n\n       The man that killed my husband, Deputy Danny Oliver, was \n     deported several times for various felonies. However, due to \n     the lack of coordination between law enforcement agencies, \n     his killer was allowed back into the country. . . .\n       I [am] asking for only one thing. I do not want your \n     sympathy, I want change so others will not have to endure the \n     grief we have in our lives every day.\n\n  The bill which we will consider this afternoon is supported by law \nenforcement organizations such as the National Sheriffs' Association, \nthe Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, and the National \nAssociation of Police Organizations.\n  Here is what the International Union of Police Associations had to \nsay about it:\n\n       The International Union of Police Associations is proud--\n\n  Proud--\n\n     to add our name to the list of supporters of the bill \n     addressing ``Sanctuary Cities'' titled Stop Sanctuary \n     Policies and Protect Americans Act.\n       As it now stands, our officers can be held liable for \n     sharing relevant information and honoring immigration \n     detainers, even when they are from federal immigration \n     officials. This legislation remedies that.\n       Additionally, the bill provides a financial disincentive \n     for cities to become or remain ``sanctuary cities''. . . .\n\n  The organization also noted that this bill would help end the \n``revolving door'' of criminals who ``even though convicted of felony \ncriminal activity and deported, unlawfully return to prey upon our \ncitizens.''\n  The issue before us is not truly about immigration; it is more about \nkeeping our communities safe. Those who defend so-called sanctuary \ncities callously disregard how their extreme policies hurt others. The \nPresident's own DHS Secretary has used terms such as ``not acceptable'' \nand ``counterproductive to public safety'' when referring to sanctuary \ncity policies. Such extreme policies can inflict almost unimaginable \npain on innocent victims and their families.\n  As the father of three daughters, I know--I know--we can do better. I \nam\n\n[[Page S7310]]\n\ncalling on every colleague to put compassion before leftwing ideology \ntoday. This bill would support the deputy sheriff who puts her life on \nthe line every day. This bill would provide hope and justice for \nvictims and their families. So let's vote to support them, not defend \nextreme policies that actually hurt them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/20/senate-section/article/S7310-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 2181, S. 2182, AND S. 2183\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Any one of these States that my friend refers to--any one \nof these communities--has a right at any time to change the law. This \nis not a Federal law they are trying to change; they are trying to \nchange what is taking place in cities throughout the country.\n  So they are States' rights, my Republican colleague's own words. It \ncertainly doesn't belie the actions they have tried to take. The \nRepublican leader tries to make the bill before this body a political \nissue. It is a Donald Trump-bashing-immigrants issue.\n  This bill is opposed by the National Association of Chiefs of Police, \nit is opposed by the National Council of Mayors, and many different \norganizations that believe in States' rights. My friend, the Republican \nleader, would just make things a lot worse, and that is an \nunderstatement.\n  With the provisions in this bill, it is estimated it would take 15 \nnew huge prisons just to handle the people who would be arrested--huge \nprisons, costing billions of dollars. It is not smart police policy. It \nis not smart budget policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/20/senate-section/article/S7310-4", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7310-S7311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE DEBT LIMIT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, over the last 10 months, congressional \nRepublicans have proven they are incapable of governing--at least \ngoverning productively. Instead, Republicans are governing \ndestructively. It is hard to understand or fathom, but this seems to be \nwhat they want: destruction. It is not a word I decided to bring into \nthe conversation today. One Republican Congressman said very recently: \n``We are looking for creative destruction in how the House operates.'' \nThis Republican Congressman said, I repeat, ``We are looking for \ncreative destruction in how the House operates,'' and they are as good \nas their word in the House and sadly also in the Senate.\n  Time and time again, Republican leaders have brought the United \nStates to the brink of unnecessary disaster, and sadly here we are \nagain, facing another manufactured crisis courtesy of Republicans in \nCongress. This time it is a debt limit crisis. On November 3, just 2 \nweeks from today, our great country--the United States of America--will \ndefault on its debt unless Republicans start legislating more \nconstructively to solve the problem. Let's be clear about what the debt \nlimit does and doesn't mean. Adjusting the debt limit--when it is \nabsolutely necessary, and it will be in 2 weeks--is necessary to pay \nthis country's bills that are already due. What we face now with the \ndebt ceiling isn't about a penny of new spending. It is not about a \npenny of new programs or a penny of new taxes. It is not about creating \nnew obligations, only meeting existing ones. The debt limit is about \npaying what we already owe.\n  What are these debts? A large, large, large chunk of these is what we \nowe as a result of an unpaid war, a second unpaid war, and tax breaks \nfor the rich that were unpaid for. Remember, this great theory of \nPresident Bush was that these wars would bring a new democracy to the \nworld. Well, the invasion of Iraq was the worst foreign policy decision \nprobably in the history of the country. Look what it has done, and it \nhas been done at the cost of trillions of dollars of taxpayers' money, \nand that is part of the debt that is due.\n  These tax breaks for the rich. Why did the Bush administration push \nthese tax breaks? Because it would be great for the economy. Well, it \nhas been great for the rich people. They are getting richer, the poorer \nare getting poorer, and the middle class are getting squeezed. All \nthese tax cuts were unpaid for. If we don't act, we allow the United \nStates to default. The day of reckoning will be terrible. We will hurt \nAmerican jobs, families, businesses, and the fallout will be felt \naround the world. If some Republicans in Congress get their way, the \nUnited States will default on this debt. What happens then? The short \nanswer is economic catastrophe.\n  The former Director of the Congressional Budget Office, Douglas \nHoltz-Eakin, described last week what will happen if the United States \ndefaults:\n\n       The first thing you'll see is a market reaction. Then \n     you've got dramatic impacts on consumer confidence, the \n     world's melting down again and they go into an economic fetal \n     position . . . there's just no good news there.\n\n  This wasn't some leftwing blogger; this is a man who did a good job \nrepresenting this country on a bipartisan basis in the Congressional \nBudget Office--by the way, during a Republican administration. He said:\n\n       The first thing you'll see is a market reaction. Then \n     you've got dramatic impacts of consumer confidence, the \n     world's melting down again and they go into an economic fetal \n     position . . . there's just no good news there.\n\n  The Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, a \nreasonable Paul Ryan, said as much last week:\n\n       If the United States missed a bond payment, it would shake \n     the confidence of the world economy. All kinds of credit \n     would dry up: loans for small businesses, mortgages for young \n     families. We could even go into a recession.\n\n  That is what we will face in 2 weeks if Republicans don't get their \nact together, and by all signs, it doesn't appear they are going to. \nAll signs indicate that House and Senate Republicans are still not \nserious about dealing with the debt limit. If they were serious about \npaying our bills and keeping America on sound economic footing, they \nwould not be proposing an absurd idea of having a ``partial default.'' \nYou can't be partially pregnant; you can't have a partial default. \nHouse Republicans have engineered legislation to pick and choose which \ndebts to pay and which to ignore.\n  Listen to this: Their proposed legislation is going to pay foreign \ncreditors first, such as China, but they don't want to meet our \nobligations to veterans, Medicare beneficiaries, and millions of \nmiddle-class Americans. No. They want to start paying down the debt we \nowe to China. Think about that. The truth is this pay-China-first \napproach is just default by another name. This approach would lead a \nmiddle-class family into financial ruin, and just imagine what it would \ndo to world markets. I repeat: There is no such thing as a partial \ndefault. A partial default is a default.\n  We can't allow the Federal Government to be delinquent in paying its \ndebts. We have 2 weeks to get something done, and we can if the \nRepublicans come to their senses. This unnecessary drama over paying \nour bills is already rattling the financial markets. The bond market \nhas already been hurt, and we can see it.\n\n[[Page S7311]]\n\n  I say to my Republican friends, especially the leaders in the House \nof Representatives and the U.S. Senate: Start governing in a way that \nis not an embarrassment to Congress and the American people.\n  Mr. President, please announce what we will be doing here today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/20/senate-section/article/S7311-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 11 \na.m. will be equally divided for debate in the usual form.\n  The assistant Democratic leader.\n\n\n    Refugee Crisis in Greece, Nomination of Gayle Smith, and Ukraine\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I had the privilege of joining Senators \nShaheen, Klobuchar, and Warren during the recess that just concluded to \ntravel to Europe to assess the refugee flow that is spilling into \nGreece and ongoing Russian aggression during our visit to Ukraine.\n  I will start with the visit to one of our most important NATO \nEuropean allies, Greece. Greece is struggling, as we all know, with its \nown economic challenges, but now it is facing an overwhelming flow of \nrefugees across its border.\n  Almost half a million refugees have flown into Greece just this year. \nThe bulk of the refugees come from across the Aegean Sea from Turkey. \nThey are fleeing war and economic instability in the region. Most are \nfrom Syria, but there are many others from Afghanistan, Iraq, and other \ncountries in peril. Many are middle-class families who are simply \nexhausted from years of horrific war in Syria.\n  I met many of them and had a chance to speak to them. Their stories \nare heartbreaking. They are fleeing with their children and whatever \nthey can carry. Their destination is uncertain, but they know they \ncan't stay in the camps or in Syria. They are the victims of smugglers \nand exploitation. Some of these desperate people are charged 1,000 \nEuros just to cross a 2-mile stretch of ocean between Turkey and \nGreece.\n  We were on the island of Lesbos, and those who were able to watch \n``60 Minutes'' this week saw a presentation of what is happening on \nthat small island of about 80,000 people where more than 400,000 \nrefugees have come through in the last several weeks. Many of these \nrefugees are unaccompanied children.\n  At one of the camps, I met a young man who said he was 17--probably \n15--who had come across that stretch of water with his 8-year-old \nsister. Think for a moment what that family must have gone through in \ndeciding that it was safer for this 15-year-old to take his 8-year-old \nsister and try to find their way to a safe place in Europe rather than \nstay in war-torn Syria. That is the reality of many of these refugees \nand the plight that they face.\n  On this island of Lesbos, 2,000 refugees are arriving every single \nday. The Greek Coast Guard showed us stacks of discarded rubber rafts. \nThese rubber rafts are made to hold about 20 people as they cross this \n3-mile stretch of ocean. They packed them with over 50 people. They \ncharge 1,000 Euros for each adult and 500 Euros for each child.\n  We saw these rafts stacked up and piles of life preservers. Some of \nthem are the types of life preservers and jackets that you might \nexpect, but others are ridiculous. Some of them are literally pool \ntoys, and they say so. They have written right on them that they are \nnot to be used as life preservers. These pool toys are strapped to \nthose little kids who are put in these rafts that come across that \nstretch of ocean. There were rows upon rows of cheap outboard motors \nthat were used to propel these rafts across the straits.\n  Incidentally, the smugglers picked someone in the raft and told them \nthat they were in charge. They would ask if they knew how to operate \nthe motor. If they didn't know how to operate it, they would show them \nhow to use it and point them in the right direction. The refugees would \nthen head out in the hope that they would make it across safely, and \nmany times they didn't.\n  Despite Greece's economic hardship, I was impressed with how the \nGreek people were handling this refugee crisis. Processing registration \ncenters had been established, and many refugees were quickly on their \nway to resettlement in Europe.\n  I mentioned the 15-year-old with his 8-year-old sister. I ran into \nfour others who spoke English, and all of them were college graduates \nin their 20s. One of them was a premed student who said: We just \ncouldn't live any longer with war in Syria. We were ready to risk our \nlives to find a safer place.\n  The mayor of Lesbos has been generous and thoughtful in addressing \nthe suffering. He told me he often thought he was handling a ticking \ntime bomb with this refugee crisis. Instead, this island has become an \nexample of what the rest of the world can do.\n  In Athens, we visited with an impressive NGO known as Praksis that is \ngiving unaccompanied minors a safe, nurturing place to stay while they \nattempt to place them with families.\n  The United States leads the world in financial assistance for this \nSyrian refugee effort, but we have a moral obligation to do that and \nmore. I have called on the administration to accept 100,000 Syrian \nrefugees. I am a cosponsor of the emergency supplemental bill \naddressing refugee assistance, recently introduced by Senators Graham \nand Leahy.\n  Allow me to put the 100,000 number in perspective. Germany has agreed \nto accept 800,000 of these Syrian refugees. It is estimated that there \nare 4 million total. The United States accepted 750,000 Vietnamese \nrefugees and over 500,000 Cuban refugees after the Castro regime took \nover. Those Cuban refugees included the fathers of two sitting U.S. \nSenators, one of whom is running for President of the United States. We \naccepted over 200,000 Soviet Jews who were being persecuted in that \ncountry. We have accepted refugees from Somalia and from different \nplaces around the world, such as Bosnia. We have assimilated them into \nAmerica, and we can do it again.\n  When we go through this process of accepting refugees, we carefully \ncheck their backgrounds to make sure that they are not a threat to the \nUnited States or anybody who lives here. I think we should continue to \ndo that, but the fact that only 1,700 have made it to our Nation in the \nlast 4 years tells us that we need to do more.\n  I will continue to be a strong advocate for humanitarian safe zones \nin Syria so the people there can have a safe place to be treated for \ntheir illnesses and to at least live until this war comes to an end.\n  Let me say something else. It is embarrassing for me to stand before \nthe Senate and note that on our Executive Calendar, which is on the \ndesks of Senators, there includes one nominee, Gayle Smith, who has \nbeen nominated to be administrator of the United States Agency for \nInternational Development. She has been sitting on this calendar since \nJuly 29 of this year.\n  The USAID, which she seeks to head, is the premier frontline agency \nfor helping refugees. Yet this good woman with a lifetime of experience \nis being held up in the Senate for entirely political reasons. There \nare no objections to her personally, and there are no objections to her \nbackground.\n  One Senator is holding up her nomination because the Senator stated \npublicly that he objects to the President's Iran nuclear agreement. \nGayle Smith had nothing to do with that. The USAID had nothing to do \nwith that. Shouldn't we appoint this good person to manage this agency \nto deal with this international refugee crisis?\n  While we are at it, they are asking that Thomas Melia of Maryland be \nthe assistant administrator. Wouldn't we want competent management when \nwe are talking about billions of American\n\n[[Page S7312]]\n\ntax dollars being spent wisely in this humanitarian effort? Yet they \nlanguish on this calendar.\n  If there are objections to these nominees, state them. If not, \napprove them.\n  After Greece, we had a visit to Ukraine. I believe what is happening \nthere is deeply important to us in the United States, and I am \ncommitted to seeing that Ukraine succeed as a Democratic sovereign \nnation. It is hard to describe what has happened there in a year and a \nhalf. A shamefully corrupt regime which is deeply influenced by Russia \nwas rejected by the Ukrainian people. As the country tried to get back \non its feet and build a more transparent and Democratic future, Russia \nand Vladimir Putin staged an invasion first by taking over Crimea and \nthen by invading eastern Ukraine.\n  The Russians have turned eastern Ukraine into a dysfunctional, grim, \nand abandoned wasteland, somehow under the illusion that it would be \nthe new Russia. More than a million people have been displaced in \neastern Ukraine and thousands have been killed. The captured land was \neven used as a base to shoot down a civilian airliner, killing \nhundreds. A recent Dutch investigation showed that this was done with \nRussian weaponry. If only President Putin would try to help with the \ninvestigation of the Malaysian plane that was shot down instead of \nnakedly blocking the effort of the U.N. Security Council, we would have \neven more information about this horrible tragedy.\n  Despite agreeing in Minsk to a pullback of heavy weapons, exchange of \nprisoners, and return of border control in the east, Russia has dragged \nits feet on every term of the agreement, incorrectly hoping that the \nworld will not notice. We notice.\n  Yet amid all this transparent and barbaric effort to undermine \nUkraine, the country has found a new unity and determination. It has \ntaken on significant reforms. During my visit with my fellow Senators, \nI was struck by how many dedicated Ukrainians are working for a better \nfuture. They are now members of Parliament and local officials coming \nright out of the Maidan demonstration. They are giving everything they \ncan for the future of their country.\n  I have been a strong supporter of President Obama's efforts to \nsupport Ukraine to train and equip its military and provide significant \nassistance for their courageous effort. As the world's attention is \ndistracted to many other challenges, let's not lose sight of the \nongoing struggle in Ukraine. The United States and Europe must remain \nunited on sanctions against Russia as long as it continues to invade \nand occupy a sovereign nation like Ukraine.\n  I will conclude by recognizing the many dedicated Foreign Service \nofficers working in our embassies that we meet with on our trips. They \nare on the frontlines of American leadership and generosity. Ambassador \nGeoffrey Pyatt in Ukraine and Ambassador David Pearce in Greece are two \nwe worked with during our recent visit.\n  As the Republicans threaten government shutdown after government \nshutdown, let us not forget that these men and women and many like them \nliterally risk their lives every single day standing up and \nrepresenting the United States around the world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n           Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Bill\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise again in strong support of the Stop \nSanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Act, which we will be voting \non later today. I was here on the floor yesterday laying out the strong \ncase in support of that, talking to many colleagues before this vote \ntoday, as I have been for the past several days.\n  Today I rise to focus on some arguments from the other side that are \nerroneous and misleading, quite frankly, and to debunk those arguments \nso everyone has the full, true, and clear picture of why this \nlegislation is so needed.\n  First, I have heard a few of my colleagues talk about the need for \nFederal and local authorities to do a better job of working together. \nFor instance, Senator Durbin, who just left the floor, said: ``Federal \nand local authorities must do a better job of communicating and \ncoordinating so that undocumented immigrants with serious criminal \nrecords are detained and deported, period.''\n  Similarly, Senator Feinstein said: ``It is very clear to me that we \nhave to improve cooperation between local, State, and Federal law \nenforcement.''\n  Let me say that I completely agree with them, and they are laying out \na strong case for this legislation, not against it, because we need to \ndo something about the cause of the noncooperation, the obstacle \nbetween that full cooperation, which absolutely needs to happen every \nday. Simply wishing for a better outcome isn't going to make it happen.\n  The fact is, there are dozens of sanctuary cities--jurisdictions that \nhave those policies--that were cooperating in the past and that want to \ncooperate, but they have been faced with lawsuits from the ACLU and \nothers and court decisions wherein local law enforcement officials \ncould be held liable for violating an individual's constitutional \nrights simply for honoring a detainer request from ICE. That is \nridiculous. That is an abusive threat. Our legislation on the floor \ntoday is going to remove that threat.\n  The Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Act allows for that \ncooperation between local and Federal authorities to resume again \nbecause section 4 of the bill will facilitate State and local \ncompliance with the ICE detainer and remove that onerous and \nunreasonable threat. Cooperation has been stifled by lawsuits aimed at \nbullying local law enforcement, and this bill will grant local law \nenforcement the authority to clearly comply with ICE detainers without \nthreat of liability. It will protect them from that liability for \nsimply complying with ICE detainers.\n  I will remind my colleagues that it will do nothing to infringe on an \nindividual's civil or constitutional rights. They still have the same \nability to pursue those against ICE or anyone else they choose.\n  That is why this legislation is supported by people who know \nsomething about what needs to happen for local and Federal authorities \nto cooperate. Who am I talking about? The Federal Law Enforcement \nOfficers Association--they know what they are talking about. The \nInternational Union of Police Associations--they live it every day. The \nNational Association of Police Organizations and the National Sheriffs' \nAssociation--don't my colleagues think they know what is needed on the \nground? They do. And because they do, they strongly support this \nlegislation.\n  Second, some colleagues on the other side argue that this bill won't \ndo anything; instead, we need so-called comprehensive immigration \nreform such as the Gang of 8 bill. But the Gang of 8 bill that my \ncolleagues are pushing--1,200 pages long when it passed the Senate--\ndidn't do anything to resolve this issue of sanctuary cities. It didn't \ndo anything to change the abusive lawsuits I am speaking about. It \ndidn't do anything to encourage Federal and local authorities to \ncooperate in real time--absolutely nothing. That is just the fact, once \nwe read the 1,200 pages. All the Gang of 8 bill does is lead with a big \namnesty--an amnesty overnight--for about 11 million illegal immigrants \nin our country today. So that comprehensive immigration reform bill--\nthe Gang of 8 bill or whatever we want to call it--does nothing in this \narea that is so crucial to fix, does nothing about sanctuary cities, \ndoes nothing to remove these abusive lawsuits as obstacles to the clear \nand full cooperation between Federal, State, and local authorities, \nwhich even folks on the other side of the bill admit needs to happen \nand is a problem right now.\n  There are lots of myths about our bill versus the facts.\n  With that in mind, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a myth v. fact sheet that lays out clearly the myths, the \narguments made against this legislation, and the real facts of the Stop \nSanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Act, S. 2146.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Myth v. Fact--Stop Sanctuary Policies Act (S.2146)\n\n       1. S.2146 does not punish illegal immigrants who come \n     forward to report crimes.\n       Myth: Under S.2146, ``reporting crimes or otherwise \n     interacting with law enforcement could lead to immigration \n     detention and deportation.'' \\1\\\n\n[[Page S7313]]\n\n       Fact: S.2146 provides that if a jurisdiction has a policy \n     that local law enforcement will not inquire about the \n     immigration status of crime victims or witnesses, such \n     jurisdiction will not be deemed a sanctuary jurisdiction and \n     will not lose any federal funds. See section 3(e).\n       2. S.2146 does not require local law enforcement to carry \n     out federal immigration responsibilities.\n       Myth: S.2146 would ``require[e] state and local law \n     enforcement to carry out the federal government's immigration \n     enforcement responsibilities,'' and thus ``the federal \n     government would be substituting its judgment for the \n     judgment of state and local law enforcement agencies.'' \\2\\\n       Fact: The bill does not require local law enforcement ``to \n     carry out federal immigration responsibilities.'' Removing \n     illegal immigrants remains the exclusive province of the \n     federal government. The bill simply withholds certain federal \n     funds from jurisdictions that prohibit their local law \n     enforcement officers from cooperating with federal officials \n     in the limited circumstance of honoring an immigration \n     detainer.\n       It is politicians in sanctuary jurisdictions who, by tying \n     the hands of local law enforcement, are ``substituting \n     [their] judgment for the judgment of state and local law \n     enforcement.''\n       3. S.2146 is necessary to keep dangerous criminals off of \n     the streets.\n       Myth: ``Congress should focus on overdue reforms of the \n     broken immigration system to allow state and local law \n     enforcement to focus their resources on true threats--\n     dangerous criminals and criminal organizations.'' \\3\\\n       Fact: Sanctuary cities are the ones preventing local law \n     enforcement from focusing on dangerous criminals and criminal \n     organizations--by forbidding local law enforcement officers \n     from holding such criminals.\n       The illegal immigrant who killed Kate Steinle explained \n     that he chose to live in San Francisco because it was a \n     sanctuary city, and he knew San Francisco would not take \n     action against him He was right. Three months before Kate's \n     death, the federal government asked San Francisco officials \n     to hold him, but San Francisco refused.\n       4. S.2146 does not force the U.S. to bear liability for \n     unconstitutional actions by local law enforcement.\n       Myth: S.2146 includes ``provisions requiring DHS to absorb \n     all liability in lawsuits brought by individuals unlawfully \n     detained in violation of the Fourth Amendment.'' \\4\\\n       Fact: If a lawsuit alleges that a local officer knowingly \n     violated Fourth Amendment or other constitutional rights, \n     under S.2146, the individual officer, not the federal \n     government, will bear all liability. See section 4(c).\n       For some lawsuits, the U.S. will be substituted as \n     defendant--specifically, suits alleging that that the \n     immigration detainer should not have been issued. But such a \n     claim could already be brought against the U.S. under \n     existing law; thus, S.2146 does not create a new source of \n     liability for the federal government. S.2146 simply provides \n     that if the federal government made the error, the federal \n     government should be the defendant.\n       5. S.2146 is fully consistent with the Fourth Amendment and \n     preserves individuals' rights to sue for constitutional \n     violations.\n       Myth: ``The Fourth Amendment provides that the government \n     cannot hold anyone in jail without getting a warrant or the \n     approval of a judge.'' \\5\\\n       Fact: The Constitution requires probable cause to detain an \n     individual, which can be established by a judicial a warrant \n     issued before the arrest or by a demonstration of probable \n     cause after the arrest. Otherwise police could never arrest \n     someone whom they see committing a crime.\n       S.2146 does not alter the requirement for probable cause. \n     In fact, S.2146 explicitly preserves an individual's ability \n     to sue if he or she is held without probable cause or has \n     suffered any other violation of a constitutional right.\n\n                                Endnotes\n\n       1. Email from Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service \n     (Oct. 19, 2015).\n       2. Letter from Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force (Oct. \n     15, 2015).\n       3. Letter from Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force (Oct. \n     15, 2015).\n       4. Letter from ACLU (Oct. 19, 2015).\n       5. Letter from ACLU (Oct. 19, 2015).\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, let me highlight the two biggest ones. The \nfirst one is that our legislation would somehow punish and make it more \ndifficult for illegal persons to report crimes and cooperate with local \nlaw enforcement. That is a pure myth. What is the fact? Well, read the \nbill, as the American people suggest. Read the bill. Our bill, S. 2146, \nspecifically provides that if a jurisdiction has a policy that local \nlaw enforcement will not inquire about the immigration status of crime \nvictims or witnesses, such jurisdiction will not be deemed a sanctuary \njurisdiction and it will not lose Federal funds over that. So that \nargument is simply a myth.\n  The second argument often made is that somehow this legislation is \nrequiring local law enforcement to carry out Federal immigration \nresponsibilities. Again, that is a pure myth, a purely erroneous \nargument, and if we read the bill, S. 2146, we will see it is simply \nnot true. The bill does not require local law enforcement ``to carry \nout Federal immigration responsibilities'' in any way, shape, or form. \nRemoving illegal immigrants remains the exclusive province of the \nFederal Government. The bill simply withholds certain Federal funds \nfrom jurisdictions that prohibit exactly the cooperation that our \nopponents on the other side say is so necessary and correctly say is so \nnecessary. So that, again, is the fact versus the myth that is being \npropagated.\n  Again, we have several myths versus facts as part of the record, and \nI urge everyone, starting with our colleagues, Democrats and \nRepublicans, to study it carefully.\n  This is an important issue. Sanctuary cities are a real problem, and \nwe need to fix that problem to move forward. So I urge my colleagues to \nlook carefully at this issue of what is driving these sanctuary cities \npolicies. Our legislation will take up those drivers, those obstacles, \nwill solve those problems, and will result in the cooperation at all \nlevels of law enforcement that we desperately need.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes later today so we can push forward \nwith this important and critical legislation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, we will finally vote on the \nnomination of Judge Ann Donnelly to be a Federal district judge in the \nEastern District of New York. She was first nominated for this judicial \nemergency vacancy nearly a year ago, back in November 2014. She was \nvoted out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote over 4 \nmonths ago on June 4, but since then she has been blocked from \nreceiving a vote on the Senate floor. Senator Schumer has twice sought \nto secure a vote for Judge Donnelly through unanimous consent requests \nin July and September, but was blocked by Republicans both times. No \nsubstantive reason was given for this obstruction, which is hurting \nboth our justice system and the people who seek justice in those \ncourts.\n  Judge Donnelly is not the only New York nominee ready for a vote \ntoday on the Executive Calendar. LaShann Hall, a partner at a prominent \nnational law firm, was nominated to the other judicial emergency \nvacancy in the Eastern District of New York last November as well. She \nwas voted out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote at the \nsame time as Judge Donnelly, and she is still awaiting a vote.\n  Also waiting for a vote is Lawrence Vilardo, who has been nominated \nto the vacancy in the Western District of New York in Buffalo. The \nWestern District of New York has one of the busiest caseloads in the \ncountry and handles more criminal cases than Washington, DC, Boston, or \nCleveland; yet there is not a single active Federal judge in that \ndistrict, and the court is staying afloat only through the voluntary \nefforts of two judges on senior status who are hearing cases in their \nretirement. Despite these circumstances, Republicans continue to hold \nMr. Vilardo's nomination up as well. There is no good reason why these \ntwo other noncontroversial New York nominees could not be confirmed \ntoday. The same goes for the rest of the noncontroversial judicial \nnominees on the Executive Calendar.\n  In the Judiciary Committee, I have continued to work with Chairman \nGrassley to hold hearings on judicial nominees. We will hold a hearing \ntomorrow for four more judicial nominees. But the pattern we have seen \nover the last 9 months is that, once nominees are voted out of \ncommittee and awaiting confirmation on the floor, the Republican \nleadership refuses to schedule votes. So far this year, we have only \nconfirmed seven judges. That is not even one judge per month. Some \nRepublicans claim that this is reasonable, but by any measure, it is \nnot. By this same point in 2007, when I was chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee and we had a Republican President, the Senate had already \nconfirmed 33 judges. At this current rate, by the end of the year, the \nSenate will have confirmed the fewest number of judges in more than a \nhalf century.\n  This pattern is especially egregious in light of the rising number of \njudicial vacancies. In fact, as a direct result of Republican \nobstruction, vacancies have\n\n[[Page S7314]]\n\nincreased by more than 50 percent, from 43 to 67. That means there are \nnot enough judges to handle the overwhelming number of cases in many of \nour Federal courtrooms. Additionally, the number of Federal court \nvacancies deemed to be ``judicial emergencies'' by the nonpartisan \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts has increased by 158 percent \nsince the beginning of the year. There are now 30 judicial emergency \nvacancies that are affecting communities across the country.\n  The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights recently issued a \nmemorandum documenting the real life impact of the Senate Republicans' \nobstruction on the judicial confirmation process. Three States where \ncommunities are most hurt are Texas, Alabama, and Florida. Texas, for \nexample, has nine judicial vacancies--with seven of them deemed to be \njudicial emergencies. Incredibly, one of the district court positions \nhas been vacant for over 4 years, and a fifth circuit position in Texas \nhas been vacant for more than 3 years. The memorandum reports that, in \nthe Eastern District of Texas, the delays caused by the vacancy in that \ncourt has placed greater pressure on criminal defendants to forego \ntrials and simply plead guilty to avoid uncertain and lengthy pretrial \ndetentions. That is not justice.\n  Similarly, Alabama has five current vacancies that remain unfilled, \nand Florida has three. These rising vacancies are leading to an \nunsustainable situation in too many states. As Chief Judge Federico \nMoreno of the Southern District of Florida noted, ``It's like an \nemergency room in a hospital. The judges are used to it and people come \nin and out and get good treatment. But the question is, can you sustain \nit? Eventually you burn out.''\n  I urge the majority leader to schedule votes for the 14 other \nconsensus judicial nominees on the Executive Calendar without further \ndelay. If the Republican obstruction continues and if home State \nSenators cannot persuade the majority leader to schedule a vote for \ntheir nominees soon, then it is unlikely that even highly qualified \nnominees with Republican support will be confirmed by the end of the \nyear. These are nominees that members of the leader's own party want \nconfirmed. Let us work together to confirm nominees and help restore \nour third branch to full strength.\n  Shortly we will begin voting on Judge Ann Donnelly to fill a judicial \nemergency vacancy in the Federal District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of New York. Since September 2014, she has served as a judge \non the New York County Supreme Court. Judge Donnelly previously \npresided on the Kings County Supreme Court from 2013 to 2014 and in the \nBronx County Supreme Court from 2009 to 2013. Prior to becoming a \njudge, she worked at the New York County District Attorney's Office for \n25 years as an assistant district attorney, senior trial counsel, and \nas chief of the Family Violence Child Abuse Bureau. She has the support \nof her two home State Senators, Senator Schumer and Senator Gillibrand. \nShe was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote on \nJune 4, 2015. I will vote to support her nomination.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is, \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Ann Donnelly, \nof New York, to be United States District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of New York?\n  Mr. FRANKEN.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 2146, which the \nclerk shall now report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 252, S. 2146, a bill to \n     hold sanctuary jurisdictions accountable for defying Federal \n     law, to increase penalties for individuals who illegally \n     reenter the United States after being removed, and to provide \n     liability protection for State and local law enforcement who \n     cooperate with Federal law enforcement and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, the American people have demanded for years \nthat the Federal Government faithfully enforce our Nation's immigration \nlaws. Americans are tired of seeing their laws flouted and their \ncommunities plagued by the horrible crimes that typically accompany \nillegal immigration. But for too long, the pleas of the American people \non this issue have gone unheeded here in Washington.\n  See, when it comes to the problem of illegal immigration, the \npolitical class and the business class--our Nation's elites--are of one \nmind. They promise robust enforcement at some point in the future but \nonly on the condition that the American people accept a pathway to \ncitizenship now for the millions of illegal immigrants who are already \nin this country.\n  Not wanting to be swindled, the American people wisely rejected this \ndeal, which the Washington class calls ``comprehensive immigration \nreform.'' Of course, the elites don't like this one bit. So instead, \nthey have taken matters into their own hands. They bend or ignore the \nlaw to make it more difficult for immigration enforcement officers to \ndo their job.\n  We have seen this repeatedly with the Obama administration. President \nObama has illegally granted amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants \nwith no statutory authorization whatsoever, even though, before his \nreelection, the President assured the American people he couldn't do so \nwithout an act of Congress. As President Obama said, when asked whether \nhe could grant amnesty, ``I am not an emperor.''\n\n[[Page S7315]]\n\n  Well, I agree with President Obama. But yet, just a few months after \nsaying he couldn't do this because he was not an emperor, apparently he \ndiscovered he was an emperor, because he did precisely what he \nacknowledged he lacked the constitutional authority to do.\n  Although the administration today claims to be focusing its resources \non deporting illegal immigrants with criminal records, it has adopted a \npolicy where many illegal immigrants that the administration deems to \nbe low-priority criminals will not be detained and deported but will be \nreleased back into our communities.\n  Remarkably, in the year 2013 the Obama administration released from \ndetention roughly 36,000 convicted criminal aliens who were actually \nawaiting the outcome of deportation proceedings. These criminal aliens \nwere responsible for 193 homicide convictions. They were responsible \nfor 426 sexual assault convictions, 303 kidnapping convictions, 1,075 \naggravated assault convictions, and 16,070 drunk driving convictions. \nAll of this was on top of the additional 68,000 illegal immigrants with \ncriminal convictions that the Federal Government encountered in 2013 \nbut never took into custody for deportation. Dwell on those numbers for \na moment.\n  In 1 year, the Obama administration releases over 104,000 criminal \nillegal aliens, people who have come into this country illegally who \nhave additional criminal convictions--murderers, rapists, thieves, \ndrunk drivers.\n  One wonders what the administration says to the mother of a child \nlost to a murderer released by the Obama administration because they \nwill not enforce the laws. One wonders what the Obama administration \nsays to the child of a man killed by a drunk driver released by the \nObama administration because they will not enforce our immigration \nlaws.\n  While this administration's refusal to enforce the laws is bad \nenough, the scandalously poor enforcement of our immigration laws is \nmade much, much worse by the lawless actions of the roughly 340 so-\ncalled sanctuary jurisdictions across the country. Although these \njurisdictions are more than happy--eager, even--to take Federal \ntaxpayer dollars, they go out of their way to obstruct and impede \nFederal immigration enforcement by adopting policies that prohibit \ntheir law enforcement officers from cooperating with Federal officers. \nSome of the jurisdictions even refuse to honor requests from the \nFederal Government to temporarily hold a criminal alien until Federal \nofficers can take custody of the individual. Not only are these \nsanctuary policies an affront to the rule of law, but they are \nextremely dangerous.\n  According to a recent study by the Center for Immigration Studies, \nbetween January 1 and September 30, 2014--just a 9-month period--\nsanctuary jurisdictions released 9,295 alien offenders who the Federal \nGovernment was seeking to deport. That is roughly 1,000 offenders a \nmonth that sanctuary jurisdictions released to the people. Now, of \nthose 9,295, 62 percent had prior criminal histories or other public \nsafety issues. Amazingly, to underscore just how dangerous this is to \nthe citizenry, 2,320 of those criminal offenders were rearrested within \nthe 9-month period for committing new crimes after they had already \nbeen released by the sanctuary jurisdiction. If that doesn't embody \nlawlessness, it is difficult to imagine what does--jurisdictions that \nare releasing over and over criminal illegal aliens, many of them \nviolent criminal illegal aliens, and exposing the citizens who live at \nhome to additional public safety risk, to additional terrorist risk.\n  This same study found that the Federal Government was unable to \nreapprehend the vast majority of the alien offenders released by the \nsanctuary jurisdictions--69 percent as of last year. Even Homeland \nSecurity Secretary Jeh Johnson has admitted that these sanctuary \npolicies are ``unacceptable.'' ``It is counterproductive to public \nsafety,'' he said, ``to have this level of resistance to working with \nour immigration enforcement personnel.''\n  I am thrilled to hear the Secretary of Homeland Security say so out \nloud. I assume that means that the Obama administration will be \nsupporting the legislation before this body. After all, the Secretary \nof Homeland Security says it is ``unacceptable,'' and that ``it is \ncounterproductive to public safety.'' Yet, sadly, the Obama \nadministration is not supporting the legislation before this body.\n  Indeed, it has taken the tragic and terrible death of Kate Steinle to \ngalvanize action here in Washington. Kate died in the arms of her \nfather on a San Francisco pier after being fatally shot by an illegal \nalien who had several felony convictions and had been deported from the \nUnited States multiple times. Her death is heartbreaking.\n  In the Senate Judiciary Committee we had the opportunity to hear from \nKate Steinle's family. The heartbreak is even more appalling because \nKate's killer had been released from custody and not turned over to the \nFederal Government to be deported because of San Francisco's sanctuary \npolicy.\n  The city of San Francisco is proudly a sanctuary city. They say to \nillegal immigrants across the country and across the world: Come to San \nFrancisco. We will protect you from Federal immigration laws. We, the \nelected democratic leaders of this city, welcome illegal immigrants, \nincluding violent criminal illegal immigrants such as the murderer who \ntook Kate Steinle's life.\n  These policies are inexcusable. They are a threat to the public \nsafety of the American people, and they need to end. That is why I am \nproud to be one of the original cosponsors of the Stop Sanctuary \nPolicies and Protect Americans Act, which strips certain Federal funds, \nespecially community development block grants, from jurisdictions that \nmaintain these lawless policies. If these jurisdictions insist on \nmaking it more difficult to remove criminal aliens from our \ncommunities, then these Federal dollars should go instead to \njurisdictions that will actually cooperate with the Federal Government, \nthat are willing to enforce the law rather than aid and abet the \ncriminals. It makes no sense to continue sending Federal money to local \ngovernments that intentionally make it more difficult and costly for \nthe Federal Government to do its job.\n  But this bill doesn't just address sanctuary jurisdictions. It also \naddresses the problem of illegal immigrants who, like Kate Steinle's \nkiller, are deported but illegally reenter the country, which is a \nfelony. This class of illegal aliens has a special disregard and \ndisdain for our Nation's laws, and too often these offenders also have \nserious rap sheets.\n\n  In 2012, just over a quarter of the illegal aliens apprehended by \nBorder Patrol had prior deportation orders. That is an astounding \n99,420 illegal aliens. Of the illegal reentry offenders who were \nactually prosecuted in fiscal year 2014--that is just 16,556 \noffenders--a fraction of those committed a felony. The majority of \nthose who were prosecuted had extensive or recent criminal histories, \nand many were dangerous criminals. Even though the majority of \noffenders had serious criminal records, the average prison sentence was \njust 17 months, down from an average of 22 months in 2008.\n  In fact, more than a quarter of illegal reentry offenders received a \nsentence below the guidelines range because the government sponsored \nthe low sentence. Because we are failing to adequately deter illegal \naliens who have already been deported from illegally reentering the \ncountry, I introduced Kate's Law in the Senate.\n  I wish to thank Senators Vitter and Grassley for working with me to \nincorporate elements of Kate's Law into this bill. I also wish to \nrecognize and thank all of the original cosponsors who joined me in \nthis bill--Senators Barrasso, Cornyn, Isakson, Johnson, Perdue, Rubio, \nSullivan, and Toomey.\n  Because of this bill, any illegal alien who illegally reenters the \nUnited States and has a prior aggravated felony conviction or two prior \nillegal reentry convictions will face a mandatory sentence of 5 years \nin prison. We must send the message that defiance of our laws will no \nlonger be tolerated, whether it is by the sanctuary cities themselves \nor by the illegal reentry offenders who they harbor.\n  The problem of illegal immigration in this country will never be \nsolved until we demonstrate to the American people that we are serious \nabout securing the border and enforcing our immigration laws and until \nwe have a President who is willing to and, in fact, committed to \nactually enforcing the laws and securing the borders.\n\n[[Page S7316]]\n\n  This bill is just a small step, but at least it is a step in the \nright direction. Yet there will be two consequences from the vote this \nafternoon. First, it will be an opportunity for our friends on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle to declare to the country on whose side \nthey stand.\n  When they are campaigning for reelection, more than a few Democratic \nSenators tell the voters they support securing the borders. More than a \nfew Democratic Senators tell the voters: Of course we shouldn't be \nreleasing criminal illegal aliens. More than a few Democratic Senators \nclaim to have no responsibility for the 104,000 criminal illegal aliens \nreleased by the Obama administration in the year 2013.\n  These Senators claim to have no responsibility for the murder of Kate \nSteinle, invited to San Francisco by that city's sanctuary city policy. \nThis vote today will be a moment of clarity. No Democratic Senator will \nbe able to go and tell his or her constituents: I oppose sanctuary \ncities. I support securing the border if they vote today in favor of \nsending Federal taxpayer funds to subsidize the lawlessness of \nsanctuary cities.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony from families who had \nlost loved ones to violent criminal illegal aliens--one after the other \nafter the other. We heard about children who were sexually abused and \nmurdered by violent illegal aliens. We heard from family members who \nhave lost loved ones to drunk drivers illegally in this country.\n  During the hearing, I asked the senior Obama administration official \nfor immigration enforcement how she could look into the eyes of those \nfamily members and justify releasing murderers, rapists, and drunk \ndrivers over and over and over again.\n  Indeed, at that hearing I asked the head of immigration enforcement \nfor the Obama administration: How many murderers did the Obama \nadministration release this week? Her answer: I don't know. I asked \nher: How many rapists did the Obama administration release this week? \nHer answer: I don't know. How many drunk drivers? I don't know.\n  None of us should be satisfied with that answer or with a President \nand administration that refuse to enforce the laws and are willfully \nand repeatedly releasing violent criminal illegal aliens into our \ncommunities and endangering the lives of our families and children.\n  This vote today is a simple decision for every Democratic Senator: \nWith whom do you stand? Do you stand with the violent criminal illegal \naliens who are being released over and over again? Because mind you, a \nvote no is to say the next time the next murderer--like Kate Steinle's \nmurderer--comes in, we should not enforce the laws, and we shouldn't \nhave a mandatory 5-year prison sentence. Instead, we should continue \nsanctuary cities that welcome and embrace him until perhaps it is our \nfamily members who lose their lives.\n  It is my hope that in this moment of clarity the Democratic members \nof this body will decide they stand with the American people and not \nwith the violent criminal illegal aliens.\n\n  It is worth noting, by the way, the standard rhetorical device that \nso many Democratic Senators use is to say: Well, not all immigrants are \ncriminals. Well, of course they are not. I am the son of an immigrant \nwho came legally to this country 58 years ago. We are a nation of \nimmigrants, of men and women fleeing oppression and seeking freedom, \nbut this bill doesn't deal with all immigrants. It deals with one \nspecific subset of immigrants: criminal illegal aliens. It deals with \nthose who come to this country illegally and also have additional \ncriminal convictions, whether it is homicide, sexual assault, \nkidnapping, battery, or drunk driving. If it is the Democrats' position \nfor partisan reasons that they would rather stand with violent criminal \nillegal aliens, that is a sad testament on where one of the two major \npolitical parties in this country stands today. I suspect the voters \nwho elect them would be more than a little surprised at how that jibes \nwith the rhetoric they use on the campaign trail.\n  If, as many observers predict, Democratic Senators choose to value \npartisan loyalty to the Obama White House over protecting the lives of \nthe children who will be murdered by violent criminal illegal aliens in \nsanctuary cities if this body does not act, and if they vote on a \nparty-line vote, as many observers have predicted, that will provide a \nmoment of clarity. I will also suggest that it underscores the need for \nRepublican leadership to bring this issue up again--and not in the \ncontext where Democrats can blithely block it and obstruct any \nmeaningful reforms to protect our safety, secure the border, enforce \nthe law, and stop violent illegal criminal aliens from threatening our \nsafety--in the context of a must-pass bill and attach it to legislation \nthat will actually pass in law.\n  I am very glad we are voting on this bill this week. That is a good \nand positive step. It is one of the few things in the last 10 months we \nhave voted on that actually responds to the concerns of the men and \nwomen who elected us.\n  I salute leadership for bringing up this vote, but if a party-line \nvote blocks it, then the next step is not simply to have a vote. The \nnext step is to attach this legislation to must-pass legislation and to \nactually fix the problem. Leadership loves to speak of what they call \ngoverning, and in Washington governing is always set at least an octave \nlower. Well, when it comes to stopping sanctuary cities and protecting \nour safety, we need some governing. We need to actually fix the problem \nrather than have a show vote.\n  My first entreaty is to my Democratic friends across the aisle. \nRegardless of areas where we differ on partisan politics, this should \nbe an easy vote. Do you stand with the men and women of your State or \ndo you stand with violent criminal illegal aliens? We will find out in \njust a couple of hours.\n  My second entreaty is to Republican leadership. If Democrats are \npartisans first rather than protecting the men and women they \nrepresent, then it is up to Republican leadership to attach this to a \nmust-pass bill and actually pass it into law and solve the problem--not \nto talk about it, but to do it. It is my hope that is what all of us do \ntogether.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to speak out against a bill \nthat is misguided, stands against everything that America represents, \nand suggests that it will protect Americans when, in fact, it will \nprotect Americans less.\n  From our founding, our principles have been guided by core values of \nequality, fairness, freedom, and tolerance, and in turn, we have \nhonored the many ways that immigrants have contributed to this country \nsince its inception. Yet the other side of the aisle is once again \nengaged in a stubborn, relentless, and shameful assault against \nimmigrants.\n  As the son of immigrants myself, I find it hard not to take offense \nat the anti-immigrant rhetoric we are hearing from their Presidential \ncandidates. It is unacceptable, deplorable, and should be renounced by \nevery American. We are witnessing the most overtly nativist, xenophobic \ncampaign in modern U.S. history. We have hit a new low with the \nextraordinarily hateful rhetoric that diminishes immigrants' \ncontributions to American history and particularly demonizes the Latino \ncommunity by labeling Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals.\n  The Republican leading in the polls actually launched his \nPresidential candidacy by attacking immigrants, saying:\n\n       They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're \n     rapists.\n\n  Please spare me. It is senseless and false. Yet some of my Senate \ncolleagues have decided to jump on the GOP's fearmongering bandwagon, \nseeking to blindly stamp millions of hard-working, law-abiding \nimmigrant families as criminals and rapists, and that is why we are \nhere today. That anti-immigrant rhetoric has made its way to the Senate \nfloor courtesy of Donald Trump and some Republicans eager to capitalize \non this rhetoric for their own political gain.\n  This is nothing more than another offensive anti-immigrant bill, \nanother effort to demonize those who risk everything for a better life \nfor themselves and their children, those who were left with no choice \nbut to flee persecution and violence or else face a certain death. That \nis what we are debating here today. Those are the individuals this \nlegislation seeks to brand as criminals.\n\n[[Page S7317]]\n\n  This bill does nothing more than instigate fear and divide our \nNation. Supporters of this bill may say that it is in response to a \ntragedy such as what happened in San Francisco, and what happened in \nSan Francisco was a tragedy. Such tragedies will not be prevented by \nthis legislation but by real immigration reform. I am happy to have \nthat debate--a real debate, an honest and compassionate debate, a \ndebate the country deserves--but that is not what is happening in this \nbill.\n  The title of the bill asserts that it will protect Americans. Well, \nto be clear, this bill will not protect Americans because it second \nguesses decisions made by local law enforcement around the country \nabout how to best police their own communities and ensure public \nsafety.\n  What is worse, this bill mandates local law enforcement to take on \nFederal immigration enforcement duties by threatening to strip away \nfunding from as many as 300 local jurisdictions, from programs such as \nthe community development block grant, community-oriented policing \nservices, and the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program. These are \nprograms that directly help our towns and communities. The CDBG Program \ngrows local economies and improves the quality of life for families. It \nhas assisted hundreds of millions of people with low and moderate \nincomes, stabilized neighborhoods, provided affordable housing, and \nimproved the safety and quality of life of American citizens. The Cops \non the Beat grant funds salaries and benefits for police officers who \nserve us every day by keeping our communities safe, and they deserve \nbetter than being dragged into partisan politics.\n  My colleague from Louisiana seeks to strip funding from localities \nthat undertake the balancing of public safety considerations and refuse \nto act as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. But this bill \ngoes even further than that. This bill isn't content with taking \ndiscretion away from local communities; it takes it away from the \njudicial branch. It adds new mandatory minimums when, as a nation, we \nare trying to move away from that approach. The new mandatory minimum \nsentences would have a crippling financial impact with no evidence that \nthey would actually deter future violations of the law. They could cost \nAmerican taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. I think that \ndeserves a serious, thoughtful debate in the Judiciary Committee, with \nexpert testimony on whether this really makes us safer or whether we \nare throwing away hard-earned taxpayer dollars. But we won't even get \nthat debate because this bill was fast-tracked as a Republican \npriority, and it didn't even go through the regular committee process.\n  The U.S. Senate cannot nurture an environment that demonizes and \ndehumanizes Latinos and the entire immigrant community. By threatening \nto strip CDBG funding from cities, Senate Republicans are saying that \nit is OK to withhold funding from economically vulnerable American \ncitizens, senior citizens, veterans, and children to promote their \nanti-immigrant agenda and that it is OK to cut COPS funding, which has \nlong promoted public safety through community policing.\n  A one-size-fits-all approach that punishes State and local law \nenforcement agencies that engage in well-established community policing \npractices just doesn't make sense. Local communities and local law \nenforcement are better judges than Congress of what keeps their \ncommunities safe. Police need cooperation from the community to do \ntheir jobs. That is why over the past several years hundreds of \nlocalities across our Nation, with the support of some of the toughest \npolice chiefs and sheriffs, have limited their involvement in Federal \nimmigration enforcement out of concerns for community safety and \nviolations of the Fourth Amendment. They need witnesses and victims to \nbe able to come forward without fear of recrimination because of their \nimmigrant status, and fear of deportation should never be a barrier to \nreporting crime or seeking help from the police. This fear undermines \ntrust between law enforcement and the communities they protect and \ncreates a chilling effect.\n  These policies were put in place because local jurisdictions don't \nwant to do ICE's job for them. Effective policing cannot be achieved by \nforcing an unwanted role upon the police by threat of sanctions or \nwithholding assistance, especially at a time when law enforcement \nagencies are strengthening police-community relations.\n  Furthermore, why do my Republican colleagues believe they know better \nthan the local towns and citizens who live this day in and day out? \nThey talk endlessly about decentralizing government, giving the power \nback to local communities, but not this time. It is no wonder that this \nbill is opposed by law enforcement, including the Fraternal Order of \nPolice, the Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force, the U.S. Conference \nof Mayors, immigrant and Latino rights organizations, faith groups, and \ndomestic violence groups, among others.\n  This bill is not a real solution to our broken immigration system. \nThe bottom line is that we need comprehensive immigration reform. We \npassed bipartisan legislation in 2013, but we haven't had a real \ndiscussion in Congress for over 2 years.\n  A recent Pew poll found that 74 percent of Americans overall said \nthat undocumented immigrants should be given a pathway to stay legally. \nThat included 66 percent of Republicans, 74 percent of Independents, \nand 80 percent of Democrats who support a pathway to legal status for \nundocumented immigrants. This bipartisan support is not new.\n  Comprehensive immigration reform, previously passed in the Senate, \nbrought millions of people out of the shadows who had to prove their \nidentity, pass a criminal background check, pay taxes, and provide an \nearned path to citizenship so ICE could focus on the people who were \ntrue public safety threats. The bill also increased penalties for \nrepeat border crossers. It included $46 billion in new resources, \nincluding no fewer than 38,000 trained, full-time, active Border Patrol \nagents deployed and stationed along the southern border. It increased \nthe real GDP of our country by more than 3 percent in 2023 and 5.4 \npercent in 2033--an increase of roughly $700 billion in the first 10 \nyears and $1.4 trillion in the second 10. It would have reduced the \nFederal deficit by $197 billion over the next decade and by another \n$700 billion in the following. That is almost $1 trillion in deficit \nspending reductions by giving 11 million people a pathway to \ncitizenship. That was a real solution. That is the type of reform we \nneed. That, in fact, is the opportunity that existed. Unfortunately, \nthe other body, the House of Representatives, did not even have a vote. \nTo the extent that Americans are less safe, it is because of their \ninaction that we are less safe today.\n  Tragedies should not be used to scapegoat immigrants. They should not \nbe used to erode trust between law enforcement and our communities. We \ncannot let fear drive our policymaking.\n  So let's actively and collectively resist the demagoguery that \nthreatens to shape American policymaking for the worse. I believe a \nvote to proceed is a vote against the Latino and immigrant communities \nof our country, and I hope that on a bipartisan basis we can reject it.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to discuss sanctuary cities.\n  Two women, Kate Steinle and Marilyn Pharis, were killed in California \nover the summer, both allegedly by undocumented individuals with \ncriminal records.\n  The suspect in each case had recently been released from local \ncustody without notice to Federal immigration officials, which could \nhave resulted in those individuals being removed from the country \ninstead of being released.\n  I believe these murders could have been prevented if there were open \nchannels of communication between local law enforcement and Federal \nimmigration authorities about dangerous individuals.\n  In both cases, those lines of communication broke down, and two women \ndied.\n  In my view, local law enforcement agencies should be required to \nnotify Federal authorities--if such notification is requested--that \nthey plan to release a dangerous individual, such as a convicted felon.\n  This is a reasonable solution that would target those criminals who \nshouldn't be released back onto the street.\n\n[[Page S7318]]\n\n  While I do support mandatory communication between local, State, and \nFederal officials, I do not support the bill before us today.\n  The bill we will soon be voting on would target all undocumented \nimmigrants for deportation.\n  It would divert already stretched local law enforcement resources \naway from dangerous criminals and from policing in their own \ncommunities. I do not support such an action.\n  This bill also includes a detention requirement that goes beyond \ndangerous individuals--it would cover any immigrant sought to be \ndetained.\n  This is a standard that could be abused in another administration, \nand it is potentially a huge unfunded mandate to impose on States and \nlocalities.\n  In addition to being an unfunded mandate, the bill would make drastic \ncuts to police departments, sheriffs departments, and local community \nprograms.\n  Specifically it would cut the COPS Hiring Program; the State Criminal \nAlien Assistance Program, known as SCAAP; and the Community Development \nBlock Grant Program.\n  Last year, 21 California jurisdictions received $13.2 million in COPS \nhiring grants to hire police officers.\n  California also received $57 million in SCAAP funds to help cover \ncosts of holding undocumented immigrants.\n  And California communities received $356.9 million under the \nCommunity Development Block Grant Program.\n  As a former mayor, I know how important these funds are to local \ncommunities.\n  The bill would also impose lengthy Federal prison sentences on all \nundocumented immigrants.\n  This would include mothers crossing the border to see their children.\n  It would include agricultural workers who are vital to California's \neconomy.\n  It would include other essentially innocent individuals who simply \nwant to make a better life for themselves and their families.\n  In my view, this goes much too far, and I cannot support it.\n  I would, however, like to talk further about the murders of Kate \nSteinle and Marilyn Pharis and what I believe should be done to protect \npublic safety.\n  Kate Steinle, a 32-year-old woman, was shot and killed in July while \nwalking along San Francisco's Pier 14 with her father.\n  The suspected shooter, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, had a long \ncriminal record.\n  He had seven felony convictions, including one for possession of \nheroin and another for manufacturing narcotics.\n  He had also been removed from the country five times.\n  The chain of events that led to Kate's murder began on March 23, when \nSan Francisco County Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi requested that Lopez-\nSanchez be transferred from Federal prison to San Francisco.\n  The sheriff's request was based on a 20-year-old marijuana possession \nwarrant.\n  On March 26, Lopez-Sanchez was booked into San Francisco County jail.\n  However, the 20-year-old marijuana charge was quickly dropped, and \nLopez-Sanchez was later released.\n  Immigration and Customs Enforcement had asked Sheriff Mirkarimi to \nlet the agency know when Lopez-Sanchez would be released. That did not \nhappen.\n  A simple phone call would have been enough, but Sheriff Mirkarimi \nfailed to notify Federal officials.\n  In July, only a few months after his release, Lopez-Sanchez shot and \nkilled Kate Steinle.\n  In fact, not only did the sheriff fail to notify, the failure was a \nconsequence of a deliberate policy.\n  Just weeks before his office requested the transfer of Lopez-Sanchez, \nthe sheriff adopted a policy forbidding his own deputies from notifying \nimmigration officials.\n  The policy specifically states that sheriff department staff shall \nnot provide release dates or times to immigration authorities.\n  Let me be clear: this isn't State law or even San Francisco law. This \nis the sheriff's own policy.\n  I believe this policy is wrong, and I have called on the sheriff to \nchange it. San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee has made the same request.\n  On July 24, Marilyn Pharis was brutally attacked with a hammer and \nsexually assaulted in her home by two suspects.\n  The 64-year-old Air Force veteran died in the hospital from her \ninjuries a week later.\n  One of the individuals charged with this heinous crime is a 20-year-\nold U.S. citizen named Jose Fernando Villagomez.\n  The other is a 29-year-old undocumented immigrant named Victor \nAureliano Martinez Ramirez.\n  According to ICE, Martinez Ramirez was arrested in May 2014, but he \nhad no prior felony convictions or deportations.\n  He was subject to what is called an ICE detainer request, asking the \nlocal jurisdiction to hold him until ICE could pick him up.\n  The local jurisdiction did not hold the suspect, nor did they notify \nICE of his release.\n  In the ensuing months, Martinez Ramirez accumulated multiple \nmisdemeanor convictions, including possession of methamphetamine and \nbattery.\n  One of his convictions included a protection order requiring him to \nstay away from a particular individual.\n  On July 20, he pleaded guilty to additional misdemeanor charges of \npossessing a dagger and drug paraphernalia.\n  He was sentenced to 30 days, but that wasn't to begin until October \n31. He was released from custody and, 4 days later, allegedly attacked, \nraped, and killed Marilyn Pharis in her own home.\n  I believe these two cases demonstrate the need for better \ncommunication between local, State, and Federal authorities before a \ndangerous individual with a criminal record is released.\n  When our committee was set to markup an earlier bill from Senator \nVitter, I prepared a simple amendment to ensure such communication \nhappens. That markup was cancelled.\n  I'd like to describe this approach now.\n  First, it would require notification by a State or local agency of \nthe impending release of certain dangerous individuals, if ICE requests \nsuch notification.\n  It would apply to individuals where there is probable cause to \nbelieve they are aliens who are removable from the country and who pose \na threat to the community.\n  Immigration offenses would be covered only if the individual had \nactually received more than 1 year in prison, which would happen for a \nperson with a significant criminal history.\n  The amendment I prepared would not include harmful cuts to law \nenforcement and community programs, which I believe are unnecessary and \nunwise.\n  The legal precedents from the Supreme Court show that Congress can \nimpose a reporting requirement on a State or local government, without \nthreatening harmful funding cuts.\n  That is the approach I would take--I believe it would protect public \nsafety without harming otherwise law-abiding immigrants or State or \nlocal law enforcement.\n  Before I conclude, I'd like to remind my colleagues that this is not \na choice between being pro-immigrant or pro-criminal.\n  I am pro-immigrant. Immigrants make a tremendous contribution to this \ncountry and to my State.\n  They work some of the most difficult jobs, from agriculture to \nconstruction to hospitality.\n  They are part of the fabric of our country.\n  I, myself, am the daughter of an immigrant.\n  I strongly support comprehensive immigration reform, which I think is \nthe only long-term solution to many of these problems.\n  I also support the President's executive actions to eliminate the \nthreat of deportation for young people who have been raised here, as \nwell as the parents of American citizens.\n  And I agree with immigrant advocates who want to prevent families \nfrom being separated because of a minor infraction like a broken \ntaillight.\n  The position I support strikes a balance.\n  It would keep dangerous individuals off the street, while protecting \notherwise law-abiding immigrants who are just here to work and provide \ntheir children with a better future.\n\n[[Page S7319]]\n\n  I believe the deaths of Kate Steinle and Marilyn Pharis could have \nbeen prevented.\n  I believe we can and should fix the problems that led to their deaths \nby requiring that local officials notify Federal officials before they \nrelease dangerous criminals, if asked to do so.\n  I oppose Senator Vitter's bill, which would sweep up otherwise law-\nabiding immigrants and divert resources away from where they are most \nneeded.\n  We should focus our efforts on dangerous criminals, and I hope that \nwhen we again take up comprehensive immigration reform, that is what \nhappens.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the death of Kate Steinle in San Francisco \nby a convicted felon who illegally crossed the border multiple times \nwas horrific. It left a family heartbroken and shocked our community, \nour State, and our Nation.\n  We cannot allow a tragedy like this to happen again.\n  We should never give sanctuary to serious and violent felons, but \nthis Republican bill is not the answer.\n  Getting rid of sanctuary cities will not reduce crime--in fact, it \nwill only increase crime and make us less safe.\n  That is why this bill is opposed by law enforcement, immigrant rights \norganizations, faith groups, domestic violence groups, labor unions, \nhousing and community development organizations, mayors of California's \nbiggest cities, and the National League of Cities--as well as many \nothers.\n  The truth is that sanctuary cities keep our neighborhoods safe by \npromoting trust and cooperation between police officers and immigrant \ncommunities. And that trust is essential to protecting all of us.\n  Let me give a quick example.\n  A few years ago in Seattle, more than two dozen Asian women were \nsexually assaulted in the same neighborhood over a 2-year period.\n  Because of the strong relationship between police and the community--\na community where police are generally prohibited from asking about \nimmigration status--many of the immigrant victims were willing to come \nforward and share information with the police, which led to the \nperpetrator's arrest.\n  Don't just take my word for it--listen to what law enforcement in our \ncommunities say about the importance of sanctuary city policies.\n  As former San Jose Police Chief Rob Davis said: ``We have been \nfortunate enough to solve some terrible cases because of the \nwillingness of illegal immigrants to step forward, and if they saw us \nas part of the immigration services, I just don't know if they'd do \nthat anymore.''\n  As Ohio Chief of Police Richard Biehl explained: ``Sanctuary policies \nand practices are not designed to harbor criminals. On the contrary, \nthey exist to support community policing, ensuring that the community \nat large--including immigrant communities--trusts State and local law \nenforcement and feels secure in reporting criminal conduct.''\n  Ending sanctuary policies would keep the voices of immigrant victims \nand witnesses quiet.\n  That means crimes would go unreported, cases would go unsolved, and \ndangerous criminals would go unpunished.\n  Ending these policies would actually give sanctuary to dangerous \ncriminals because, without the help of immigrant communities, these \nviolent offenders will continue to threaten our safety.\n  We know this because there are many places in this country where \nimmigrants do not feel safe coming forward.\n  As Texas Sheriff Lupe Valdez said: ``A lot of undocumented \nindividuals came from areas where they can't trust the police. The \nuniform has pushed them into the shadows. Good law enforcement cannot \nbe carried out this way.''\n  Just listen to some of the immigrants who were too terrified to come \nforward and report horrific crimes.\n  Take it from Maria, an immigrant survivor of serious domestic \nviolence, who fled from Texas to Indiana, where her abuser tracked her \ndown.\n  When he came to her house at midnight, she was too afraid to call \n911--fearing she could be deported--so she called her lawyer over and \nover. Because it was the middle of the night, her attorney was not at \nwork and came in the next morning to a series of frantic messages left \non her voicemail.\n  Ultimately, Maria's abuser was not able to get into the house, but \nher life was in danger because she thought that law enforcement wasn't \na safe option.\n  Take it from Cecilia, a young Guatemalan girl in Colorado.\n  Cecilia was sexually abused by a family friend at the age of 5. Her \nparents, undocumented immigrants, learned about the abuse, but they \nwere terrified to report the crime to the police because they were told \nby family and friends that the police could not be trusted. They were \ntold that, if they came forward, they would be reported to immigration \nand deported.\n  A year later, the same perpetrator sexually abused another young \nchild. It wasn't until the father of that child contacted Cecilia's \nparents that they decided to go to the police together, and the \nperpetrator was caught and prosecuted.\n  But because of their initial fear of reporting the crime, another \nchild was harmed.\n  So why would we pass a bill that could discourage victims or \nwitnesses from coming forward for help?\n  Why would we pass a bill that would make it harder for law \nenforcement to solve crimes and keep our communities safe?\n  This Republican bill is also dangerous because it would cut off COPS \ngrants that help communities protect residents by hiring officers.\n  We should be doing everything we can to help local police \ndepartments--not take away their ability to put officers on the street.\n  Republicans also want to punish communities by taking away their \ncommunity development block grants, which would hurt thousands of \nworking families who rely on these funds for safe, affordable housing \nand other critical services.\n  This GOP bill would also take away SCAAP funding, which reimburses \nState and local governments for the costs of incarcerating undocumented \nimmigrants. This funding has been repeatedly slashed, and it has never \nbeen enough--especially in my State of California, which spends nearly \n$1 billion a year on these incarceration costs.\n  These cuts would have devastating impact on States and local \ncommunities.\n  Now, there are some California communities reviewing their specific \npolicies and forging cooperation agreements with Federal immigration \nofficials--and I think that's a good thing.\n  I believe that State and local officials should examine their \npolicies to ensure that they are preserving the trust that law \nenforcement has built in our communities, while keeping serious and \nviolent felons off our streets.\n  Unfortunately, this Republican bill would do the exact opposite--it \nwould undermine the trust that has been developed between police and \nimmigrant communities, and it would set back efforts to solve cases and \nput dangerous criminals behind bars.\n  The real question is: Why are we even considering this bill?\n  Why isn't Congress passing the bipartisan comprehensive immigration \nreform bill that the Senate passed more than 2 years ago?\n  That bipartisan bill would make our country safer by adding 20,000 \nmore Border Patrol agents; increasing surveillance; and hiring \nadditional prosecutors and judges to boost prosecutions of illegal \nborder crossings.\n  The measure would also make clear that serious or violent felons will \nnever get a pathway to citizenship or legal status.\n  And the bill would bring families out of the shadows--so that they \ndon't fear being deported or separated from their families . . . so \nthey feel comfortable cooperating with police and reporting crimes in \ntheir communities.\n  Let's make our communities safer by passing real immigration reform \nand by defeating this misguided Republican bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                         Donnelly Confirmation\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am going to discuss the bill on the \nfloor in a minute, but first I wish to take a moment to congratulate \nthe newly confirmed district judge for the Eastern District of New \nYork, Ann Donnelly. She just passed the Senate with a vote of 95 to 2--\nnearly unanimous and deservedly so.\n\n[[Page S7320]]\n\n  There are few more qualified for a Federal judgeship than Ann \nDonnelly. She has dedicated her life to public service, having spent a \nquarter decade as a prosecutor in the prestigious New York County \nDistrict Attorney's Office under Bob Morgenthau. She accumulated a host \nof awards there and rose through the leadership ranks of the office. \nThen, in 2009, she became a State court judge in New York, hearing a \nwide variety of cases. She has a stellar academic record, having \ngraduated from the University of Michigan and Ohio State University \nSchool of Law.\n  I could tick off more of her accomplishments, and the list would be \nlong, but Judge Donnelly is more than a brilliant resume. I know her \nwell. She is at her core a kind, thoughtful, and compassionate person. \nAnyone who knows her or who has interacted with her even briefly knows \nshe is fair, open-minded, and has exactly the kind of temperament that \nwill make her an exceptional Federal judge.\n  I congratulate Ann Donnelly and her family--particularly her mother--\non her confirmation. I know her mother is so proud of her. It is a \nmilestone day in her career and a bright day for the Eastern District \nof New York.\n  Mr. President, today the Senate will turn its attention to a divisive \nimmigration bill that has no hope of becoming law. Today's vote won't \nbe on a comprehensive bill, as was the one the Senate passed 2 years \nago--one that secures our borders, provides a jolt to the economy, \nprovides a pathway to citizenship for hard-working, law-abiding \nimmigrants who pay their taxes to get right with the law.\n  I want to be clear with the American people on this. Today's vote is \nnothing but a political show vote. Senator Vitter knows his bill has no \nchance of passing the Senate or being signed into law. As stated by my \nfriend the Republican junior Senator from Nevada--here is what he said: \n``You know we have votes because people are running for president, so I \nam not surprised we have votes because people are running for \ngovernor.'' No other sentence sums it up better as to what a waste of \ntime this is, and that is to say nothing about the substance of the \nbill, which has drawn opposition from nearly every important interest \ngroup. A broad coalition of major law enforcement groups, faith groups, \nlabor, cities, elected officials, housing advocates, and immigrant \nrights groups oppose this bill. I suspect there are Members of the \nRepublican caucus who oppose many parts of it. Why? Because it is a \nbill that would jeopardize hundreds of millions of dollars in the name \nof punishing immigrants and cities where they live.\n  This bill would strip away community development block grants, \ncommunity COPS grants to hire more cops, and SCAAP, a proposal that \nfunds jurisdictions that are doing what many on the other side want \nthem to do by locking up unauthorized immigrants who commit crimes. \nEveryone believes that if a person commits a serious crime unrelated to \nbeing an immigrant--not like crossing the border or forging a document \nbut a serious crime--law enforcement should be required to cooperate \nand those folks should be deported, plain and simple. But in the name \nof trying to help law enforcement, this bill hurts law enforcement \nbecause it will take away so many of the grants law enforcement needs. \nIt will take away the grants that help create a way of incarcerating \nthose who commit serious crimes.\n  All of these cuts would come while also astronomically increasing the \nsize of prison population and related costs, without decreasing the \ndeficit by a single dime. This will put a huge burden on our State and \nlocal taxpayers. Their taxes would go way up if this bill were passed \ninto law and implemented.\n  To be clear, the death of Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco was \ntragic. It never should have happened. I mourn not only her family but \nthe family of any American killed in a senseless act of gun violence. \nFor people like the killer of Ms. Steinle, law enforcement should \ncooperate with the Federal authorities and deport those folks.\n  This is not the way to exercise better law enforcement. Punishing \ncities and communities and yanking Federal funding from cops will not \nget us to a better immigration system or safeguard our communities.\n  The bill we passed in 2013, which I was proud to author with a number \nof Democratic and Republican colleagues, is the opposite of this bill \nin every way. Our bill was supported by a broad coalition of groups, \nfrom business, labor, faith communities, immigrant communities, and law \nenforcement. Our bill paid for itself and went on to decrease the \ndeficit by $160 billion over 10 years and to increase GDP by 3.3 \npercent. Our bill secured the border--this bill doesn't do that--not \nonly with more resources and staff but by cracking down on repeat \nborder crossers and those who overstay their visas. It did it in a \nsmart way. The goal of our friend from Louisiana isn't accomplished in \nhis bill, but it is in comprehensive immigration reform--the goal of \nmaking sure those who are repeat border crossers and those who overstay \ntheir visas are dealt with properly.\n  Our bill paved a tough but fair pathway to citizenship, shielding \nlaw-abiding immigrants from deportation, fostering trust with law \nenforcement, and exposing the criminals in their communities who would \nrather live in the shadows.\n  Our bill was a bipartisan compromise. There is no compromise here. I \ndaresay many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, when they \nlook at provisions in this bill, do not like them. This is a show \nvote--a vote, as my Republican colleague from Nevada said, to help \nsomeone in his quest for political office.\n  There are so many vitally important policy debates we could be \nturning to today. Instead, the Senate Republican leadership insists on \nleading us into this dark, divisive place for nothing more than \npolitical theater. Think of the urgent bipartisan issues we should be \nworking on, including the debt ceiling. We are about to default because \nof the shenanigans going on on the other side. The Perkins Loan Program \nso that kids can go to college; the land and water conservation \nprograms are expiring. The highway bill--we don't have a highway bill, \nyet we are doing this. And if we don't take action by the end of the \nyear, millions of seniors will see a 52-percent increase in their \nMedicare bill. How many Americans would want us to do that and not the \ndivisive show vote that has no chance of passing?\n\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill. Just as importantly, I beg \nmy colleagues to join us on this side of the aisle in turning to a \nserious debate on comprehensive immigration reform--something they have \nso far refused to do.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The Senator is advised that the Senate is under an order to recess at \nthis time.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for such time as I may consume and that Senator Hirono be \nrecognized following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak on S. 2146, the Stop \nSanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Act, which the Senate will \nvote on shortly and which our colleagues have been speaking about.\n  First, I want to recognize and thank my colleagues for joining in \nthis effort--Senator Vitter, Senator Grassley, Senator Cruz, and \nSenator Johnson--and introducing this very important bill. I can't \nbelieve the way it is being mischaracterized, and I will try to address \nsome of those mischaracterizations.\n  Let's be clear. This bill is about keeping our communities safe from \nviolent crime. That is what it is about. It is necessary because of the \nsanctuary cities that we have across America.\n  This is not a manufactured problem. This is a very real problem. \nThere is one father who knows about it all too well. Jim Steinle was \nwalking arm in arm with his daughter on a pier in San Francisco. \nSuddenly a gunman leaps out, opens fire, and hits Kate. She falls into \nher father's arms and pleads, ``Help me, dad,'' while she bleeds to \ndeath.\n  What is so outrageous about this, among other things, is that the \nshooter never should have been on the pier that day, in the first \nplace. He was an illegal immigrant who had been convicted of seven \nfelonies. He had been deported\n\n[[Page S7321]]\n\nfive times, and there he is on the San Francisco pier, shooting and \nkilling an innocent woman. It is more outrageous than that. Just 3 \nmonths earlier, the Department of Homeland Security had asked the San \nFrancisco Police Department, when they had picked up this man, to hold \nhim until DHS officials could come and get him. They had made that \nspecific request when this man was in the custody of the San Francisco \nPolice Department, but San Francisco refused to cooperate. Knowing that \nDHS wanted them to hold this man for a short period of time until their \nagents could get there and take him into custody, having had that \nrequest from DHS, San Francisco said no, and they released him so he \ncould then go out and commit a murder.\n  Why in the world would they release a man such as this when DHS has \nasked them to hold him? It is because San Francisco is a sanctuary \ncity. What that means is that it is the policy of the city of San \nFrancisco--having commanded their local law enforcement, their police \ndepartment--to not cooperate with Federal officials seeking to \nprosecute immigration issues. Even when they want to cooperate, they \nare forbidden from cooperating. Think about how absurd this is.\n  If Federal officials had called the San Francisco Police Department \nabout any other kind of crime--larceny, burglary, a trademark \nviolation--they would have been happy to cooperate. They would have \ncooperated, in fact. But because the crime was related to illegal \nimmigration, the San Francisco Police Department's hands were tied. The \npolice were forced to release the man who would then go on and kill \nKate Steinle. As a father of three young children, I can't even begin \nto think about the pain that the Steinles just went through, and what \nis so maddening is that it was entirely unnecessary.\n  Sadly, this is not the only case, as you know. According to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, during an 8-month period last year, \nsanctuary jurisdictions--cities and counties that have adopted this \npolicy of noncooperation--have released over 8,000 illegal immigrants \nthey had in their custody, and 1,800 of these were later arrested for \ncriminal acts. This includes two cities that refused to hold \nindividuals who had been arrested for child sexual abuse. In both cases \nthe individuals were later arrested for sexually assaulting young \nchildren. This is how outrageous this has become.\n  For the record, let me make it clear that I completely understand \nthat the vast majority of immigrants would not commit these crimes. \nThat is not what this is about. But the truth of the matter is that any \nlarge group of individuals is going to have a certain number of \ncriminals within it. Of the 11 million people who are here illegally, \nsome are inevitably violent criminals.\n  The Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Act provides a \nsolution to this in three parts. First, under our legislation sanctuary \njurisdictions will lose certain Federal funds. If a city or county or \nmunicipality decides they will declare or forbid their law enforcement \nofficials from cooperating and even sharing information with Federal \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials, they will lose some Federal \nfunding.\n  Second, this legislation includes Kate's Law. This provides for a \nmandatory minimum 5-year sentence for a person who reenters the United \nStates illegally after having been convicted of an aggravated felony or \nhaving been convicted twice before of illegal reentry.\n  Finally, there is the third part of this legislation. Across America \ndozens of municipalities that had been cooperating with Federal \nimmigration officials have been forced to become sanctuary communities \nor counties because several Federal courts have held that local law \nenforcement may not cooperate when DHS asks them to hold an illegal \nimmigrant. They maintain that there is not the statutory authority for \nlocal law enforcement to do so. Therefore, if the local police were to \ncooperate, as they should, they would be liable for damages, and this \nwould apply even to dangerous criminal cases. We solve that problem by \nmaking it clear that when local law enforcement is acting in a fashion \nconsistent with what DHS is requesting--what DHS has the authority to \ndo themselves--then there would be no such legal liability.\n  Some of my Democratic colleagues have said that we don't need this \nlegislation and that all we need is greater cooperation between Federal \nand local law enforcement. Well, that is absolutely factually \nincorrect. It is not possible to have the level of cooperation that we \nneed to have because of these court decisions, because the court \ndecisions effectively are precluding the kind of cooperation that we \nneed. That is why Congress needs to act.\n  We need to make it clear that local law enforcement can in fact hold \nsomebody that the Department of Homeland Security needs to have held, \njust as the Department of Homeland Security has that authority \nthemselves. The Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Act \nprovides a valid solution. It confirms that local law enforcement \nofficers are allowed to cooperate when Federal officials ask them to \nhold illegal immigrants.\n  It is carefully drafted to protect individual liberties. If an \nindividual's civil liberties or constitutional rights are violated, \nthan that individual can still file suit and can still seek a remedy, \nand that is as it should be. But this legislation to stop sanctuary \npolicies act really should have very broad bipartisan support.\n  Let's keep in mind the people we are talking about here. As a \npractical matter, the only cases in which this applies is that small \nsubset of illegal immigrants who even the Obama administration wishes \nto hold for deportation--only that small subset of people that the \nObama administration believes is dangerous enough to warrant removal. \nReally, we can't even have local law enforcement officials cooperate \nunder those circumstances?\n  President Obama's own Secretary of Homeland Security has declared \nthat sanctuary cities are ``not acceptable.'' He has described them as \n``counterproductive to public safety.'' There is no real basis for \nvoting no on this.\n  Opponents have turned to misrepresenting this in many ways, but the \nfacts are overwhelming.\n  There are three national law enforcement groups that have written a \npowerful letter addressing some of the misrepresentations that have \nbeen made about this bill. They have reaffirmed their support for this \nbill. They include the National Sheriffs' Association, the National \nAssociation of Police Organizations, and the Federal Law Enforcement \nOfficers Association.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have their letter printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 October 20, 2015.\n     Senator David Vitter,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Chairman Chuck Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator Ron Johnson,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator Pat Toomey,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator Ted Cruz,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Vitter, Toomey, Grassley, Cruz, and Johnson: \n     On behalf of the National Sheriffs' Association, the National \n     Association of Police Organizations, and the Federal Law \n     Enforcement Officers Association and the local, state, and \n     federal law enforcement officers we represent, we write to \n     reiterate out support for the Stop Sanctuary Policies and \n     Protect Americans Act (S.2146) and to correct some \n     misrepresentations regarding the Act.\n       As the law enforcement officers on the front lines working \n     to protect our communities, we know firsthand the challenges \n     facing police officers. We know when a bill makes our jobs \n     more difficult and when a bill makes our jobs easier.\n       We have been surprised to hear some misrepresent this bill \n     and its effects on law enforcement.\n       For example, some have claimed that the Stop Sanctuary \n     Policies Act will ``requir[e] state and local law enforcement \n     to carry out the federal government's immigration enforcement \n     responsibilities,'' and thus ``the federal government would \n     be substituting its judgment for the judgment of state and \n     local law enforcement agencies.'' Nothing in the Stop \n     Sanctuary Policies Act requires local law enforcement ``to \n     carry out federal immigration responsibilities.'' Removing \n     illegal immigrants remains the exclusive province of the \n     federal government. The bill simply withholds certain federal \n     funds from jurisdictions that prohibit their local law \n     enforcement officers from cooperating with\n\n[[Page S7322]]\n\n     federal officials in the limited circumstance of honoring an \n     immigration detainer. It is politicians in sanctuary \n     jurisdictions who, by tying the hands of local law \n     enforcement, are ``substituting [their] judgment for the \n     judgment of state and local law enforcement.''\n       Others have resorted to scare tactics, warning that that \n     S.2146 will lead to the deportation of those who report \n     crimes to law enforcement. This is simply false. The bill \n     provides that if a jurisdiction has a policy that it will not \n     inquire about the immigration status of crime victims or \n     witnesses, the jurisdiction will not be deemed a sanctuary \n     jurisdiction and will not lose any federal funds.\n       To be clear: We believe the Stop Sanctuary Policies Act \n     will make America safer, enhance the ability of police to \n     protect and serve, and provide greater flexibility for law \n     enforcement officers at every level--federal, state, and \n     local.\n       We also write to address those Members of Congress who \n     insist that the Stop Sanctuary Policies Act is not needed; \n     instead, Congress should ``encourage'' local officers to \n     cooperate with federal officials. This ignores one crucial \n     fact: Across America, federal courts have issued decisions \n     forbidding local officers from cooperating with federal \n     requests to hold an illegal immigrant. These decisions \n     provide that local law enforcement and municipalities may be \n     sued if they cooperate with federal officials to detain \n     dangerous criminals. Under these decisions, even if a federal \n     official would have had the authority to hold the individual, \n     local law enforcement can still be sued.\n       Too often, local law enforcement officers are left with a \n     terrible choice: Either release an individual who has been \n     convicted of or arrested for violent crimes, or be sued and \n     lose funds that are needed to protect our communities. As a \n     result of these lawsuits, scores of cities and counties \n     across America have become sanctuary jurisdictions.\n       The Stop Sanctuary Policies Act provides a solution. The \n     bill confirms that local law enforcement may cooperate with \n     federal requests to hold an illegal immigrant. The bill \n     provides that when local officers comply with such requests, \n     they are delegated the same powers to hold an illegal \n     immigrant as a DHS official would have. If the detention \n     would have been legal if carried out by the Department of \n     Homeland Security (DHS), then under S.2146 it is still legal; \n     it does not become a crime simply because it is a local \n     sheriff acting instead of a DHS official.\n       This provision was carefully drafted to protect individual \n     liberties. It preserves an individual's ability to sue for a \n     violation of a constitutional or civil rights, regardless of \n     whether the violation was the result of negligence or was \n     purposeful. Under S.2146, if there was no basis to detain the \n     individual--DHS issued the request for someone in the U.S. \n     legally--the individual may still sue for a violation of \n     rights. The difference is that the party responsible for the \n     error, the federal government, is liable; not a local police \n     officer or jailer acting in good faith. If a local law \n     enforcement officer acts improperly--mistreating an \n     individual or continuing to hold an individual after federal \n     officials issue a release order--the individual may sue, with \n     the local officer liable for all costs and judgments.\n       Contrary to the assertions of the American Civil Liberties \n     Union (ACLU)--the party that has orchestrated these lawsuits \n     against local law enforcement officers--the Stop Sanctuary \n     Policies Act is fully consistent with the Fourth Amendment. \n     In a letter to Congress, the ACLU states, ``The Fourth \n     Amendment provides that the government cannot hold anyone in \n     jail without getting a warrant or the approval of a judge.'' \n     The fact is that the Constitution requires probable cause to \n     detain an individual, which can be established by a judicial \n     warrant issued before the arrest or by a demonstration of \n     probable cause after the arrest. Otherwise police could never \n     arrest someone whom they see committing a crime. The Stop \n     Sanctuary Policies Act does not alter the requirement for \n     probable cause. To the contrary, S.2146 explicitly preserves \n     an individual's ability to sue if he or she is held without \n     probable cause or has suffered any other violation of a \n     constitutional right.\n       The ACLU also tries scare tactics. It claims that the Stop \n     Sanctuary Policies Act includes ``provisions requiring DHS to \n     absorb all liability in lawsuits brought by individuals \n     unlawfully detained in violation of the Fourth Amendment.'' \n     This is false. If a lawsuit alleges that a local officer \n     knowingly violated Fourth Amendment or other constitutional \n     rights, then under S.2146, the individual officer will bear \n     all liability--not the federal government. For some lawsuits, \n     the U.S. will be substituted as defendant--specifically, \n     suits alleging that that the immigration detainer should not \n     have been issued. But such a claim could already be brought \n     against the U.S. under existing law; thus, S.2146 does not \n     create a new source of liability for the federal government. \n     S.2146 simply provides that if the federal government made \n     the error, the federal government should be the defendant.\n       We, the law enforcement officers of America, are on the \n     front lines day after day. We know the challenges of \n     apprehending criminals and the difficulties of working with \n     crime victims and witnesses--especially those who may be \n     fearful of local and federal authorities. Based on our \n     collective knowledge and experience, we strongly support the \n     Stop Sanctuary Policies Act (S.2146) and urge the Senate to \n     pass this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     National Sheriffs' Association.\n     National Association of Police Organizations.\n     Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association.\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, let me finish by reminding my colleagues \nthat the vote we are about to have is not actually a vote on this bill \nin its current form. If Members object to a provision in it or they \nwant to add a provision in it, then, by all means, let's vote to get on \nthe bill. Let's open up debate, and we will have amendments, we will \nhave a discussion, and we will have a debate. They are free to attempt \nto improve this bill and modify this bill, as they see fit.\n  This vote today is not a final passage vote. It is a vote on whether \nthe issue of sanctuary jurisdictions is important enough to merit the \nSenate's consideration.\n  I was just shocked to hear one of our colleagues describe this bill \nas a waste of time. Really, a waste of time? That is unbelievable. How \ncould the lives of Kate Steinle and the other victims who have been \nlost because of this ridiculous policy be a waste of the Senate's time \nwhen the courts are precluding the cooperation between local and \nFederal law enforcement officials because we have not acted? There is a \nsimple solution. It starts with passing a motion to proceed so we can \nget on this bill and hopefully complete it successfully. I think the \nlives of Kate Steinle and the other victims are not a waste of time. I \nthink we should be addressing this issue. We should be addressing it \ntoday.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote aye so that we can begin considering \nthis very important--and it should be broadly supported--bipartisan \npiece of legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I would like to urge my colleagues to \noppose S. 2146, the Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Act.\n  Hundreds of cities and local jurisdictions across our country have \nfinancial, constitutional, and public safety concerns with using scarce \nlocal tax dollars to hold immigrants in jail when they otherwise would \nbe entitled to release under the law. These cities and towns are being \ncalled sanctuary cities because they have made a local and fact-based \nchoice to keep their communities safe rather than serve as an arm of \nimmigration enforcement.\n  This bill would create new criminal penalties for undocumented \nimmigrants and make life even harder for them, most of whom are honest, \nhard-working people, not criminals. The bill also takes severe steps to \npenalize these sanctuary cities by stripping them of critical community \nblock grants and Federal homeland security and law enforcement funding. \nWhile this bill purports to protect our communities, it is strongly \nopposed by law enforcement, victims' advocates, and local and State \ngovernment leaders.\n  Why do they oppose this bill?\n  Demonizing our immigrant communities and using them as scapegoats \ndoes not make America safer. Decades of research shows the following: \nthat immigrants as a group are not a threat to public safety, that \nimmigrants are less likely to commit serious crimes than the rest of \nAmericans, and that the higher rates of immigration are associated with \nlower rates of violent crime.\n  Law enforcement is clear. This bill would limit their ability to keep \nall people in their communities safe. Good community policy requires \ncollaboration and trust. Our law enforcement officials want to spend \ntheir time going after people who truly pose a threat to our safety. \nThis bill would have us spend limited resources pursuing hardworking \nthough undocumented members of their communities with no criminal \nhistory. Community law enforcement should not be coerced, because that \nis what this bill would require. It is a requirement. Community law \nenforcement should not be coerced into serving as an arm of Federal \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement. That is what this bill does. \nNobody is talking about voluntary collaboration and support for Federal \nGovernment\n\n[[Page S7323]]\n\nenforcement of laws. Throughout this Congress, my Republican colleagues \noften rail against the Federal Government telling State and local \ngovernments what to do, but now when it comes to something as important \nas public safety and law enforcement, it is suddenly OK to second guess \nState and local law enforcement?\n\n  Instead of turning hard-working immigrants into bogeymen, we should \nbe focusing on real solutions for violent crime in our communities. If \nmy colleagues who support this bill are serious about addressing \nviolence in America, then they should come to the table to talk about \nhow we can strengthen our laws to keep guns out of the hands of \ncriminals and the mentally ill.\n  I have been saying, along with many of my colleagues for over a year \nnow, if my Republican colleagues want to discuss immigration reform, we \nwelcome that debate. Everyone agrees our immigration system is broken \nand needs reform. It has been 28 months since the Senate passed a \ncomprehensive immigration bill that had strong bipartisan support.\n  Even though it was not perfect from my perspective, we nonetheless \nworked together to come up with a compromise bill, but House \nRepublicans ducked the issue and refused to take up the immigration \nreform bill. The Senate comprehensive immigration bill would have \nreduced the Federal deficit by $1 trillion in just two decades because \nof the broad economic benefits immigration reform granted.\n  It would have protected and united families, strengthened our border \nsecurity, improved our economy, and encouraged job creation in our \ncountry. The Senate's bill would have gotten millions of people out of \nthe shadows, requiring them to pass criminal background checks and earn \ntheir path to citizenship. It would have let immigration enforcement \nofficials focus on true security threats to our country.\n  The Senate's immigration bill included $46 billion in new resources \nto help our Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. \nOf this amount, roughly $30 billion was added to the bill to further \nsecure our borders, but that is not enough for some Republicans. \nApparently, some will not be happy until we literally round up every \nundocumented immigrant--some 11 million of them in our country--and \ndeport them, which would be catastrophic to our economy, not to mention \nimpossible to do. The current sanctuary cities debate is not the first \ntime some have tried to use myths about immigrants to scare Americans. \nThis rhetoric could not be further from the truth about immigrants.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose these scare tactics and to vote no on \nthe motion to proceed to S. 2146.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/20/senate-section/article/S7323-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 54, the nays are \n45.\n  Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1082\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I don't think any of us in any of the 50 \nStates have not had calls from our constituents about the Veterans' \nAdministration. I know that certainly in Florida, I have. We are \nblessed to have so many people who are either in uniform or have served \nin uniform.\n  We make two fundamental promises to the men and women who serve our \ncountry. The first is that if we ever put them into hostility, they \nwill be better equipped, better trained, and have more information than \ntheir adversaries. I, of course, fear that all three of those promises \nhave eroded.\n  Here is the second promise we make to them: After they take care of \nus and they come home, we will take care of them. That is a promise \nthat, sadly, is also not being kept.\n  There are a lot of different issues we can get into when it comes to \nveterans and what they are facing in this country, but one that has \nreceived a lot of attention is the Veterans' Administration and in \nparticular the role it plays in providing health care for those \nreturning or those who have served our country and have been facing \nchallenges ever since. We have all had the phone calls to our office, \nand we have seen the media reports about it.\n  I am proud that last year we were able to pass legislation that gave \nthe Secretary of the VA the ability to fire senior executives who \nweren't doing their jobs. This is the point--and this is where I always \nstop and remind everyone there are really good people working in the \nVA. In fact, the enormous majority of people at the VA are good people \nwho care passionately about our veterans. There are some phenomenal VA \nfacilities in this country, and then there are some facilities\n\n[[Page S7324]]\n\nthat aren't working. There are some individuals within that agency who, \nquite frankly, are not doing their jobs well. The problem is that they \ncan't be held accountable because they are protected by law, and as a \nresult they can't be removed.\n  We expanded that law a year ago to include the ability to fire senior \nexecutives who weren't doing their jobs, but to date that has not been \nused to much effect. So earlier this year we introduced followup \nlegislation, and the followup legislation gives the Secretary of the \nDepartment the authority to remove any employee of Veterans Affairs \nbased on performance--or lack thereof--or misconduct. It gives them the \nauthority to remove such individuals from the civil service or demote \nthe individual through a reduction in grade or annual pay rate.\n  I am proud that this bill has gone through the process here in the \nSenate. It has passed out of committee and is now ready for action. I \nhope we will take action on this. There is a different version in the \nHouse. It has also gone through their committees, and they are waiting \nfor their process to move it through. There are some differences \nbetween the two, which, of course, would be worked out in conference.\n  I think the prudent thing to do at this point, given the fact that \nthe Senate bill has worked its way through the process and is now ready \nfor action, is to take action. This is about creating accountability. \nBy the way, this is about taking care of our veterans, but it is also \nabout taking care of the people at the VA who are doing their jobs. \nThis is also about them. It isn't fair to them that people who aren't \ndoing their jobs continue in their positions and in many instances are \nincreasing the workload on others because they are not performing or \ncarrying their weight.\n  That is why I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 272, S. 1082; further, that the \ncommittee-reported amendments be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be \nread a third time and passed, and that the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I \nrespect deeply and in fact support the arguments made by my colleague \nfrom Florida. There are goals here to be served, and I strongly support \nthem as well. Accountability has been lacking for too long in the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. That is a simple fact on which we can \nall agree. In fact, we took a major step in the right direction with \nthe passage of the access and accountability act during the last \nsession with bipartisan support.\n  I would support this measure if a number of simple changes were made \nto it to comply with the Constitution. This measure lacks some of the \nbasic constitutional guarantees that again and again the Supreme Court \nof the United States has said are absolutely mandatory. This bill, \nunfortunately, fails to provide sufficient notice in advance of any \nfiring or disciplinary action, a statement of cause, a right to be \nheard, and an opportunity for basic administrative constitutional \nguarantees.\n  I commit to work with my colleague from Florida on seeking to improve \nthis bill. In fact, I have proposed a measure that is now pending in \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs, S. 1856, which will improve the \nmanagement of the VA in many of the same ways, but it avoids these \nconstitutional pitfalls.\n  As a former attorney general, I care deeply about enforcement, which \nis to say effective enforcement. A disciplinary action now under appeal \nin the Federal circuit will decide the constitutionality of exactly \nthese procedures. In the meantime, we ought to avoid creating \nunnecessary litigation and challenge to a law that should be enforced \neffectively. This one, unfortunately, cannot be. I believe strongly \nthere are measures and ways to achieve greater accountability. It isn't \na luxury or convenience; it is a necessity that the VA is held \naccountable. The more effective way to hold the VA accountable is to \npass a measure that is fully constitutional and, in addition, provides \nmore effective protection for whistleblowers. They are the ones who \ncome forward speaking truth to power. They are the ones with critical \nfacts necessary for accountability. This measure, unfortunately, fails \nto afford sufficient protection for those whistleblowers. Therefore, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, the difference between this bill and the \none in the House is the Whistleblower Protection Act. So if that is the \nissue the Senator is concerned with, I would ask if the Senator from \nConnecticut would then be willing not to object, to lift the objection, \nif we could move forward on the House bill that is now here and ready \nfor us to take up as well because it does contain the whistleblower \nprotection language.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I would be more than willing--indeed, \nhappy--to work with my colleague from Florida on specific language that \nimproves the whistleblower protection language. I think his bill takes \na step in the right direction by providing that the Office of Special \nCounsel provide approval for any disciplinary action. That is a good \nstep, but I believe it could be made more effective. I think the \nopportunity to be heard with notice for cause or discipline or firing \nis essential to effective enforcement. I share the goal--strongly share \nit--of making sure that accountability is enforced.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Again, the House version of this bill, which is ready for \nus to take up today, has stronger accountability language which we do \nnot oppose. It simply was not included for purposes of time at the \ncommittee level. But we are prepared to move now, if we could, because \nthe House version is here and ready for action on our part, and it has \nthe stronger accountability language. It sounds as though, no matter \nwhat, we are probably going to have a delay here on acting on this \nmatter.\n  I would say this for people watching here in the Gallery or at home \nor anywhere they might see it later--I just want everybody to \nunderstand what we are saying here. All we are saying in this bill is \nthat if you work for the VA and you aren't doing your job, they get to \nfire you. I think people are shocked that doesn't actually exist in the \nentire government since there is no other job in the country where, if \nyou don't do your job, you don't get fired. But in this instance, we \nare just limiting it to one agency. This should actually be the rule in \nthe entire government. If you are not doing your job, you should get \nfired. But this is just limiting it to the VA because we have a crisis \nthere with the lack of accountability.\n  I would hope we can move forward on this, and I am prepared to listen \nto anyone who wants to improve this. We went through the normal course \nand process in the Senate. We went through the committee. It had \nhearings. Opportunities for amendments were offered at the time. So if \nthere is a good-faith effort--and I believe that there is--then let's \nimprove this and take action on it. We need to have a VA that is more \ninterested in the welfare and security of our veterans than the job \nsecurity of Federal employees.\n  I said at the outset that there are really good people at the VA. The \nvast majority of employees at the VA are doing their jobs and doing \nthem well. They care about these veterans. It isn't fair to them that \nthere are people on the payroll taking up seats, taking up slots, \ntaking up money, and taking up time who aren't doing their jobs, and \nthey literally cannot be fired. They literally cannot be removed. It is \na near impossibility. The process is so expensive, so long, so \ntroublesome, so complicated that in essence they cannot be removed.\n  Unfortunately, we will not be able to move forward on this today, it \nappears, but I hope that in quick succession we will be able to come \ntogether and get this done to provide a higher level of accountability \nthat is so necessary in every agency of government but none more so \nthan Veterans Affairs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, one last word. I want to simply concur\n\n[[Page S7325]]\n\nin the very powerful and eloquent statements made by my colleague from \nFlorida. I think we all share those sentiments in this body that--and I \nam quoting now from legislation: Any employee who engages in \nmalfeasance, overprescription of medication, insubordination, violation \nof any duty of care should be disciplined and very possibly fired.\n  We are talking about the process to achieve that end. I can commit \nthat I will work with my colleague from Florida to make sure this body \napproves a measure that is effective as a deterrent to those kinds of \nviolations of basic duty. To be effective as a deterrent, it has to be \nenforceable, and that is our common goal here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, a few moments ago the Senate refused to \nmove forward on an important piece of legislation, sometimes called the \nsanctuary cities bill. I want to explain for whoever may be listening \nand particularly for my colleagues what a terrible mistake our \nDemocratic colleagues made--with the exception of two--by voting to \nblock consideration of this piece of legislation.\n  What this bill would do is withhold Federal funds from jurisdictions \nthat basically violate current law--that violate the information-\nsharing requirement in immigration law, Section 642 of the 1996 Illegal \nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. Secondly, it would \nwithhold Federal funds from those jurisdictions that refuse to honor \nthe lawful, legal process known as the detainer, or request to notify \nFederal authorities if local law enforcement decides to release an \nillegal immigrant who happens to have been arrested for some other \nunrelated reason.\n  This is a truly important issue. As we have seen from the news, Kate \nSteinle out in California was killed by somebody who had repeatedly \nviolated our laws not only by entering the country illegally but also \nby committing offenses against the persons and property of American \ncitizens. Essentially what happens is when local jurisdictions give up \nand refuse to honor the detainers or give notice to Federal authorities \nbefore they release individuals, then people are going to get hurt. The \nKate Steinles of the world will get killed.\n  In my State of Texas, we have had Houston police officers and other \nlaw enforcement personnel killed by illegal immigrants who have \nroutinely broken our laws and have terrible criminal records. But if we \ncan't get the cooperation of local law enforcement authorities to work \nwith the Federal authorities, then unfortunately public safety will be \nharmed.\n  I am going to pull back a little bit and ask my colleagues to look at \nthis perhaps from 30,000 feet. There is a reason at the time our \nConstitution was written that article VI, clause 2 simply said the \nFederal law is the supreme law of the land. In other words, Federal \nlaws trump State laws and local laws.\n  If we think about it, as James Madison said, if we didn't have \nFederal law as the supreme law of the land, essentially the authority \nof the whole country--the elected officials, the President, the \nCongress, those serving in the Federal Government--the laws of the \ncountry would be made subordinate to the parts of the country--the \ncities, the counties, the States--that essentially defy Federal law, \nand our system would be in chaos.\n  Indeed, what our colleagues across the aisle appear to have ratified \nhere is not one Nation under the law, but a confederation of different \njurisdictions that can pick and choose what laws they want to comply \nwith. That is a recipe for chaos.\n  One of the reasons I think the American people are so angry with what \nthey see happening in Washington these days--indeed, I think they have \nmoved beyond anger to fear. They are fearful for the future of our \ncountry. When we see individual cities and States effectively nullify \nFederal law by refusing to cooperate or saying: We don't care what the \nFederal Government says; we are going to impose our own will, this is a \nrecipe for chaos and for the very fabric of our country to unravel.\n  At different points in our Nation's history we have had States which \nsaid: We aren't going to respect Federal law; we are going to nullify \nit, in effect. That is what these cities that defy the Federal \nauthorities and the supremacy of Federal law are doing. They are saying \nwe don't have to comply with the law, and so the American people--I \nthink out of apprehension over what they see happening here when \nStates, cities, and other jurisdictions decide to pick and choose which \nlaws will apply--realize this is a recipe for disunity and, in this \ncase, for danger.\n\n  The people whom we are fighting for are families and communities that \nwant to live in peace and safety in their local communities. That is \nwhat this legislation is about. This legislation, of course, is called \nStop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Act. All it does, simply \nstated, is to restore law and order across the country and to hold \ncertain cities that want to defy Federal law accountable. It would \nlimit Federal funding for State and local governments that refuse to \ncooperate. Basically, the Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans \nAct encourages compliance with Federal law, as I said a moment ago, and \nuses the power of the purse to withhold Federal funds from those \njurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with the Federal law. The goal, \nas I said, is to protect our communities from those who would pose a \ndanger to our society. It does not target legal immigrants who seek to \nlive a law-abiding and productive life here.\n  Frankly, I do not understand the Democrats'--with the exception of \ntwo who voted to get on this legislation and offer amendments and \nconstructive suggestions--refusal to move this legislation forward, \nbecause it harms the public safety and it causes our country to become \na confederation of different jurisdictions that can pick and choose \nwhich laws they want to enforce.\n  I mentioned one terrible incident over the summer, the murder of Kate \nSteinle in San Francisco by an illegal immigrant with a known and \nlengthy criminal record. This is just one example. This sad story \npoignantly demonstrates the consequences of the administration's abject \nfailure when it comes to enforcing our immigration laws. People get \nhurt. People get killed. This legislation would address the root cause \nof this tragedy by targeting criminal aliens and those local entities \nthat refuse to do anything to help the Kate Steinles of the world, and \nit would specifically serve to counter the policies of those city \ngovernments, such as San Francisco, that are known to shield criminal \naliens from deportation. They openly defy the 1996 Federal law that \nrequires information sharing. They openly refuse to cooperate with \nFederal orders and detainers and to notify the Federal Government when \npeople are released from their jail sentence even though they know \nthere is an outstanding deportation order pending.\n  This bill also extends the mandatory minimum sentence for those who \nattempt to reenter the country after being removed for breaking our \nlaws. Time and again we are met with the tragic news of some other \nAmerican citizen who was killed, injured or assaulted by somebody who \nhas reentered the country, after being removed for violating our laws, \nand keeps coming back and committing other criminal acts.\n  We need to send a clear signal to those who attempt to enter our \ncountry illegally and violate and ignore our laws that they will have \nto answer for them and certainly will not be allowed to come back.\n  Some have rightly noted that this bill is not about immigration \nreform, and I agree. This bill is simply about enforcing our current \nlaw and holding those jurisdictions that refuse to comply with current \nlaw accountable by withholding Federal funds.\n  This legislation underscores the concept that, unbelievably, has been \nlost among municipalities across the country. Despite what the current \nadministration might have us think, upholding the Federal law is not a \nsuggestion. It is a legal requirement for all of us. We can't, in good \nfaith, ask the American people to trust us when it comes to reforming \nour broken immigration system until they see us willing to stand up and \nenforce the laws that are currently on the books and hold those \njurisdictions, municipalities, States, and other local entities that \nrefuse to comply with Federal law accountable. That\n\n[[Page S7326]]\n\nis why organizations such as the National Sheriffs' Association and the \nNational Association of Police Organizations have voiced their support \nfor this legislation.\n  To sum up, the Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Act \nreally serves as a confidence-building exercise for Congress. If the \nAmerican people don't see us actually stepping up and demanding that \nlocal jurisdictions enforce current law, how can they expect us to pass \ncomplex immigration reform legislation to address our broken \nimmigration system? Unfortunately, in this confidence-building \nexercise, the Senate, led by our colleagues across the aisle, has \nfailed in that confidence-building exercise. What they have done is to \nreinforce the belief that there are Members of the Senate who believe \nthat local jurisdictions can openly defy Federal law and there will be \nno recourse and no accountability.\n  Frankly, it is hard for me to understand how our Democratic \ncolleagues can, in good conscience, block this legislation, given some \nof the horrific crimes that have occurred, such as the crime that was \ncommitted against Kate Steinle in San Francisco. There are many, many, \nmany tragic examples of this happening over and over in our country. \nThis was our opportunity to do something about it, but unfortunately, \nfor reasons unbeknownst to me, our Democratic colleagues will not even \nallow us to pass a bill which will hold jurisdictions that refuse to \nenforce current Federal law accountable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, this week we have been discussing and \ntaking up legislation to address the problem of sanctuary cities. In \nfact, just earlier today, we had a procedural vote on a motion to \nproceed to actually get on the bill. It failed. It only had 54 votes. \nThe threshold in the Senate to get on a bill is 60 votes. Democrats \nhere in the Senate decided to block consideration of this bill and to \nhave that 60-vote threshold in play, and as a consequence, it failed. \nWe had 54 votes. I think only two Democratic Senators voted to proceed \nto this legislation, and I would argue that is very unfortunate because \nthis is a piece of legislation which represents common sense and what I \nthink the American people want us to be focused on when it comes to the \nissue of dealing with crime in our communities and illegal immigration \nin a way that ensures that those who come to this country and commit \ncrimes aren't allowed to stay here.\n  According to the Department of Homeland Security, there are 334 \njurisdictions across our country right now that have official policies \ndiscouraging cooperation with Federal immigration enforcement officers. \nAmong other things, that means these jurisdictions regularly ignore \nwhat are called detainers, requests from the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to hold an individual for deportation. As a city prepares to \nrelease an illegal immigrant who has been convicted of or charged with \na crime, the Department of Homeland Security will send a detainer \nasking that the individual be held for a brief period--usually 48 \nhours--until Federal immigration officers can take custody.\n  In a majority of the cities across the country, law enforcement would \nsimply comply with this request and hold the individual until the \nDepartment of Homeland Security can arrive, but in sanctuary cities \nofficials regularly ignore these requests and simply release these \nindividuals from jail and back into the population at large--a practice \nthat has resulted in the release of approximately 1,000 undocumented \ncriminals per month. According to information from U.S. Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement, 9,295 imprisoned individuals whom Federal \nofficials sought to deport were released into the population between \nJanuary 1 and September 30 of last year. They released 9,295 imprisoned \nindividuals in just 9 months. Of those 9,295 individuals, 5,947, or 62 \npercent, had a significant prior criminal history or presented a threat \nto public safety even before the arrest that preceded their release, \nand many went on to be arrested again within a short period of time.\n  There is a terrible human cost to sanctuary cities' decision to \nrefuse to cooperate with U.S. immigration law. There has been a lot of \ndiscussion on the floor about Kate Steinle. Kate Steinle paid that cost \nwhen she was murdered on a San Francisco pier while walking with her \nfather on July 1, 2015. She was shot by an undocumented immigrant who \nhad been convicted of no fewer than seven felonies--seven felonies--\nprior to the decision of the city of San Francisco to ignore a request \nfrom the Department of Homeland Security and then go on and release \nthis man into the population.\n  Unfortunately, Kate Steinle is not alone. Marilyn Pharis of Santa \nMaria, CA, was raped and then bludgeoned by an undocumented immigrant \nwho had previously been arrested for battery but had been released \nafter the local sheriff's office decided to ignore a request to detain \nhim until he could be taken into Federal custody.\n  A 2-year-old California girl--a 2-year-old--was brutally beaten by \nher mother's boyfriend, an undocumented immigrant with felony drug and \ndrunk driving convictions, who was released on bail after the crime \ndespite a request from Federal officials that he be detained.\n  In 2011, Dennis McCann was killed when he was hit and dragged by a \ncar driven by a drunk driver with a blood alcohol content nearly four \ntimes the legal limit. His killer turned out to be Saul Chavez, an \nundocumented immigrant with a prior drunk driving conviction. After \nDennis McCann's death, the Department of Homeland Security filed a \nrequest asking that Immigration and Customs Enforcement be notified if \nChavez was scheduled to be released. Cook County, however, chose to \nignore this request, and after being released on bail, Dennis's killer \napparently fled the country. Four years later, Dennis's family is still \nwaiting to see justice done.\n  Unfortunately, I could go on and on. Decisions to release \nundocumented immigrants convicted of crimes, instead of detaining them \nfor Federal officials, have resulted in far too many tragedies like \nthose of Marilyn Pharis and Kate Steinle, and too many families in this \ncountry are mourning as a result.\n  Cooperation between local and Federal law enforcement is essential to \nprotecting Americans, and detainer requests from the Department of \nHomeland Security are a key tool that helps Federal officials make sure \ndangerous individuals are not going back onto our Nation's streets.\n  When cities and counties ignore these requests, they force \nimmigration officers to attempt to track down undocumented criminals \nafter they have been released into the community. According to the \nCenter for Immigration Studies, this requires an exponentially larger \nexpenditure of funds and manpower and success is not guaranteed. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement needs the support of cities and \nlocal law enforcement if it is going to keep these individuals off our \nNation's streets.\n  The legislation we have been discussing today would take a \nsubstantial step forward toward handling the threat posed by sanctuary \ncities. The Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Act, which \nhas strong support from law enforcement organizations and victims' \nfamilies, will withhold Federal funds under three grant programs and \nredirect those funds to jurisdictions that comply with Federal \nimmigration laws. It will also provide crucial legal protections to law \nenforcement officers that will allow them to cooperate with Federal \nimmigration authorities without the fear of lawsuits.\n  This act also incorporates provisions known as Kate's Law, named \nafter Kate Steinle. These provisions would increase the maximum penalty \nfor illegally reentering the United States after being deported and \ncreate a maximum penalty of 10 years for reentering the country \nillegally after being deported three or more times. Kate's Law would \nalso create a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years for those \nreentering the country after having been convicted of an aggravated \nfelony prior to deportation or for those who reenter the country after \ntwo previous convictions for illegal reentry.\n\n[[Page S7327]]\n\n  What happened to Kate Steinle on that pier in San Francisco should \nnever have happened. It likely could have been prevented if San \nFrancisco had chosen to respect the Department of Homeland Security's \nrequest to hold her killer until immigration officers could pick him \nup.\n  I hope the stop sanctuary policies act will move forward in the \nSenate so we will be able to send a version of this legislation to the \nPresident. It is time we started ensuring that dangerous criminals like \nKate Steinle's killer don't end up back on the streets. We have that \nopportunity today. We ought to vote to move to this bill.\n  What is truly remarkable and amazing is that we couldn't even get on \nthe bill to debate it. It was blocked by our colleagues on the other \nside who prevented even proceeding to the bill--a motion to proceed, \nwhich takes 60 votes in the Senate. It would have been very easy to get \non the bill and at least have that debate. If they didn't like the \nprovisions in the bill, they would have an opportunity to amend it and \ndiscuss the bill as we should be doing in the Senate, but instead the \nDemocratic Senators chose to block the consideration, even the very \nconsideration of legislation that would go to great lengths to try and \nprevent the types of tragedies we witnessed this last summer with Kate \nSteinle and so many others who have fallen prey to acts of violence by \nthose who are here illegally and have prior experience with the law, \nprior convictions, and who are clear dangers to people and families all \nacross this country.\n  It is a tragedy we weren't able to get on the bill. I hope our \nDemocratic colleagues will change their minds and allow us to proceed \nto this legislation, to debate it, to vote on it, to pass it, and to \nsend it to the President for his signature.\n\n\n                 Cybersecurity Information Sharing Bill\n\n  Mr. President, I also wish to speak in support of S. 754, which I \nthink we will be discussing momentarily, the Cybersecurity Information \nSharing Act, or what is referred to as CISA, which the Senate is going \nto be debating this week. I commend Chairman Burr and Vice Chairman \nFeinstein for their bipartisan work to bring this bill to the floor.\n  It seems that every week we learn of another serious cyber attack \nagainst U.S. businesses and government agencies. The most devastating \nrecent attack is the one against the Office of Personnel Management \nthat compromised the background check information of more than 21 \nmillion Americans. The pace of such attacks appears to be accelerating. \nAccording to the security firm Symantec, last year alone, more than 300 \nmillion new types of malicious software or computer viruses were \nintroduced on the Web or nearly, if my colleagues can believe this, 1 \nmillion new threats each and every day.\n  Just last month, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper \ntestified before the House Intelligence Committee that ``cyber threats \nto U.S. national and economic security are increasing in frequency, \nscale, sophistication, and severity of impact.''\n  From my position as head of the Senate commerce committee, I have \npromoted the great potential of the emerging Internet of Things--which \npromises to yield improvements in convenience, efficiency, and safety \nby connecting everyday products to the Web--but I have also held \nseveral hearings on the cyber security risks and challenges that \naccompany an increasingly connected world. By increasing the sharing of \ncyber threat information between and among the private and public \nsectors, the bill would authorize the voluntary sharing of cyber threat \ninformation and would provide commonsense liability protections for \ncompanies that share such information with the government or their \npeers, when they abide by the bill's requirements. The goal is to help \ncompanies and the government better protect their networks from \nmalicious cyber attacks by sharing information about those threats \nearlier and more broadly.\n  Similar bipartisan legislation was reported by the Senate \nIntelligence Committee last year that was never considered by the \nDemocratic-controlled Senate at the time. This year the Intelligence \nCommittee passed a bill by a bipartisan vote of 14 to 1, which should \nportend a strong bipartisan vote on the floor of the Senate.\n  The House of Representatives has also passed two bills to facilitate \nthe sharing of cyber threats, so we are now within striking distance of \nfinally enacting critical cyber security information-sharing \nlegislation after several false starts in recent years.\n  I know some have questioned whether this bill provides appropriate \nprotections for personal privacy and civil liberties. I appreciate \nthese concerns, and I believe the bill's sponsors have meaningfully \naddressed them, including through modifications to be included in a \nmanagers' amendment.\n  This bill is not a surveillance bill. Among other things, the \nmodified bill would limit the sharing of information to that defined as \n``cyber threat indicators'' and ``defensive measures'' taken to detect, \nprevent or mitigate cyber security threats.\n  The bill also requires private sector and Federal entities to remove \npersonally identifiable information prior to sharing threat indicators, \nand the Federal Government can only use the cyber threat information it \nreceives for cyber security purposes and to address a narrow set of \ncrimes, such as the sexual exploitation of children.\n  The bill also requires regular oversight of the government's sharing \nactivities by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board created \nafter \n9/11 and by relevant agency inspectors general.\n  In the end, it is important to remember that CISA is about cyber \nthreats--like the malware being used by criminals in hostile states--\nnot personal information. Meanwhile, failing to enact this bill could \nactually make it easier for criminals in rogue states to continue \ncollecting our personal information from vulnerable systems.\n  Let me be clear. This is not a silver bullet and it will not render \ncyberspace completely safe--no bill can do that--but CISA is an \nimportant piece of the ongoing effort to improve our cyber security.\n  Late last year, after a decade without passing major cyber security \nlegislation, Congress enacted five cyber security laws that target \nother pieces of the cyber puzzle. I coauthored one of these--the \nCybersecurity Enhancement Act--with former Senator Jay Rockefeller. \nThis law ensures the continuation of a voluntary and private sector-led \nprocess at the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards \nand Technology, or what we refer to as NIST, to identify best practices \nto protect our Nation's critical infrastructure from cyber threats. The \nCybersecurity Enhancement Act also promotes cutting-edge research, \npublic awareness of cyber security risks, and improvements in our cyber \nsecurity workforce.\n  CISA will work together with this new law and others to ensure that \nbusinesses have timely warning about current threats so they can better \nprotect themselves--and all of us--from cyber attacks. It does so in a \nmanner that protects individual privacy and avoids government mandates.\n  I look forward to the coming debate on the bill--including a healthy \nconsideration of amendments--and I urge my colleagues to join the \nbipartisan sponsors and a broad coalition of stakeholders around this \ncountry in supporting this much needed legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, since we are still on the sanctuaries bill, \nbefore we turn to the cyber legislation, I ask unanimous consent that I \nbe allowed to address the Senate after Chairman Burr has completed his \nremarks and after Ranking Member Feinstein has completed her remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, we are quickly moving to a point where I \nthink the majority leader will come to the floor and will call up the \ncyber security bill.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that we have been on the floor briefly \nbefore, and the conclusion then was that we agreed to a unanimous \nconsent request that made in order 22 amendments. It was not a limiting \nUC. So there is the opportunity for additional amendments to come to \nthe floor.\n  As we start, I say to my colleagues that if we have a level of \ncooperation\n\n[[Page S7328]]\n\nby the Members--if in fact they come, debate, and vote on amendments--\nwe can resolve this in literally a matter of a couple of days. If \npeople want to try to obstruct, then it is going to be a lengthy \nprocess procedurally.\n  I don't think there is a lot new that we are going to learn. What is \nthe fact? The fact is that actors around the world continue to attack \nU.S. systems and, in many cases, penetrate them: Sony Films, Anthem \nHealth, OPM.\n  The Presiding Officer, as a member of our committee, knows that the \namount of personal data that is being accumulated out there somewhere \nprovides almost a roadmap to everything about anybody. What we are \nattempting to do with this cyber bill I want the American people to \nunderstand: This is not to prevent cyber attacks. I would love to \nfigure out technologically how we do it. Nobody has been able to do it. \nWhat this is designed to do is to minimize the data that is lost, to \nminimize the personal information that an individual gleans out of \ngoing into a database and pulling out that information.\n  The vice chairman and I have worked with other members of the \ncommittee to report a bill out of the committee on a 14-to-1 vote. We \nare now almost 3 months behind the House of Representatives, which has \npassed two bills that we desperately need to get out of the Senate in a \npiece of legislation that we could conference with the House of \nRepresentatives. In a conversation just this morning that I had with \nthe White House, they are supportive of this bill getting out of the \nSenate and having the bill on the President's desk so that he could \nsign it into law and we could have this in place.\n\n  Let me make some overall points on the cyber bill. One, most \nimportantly, it is voluntary. Any business in America can choose to \nparticipate or not to participate. They can tell the Federal Government \nthat they have been penetrated. They can provide the appropriate data \nfor us to begin the forensics and to tell them in real time: Here is a \ndefensive software package you can put on your system that will make it \nimmune from that tool again. But more importantly, it might minimize \nthe amount of data that is lost and certainly would allow the \ngovernment to then broadcast to business more widely: Here is the tool \nthat is being used today and here is the defensive mechanism to keep \nother businesses from having the same penetration and data loss.\n  Now, it is important that I say that when we started there were 22 \namendments that were placed in order. I am proud to tell my colleagues \nthat we have worked out eight of those amendments. They will be \nincorporated in a managers' amendment that will also have an additional \nsix amendments that we think strengthen the concerns that have been \nexpressed about privacy. They also address certain areas of cross-\njurisdiction, such as the Department of Homeland Security. We now have \nthose chairmen and those ranking members fully on board in support of \nthis legislation. Now we have to go through the process. At the root of \nthis is moving forward a piece of legislation on cyber that is a \nvoluntary piece of legislation by companies.\n  I mentioned real time. I know the Presiding Officer has heard this in \ncommittee. If we can't promise real time, we can't promise to anybody \nwho is willing to provide the data that we can actually stop or \nminimize data loss. So it is absolutely crucial that this all function \nin real time. To have a voluntary program that involves real time \ntransfer of information means that there have to be incentives for that \nto be done.\n  Let me just point out two things. For a company to talk to a \ncompetitor after they have been attacked and penetrated, we provide \nantitrust protection to them to talk directly to that competitor as \nfast as they possibly can to find out whether we have multiple systems \nthat are at risk. For the company to report to the Federal Government \nwe provide liability protection just for the transfer of that \ninformation. As Members read the bill, they will see that statutorily \nwe don't allow personal data that is unrelated to the forensics--needed \nto identify who did the attack, with what type of a tool, and what the \ndefensive mechanism is--that statutorily cannot be transferred from a \nprivate company to the government. Additionally, we say to every \nFederal agency that might receive in real time this data that if there \nis personal data that is transmitted from a company to the Federal \nGovernment, you cannot distribute personal data.\n  I am not sure how it gets stronger than where we are, but I have come \nto this conclusion after working on this legislation for this entire \nyear--and the vice chairman has worked on it for multiple years: There \nare some people who don't want legislation. We have met with every \nperson who had a good thought--legislation that would send us in a \npositive direction but still embrace the policy found in this \nlegislation. It is limited, but there are some who we can't in fact \nsatisfy.\n  So let me say this to those companies that have expressed opposition \nto this piece of legislation. It is really clear. Choose not to \nparticipate. It is voluntary. To those companies that find no value in \nit, if you have an aversion to what we have written, don't \nparticipate--even though a majority of businesses in America are \nactually calling my office and the vice chairman's office saying: When \nare we going to get this done? We need this. We need it.\n  It is that simple. That is the beauty of it being voluntary. \nVoluntary also means that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is 100 percent \nsupportive of this legislation. Now we never have full agreement from a \nmembership of an association, but it takes a majority--in fact, it \ntakes well over a majority--for an organization such as that to come \nout publicly supporting it. So I say very boldly, if you don't like the \npiece of legislation, it is real easy: You just don't participate in \nit.\n  Some have called this a surveillance bill. Let me just knock that \ndown real quick. First, this bill requires private companies and the \ngovernment to eliminate any irrelevant personal, identifiable \ninformation before sharing cyber threat indicators or defensive \nmeasures. Second, this bill does not allow the government to monitor \nprivate networks or computers. Third, this bill does not allow the \ngovernment to shut down Web sites or require companies to turn over \npersonal information. Fourth, this bill does not permit the government \nto retain or use cyber threat information for anything other than cyber \nsecurity purposes, identifying the cyber security threat, protecting \nindividuals from death or serious bodily or economic harm, and \nprotecting minors or investigating limited cyber crime offenses. Fifth, \nit provides rigorous oversight and requires a periodic interagency \ninspector general report to assess whether the government has violated \nany of the requirements found in this act. The report would also assess \nany impact this bill may have on privacy and civil liberties.\n  Finally, our managers' amendment has incorporated additional \nprovisions that enhance privacy protection. First, our managers' \namendment omitted the government's ability to use cyber information to \ninvestigate or prosecute serious violent felonies.\n  Personally, I thought that was a pretty good thing. I can understand \nwhere it is outside of the scope of a cyber bill, but information about \na felony that you learned in this I thought was something the American \npeople would want us to act on. Individuals raised issues on it. We \ndropped it out of the bill.\n  Secondly, our managers' amendment limited cyber threat information \nsharing authorities to those that are shared for cyber security \npurposes. In other words, it is only for cyber security purposes.\n  Both of these changes ensure that nothing in our bill reaches beyond \nthe focused cyber security threats that it intends to prevent and \ndeter. Nothing in this bill creates any potential for surveillance \nauthorities. Despite rumors to the contrary, CISA's voluntary cyber \nthreat indicator sharing authorities do not provide in any way for the \ngovernment to spy on or use library and book records, gun sales, tax \nrecords, educational records or medical records. Given that cyber \nhackers have hacked into and stolen so much publicly disclosed private, \npersonal information, it is astounding that privacy groups would oppose \na bill that has nothing to do with surveillance and seeks to protect \ntheir private information from being stolen. I guess that has been the \nmost troubling aspect of the road we have traveled--that we are trying \nto protect personal data, and yet\n\n[[Page S7329]]\n\nthe groups that say they are the stewards of personal data are the ones \nthat, in fact, are the most vocal on this.\n  CISA ensures the government cannot install, employ or otherwise use \ncyber security systems on private sector networks. No one can hack back \ninto a company computer system even if their purpose is to protest \nagainst or quash cyber attacks.\n  The government cannot retain or use cyber threat information for \nanything other than cyber security purposes; preventing, investigating, \ndisrupting or prosecuting limited cyber crimes; protecting minors; and \nprotecting individuals from death or serious bodily or economic harm. \nThe government cannot use cyber threat information in regulatory \nproceedings.\n  That is what we are here talking about. This is voluntary and it is \ntargeted at minimizing data loss. It is targeted at trying to protect \nthe personal data of the American people found in every database in \nevery company around the world.\n  Mr. President, I am going to turn to my vice chairman as we get ready \nfor Senator Wyden to make remarks and for leader McConnell to come to \nthe floor.\n  I would put Members on notice once again. It is our intent to have \nsome opening comments, to actually make the managers' amendment \npending, to make those amendments that were part of the unanimous \nconsent agreement but not worked out as part of the managers' package \npending.\n  I encourage those Members who have authorship of those pending \namendments to come and debate them, and we will schedule a vote for \nthem. If you have additional amendments, come and offer those \namendments and we will start debate on it. It is our goal, with the \ncooperation of Members, to work expeditiously through all of the \namendments one wants to consider and to dispose of them and to finalize \ncyber security legislation in the Senate so we can move to the House \nand conference a bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to begin by saying that I very \nmuch agree with what Chairman Burr has just stated. It is factual. It \nis the truth.\n  For me, I have worked on this issue for 7 years now. And this is \nactually the third bill that we have tried to move.\n  I want to thank the two leaders for bringing the bill to the floor, \nand I hope it can be considered quickly.\n  Up front I want to make clear, if it hasn't been made clear, that \nthis legislation is a first step only to improve our Nation's defenses \nagainst cyber attack and cyber intrusion. It is not a panacea, and it \nwill not end our vulnerabilities. But it is the most effective first \nlegislative step we believe that we can take.\n  This legislation is about providing legal clarity and legal \nprotection so that companies can share cyber threat information \nvoluntarily with each other and with the government. It provides \ncompanies the protections they need and puts strong privacy rules in \nplace.\n  At the beginning of this debate, I think it is important to talk \nabout the depth and breadth of the cyber threat we actually face every \nday, because rarely does a month go by without the announcement of a \nsignificant cyber attack or intrusion on an American company or an \nagency of the U.S. Government. These attacks compromise sensitive \npersonal information, intellectual property or both.\n  Just in the last year, major banks, health insurers, tech companies, \nand retailers have seen tens of millions of their customers' sensitive \ndata stolen through cyber means. In 2014 the Internet security company \nSymantec reported that over 348 million identities were exposed through \ndata breaches. Threats in cyber space do not just risk the personal \ndata of Americans. They are a significant and growing drain on our \neconomy as malicious actors steal our money, rob companies of \nintellectual property, and threaten our ability to innovate.\n  The cyber security company McAfee and the think tank Center for \nStrategic and International Studies estimated last year that the cost \nof cyber crime is more than $400 billion annually. The same study \nstated that losses from cyber theft could cost the United States as \nmany as 200,000 jobs. These are not theoretical risks; they are \nhappening today and every day.\n  As we know all too well in the wake of cyber intrusions at the Office \nof Personnel Management, cyber threats are not only aimed against the \nprivate sector. They are also aimed against the public sector. Every \nday, foreign nation-states and cyber criminals scour U.S. Government \nsystems and our defense industrial base for information on government \nprograms and personnel--every single day.\n  More than 22 million government employees and security clearance \napplicants had massive amounts of personal information stolen from the \nOffice of Personnel Management, reportedly taken by China. These \nemployees now face increased risk of theft and fraud, and also their \ninformation could be used for intelligence operations against them and \nthe United States.\n\n  As bad as this is--and it is bad--we have seen in the last few years \nan acceleration of an even more concerning trend, that of cyber attack \ninstead of just cyber theft. In 2012 major U.S. financial institutions \nsaw an unprecedented wave of denial-of-service attacks on their \nsystems.\n  Saudi Aramco--reported to be the world's largest oil and gas \ncompany--was the victim of a cyber attack that wiped out a reported \nthree-quarters of its corporate computers. In 2013 we saw further \nescalations of these threats as waves of denial-of-service attacks were \naimed at some of our largest banks. In early 2014 Iran launched a cyber \nattack on the Sands Casino which, according to the public testimony of \nthe Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, rendered \nthousands of computer systems inoperable. Last November we saw one of \nthe most publicized cyber attacks when North Korean attacks broke into \nSony Pictures Entertainment, stole vast amounts of sensitive and \npersonal data, and destroyed the company's internal network.\n  These breaches of personal information and loss of intellectual \nproperty and destructive attacks continue online every day. It is only \na matter of time before America's critical infrastructure--major banks, \nthe electric grid, dams, waterways, the air traffic control system, and \nothers--is targeted for a cyber attack that could seriously affect \nhundreds of thousands of lives.\n  Clearly it is well beyond the time to act. There is no legislative or \nadministrative step we can take that will end cyber crimes and cyber \nwarfare. However, since the Intelligence Committee began looking \nseriously at this in 2008, we have heard consistently that improving \nthe exchange of information about cyber threats and cyber \nvulnerabilities can yield a real and significant improvement to U.S. \ncyber security. That is why this bill is the top cyber legislative \npriority for the Congress, the Obama administration, and the business \ncommunity.\n  I have heard directly from dozens of corporate executives about the \nimportance of cyber security legislation, as have the Intelligence \nCommittee staff in hundreds of meetings over the course of years in \ndrafting this legislation. As Chairman Burr has said, not only has the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce called for this legislation but so have \ndozens--specifically 52--of industry groups representing some of the \nlargest sectors of our economy. On the floor in early August, I listed \n40 associations that have written in support of the legislation. Today \nthere are 52.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of supporters of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act\n\n\n                              Endorsements\n\n       Agricultural Retailers Association, Airlines for America, \n     Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, American Bankers \n     Association, American Cable Association, American Chemistry \n     Council, American Coatings Association, American Fuel & \n     Petrochemical Manufacturers, American Gaming Association, \n     American Gas Association, American Insurance Association \n     American Petroleum Institute.\n       American Public Power Association, American Water Works \n     Association, ASIS International, Association of American \n     Railroads, Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, BITS--\n     Financial Services Roundtable, College of Healthcare \n     Information Management,\n\n[[Page S7330]]\n\n     Computing Technology Industry Association, Executives \n     Computing Technology Industry Association, Edison Electric \n     Institute, Electronic Payments Coalition, Electronic \n     Transactions Association, Federation of American Hospitals, \n     Food Marketing Institute.\n       Global Automakers, GridWise Alliance, Healthcare \n     Information and Management Systems Society, Health \n     Information Trust Alliance, Large Public Power Council, \n     National Association of Chemical Distributors, National \n     Association of Manufacturers, National Association of Mutual \n     Insurance Companies, National Association of Water Companies, \n     National Business Coalition on e-Commerce & Privacy, National \n     Cable & Telecommunications Association, National Retail \n     Federation.\n       National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, Property \n     Casualty Insurers Association of America, Real Estate \n     Roundtable, Retail Industry Leaders Association, Rural \n     Broadband Association, Security Industry Association, \n     Software & Information Industry Association, Society of \n     Chemical Manufacturers & Affiliates, Telecommunications \n     Industry Association, Transmission Access Policy Study Group, \n     United States Telecom Association, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \n     Utilities Telecom Council, Wireless Association.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, regrettably this is the third attempt \nto pass a cyber security information sharing bill in recent years. In \n2012 the Lieberman-Collins Cybersecurity Act of 2012 was on the floor. \nIt included a title on information sharing which the Intelligence \nCommittee helped produce. It was an important piece of legislation, but \nit only received one Republican vote.\n  Last Congress, then-vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee Saxby \nChambliss and I set out to draft a narrower bill just on information \nsharing in the hopes of attracting bipartisan support. The Intelligence \nCommittee approved a bill in 2014 by a strong bipartisan vote of 12 to \n3, but it never reached the Senate floor due to privacy concerns. So \nthis is the third try.\n  I am very pleased that Chairman Burr and I now have the opportunity \nto bring a bill to the floor that both sides can and should support. \nThis bill is bipartisan. It is narrowly focused. It puts in place a \nnumber of privacy protections, many of which we will outline shortly. I \nbelieve the bipartisan vote of 14 to 1 in the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee in March underscores this fact. I would like to commend \nSenator Burr's leadership and his willingness to negotiate a bipartisan \nbill with me that can and should--and I hope will--receive a strong \nvote in the Senate. Let me take a few minutes to describe the main \nfeatures of the bill and its privacy protections.\n  In short, it does the following five things:\n  First, the bill recognizes that the Federal Government has \ninformation about cyber threats that it can and should share with the \nprivate sector and with State, local, and tribal governments. The bill \nrequires the Director of National Intelligence to put in place a \nprocess to increase the sharing of information on cyber threats already \nin the government's hands with the private sector to help protect an \nindividual or a business. So that is the sharing between the government \nand the private sector. This includes sharing classified data with \nthose with security clearances and an appropriate need to know but also \nrequires the DNI to set up a process to declassify more information to \nhelp all companies secure their networks. We have heard over and over \nagain from companies that the information they get from the government \ntoday is not sufficient. That needs to change.\n  Second, the bill provides clear authorization for private sector \nentities to take appropriate actions. That includes an authorization \nfor a company to monitor its networks or information on its networks \nfor cyber security purposes only. No other type of monitoring is \npermitted, nor is the use of information acquired through such \nmonitoring allowed for purposes other than cyber security.\n  There is also an authorization for a company to implement a defensive \nmeasure on its network to detect, prevent, or mitigate a cyber threat. \nThis authorization by definition does not authorize a defensive measure \nthat destroys, renders unusable, or substantially harms a computer \nsystem or information on someone else's network. This is an important \npoint. There has been concern that the bill would immunize a company \nfor damage it might cause to other people's networks. The managers' \namendment makes clear that the authorization in this bill allows \ncompanies to block malicious traffic coming from outside their network \nand stop threats on their systems but not conduct offensive activities \nor otherwise have substantial effects off their networks.\n  Finally, there is an authorization for companies to share limited \ncyber threat information or defensive measures with other companies or \nwith government agencies. It does not authorize sharing anything other \nthan cyber information. In a critical change, the managers' amendment \nstates that sharing is for cyber security purposes only. So this really \nis a very limited authorization.\n  It is important to note that while these activities are authorized, \nthey are not mandatory. Information sharing, monitoring, and use of \ndefensive measures are all voluntary. The bill makes explicit that \nthere are no requirements for a company to act or not to act.\n  I have heard from technology companies in the past couple of weeks \nthat they are concerned that this bill requires them to share customer \ninformation with the government. That is false. Companies can choose to \nparticipate or they can choose not to. If they do, they can only share \ncyber threat information, not their company's personal information or \ntheir online activity.\n  The third thing this bill does is it puts in place procedures and \nlimitations for how the government will receive, handle, and use cyber \ninformation provided by the private sector. The bill requires two sets \nof policies and procedures. The first set--to be written by the \nAttorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security--requires that \ncyber information that comes to the Federal Government will be made \navailable to all appropriate Federal departments and agencies without \nunnecessary delay and that the information sharing system inside the \ngovernment is auditable and is consistent with privacy safeguards.\n  The second set of required guidelines is designed to limit the \nprivacy impact of the sharing of cyber information and specifically \nlimits the government's receipt, retention, use, and dissemination of \npersonal information. These guidelines are to be written by the \nAttorney General. They will be made public.\n  The bill specifically limits the use of cyber information by the \ngovernment. Federal agencies can only use the information received \nthrough this bill for a cyber security purpose, for the purpose of \nidentifying a cyber threat, preventing or responding to an imminent \nthreat of death, serious bodily harm, serious economic harm, including \nan imminent terrorist attack, preventing or responding to a serious \nthreat of harm to a minor, and preventing, investigating, or \nprosecuting specific cyber-related crimes.\n  Fourth, the bill creates what we call in shorthand a portal at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and requires that cyber information is \nreceived by the government through the Homeland Security portal, from \nwhich it can be distributed quickly and responsibly to appropriate \ndepartments and agencies. This portal was the joint proposal a few \nyears ago by former DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano, FBI Director Bob \nMueller, and NSA Director Keith Alexander. The purpose of the portal is \nto centralize the entry point for cyber information sharing so that the \ngovernment can effectively and efficiently receive that cyber \ninformation, can protect privacy, and can ensure that all the \nappropriate departments with cyber security responsibility can quickly \nlearn about threats.\n  A key aspect of this centralized portal is to enable information to \nmove where it needs to go automatically. Once cyber threat information \nenters the portal, it will be shared in real time--meaning without \nhuman intervention and at machine speed--to the other appropriate \nFederal agencies. The belief is that they can put in a filter and do a \nprivacy scrub, if you will, just in case there is any private \ninformation, such as a Social Security number, a driver's license \nnumber, or something like that, that can be instantly moved out.\n  Such a real-time exchange is necessary because if there are \nindications that a cyber attack is underway, the\n\n[[Page S7331]]\n\nresponse to stop that attack will need to be immediate and not subject \nto any delay. The bill makes clear that this can and should be done in \na way that ensures that privacy is protected, improving both privacy \nprotections and the ability to quickly protect sensitive systems.\n  Fifth and finally, the bill provides liability protection to \ncompanies that act in accord with the bill's provisions. Specifically, \nthe bill provides liability protection for companies that properly \nmonitor their computer networks or that share information the way the \nbill allows. The bill specifically does not protect companies from \nliability in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct, nor \ndoes it protect those who do not follow its privacy protections.\n  As I mentioned earlier, there are many privacy protections throughout \nthe bill. Because this is a key point of interest for a number of \nSenators, I wish to list 10 of them.\n  No. 1, it is voluntary. The bill doesn't require companies to do \nanything they choose not to do. There is no requirement to share \ninformation with another company or with the government, and the \ngovernment cannot compel any sharing by the private sector. So if there \nis this tech company or that tech company that doesn't want to provide \nthis information, don't do it. Nothing forces you to do it. This is 100 \npercent voluntary.\n  No. 2, it narrowly defines the term ``cyber threat indicator'' to \nlimit the amount of information that may be shared under the bill. Only \ninformation that is necessary to describe or identify cyber threats can \nbe shared.\n  No. 3, the authorizations are clear, but they are limited. Companies \nare fully authorized to do three things: monitor their networks or \nprovide monitoring services to their customers to identify cyber \nthreats, use limited defensive measures to protect against cyber \nthreats on their networks, and share and receive cyber information with \neach other and with Federal, State or local governments. No \nsurveillance, no sharing of personal or customer information is \nallowed.\n  No. 4, there are mandatory steps that companies must take before \nsharing any cyber threat information with other companies or the \ngovernment. Companies must review information before it is shared for \nirrelevant privacy information, and they are required to remove any \nsuch information that is found. A bank would not be able to share a \ncustomer's name or account information. Social Security numbers, \naddresses, passwords, and credit information would be unrelated to a \ncyber threat and would, except in very exceptional circumstances, be \nremoved by the company before sharing.\n  No. 5, the bill requires that the Attorney General establish \nmandatory guidelines to protect the privacy of any information the \ngovernment receives. These guidelines will be public. The guidelines \nwill limit how long the government can retain any information and \nprovide notification requirements and a process to destroy mistakenly \nshared information. It also requires the Attorney General to create \nsanctions for any government official who does not follow these \nmandatory privacy guidelines.\n  No. 6, the Department of Homeland Security, not the Department of \nDefense or the intelligence community, is the primary recipient of the \nshared cyber information.\n  No. 7, the managers' amendment includes a new provision, which was \nsuggested by Senator Carper, with the backing of a number of privacy \ngroups, to allow the Department of Homeland Security--and I say this \nagain--to scrub the data as it goes through the portal to make sure it \ndoes not contain irrelevant personal information.\n  No. 8, the bill restricts the government's use of voluntarily shared \ninformation to cyber security efforts, imminent threats to public \nsafety, protection of minors, and cyber crimes. Unlike previous \nversions, the government cannot use this information for general \ncounterterrorism analysis or to prosecute noncyber crimes.\n  No. 9, the bill limits liability protection to only monitoring for \ncyber threats and sharing information about them when a company \ncomplies with the bill's privacy requirements, and it explicitly \nexcludes protection for gross negligence or willful misconduct.\n  No. 10, above and beyond these mandatory protections, there are a \nnumber of oversight mechanisms in the bill which involve Congress, the \nheads of agencies, the inspectors general, and the Privacy and Civil \nLiberties Oversight Board.\n  In sum, this bill allows for strictly voluntary sharing of cyber \nsecurity information with many layers of privacy protections.\n  As I have noted, the managers' amendment that we will consider \nshortly, I hope, will include several key privacy protections. We will \nbe describing them in more detail when we turn to that amendment.\n  Mr. President, I hope this has made clear that we have tried to very \ncarefully balance the need for improved cyber security with the need to \nprotect privacy and private sector interests. As I said earlier, this \nis the third bill on information sharing. We have learned from the \nprior two efforts.\n  It is clear from the headlines and multiple data breach notifications \nthat customers and employees are now receiving that this bill is \nnecessary and we need to act now instead of after a major cyber attack \nseriously impacts hundreds or thousands of lives or costs us billions \nor trillions of dollars.\n  We have a good bill. I know there are some cynics. I know there are \nsome tech companies that may be worried about what their customers \nmight do. Then don't participate if you don't want to, but I have \ntalked to enough CEOs who have said to me: Please do this. We need this \nability to share, and the only way we can get this ability is with \nliability protection for sharing cyber threat material, so this is very \nimportant.\n  I again thank the chairman for everything he has done to lead this \neffort. It is my hope that we will have a good, civil debate and that \nwe will be able to pass this bill with a substantial margin.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this afternoon we begin the discussion of \ncyber security legislation. I think it is important to say at the \noutset that I think everybody who hears the notion that the Senate is \ntalking about cyber security would say: Boy, you have to be for that. \nWe all read about cyber hacks regularly, so you ask: Why not be for \nwhat they are talking about in the Senate?\n  I begin by way of saying that the fact is not every bill with cyber \nsecurity in the title is necessarily a good idea. I believe this bill \nwill do little to make Americans safer but will potentially reduce the \npersonal privacy of millions of Americans in a very substantial way. In \nthe beginning, I think it is particularly telling who opposes this \nlegislation at this time. The Business Software Alliance has said they \ncannot support this bill. They have members such as Apple, IBM, and \nMicrosoft, and they are saying that at this time they cannot be for \nthis bill. The Computer and Communications Industry Association has \nmembers such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon. They have said they \ncannot support the legislation at this time. America's librarians \ncannot support it at this time. Twitter cannot support it at this time. \nWikimedia Foundation and Yelp can't support it at this time.\n  The groups I am talking about are ones with members who have \ncompanies with millions and millions of customers, and they are saying \nthey can't support this bill at this time.\n  I think I know why these companies that didn't have a problem with \nprevious kinds of versions of this legislation are saying they don't \nsupport it. These companies are hearing from their customers and they \nare worried their customers are saying: This doesn't look like it is \ngoing to protect our privacy. Of course, we want to be safe. We also \nwant to have our liberty. Ben Franklin famously said anyone who gives \nup their liberty to have security really doesn't deserve either--so we \nknow what Americans want.\n  I would submit the reason these companies are coming out in \nopposition to this legislation is they don't want their customers to \nlose confidence in their products. They are looking at this \nlegislation, and they are saying the privacy protections are woefully \ninadequate and their customers are going to lose confidence in their \nproducts.\n  I appreciate that the managers are trying to make the bill better. It \nis\n\n[[Page S7332]]\n\nquite clear to me, having listened to two colleagues--whom I respect \nvery much--that they are very much aware that their bill has attracted \nwidespread opposition. The comment was made that Apple, Google, \neveryone should be for this.\n  I would say again--respectfully to my colleagues, the authors, with \nwhom I have served since we all came to the committee together--even \nwith the managers' amendment, the core privacy issues are not being \ndealt with.\n  I would just read now from a few of the comments--maybe I am missing \nsomething. Maybe I heard a list of all the privacy issues that had been \naddressed. I haven't seen any privacy groups the Democrats or \nRepublicans look to saying they support the privacy protections in the \nbill, but let me give you an example of a few who surely don't.\n  This is what Yelp says: ``Congress is trying to pass a `cyber \nsecurity' bill that threatens your privacy.''\n  This is what the American Library Association is saying. I will \nadmit, Mr. President, I am a little bit tilted toward librarians \nbecause my late mother was a librarian. We all appreciate the \nlibrarians we grew up with. The librarians say that this bill ``de \nfacto grants broad new mass data collection powers to many federal, as \nwell as state and even local government agencies.''\n  Salesforce, a major player in the digital space located in \nCalifornia, says:\n\n       At Salesforce, trust is our number one value and nothing is \n     more important to our company than the privacy of our \n     customers' data. . . . Salesforce does not support CISA and \n     has never supported CISA.\n\n  They have a hashtag.\n\n       Follow #StopCISA for updates.\n\n  This is the group that represents the Computer and Communications \nIndustry Association--this is Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, the \nbiggest major tech companies. Again, these are companies with millions \nof customers, and the companies are worried that this bill lacks \nprivacy protections and their customers are going to lose confidence in \nsome of what may be done under this. They say they support the goals, \nof course--which we all do--of dealing with real threats and sharing \ninformation. They state: ``But such a system should not come at the \nexpense of users' privacy, need not be used for purposes unrelated to \ncyber security, and must not enable activities that might actively \ndestabilize the infrastructure the bill aims to protect.''\n  Mr. President, we heard my colleague, the chair of the committee, a \nmember of the Committee on Finance whom I have worked with often, say \nthat the most important feature of the legislation is that it is \nvoluntary. The fact is that it is voluntary for companies. It will be \nmandatory for their customers. And the fact is that companies can \nparticipate without the knowledge and consent of their customers, and \nthey are immune from customer oversight and lawsuits if they do so. I \nam all for companies sharing information about malware and foreign \nhackers with the government, but there ought to be a strong requirement \nto filter out unrelated personal information about customers.\n  I want to emphasize this because this is probably my strongest point \nof disagreement with my friends who are the sponsors. There is not in \nthis bill a strong requirement to filter out unrelated personal \ninformation about these millions of customers who are going to be \naffected. This bill would allow companies to hand over a large amount \nof private and personal information about millions of their customers \nwith only a cursory review. In my judgment, information about those who \nhave been victims of hacks should not be treated in essentially the \nsame way as information about the hackers. Without a strong requirement \nto filter out unrelated personal information, that is unfortunately \nwhat this bill does.\n  At the outset of this discussion, we were told this bill would have \nsubstantial security benefits. I heard for days, for example, that this \nbill would have prevented the OPM attack, that it would have stopped \nthe serious attack on government personnel records. After technologists \nreviewed that particular argument, that claim has essentially been \nwithdrawn.\n  There is a saying now in the cyber security field: If you can't \nprotect it, don't collect it. If more personal consumer information \nflows to the government without strong protections, my view is it is \ngoing to end up being a prime target for hackers.\n  Sharing information about cyber security threats is clearly a worthy \ngoal, and I would like to find ways to encourage more of that \nresponsibly. Yet if you share more information without strong privacy \nprotections, millions of Americans will say: That is not a cyber \nsecurity bill; it is a surveillance bill. My hope is that, working in a \nbipartisan way, by the time we have completed this legislation on the \nfloor, that will not be the case.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I listened patiently to my friend and \ncolleague, and we are on the committee together, so this is not the \nfirst time we have had a frank discussion. But let me say to those \ncompanies that have reached out to him, and he listed them--I am not \ngoing to bother going through 53 associations and the number of \ncompanies that are represented because there are hundreds and hundreds. \nThey are sectors of our economy. It is the financial industry. It is \nautomotive. It is practically everybody in retail.\n  There are a couple of things that still shock me because I really \ncan't make the connection. A technology company has a tremendous amount \nof users, and those users put their personal data on that--pick one--\nand the company says there is nothing more important than protecting \nthe data of their users. It strikes me, because I was in business for \n17 years before I came to this insane place, that any business in the \nworld would say: I don't have a problem with putting this in place as \nlong as I don't have to use it. I can make a decision whether I use it \nor whether I don't.\n  It may be that when they get an opportunity to see the final product \nand it is in place, they may say: Well, you know what, this isn't so \nbad. This actually took care of some of the concerns we have.\n  But to make a blanket statement for a company whose No. 1 concern is \nthe protection of its customers' data--to ignore the threat today that \nis real and will be felt by everybody, if it hasn't been felt by them, \nand not have something in place is irresponsible by those companies.\n  Again, I point to the fact that if this were a mandatory program, I \ncould understand why they might, for market share reasons or marketing \nreasons, go out and say: We are not covered by this. But this is \nvoluntary for everybody. There is not a soul in the world who has to \nparticipate. But the ones that are really concerned about their \ncustomers' data, the ones that really understand there are companies, \nindividuals, and countries trying to hack their systems will succumb to \nthe fact that something is better than nothing.\n  It is sort of like going home to North Carolina--and I see the leader \nis coming--where this year we have had a rash of sharks. It is one \nthing to know there are sharks out there and swim and say: How could \none bite me? Well, you know you have hackers out there. It seems as if \nyou take precautions when you go swimming, and it seems as if you \nshould take precautions to keep from being hacked.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/20/senate-section/article/S7332-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7332-S7342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CYBERSECURITY INFORMATION SHARING ACT of 2015\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, let me add at this time that the vice \nchairman and I have worked aggressively, as have our staffs, to \nincorporate the suggestions and the concerns Members and companies have \nraised with us. If we believed they made the legislation stronger--\nstronger from the standpoint of minimizing data loss and stronger from \nthe standpoint of the privacy concerns--let me assure my colleagues we \nhave accepted those and we have incorporated them in the managers' \namendment. If, in fact, we couldn't agree or felt that it in any way \nwas detrimental to the legislation, the vice chair and I have agreed to \noppose those amendments.\n  I think it is important that this bill represent exactly what we have \nsold: an information sharing bill, a bill that is voluntary.\n  So I would suggest to those who hear this debate and say ``I don't \nreally understand all this cyber stuff. I hear about it and don't \nreally understand it,'' let me put it in these terms. What this \nlegislation does is it creates a community watch program, and like any \nneighborhood watch program, the spirit of what we are trying to do is \nto protect the neighborhood. It doesn't mean that every resident on \nevery street in that community in that neighborhood is going to be a \nparticipant, but it means that neighborhood is committed to making sure \nthat if crimes are happening, they are out there to stop them, to \nreport them, and maybe through reporting them, the number of crimes \nover time will continue to decrease.\n  Well, I would share with you that is what we are doing with the cyber \nsecurity bill. We are out now trying to set up the framework for a \ncommunity watch program, one that is voluntary, that doesn't require \nevery person to participate, but it says: For those of you who can \nembrace this and can report the crimes, it is not only beneficial to \nyou, it is beneficial to everybody.\n  So I respect the fact there are a few companies out there saying: \nThis is no good; we shouldn't have this. Really? Do you want to deny \nthis to everybody? There are a heck of a lot of businesses that have \nmade the determination that this is beneficial to their business, that \nit is beneficial to their sector.\n  This is beneficial to the overall U.S. economy. That is what the \nSenate is here to do. We are not here to pick winners and losers; we \nare here to create a framework everybody can operate in that advances \nthe United States in the right direction.\n  Shortly we will have an opportunity to make pending some additional \namendments, and I encourage all Members, if your amendment is pending, \nto come down and debate it. If you have additional amendments, please \ncome down and offer them and debate them. With the cooperation of \nMembers, we can process these in a matter of days and we can then send \nthis out of the Senate and be at a point where we could conference with \nthe House.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Madam President, I call up the Coons amendment No. \n2552, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment by number.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for Mr. \n     Coons, proposes an amendment numbered 2552, as modified, to \n     amendment No. 2716.\n\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To modify section 5 to require DHS to review all cyber threat \n  indicators and countermeasures in order to remove certain personal \n                              information)\n\n       Beginning on page 23, strike line 3 and all that follows \n     through page 33, line 10 and insert the following:\n       (3) Requirements concerning policies and procedures.--\n     Consistent with the guidelines required by subsection (b), \n     the policies and procedures developed and promulgated under \n     this subsection shall--\n       (A) ensure that cyber threat indicators shared with the \n     Federal Government by any entity pursuant to section 4 that \n     are received through the process described in subsection (c) \n     of this section and that satisfy the requirements of the \n     guidelines developed under subsection (b)--\n       (i) are shared in an automated manner with all of the \n     appropriate Federal entities;\n       (ii) are not subject to any unnecessary delay, \n     interference, or any other action that could impede receipt \n     by all of the appropriate Federal entities;

The clerk will report the amendment by number.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for Mr. \n     Wyden, proposes an amendment numbered 2621, as modified, to \n     amendment No. 2716.\n\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To improve the requirements relating to removal of personal \n        information from cyber threat indicators before sharing)\n\n       On page 17, strike lines 9 through 22 and insert the \n     following:\n       (A) review such cyber threat indicator and remove, to the \n     extent feasible, any personal information of or identifying a \n     specific individual that is not necessary to describe or \n     identity a cybersecurity threat; or\n       (B) implement and utilize a technical capability configured \n     to remove, to the extent feasible, any personal information \n     of or identifying a specific individual contained within such \n     indicator that is not necessary to describe or identify a \n     cybersecurity threat.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, as the vice chair and I have said numerous \ntimes this afternoon, nothing would make us happier than for Members to \ncome to the floor. We have amendments pending. We have a managers' \namendment. Everybody knows exactly what is in this bill. Let's start \nthe debate. Let's vote on amendments. Let's end this process in a \nmatter of days. We are prepared to vote on every amendment.\n  So at this time, I ask unanimous consent that on Thursday, October \n22, at 11 a.m., the Senate vote on the pending amendments to the Burr-\nFeinstein substitute to S. 754, with a 60-vote threshold for those \namendments that are not germane; and that following the disposition of \nthe amendments, the substitute, as amended, if amended, be agreed to, \nthe bill, as amended, be read a third time, and the Senate vote on \npassage with a 60-vote threshold for passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I certainly support most of the \namendments that were just described. However, I am especially troubled \nabout amendment No. 2626, which would significantly expand a badly \noutdated Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. I have sought to modernize the \nComputer Fraud and Abuse Act, and I believe that amendment No. 2626 \nwould take that law--the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act--in the wrong \ndirection. I would object to any unanimous consent request that \nincludes that amendment. Therefore, I object to this request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, the Senate functions best when Members are \nfree to come to the floor and offer amendments, debate the amendments, \nand have a vote on the amendments. I might even share Senator Wyden's \nconcerns about that particular piece of legislation. I am not sure. It \nis a judiciary issue. The vice chair is on the Judiciary Committee. It \nis an amendment that we were not able to pass in the managers' \namendment. But as the vice chair and I said at the beginning of this \nprocess, we would like the Senate to function like it is designed, \nwhere every Member feels invested, and if they have a great idea, come \ndown, introduce it as an amendment, debate it, and let your colleagues \nvote up or down against it. If we can't move forward with a process \nlike that, then it is difficult to see how in a reasonable amount of \ntime we are going to complete this agenda.\n  So I would only urge my colleague from Oregon that there is nothing \nto be scared about. This is a process we will go through, and a \nnongermane amendment, which I think this would be listed as--I look for \nmy staff. It would be a nongermane amendment--requiring 60 votes, a \nthreshold that the Senate designed to pass practically anything.\n  So I urge him to reconsider at some point, and I will make a similar \nunanimous consent request once he has had an opportunity to think about \nit. But also, we will work to see if in fact that amendment might be \nmodified in a way that might make it a little more acceptable for the \ndebate and for colleagues to vote on it.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, as the Senate turns its focus to \nlegislation related to the critical issue of our Nation's cyber \nsecurity and in the light of Chinese President Xi Jinping's state visit \nlast month, I would like to reflect on America's security in cyber \nspace.\n  As the global economy becomes increasingly dependent on the Internet, \nthe exponential increase in the number and scale of cyber attacks and \ncyber thefts are straining our relationship with international trading \npartners throughout the world. This is especially true for our \nimportant trade relationship with China. This year alone, the United \nStates has experienced some of the largest cyber attacks in our \nNation's history--many of which are believed to have been perpetrated \nby the Chinese. Just last February, hackers breached the customer \nrecords of the health insurance company Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield. \nMany news sources reported that China was responsible for the attack. \nThis cyber attack resulted in the theft of approximately 80 million \ncustomers' personally identifiable information, including Social \nSecurity numbers and information that can be used for identity theft.\n  In the early summer, cyber criminals also hacked United Airlines, \ncompromising manifest data that detailed the movement of millions of \nAmericans. According to the news media, China was again believed to \nhave been responsible.\n  But the most devastating cyber attack this year was on the U.S. \nGovernment's Office of Personnel Management. This past June, sources \nreport that the OPM data breach, considered the worst cyber intrusion \never perpetrated against the U.S. Government,\n\n[[Page S7337]]\n\naffected about 21.5 million Federal employees and contractors. Hackers \nsuccessfully accessed sensitive personal information, including \nsecurity clearance files, Social Security numbers, and information \nabout employees' contacts and families. Again, China was the suspected \nculprit.\n  Most troubling, the OPM breach included over 19.7 million background \ninvestigation records for cleared U.S. Government employees. The \nexposure of this highly sensitive information not only puts our \nnational security at risk but also raises concern that foreign \ngovernments may be keeping detailed databases on Federal workers and \ntheir associations.\n\n  I was pleased during the Chinese President's visit to Washington last \nmonth that President Obama expressed his ``very serious concerns about \ngrowing cyber threats'' and stated that the cyber theft of intellectual \nproperty and commercial trade secrets ``has to stop.'' President Obama \nand President Xi Jinping came to an agreement not to ``conduct or \nknowingly support'' cyber theft of intellectual property or commercial \ntrade secrets.\n  Even so, Director of Intelligence James Clapper expressed doubts \nabout the agreement in a hearing before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee last week. When Chairman McCain asked Mr. Clapper if he was \noptimistic about the deal, he told members of the committee he was not. \nI add my skepticism of this agreement to the growing chorus of \nlawmakers, military leaders, and intelligence community personnel who \nhave voiced similar concerns.\n  As Admiral Rogers, head of the National Security Agency and U.S. \nCyber Command, has said, ``China is the biggest proponent of \ncyberattacks being waged against the U.S.'' We must do more to defend \nourselves against this growing threat. Unfortunately, I have been \ndisappointed in this administration's inability to protect our Federal \ncomputer systems from cyber intrusions and to hold criminals \naccountable for their participation in cyber attacks committed against \nthe United States. Sadly, the cyber threats facing our Nation are not \nlimited to China. Investigators believe Russia, North Korea, Iran, and \nseveral other nations have also launched cyber attacks against our \ngovernment, U.S. citizens, and of course companies. These attacks are \nincreasing both in severity and in number.\n  In April, Russian hackers accessed White House networks containing \nsensitive information, including emails sent and received by the \nPresident himself.\n  In May, hackers breached IRS servers to gain access to 330,000 \nAmerican taxpayers' tax returns. That same month a fraudulent stock \ntrader manipulated U.S. markets, costing the stock exchange an \nestimated $1 trillion in just 36 minutes. In July, it was reported that \na Russian spear phishing attack shut down the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nemail system for 11 days. Just 1 month ago, hackers stole the personal \ndata of 15 million T-Mobile customers by breaching Experian, the \ncompany that processes credit checks for prospective customers. This \nstolen data includes names, birth dates, addresses, Social Security \nnumbers, and credit card information.\n  These breaches have a serious and real cost for the victims. \nAccording to the Federal Trade Commission, the average identity fraud \nvictim in 2012 incurred an average of $365 in losses. Incredibly, all \nof these high-profile breaches have occurred this year, making 2015 \nperhaps the worst year ever in terms of attacks on our national cyber \nsecurity.\n  Prior to 2015, we also saw several high-profile breaches at large \nAmerican corporations, including Target, Home Depot, Sony, and others. \nOur lack of effective cyber security policies and procedures threatens \nthe safety of our people, the strength of our national defense, and the \nfuture of our economy. We must be more vigilant in reinforcing our \ncyber infrastructure to better defend ourselves against these attacks. \nIn doing so, Congress must create a deterrent for those who seek to \ncommit cyber attacks against our Nation. Our adversaries must know they \nwill suffer dire consequences if they attack the United States. Finding \na solution to this critical problem must be an urgent priority for the \nSenate.\n  I agree with Leader McConnell that we must move forward in the Senate \nwith legislation to improve our Nation's cyber security practices and \npolicies. I am supportive of the objectives outlined in Chairman Burr \nand Vice Chairperson Feinstein's bipartisan Cybersecurity Information \nSharing Act, CISA.\n  I was pleased to see the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence pass \nthe Burr-Feinstein CISA bill out of the committee by an overwhelming \nbipartisan vote of 14 to 1. This important legislation incentivizes and \nauthorizes private sector companies to voluntarily share cyber threat \ninformation in real time that can be useful in detecting cyber attacks \nand in preventing future cyber intrusions.\n  I also commend Chairman Burr and Vice Chairman Feinstein's efforts to \ninclude provisions in CISA to protect personal privacy, including a \nmeasure that prevents a user's personally identifiable information from \nbeing shared with government agencies. Additionally, CISA sets limits \non information that can be collected or monitored by allowing \ninformation to be used only for cyber security purposes.\n\n  As the American economy grows ever more dependent on the Internet, I \nbelieve CISA represents an important first step in protecting our \nNation's critical infrastructure from the devastating impact of cyber \nattacks. Congress must do more to adequately protect and secure \nAmerica's presence in cyber space.\n  In light of recent revelations highlighting our Federal Government's \ninability to adequately protect and secure classified data and other \nsensitive information, I joined Senator Carper, the ranking member of \nthe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, in \nintroducing the Federal Computer Security Act.\n  The Hatch-Carper bill shines light on whether our Federal Government \nis using the most up-to-date cyber security practices and software to \nprotect Federal computer systems and databases from both external cyber \nattackers and insider threats. Specifically, this legislation requires \nFederal agency inspectors general to report to Congress on the security \npractices and software used to safeguard classified and personally \nidentifiable information on Federal computer systems themselves.\n  This bill also requires each Federal agency to submit a report to \neach respective congressional committee with oversight jurisdiction \ndescribing in detail to each committee which security access controls \nthe agency is implementing to protect unauthorized access to classified \nand sensitive, personally identifiable information on government \ncomputers.\n  Requiring an accounting of each Federal agency's security practices, \nsoftware, and technology is a logical first step in bolstering our \nNation's cyber infrastructure. These reports will guide Congress in \ncrafting legislation to prevent future large-scale data breaches and \nensure that unauthorized users are not able to access classified and \nsensitive information.\n  Agencies should be employing multifactor authentication policies and \nshould be implementing software to detect and monitor cyber security \nthreats. They should also be using the most up-to-date technology and \nsecurity controls. The future of our Nation's cyber security starts \nwith our Federal Government practicing good cyber hygiene. In \nstrengthening our security infrastructure, the Federal Government \nshould be accountable to the American people, especially when cyber \nattacks affect millions of taxpayers.\n  I have heard from many constituents who have expressed concerns about \nthe state of America's cyber security. I am honored to represent a \nState that is an emerging center of technological advancement and \ninnovation, with the growing hub of computer companies expanding across \na metropolitan area known as Silicon Slopes. The people of Utah \nrecognize that our Nation's future depends on America's ability to \ncompete in the digital area. They understand we must create effective \ncyber security policies so we can continue to lead the world in \ninnovation and technology advancement.\n  I am pleased to announce that an amended version of the Federal \nComputer Security Act is included in Chairman Burr and Vice Chairman\n\n[[Page S7338]]\n\nFeinstein's managers' package. I wish to express my appreciation to \nboth the chairman and vice chairman for their willingness to work with \nme in fine-tuning this legislation. I appreciate it. I wish to also \nthank Chairman Ron Johnson and Ranking Member Tom Carper of the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee for their efforts \nin this endeavor as well.\n  In addition to broad bipartisan support in the Senate, the Federal \nComputer Security Act enjoys support from key industry stakeholders. \nSome of our Nation's largest computer security firms support the bill, \nincluding Symantec, Adobe, and CA Technologies. Several industry groups \nhave also voiced their support, including the Business Software \nAlliance and the IT Alliance for the Public Sector.\n  I commend Intelligence Committee Chairman Burr and Vice Chairman \nFeinstein for their leadership in managing this critical cyber security \nlegislation. As Leader McConnell works to restore the Senate to its \nproper function, I am grateful we have been able to consider this \nlegislation in an open and transparent fashion. By reinstating the open \namendment process, we have not only been able to vote on dozens of \namendments this year, we have been able to refine legislation through \nrobust consideration and debate. I think we voted on approximately 160-\nplus amendments so far this year, and they are about evenly split \nbetween Democrats and Republicans.\n  With the renewal of longstanding Senate practices, we are passing \nmeaningful laws that will better serve the needs of the American \npeople. May we build on the foundation of success as we work to improve \nthis critically important Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act.\n  I wish to again thank the distinguished leaders of this Intelligence \nCommittee. Having served 18 years on the Intelligence Committee, I \nreally appreciate the work that both of them have done, especially on \nthis bill, and I look forward to its passage.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah for his words. They are much appreciated, as is his \nfriendship as well. I think he knows that. I believe the chairman feels \ncertainly as strongly if not more strongly than I do.\n  I rose to be able to make a brief statement about the sanctuary bill \nas in morning business, if that is possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n           Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Bill\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I voted against Senator Vitter's \nbill. I believe it goes much too far. My longer statement is in the \nRecord, but I want to respond to some of what I heard today. I do \nbelieve we should ensure that there is a notification prior to release \nof a dangerous individual with a criminal record, just as Senator \nSchumer said on this floor. I do believe we could take a narrow action \nto do just that. We could focus on dangerous individuals and not on all \nundocumented immigrants who happen to be taken into State or local \ncustody. We could require notification without threatening vital law \nenforcement and local government funding, as Senator Vitter's bill \ndoes.\n  I had an amendment prepared for the Judiciary Committee's \nconsideration when the committee had scheduled the bill for markup over \na series of weeks, but the committee canceled its markup, so we were on \nthe floor today with a bill that has never been heard in full by the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Senator Vitter's bill includes a notification requirement and a \ndetention requirement. It is not limited to those who are dangerous or \nhave particular criminal records. It would cover a farmworker who was \ndetained for a broken taillight or a mother who was detained for \nsimilar reasons, taking her away from her children. This is a standard \nthat could be abused in another administration, and it is potentially a \nhuge unfunded mandate to impose on States and localities.\n  The bill would also impose lengthy criminal sentences at the Federal \nlevel for individuals coming across the border to see their families or \nto perform work that is vital to the economy of California and the \nNation. For example, in California, virtually the majority, if not all, \nof the farmworkers are undocumented. It happens to be a fact. It is why \nthe agriculture jobs bill was part of the immigration reform act which \nwas before this body and passed this body and went to the House and had \nno action.\n  Although Members on the other side state that this bill has support \namong law enforcement, I will note that the Major Cities Chiefs \nAssociation, the Major County Sheriffs' Association, the Fraternal \nOrder of Police, the United States Conference of Mayors, and the \nNational League of Cities are opposed to this bill or have submitted \nletters opposing threats to Federal law enforcement funding over this \nissue.\n  So, bottom line, I do believe we should do something about the \ncircumstance that led to the tragic murder of Kate Steinle, which \noccurred in my city and State, and the tragic murder of Marilyn Pharis, \nwhich happened in the middle part of my State. I will support a \nreasonable effort to do just that, but this is not a targeted effort. \nIt is too broad, and so I opposed it. My full statement is in the \nRecord, but because it was spoken about on the floor, I did want to add \nthese words.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, moving back to cyber security, we now have \nS. 754 before the Senate, and we have a managers' package that is \npending. We have a number of amendments that have been accepted and \nincorporated in the managers' package. We have several amendments that \nwe could not reach agreement on, but those Members have the opportunity \nto come to the Senate floor. The amendments are already pending. They \ncan debate those amendments, and they can have a vote on their \namendment. For Members who might just now be engaging or who have had \nan opportunity to further read the bill, there are still present \nopportunities to offer perfecting amendments.\n  Let me suggest to my colleagues that when the vice chairman and I \nstarted down this road, we knew we couldn't reach unanimous consent of \nevery company in the country and every Member of Congress. It was our \ngoal, and I think we are pretty close to it when we look at the \nnumbers. But there will be companies that object to this bill for some \nreason that I might not recognize.\n  The vice chairman has said this and I have said it and I want to \nreiterate it another time: This bill is voluntary. It does not require \nany company in America to participate in this. It does not require any \nentity to turn over information to the Federal Government for purposes \nof the Federal Government partnering with that company to determine who \nhacked their system, who penetrated, and who exfiltrated personal data. \nIf a company has made the determination that they don't want to support \nthis bill for whatever reason, I am resigned to the fact that that is a \ndebate between their customers and themselves. It is, in fact, their \ncustomers that have to question the actions of the company.\n  I can confidently tell my colleagues that Senator Feinstein and I \nhave done everything to make sure there is wholesome participation by \ncompanies on a voluntary basis. We see tremendous value in those parts \nof our government that are experts at processing attacks like this to \nbe able to identify who did it and what tools were used but, more \nimportantly, what software defensive mechanism we can put on our \nsystems to limit any additional exfiltration of data and, more broadly, \nto the rest of the business community say: Here is an attack that is in \nprogress. Here is the tool they are using. Here is how you defend your \ndata.\n  Now, we leave open, if we pass it, that there may be a company that \ndecides they don't support this legislation. They can still participate \nin this program. Do we think if they get a call from the Department of \nHomeland Security or from the National Security Agency saying ``Here is \nan attack that is happening; here is the tool they are using,'' they \nare going to look at their system and say ``Is it in our system?'' They \nget the benefit of still participating and partnering with the Federal \nGovernment, even though they didn't support the legislation.\n\n[[Page S7339]]\n\n  I know over the next day or so the vice chairman and I will \nconcentrate on sharing with Members what is actually in the managers' \npackage. We don't leave it up to staff just to cover it.\n  Let me just briefly share 15 points that I would make about the \nmanagers' package.\n  No. 1, it eliminates the government's uses for noncyber crimes; in \nother words, a removal of the serious violent felonies.\n  No. 2, it limits the authorizations to share cyber threat information \nfor cyber security purposes, period.\n  No. 3, it eliminates new FOIA exemptions. In other words, everybody \nis under the same FOIA regulations that existed prior to this \nlegislation being enacted.\n  No. 4, it ensures defensive measures are properly limited. We can't \nget wild and put these things in places that government shouldn't be, \nregardless of what the threat is.\n  No. 5, it includes the Secretary of Homeland Security as coauthor--\ncoauthor--of government-sharing guidelines. I think this is an \nincredibly important part. The individual who is in charge of Homeland \nSecurity, that Secretary, is actively involved in the guidelines that \nare written.\n  No. 6, it clarifies exceptions to the DHS portal entry point for the \ntransfer of information.\n  No. 7, it adds a requirement that the procedures for government \nsharing include procedures for notifying U.S. persons whose personal \ninformation is known to have been shared in violation--in violation--of \nthis act. In other words, if a company mistakenly transmits \ninformation, the government is required to notify that individual. But, \nadditionally, the government is statutorily required not to disseminate \nthat information to any other Federal agency once it comes in and is \nidentified.\n  No. 8, it clarifies the real-time automated process for sharing \nthrough that DHS portal.\n  No. 9, it clarifies that private entities are not required to share \ninformation with the Federal Government or another private entity.\n  No. 10, it adds a Federal cyber security enhancement title.\n  No. 11, it adds a study on mobile device security.\n  No. 12, it adds a requirement for the Secretary of State to produce \nan international cyber space policy strategy.\n  No. 13, it adds a reporting provision concerning the apprehension and \nprosecution of international cyber criminals.\n  No. 14, it improves the contents of the biannual report on CISA's \nimplementation. My colleagues might remember, as some have raised \nissues on this, they have said: Why are there not more reports? There \nare biannual reports on the implementation and how it is done.\n  No. 15, and last, is additional technical and conforming edits.\n  Now, we didn't get into detail. We will get into detail later, but I \nsay that because if that has in any way triggered with somebody who \nfelt they were opposed to the bill because of something they were told \nwas in it, maybe it was covered by one of those 15 things that I just \ntalked about. They are things that were brought to the attention of the \nvice chairman and me, and we sat down and looked at it. If we didn't \nfeel as though it changed the intent of the bill--and we have always \nerred on the side of protecting personal data, of not letting this \nlegislation extend outside of what it was intended to do. Where we have \ndrawn the line is when we believed that the effort was to thwart the \neffectiveness of this legislation.\n  I will remind my colleagues one last time: This legislation does not \nprevent cyber attacks. This legislation is designed to minimize the \nloss of the personal data of the customers of the companies that are \npenetrated by these cyber actors.\n  As we stand here today, we have had some rather significant breaches \nwithin the United States. I remind my colleagues that just today it was \nproposed that a high school student has hacked the unclassified \naccounts, the personal email, of the Secretary of the Department of \nHomeland Security and the Director of the CIA. Is there anybody who \nreally thinks that this is going to go away because we are having a \ndebate in the Senate and in the Congress of the United States, that the \npeople who commit these acts and go without any identification are \ngoing to quit? No. It is going to become more rampant and more rampant \nand more rampant. From the standpoint of 2 of 15 Members who are \ndesignated by the U.S. Senate and its leadership to, on behalf of the \nother 85, look at the most sensitive information that our country can \naccumulate about threats, as many threads of threats as we look at \ntoday on the security of the American people, I think I can speak for \nthe vice chairman: We are just as concerned about the economic security \nof the United States based upon the threat that we are faced with from \ncyber actors here at home and, more importantly, around the world.\n  I urge my colleagues, if you have something to contribute, come to \nthe floor and contribute it. If you have an amendment already pending, \ncome to the floor and debate it and vote on it. Give us the ability to \nwork through the great thoughts of all 100 Members, but recognize the \nfact that those individuals whom you have entrusted to represent you \nwith the most sensitive information that exists in our country came to \na 14-to-1 vote when they passed this originally out of the Intelligence \nCommittee. That is because of how grave we see the threat and how real \nthe attackers are.\n  I thank the vice chairman. She has been absolutely wonderful to work \nwith through this process. We are going to have a long couple of days \nif we process all of this, but I am willing to be here as long as it \ntakes so that we can move on to conference with the House.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank the chairman for those \nwords. I have one little duty left.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2626\n\n  Madam President, I call for the regular order with respect to \nWhitehouse amendment No. 2626.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2626, as Modified\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask that the amendment be modified with the changes \nthat are at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Sanctuary Cities Bill\n\n  Mr. PERDUE. Madam President, I rise to speak very briefly about the \nStop Sanctuary Cities Act, which I was proud to cosponsor in the \nSenate. Simply put, this legislation protects American citizens from \ncriminal illegal immigrants. Today, at least 340 cities across our \ncountry are choosing not to enforce our Nation's immigration laws. \nThese sanctuary cities have become a safe haven for criminals who are \nnot only in the United States illegally but also are committing \nadditional crimes and repeatedly reentering trying our country after \nbeing deported. This summer we witnessed the tragic impact this \nlawlessness has on American citizens when Kate Steinle was murdered in \nSan Francisco, a sanctuary city, by a felon living in our country \nillegally and who was previously deported five separate times. Three \nmonths prior to Kate's tragic death, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity actually asked San Francisco to detain her murderer, but the \nsanctuary city refused to cooperate and released the criminal back into \nthe community. Had they not done that, had they turned that person over \nto Homeland Security as they were requested, Kate might still be with \nus.\n  This is unconscionable. I do not think I can overstate the importance \nof this Stop Sanctuary Cities Act to the American people and to the \npeople of my home State of Georgia. The fact is that Kate Steinle did \nnot have to die at the hands of a seven-time convicted felon and a \nfive-time deportee. Kate and many others would not have died if our \ncountry had a functional immigration system and a government that \nactually enforces our laws.\n  This is why it is absolutely crucial that we stop sanctuary cities \nand address this illegal immigration crisis, which has also become a \nnational security crisis. This bill would have done just that, and yet \nwe were not able to even get it on the floor to have a debate. This is \nwhat drives people in my home State absolutely apoplectic. We want to \nget these bills to the floor, have an open debate, and let's let \nAmericans see how we all vote on critical issues like this.\n  It is a very sad day, indeed, when this body cannot come together to \nstop rogue cities from breaking our Nation's laws, protecting the \nlivelihood of American citizens, and support our law enforcement \nofficials. I thank Senator Vitter and Chairman Grassley for working \nclosely with the victims' families and law enforcement to produce this \nlegislation. I hope we can continue to debate this and get this bill \nback on the floor. I will keep fighting to stop this lawlessness and \nprotect all Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, last week the former head of the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Robert M. Hoyt, passed \naway at the age of 92. Dr. Hoyt served this Nation under five \nPresidents and pioneered the peaceful use of satellites to understand \nour weather and climate. He said:\n\n       We do have environmental problems and they're serious ones, \n     the preservation of species among them, but the climate is \n     the environmental problem that's so pervasive in its effects \n     on the society. . . . The climate is really the only \n     environmental characteristic that can utterly change our \n     society and our civilization.\n\n  That was in 1977. That same year, James F. Black, a top scientific \nresearcher at the Exxon Corporation,\n\n[[Page S7341]]\n\ngave that company's executives a similar warning. ``[T]here is general \nscientific agreement,'' he told Exxon's Management Committee, ``that \nthe most likely manner in which mankind is influencing the global \nclimate is through carbon dioxide release from the burning of fossil \nfuels.'' According to emerging reports, Exxon executives kept that \nwarning a closely guarded company secret for years.\n  I rise today for the 115th time to urge that we wake up to the threat \nof climate change. I rise in the midst of a decades-long purposeful \ncorporate campaign of misinformation, which has held this Congress and \nthis Nation back from taking meaningful action to prevent that utter \nchange.\n  Scrutiny of the corporate campaign of misinformation intensifies, and \nscrutiny of the fossil fuel polluters behind it intensifies, and the \nregular cast of rightwing climate denier attack dogs have their hackles \nup.\n  On May 6 I gave a speech on the floor of the Senate. The speech \ncompared the misinformation campaign by the fossil fuel industry about \nthe dangers of carbon pollution to the tobacco industry's \nmisinformation campaign about the dangers of its product. The relevance \nof that comparison is that the U.S. Department of Justice, under the \ncivil provisions of the Federal racketeer influenced and corrupt \norganizations statute--RICO for short--brought an action against the \ntobacco industry. The United States alleged that the tobacco industry's \nmisinformation campaign was fraudulent, and the United States won in a \nlengthy and thorough decision by U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler.\n  You can go ahead and read them. DOJ's complaint and Judge Kessler's \ndecision can be found at the Web sites of the Justice Department and \nthe Public Health Law Center, respectively, and they are linked on my \nWeb site, whitehouse.senate.gov/climate\nchange. I will warn you that Judge Kessler's decision is a long one, \nbut it makes good reading.\n  The comparison is strong. There are whole sections of the Department \nof Justice civil RICO complaint and whole sections of Judge Kessler's \ndecision where you can remove the word ``tobacco'' and put in the word \n``carbon'' and remove the word ``health'' and put in the word \n``climate,'' and the parallel with the fossil fuel industry climate \ndenial campaign is virtually perfect.\n  This is not an idea I just cooked up. Look at the academic work of \nProfessor Robert Brulle of Drexel University and Professor Riley Dunlap \nof Oklahoma State University. Look at the investigative work of Naomi \nOreskes' book ``Merchants of Doubt,'' David Michaels' book ``Doubt is \nTheir Product,'' and Gerald Markowitz and David Rosner's book ``Deceit \nand Denial,'' describing this industry-backed machinery of deception.\n  Look at the journalistic work of Neela Banerjee, Lisa Song, David \nHasemyer, and John Cushman, Jr., in the recent reporting of \nInsideClimate News about what Exxon knew about climate change versus \nthe falsehoods that Exxon chose to tell the public. Look at a separate \nprobe by journalists Sara Jerving, Katie Jennings, Masako Melissa \nHirsch, and Susanne Rust in the Los Angeles Times.\n  From all their work, we know now that Exxon, for instance, knew about \nthe effect of its carbon pollution as far back as the late 1970s but \nultimately chose to fund a massive misinformation campaign rather than \ntell the truth. ``No corporation,'' said professor and climate change \nactivist Bill McKibben, ``has ever done anything this big and this \nbad.''\n  Just today, the person who probably knows the most about the tobacco \nlitigation, the assistant attorney general of the United States who \nprosecuted that case as a civil matter and won it in the U.S. District \nCourt, Sharon Eubanks, said about the climate denial RICO idea: ``I \nthink a RICO action is plausible and should be considered.''\n  This is how Judge Kessler depicted the culpable conduct of the \ntobacco industry in her decision in that case: ``Defendants have \nintentionally maintained and coordinated their fraudulent position on \naddiction and nicotine as an important part of their overall efforts to \ninfluence public opinion and persuade people that smoking is not \ndangerous.''\n  Now compare that to the findings of Dr. Brulle, whose research shines \nlight on the dark-money campaigns that fund and support climate denial. \nThis climate denial operation, to quote Dr. Brulle, is ``a deliberate \nand organized effort to misdirect the public discussion and distort the \npublic's understanding of climate.''\n  The parallels between what the tobacco industry did and what the \nfossil fuel industry is doing now are so striking, I suggested in my \nspeech of May 6, that it was worth a look, that civil discovery could \nreveal whether the fossil fuel industry's activities cross that same \nline into racketeering.\n  I said that again in an op-ed piece I wrote in the Washington Post on \nMay 29 regarding the civil RICO action against tobacco. Oh my, what a \ncaterwauling has ensued from the fossil fuel industry trolls. Here is a \nquick highlight reel of the tempest of rightwing invective.\n\n  One climate denier, Christopher Monckton, declared: ``Senator \nWhitehouse is a fascist goon.''\n  Another denier compared me to Torquemada, the infamous torturer of \nthe Inquisition.\n  The official Exxon responder got so excited about this suggestion \nthat he used a word I am not even allowed to use on the Senate floor. \nHe forgot rule No. 1 in crisis management: Don't lose your cool.\n  The rightwing Web site breitbart.com responded by calling me ``the \npreposterous Democrat senator for Rhode Island'' and saying the notion \nthat there is an industry-led effort to mislead the American people \nabout the harm caused by carbon pollution is ``a joke,'' a conspiracy \ntheory on par with Area 51 or the faking of the Moon landing. Well, \ntell that to the tobacco industry.\n  Paul Gigot, the editorial page editor of the Wall Street Journal, \nsaid global warming concerns ``are based on computer models, not by \nactual evidence, not by actual evidence of what we've seen so far.'' \nTell that to the scientists who measure the effects of climate change \nevery day, particularly in our oceans.\n  The polluter-funded George C. Marshall Institute, a longtime climate \ndenial outfit--and who knows how they got to take respectable George C. \nMarshall's name and slap it on the front of a climate denial industry \nfront--they wrote that this was an attack on constitutional rights. \nWell, that kind of presumes the answer because there is no \nconstitutional right to commit fraud.\n  Similarly, Calvin Beisner, founder of another phony baloney industry \nfront called the Cornwall Alliance, said the same: The mere suggestion \nof considering this action represents a ``direct attack on the rights \nto freedom of speech and the press guaranteed by the First Amendment'' \nand is ``horrifically bad for science.'' Coming from a science-denial \noutfit, that concern for science is rich. Again, fraud is not protected \nby the First Amendment.\n  In the National Review, I was accused of wanting to launch \n``organized crime investigations . . . against people and institutions \nthat disagree with [me] about global warming'' in order to ``lock \npeople up as Mafiosi.'' Crime? Lock people up? Let's remember, we are \ntalking about civil RICO, not criminal. No one went to jail in the \ntobacco case. Investigating the organized climate denial scheme under \ncivil RICO is not about putting people in jail.\n  Query why the National Review would mislead people about such an \nobvious fact, and they are not alone. The rightwing blogosphere has lit \nup with nonsense about how this is a criminal charge. Read the tobacco \ncomplaint. It is on the Department of Justice Web site. Even people who \npurport to be legal scholars are misleading folks that way. All a civil \nRICO case does is get people to actually have to tell the truth under \noath in front of an actual impartial judge or jury and under cross-\nexamination, which the Supreme Court has described as ``the greatest \nlegal invention ever invented for the discovery of truth.'' No more \nspin and deception--but that is exactly the audience polluters and \ntheir allies cannot bear, so the flacks set off criminal smokescreens \nand launch fascist goon and Torquemada hysterics.\n  A few weeks ago, 20 scientists agreed with me and wrote a letter to \nAttorney General Lynch supporting the idea of using civil RICO. That \nwas too much for the troll-in-chief for the fossil fuel\n\n[[Page S7342]]\n\nindustry, the Wall Street Journal editorial page. The Wall Street \nJournal editorial page has long been an industry science-denial \nmouthpiece. They use the same playbook every time: one, deny the \nscience; two, question the motives of reformers; and three, exaggerate \nthe costs of reforms.\n  For example, when scientists warned that chlorofluorocarbons could \nbreak down the atmosphere's ozone layer, the Wall Street Journal ran \neditorials--for decades--devaluing the science, attacking scientists \nand reformers, and exaggerating the costs associated with regulating \nCFCs. It turns out they were dead wrong.\n  When acid rain was falling in the Northeast, the Wall Street Journal \neditorial page questioned the science, claimed the sulphur dioxide \ncleanup effort was driven by politics, and said fixing it carried a \nhuge price tag. Ultimately, the Journal's editorial page, after years \nof this, had to recant and admit that the cap-and-trade program for \nsulphur dioxide ``saves about $700 million annually compared with the \ncost of traditional regulation and has been reducing emissions by four \nmillion tons annually.''\n  Now, on climate change, the Journal is back to the same pattern: Deny \nthe science, question the motives of climate scientists, exaggerate the \ncosts of tackling carbon pollution.\n  For decades, the Journal has been persistently publishing editorials \nagainst taking any action to prevent manmade climate change. On this, \nthe editorial page said that by talking about civil RICO, I am trying \nto ``forcibly silence'' the denial apparatus. Forcibly silence? First \nof all, against the billions of the Koch brothers and the billions of \nExxonMobil, fat chance that I have much ``force'' to use. And silence? \nI don't want them silent. I want them testifying in a forum where they \nhave to tell the truth.\n  Is the Journal really saying that in a forum where climate deniers \nhave to tell the truth, their only response would have to be silence? \nMaking them tell the truth ``forcibly silences'' them? The only thing \ncivil RICO silences is fraud.\n  By the way, the Journal editorial never mentions that the government \nwon the civil RICO case against tobacco and on very similar facts. That \nwould detract from the fable. Whom does the Journal cast as their \nvictim in their fable? None other than Willie Soon, whom they said I \nsingled out for--this is what they said--having ``published politically \ninconvenient research on changes in solar radiation.'' Politically \ninconvenient research.\n  Actually, what is inconvenient for Dr. Soon is that the New York \nTimes reported that he got more than half his funding from big fossil \nfuel interests such as ExxonMobil and the Charles Koch Foundation to \nthe tune of $1.2 million and didn't disclose it. Dr. Soon's research \ncontracts even gave his industry backers a chance for comment and input \nbefore he published, and he referred to the papers he produced for them \nas ``deliverables.'' In case anyone listening doesn't know this, that \nis not how real science works. Of course, none of this sordid financial \nconflict is even mentioned by the Wall Street Journal editorial page. \nThey would rather pretend that Dr. Soon is being singled out for \n``politically inconvenient'' views. Please.\n  It gets better. In the editorial, the role of neutral expert \ncommenting on all of this goes to Georgia Tech's Judith Curry. She \noffers the opinion that my ``demand . . . for legal persecution . . . \nrepresents a new low in the politicization of science.'' This is a \nparticularly rich and conflict-riddled opinion, as Ms. Curry is herself \na repeat anti-climate witness performing regularly in committees for \nRepublicans here in Congress. Again, there is no mention of this \ninterest of Ms. Curry's in the Wall Street Journal editorial.\n\n  The fossil fuel industry's climate denial machine rivals or exceeds \nthat of the tobacco industry in size, scope, and complexity. Its \npurpose is to cast doubt about the reality of climate change in order \nto forestall moves toward cleaner fuels and to allow the Kochs and the \nExxons of the world to continue making money at everybody else's \nexpense. And the Wall Street Journal editorial page plays its part in \nthis machine.\n  Even though it is only the editorial page and not the Journal's well-\nregarded newsroom, facts and logic are supposed to matter. Ignoring the \nsuccessful tobacco litigation, omitting the salient fact of Dr. Soon \nbeing paid by the industry involved in his research, and bringing in a \nclimate denier as their neutral voice without even disclosing that \nconflict--I would like to see the Wall Street Journal editorial page \nget that editorial by the editorial standards of their own newsroom.\n  So why all the histrionics on the far right? Why all the deliberate \nsubterfuge between civil and criminal RICO? Why all the name-calling? \nHave we perhaps touched a little nerve? Have we made the hit a bit too \nclose to home? Maybe a civil RICO case is indeed plausible and should \nbe considered. Are the cracks in the dark castle of climate denial as \nit crumbles beginning to maybe rattle the occupants?\n  Whatever the motivation of the Wall Street Journal and other \nrightwing climate denial outfits, it is clearly long past time for this \nclimate denial scheme to come in from the talk shows and the \nblogosphere and have to face the kind of truth-testing audience a civil \nRICO investigation could provide. It is time to let the facts take \ntheir place and let climate denial face that greatest legal engine ever \ninvented for the discovery of truth.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of a resolution the \nSenate is likely to pass this evening honoring the lives of the 33 crew \nmembers aboard the El Faro which sank near the Bahamas during Hurricane \nJoaquin earlier this month.\n  I want to take this opportunity to express my deepest sympathy and \nsincere condolences to the family of El Faro crewman Jeffrey A. Mathias \nof Kingston, MA. He was just 42 years old.\n  Jeff loved the sea. When he attended Tabor Academy, he learned how to \nsail aboard the school's sailing ship the Tabor Boy. Jeff followed his \npassion to the prestigious Massachusetts Maritime Academy, where in \n1996 he graduated with a degree in marine engineering. Upon graduation, \nhe worked at Seamass and then Altran, where he was involved with \nnuclear power plants. In 1998, he landed his dream job on a cargo \nvessel.\n  Jeff sailed to Africa, Europe, North Korea, Alaska, Hawaii, \nCalifornia, and the Caribbean. He reached the officer's position of \nchief engineer and was responsible for shaft repairs on many vessels.\n  Jeff leaves his beloved wife, Jennifer Brides Mathias; his 3 adored \nchildren, daughters Hayden, 7, Heidi, 5, and son, Caleb, 3, all of \nKingston. He also leaves behind his parents, J. Barry and Lydia Jones \nMathias, of Kingston and his brother John.\n  Another son of Massachusetts who loved the sea was President John F. \nKennedy. He famously stated, ``I really don't know why it is that all \nof us are so committed to the sea, except I think it's because in \naddition to the fact that the sea changes, and the light changes, and \nships change, it's because we all came from the sea. And it is an \ninteresting biological fact that all of us have in our veins the exact \nsame percentage of salt in our blood that exists in the ocean, and, \ntherefore, we have salt in our blood, in our sweat, in our tears. We \nare tied to the ocean. And when we go back to the sea--whether it is to \nsail or to watch it--we are going back from whence we came.''\n  I also offer my condolences to the family, friends, and loved ones of \nevery member of the El Faro crew.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/20/senate-section/article/S7343-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT MICHAELA BOUSHEY AND STAFF SERGEANT SHAYNE BOUSHEY\n\n Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I wish to recognize SGT Michaela \nBoushey and SSG Shayne Boushey as Montanans of the Week. These two \nsoldiers represent not only the best that Montana has to offer, but the \nbest this country has to offer.\n  SGT Michaela Boushey served in the Montana Army National Guard for 8 \nyears. For 4 years, she served in the 112th Security and Support \nDetachment Aviation Unit whose mission is to protect our borders, \ncollect and transmit intelligence, and to provide support for the \nDepartment of Justice. Michaela's commitments and service to our \ncountry has never faltered, and we are so grateful for her service, \nsacrifice, and loyalty to our great Nation.\n  Her husband, SSG Shayne Boushey, was deployed with both the infantry \nbattalion and the military police company. During his deployment to \nAfghanistan, Shayne and his team were targeted by Taliban forces. When \na suicide bomber detonated himself, 6 were killed and 13 were seriously \nwounded. Shayne's fast thinking, bravery, and resolve in this life-\nthreatening situation saved the lives of many in his team.\n  We owe our freedom to these soldiers and the thousands of American \nservicemembers like them. It is with the humblest gratitude that I \nthank them for their courage and unwavering loyalty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/20/senate-section/article/S7343-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO CHASE DELLWO\n\n Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I would like to highlight an \nincredibly courageous Montanan and a man very dear to my staff and me: \nChase Dellwo. Chase is a strong example of the courage, bravery, and \nquick thinking that sets Montanans apart.\n  Chase Dellwo, like myself and many other Montanans, is a hunter. In \nrecent weeks, however, Chase showed resolve that many could never \nachieve. While bow hunting with his brother recently, Chase climbed up \na narrow creek expecting to drive a herd of elk toward his waiting \nbrother.\n  Having been focused on the elk, Chase did not notice the sleeping \ngrizzly bear 3 feet from where he stood. Startling the now awake \nanimal, Chase soon found himself head to head with this 400-pound bear. \nChase recounts later that there was no time for him to draw his weapon \nback before he had been knocked off his feet and bit on the top and \nback of his head.\n  With his eye swollen shut, part of his scalp hanging over his eye, \nand blood pouring from his wounds, he suffered through the animal's \nrepeated assaults. This attack in normal circumstances would have been \nthe end of a hunter's life, but not in the case of Chase Dellwo. Mid-\nattack, Chase remembered an article his grandmother had sent him about \nlarge animals having terrible gag reflexes.\n  This quick thinking led him to plunge his arm down the animal's \nthroat, enacting the bear's gag reflex, and subsequently scaring the \nanimal away. Despite incredible disorientation, he found his way to his \nbrother and was in turn rushed to the nearest hospital.\n  After undergoing multiple hours of surgery to fix his many \nlacerations, Chase sat with his wife, defending the bear, saying that \nit had been just as startled as he had. His many injuries led to \nmultiple stitches, staples, and a hospital stay, but this 26-year-old \nremains alive and has encouraged Montana residents to be more aware of \nthe animals that share their land.\n  I commend Chase on his courage and smarts that saved his life and \nwish him luck on both his recovery and the upcoming hunting \nseason.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/20/senate-section/article/S7343-4", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING BETTE BAILLY\n\n Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I wish to honor the life of Bette \nBailly from Burlington, CO, who passed away earlier this month after \nserving nearly 50 years in the broadcast industry.\n  Bette was an inspiration to others in her professional life and in \nher community. She was due to celebrate 50 years of dedicated service \nat her station, KNAB-AM, in just 2 years' time and was honored and \nrecognized with numerous awards throughout her career. As a \nbusinesswoman, Bette was hard-charging and took a no-nonsense approach \nto broadcasting. Her tenacity was well known and respected throughout \nNortheastern Colorado.\n  Bette was also devoted to the Burlington community. She volunteered \nher time at the Burlington Chamber of Commerce, the Rotary Club, \nnumerous local boards, and her church.\n  Undoubtedly, Bette will be missed dearly by her family, her \ncommunity, and the State of Colorado. We will never forget her \ncontributions to local broadcasting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/20/senate-section/article/S7343-5", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7343-S7344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING BERKLEY SCHOOLS\n\n Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 175th \nAnniversary of Berkley Schools. I appreciate the opportunity to \nrecognize this truly significant milestone in the history of the \nBerkley School District and the city of Berkley, MI. I am proud of \nBerkley's enduring commitment to providing quality public education and \nwish it many more decades of successful service to its students and \ntheir families.\n  Throughout its history, the Berkley School District has set the \nbenchmark in public education, ensuring its students are prepared for \nsuccess, both as individuals and leaders in an increasingly global \ncommunity. The district's continued dedication to academics is apparent \nin its recognition by North Central Accreditation, as well as the many \nhonors its students have received in marketing, communications, \nliteracy and poetry, robotics, and video production. Berkley High \nSchool boasts 21 advanced placement and college level courses--more \nthan any other traditional high school campus--and provides the highest \nmath curriculum of any high school in Michigan's Oakland County. \nAdditionally, the district's Norup International\n\n[[Page S7344]]\n\nSchool is the United States only K-8 International Baccalaureate \nprogram housed on one campus. It is no surprise Berkley High School \nenjoys a 98 percent graduation rate, with nearly 100 percent of those \ngraduates enrolling in colleges and universities.\n  In addition to ensuring its students' success in the classroom, the \nBerkley School District provides an opportunity for students to \nparticipate in a wide variety of varsity sports, clubs, and student \norganizations. From football and softball, to rugby and skiing, \nstudents can compete for the Berkley Bears throughout the year. \nStudents also entertain as members of the high school's marching band, \nsymphonic band, concert band, and jazz band, as well as with its three \nchoirs and theater program. I applaud the Berkley School District for \nproviding opportunities for students to explore art, music, and \nliterature.\n  Berkley had been associated with education for nearly a century when \nthe city was incorporated in 1932. The Berkley School was mentioned as \npart of the Royal Oak Township School District No. 7 in 1840. It was \nhoused in the Blackmon School, at the corner of Coolidge and Catalpa, \nfrom 1840 until a new school building was established in 1901. The new \nbuilding, named South School, was located at the northeast corner of \nCoolidge and 11 Mile Road until it was converted into a dormitory for \nteachers in 1920. The district's growth was swift. In 1921, the \ndistrict built Angell School, a four-room building, on Bacon Street. \nFour years later, in 1925, the district added two more schools, \nPattengill and Burton, which were occupied before they were even \ncompleted.\n  Despite its success, the Berkley School District was not immune to \nthe hardships of the Great Depression. In January 1930, all pupils were \nplaced on half days, half of the faculty was dismissed, bus service was \neliminated, and the gym was closed. The following year, the district \nwas forced to close Burton and Pattengill schools. Fortunately, both \nschools were reopened in time for the ``baby boom'' that followed the \nend of World War II. As the district's population grew, Berkley High \nSchool opened in 1949, followed by Tyler and Oxford Schools in 1951; \nHamilton School in 1952; and the district's two junior high schools, \nAnderson and Norup, in 1956 and 1957.\n  Today, the Berkley School District continues to be a leader in \nproviding excellent public education in the State of Michigan. It \nserves as an example of how community-driven, quality education can not \nonly enrich the lives of students, but also drive the growth and \nquality of life in the surrounding community for generations. I am \npleased to help celebrate the 175th Anniversary of Berkley Schools and \nwish it many more decades of successful service to its students and \ntheir families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/20/senate-section/article/S7344-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNIZING THE UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA'S COLLEGIATE CYBER \n                              DEFENSE CLUB\n\n Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, as October marks Cyber Security \nAwareness Month, I wish to recognize the University of Central Florida, \nUCF, Collegiate Cyber Defense Club on winning the 2015 National \nCollegiate Cyber Defense Competition's Alamo Cup for a second year in a \nrow in April 2015. This achievement not only exemplifies the boundless \neducational opportunities provided by UCF, but also demonstrates how \nstudents in Florida are leading the next generation of growth and \ndevelopment in increasingly vital 21st century industries.\n  The UCF Collegiate Cyber Defense Club, also known as Hack@UCF was \nfounded in 2012 and today has 200 members that represent the university \nin cyber competitions around the Nation. Most notably, Hack@UCF \nannually competes in the National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition, \nCCDC. In partnership with the Center for Infrastructure Assurance and \nSecurity, CIAS, at the University of Texas at San Antonio, the CCDC \nstarted in 2005 to provide educational institutions with a controlled \nenvironment to further educate and assess the future generation's \nskills in combatting cyber attacks. This year, the competition \nchallenged 2,400 undergraduate and graduate students representing 200 \ncolleges and universities to operate and maintain a mock business, \nwhile continuously defending against cyber attacks created by \ngovernment and industry experts.\n  I am proud that the talented students of UCF were able to stand out \nas the best collegiate team during the competition for the past 2 \nyears. As our Nation will continue to face the threat of cyber attacks \non our economy, businesses, and national security, it is critical to \npromote and invest in educational programs that empower students and \nprovide them with the necessary tools to be successful in this \nindustry.\n  It is an honor to congratulate all members of the UCF Collegiate \nCyber Defense Club on this achievement. I hope it will inspire other \nstudents in the State of Florida and across the Nation to get involved \nin the cyber security industry. I wish the group an abundance of \nsuccess in the future and the best of luck in next year's \ncompetition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/20/senate-section/article/S7344-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. FRANK FIERMONTE\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Dr. Frank \nFiermonte, a physician from Orleans, VT, who cared for the people of \nVermont's North Country with distinction for many years. As Vermont's \nNorthland Journal prepares to publish the final installment of a series \non Dr. Fiermonte, I want to join in recognizing his service to Vermont.\n  Dr. Fiermonte was a true ``country doctor'' who was willing to travel \nlong distances to see his patients at all hours and in all seasons. I \nhave heard Frank tell many an anecdote about how, after a home visit to \na rural area, family and friends of the patient had to help him get his \ncar unstuck during mud season or dug out from a snow bank in the \nwinter.\n  Like many country doctors, he served a vast area, encompassing not \njust his hometown of Derby, but also a wide swath of Orleans and Essex \nCounties and even across the border into Quebec. Yet he intimately knew \nall of the families he served, which sometimes spanned several \ngenerations. The stories from North Country residents in the Northland \nJournal make it clear that Dr. Fiermonte made a tremendous impact on \nthe community. This quote from a former Derby resident stands out in \nparticular: ``Dr. Fiermonte was a godsend to the Derby area. He was \nalways available day or night.''\n  What always strikes me most about Frank is how personal the practice \nof medicine was for him. In today's modern world, health care can \nsometimes be a very impersonal experience. In fact, there is much \ndiscussion in Vermont and Washington about returning to a more patient-\ncentered system. We would do well to learn from people like Dr. Frank \nFiermonte and his contemporaries, who are the embodiment of that ideal. \nMotivated by the desire to serve his community and deliver the best \ncare possible, for Dr. Fiermonte, it was all about the patient.\n  Dr. Frank Fiermonte has earned my deepest respect, and I thank him \nfor his years of service to the North Country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/20/senate-section/article/S7344-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bills were read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 2181.
