JAMES BILLINGTON\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have recently learned that Dr. James \nBillington, the Librarian of Congress, who has been with us for almost \n30 years, will be retiring in January. He plans to spend more time with \nhis wife of nearly 58 years, Marjorie. He wants to see more of his 4 \nchildren and 12 grandchildren. I am sure he would also like to catch up \nwith his buddy who plays for the Grateful Dead or maybe just sit back \nwith a box or two of the Mallomars he loves so much.\n  But I don't think Dr. Billington is ready to take his scholar's cap \noff quite yet, because he is preparing to do a little writing, too, \nabout folks who played an important role in the history of--what else--\nthe Library that means so much to him.\n  Dr. Billington has called the Library of Congress the ``greatest \ncollection of knowledge and copyrighted creativity in human history,'' \nand I know how proud he is of the many initiatives he has undertaken to \nexpand its reach and its relevance.\n  I noted yesterday that we are unlikely to come across many guys who \ncan say they have been a Princeton valedictorian, a Harvard professor, \nan expert on the Kremlin, a veteran, and a Rhodes Scholar. But that is \nour Librarian of Congress.\n  He speaks 7 languages, he has 42 honorary doctorates, and I am hoping \nhe will soon be able to start catching a full 8 hours of sleep every \nnight.\n  Dr. Billington has certainly earned it, and we wish him the very best \nin his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/senate-section/article/S4063-6", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4063-S4064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CYBER SECURITY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on a different matter, I think a lot of \npeople were shocked to hear that the Obama administration was unable to \nprevent the information of 4 million Americans from being compromised \nby hackers.\n  Officials in the White House now owe it to every American to let \nCongress help them get out of the past and up to speed with the cyber \nsecurity realities of the 21st century. That is just what the measure \nwe will soon consider would help do.\n  It contains modern tools that cyber security experts tell us could \nhelp deter future attacks against both the public and the private \nsectors. The measure would also help get the word out faster about \nattacks as soon as they are detected, provide governments and \nbusinesses with knowledge they can use to erect stronger defenses, and \nhelp strike a critical balance between security and privacy in the \nprocess. The bill would do so, for instance, by mandating the creation \nof guidelines to limit the use, retention, and diffusion of consumers' \npersonal information.\n  This is more than just a smart measure. It is a transparent one too. \nIt has been carefully scrutinized by Senators from both parties. It has \nbeen endorsed overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis by nearly every \nsingle Democrat and every single Republican on the Intelligence \nCommittee, and it has been posted online and available for anyone to \nread for quite some time.\n  The need for this smart, bipartisan, transparent measure couldn't be \nclearer. We shouldn't wait for the administration to fumble away \nanother 4 million Social Security numbers or personal addresses before \nwe help them get modernized and up to speed.\n  That hasn't stopped some Democratic leaders from thinking they should \ntry to score some political points by taking down a bipartisan measure \nto combat cyber attacks.\n  I hope they won't do that.\n  Most Americans would find it awfully cynical for Democratic leaders, \nin the wake of the administration's inability to stop such a massive \ncyber attack, to vote against the very same cyber security legislation \ntheir own party vetted and overwhelmingly endorsed in committee for the \nsake of scoring some kind of political point.\n  We have a smart, transparent, bipartisan, fully vetted measure before \nus that can help make our country safer.\n\n[[Page S4064]]\n\nSenators in both parties have a chance to offer other amendments to the \nbill and amend it, too.\n  My hope now is that we can work together to help pass a measure that \nis in support of the American people and backed by a broad coalition of \nsupporters--everyone from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to the U.S. \nTelecom Association. The sooner we do, the sooner we can conference it \nwith two similar White House-backed bills that passed the House, and \nthe sooner we can finally get a good cyber security law on the books to \nhelp protect Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/senate-section/article/S4064-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, that brings me then to the larger \ndebate the Senate is having this week. The bill the cyber measure has \nbeen offered to is the annual Defense authorization Act. It is a \nrelated issue. It is about protecting our country. It makes sense to \nconsider these issues together.\n  Now, the Defense bill is another measure that should be sailing to \npassage with strong bipartisan support. It does so almost every year. \nBut Democratic leaders now seem to have a different idea.\n  Here is a headline that just appeared in the Washington Post: \n``Democrats prepare for filibuster summer.''\n  ``Democrats prepare for filibuster summer.'' We can already feel \nAmericans just tense up. They don't even like the sound of it. Who \nwould?\n  Let me read just a few lines from that story: ``After almost six \nmonths in the minority . . . Senate Democrats aren't afraid to be \nobstructionists, detailing a strategy of blocking appropriations bills \nand other Republican agenda items until they get what they want''--\n``until they get what they want.''\n  ``Get ready for filibuster summer,'' the Post warned, because despite \nopening themselves ``to charges of hypocrisy,'' Democrats have \n``decided to block all spending bills starting with the defense \nappropriations measure.''\n  Putting the obvious hypocrisy aside, one thing is clear: The party \nleaders opposite seem to think this is all just a game.\n  Democratic leaders seem to think the pay raise for a soldier who \ngives everything to protect our country and who would give anything to \nprovide for her kids isn't something she has earned, but something she \ncan gamble with in a high-stakes game of ``Shutdown Roulette.''\n  Democratic leaders don't seem the least bit bothered by the dire \nnational security implications of what they are doing. They have packed \nthe car for their filibuster vacation, and they are ready to hit the \nroad, whatever the consequences for our country. They are heading down \nthis road at a time when ``the United States has not faced a more \ndiverse and complex array of crises since the end of World War II.''\n  Those are the words of Henry Kissinger. And he is right. From \nBeijing, Moscow, and the tribal areas of Pakistan, to Ramadi and \nTehran, we see unrest and global threats that threaten American values \nand American interests.\n  And what do we see from Democratic leaders? A serious plan?\n  We hear the President telling us he still doesn't even have one when \nit comes to confronting one of our most serious challenges--ISIL.\n  This is 8 months after he announced his intention to confront this \nthreat. This is 8 months after I and others called on the President to \nprovide us with a comprehensive plan to defeat this menace. And it is 8 \nmonths since I pledged that Congress would work with the administration \nto ensure our forces have the resources they need to carry out their \nmissions.\n  Republicans have kept up our end of the bargain, even if the \nPresident still doesn't have a serious plan.\n  The President asked us for $612 billion in his budget request to \nCongress. That is what he asked for. So we worked across the aisle to \ncraft a bipartisan Defense authorization bill at precisely that level. \nHe asked. We delivered.\n  The House version of this bill already passed by a big bipartisan \nmargin. The Senate version sailed out of the Armed Services Committee \non a vote of 22 to 4. We were all set to pass the very type of bill \nPresident Obama indicated he wanted, but then Democratic leaders \nstarted listening to that little partisan pat on their shoulder: Why \nnot take this opportunity to pump up that unrelated government spending \nwe like so much? Just threaten to filibuster pay raises for the troops \nuntil they shower more cash on the bureaucrats in Washington.\n  At a moment of grave and gathering threats, Democrats listened to \nthat partisan voice--that partisan voice.\n  At a time when our military families need all the support they can \nget, Democratic leaders reverted to partisan form and are now \nthreatening to blow up a bipartisan bill.\n  I would think this would be of some concern to commonsense Democrats. \nThey have to be wondering if their leaders have totally lost it--\ncompletely lost it--with this filibuster summer and holding our \nmilitary hostage.\n  We don't have to look too far to see the important role the military \nplays in each of our communities. I mentioned yesterday how important \nFort Campbell is to Kentucky. Let me now tell my colleagues a little \nbit about Fort Knox.\n  Fort Knox hosts the Army's Human Resources Command. It is a hub for \nmultiple major commands under the Training and Doctrine Command. \nBecause of its vast array of excellent training grounds and exceptional \ntraining facilities, Fort Knox also recently began hosting thousands of \ncadets for extensive annual training under the Army Leader's Training \nCourse. Not only has Fort Knox been leading the Army in energy \nindependence by developing the capability to go off the grid entirely, \nbut it also continues to make an exceptionally important contribution \nlocally, as well.\n  Fort Knox's economic impact on Hardin County and the surrounding \ncommunities stands at over $2 billion a year. My constituents in \nElizabethtown and across the Commonwealth know how important Fort Knox \nis to our community and to our country. They also know that passing the \nbipartisan Defense bill before us would allow for a critical new \nmedical facility to be built at Fort Knox. They don't want to see \nDemocratic leaders hold that medical facility hostage for unrelated \npartisan reasons.\n\n  Kentuckians and Americans know that supporting our troops is never \never a waste of time. They know that ensuring the military has the \ntools it needs isn't a game. Here is something else so many of our \nconstituents know: What America needs right now is not a summer of \nfilibusters but a season of serious bipartisan solutions. That is what \nthe Defense bill before us represents, and that is what this new \nCongress has been doing all year. We have gotten a lot done. There is a \nlot more we can do. And if rank-and-file Democrats reject their \nleader's partisan games in favor of keeping up the bipartisan work that \ngot us to this point instead--on a bill they joined Republicans to pass \nin committee 22 to 4--then that is just the kind of productive summer \nwe can keep working toward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/senate-section/article/S4064-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

JAMES BILLINGTON\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I admire and appreciate very much my friend \nthe Republican leader mentioning Dr. James Billington, a friend of \nmine.\n  I had a wonderful conversation with Dr. Billington yesterday. I wrote \nhim a nice letter talking about what we have done together over these \npast three decades.\n  It seems only yesterday that I was chairman of the Legislative Branch \nAppropriations Subcommittee and a new Senator here. One of the first \nattacks we got from Republicans at that time was to whack the Library \nof Congress. They even went after the magazines that were produced in \nbraille. I can remember the debate we had about Playboy magazine. I \ndon't know what they were trying to eliminate, but they tried. I don't \nknow what they could do with the braille in a Playboy magazine. But we \nwere able to turn that back.\n  I so appreciate this good man and what he has done. His academic \nrecord\n\n[[Page S4065]]\n\nis terrific. As a person, he is the best. We have traveled parts of the \nworld with him, together with Mark Hatfield, a Republican, who was one \nof the Republican leaders of the Senate, and I was a junior Senator at \nthe time. We had a great trip. Prior to coming to the Library of \nCongress, Jim Billington was the acting leader of our country on the \nSoviet Union. He is a wonderful man, and I ask that my remarks indicate \nthat I agree with every word the Republican leader said about Jim \nBillington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/senate-section/article/S4065-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4065-S4066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend the Republican leader threw around \nwords such as ``cynicism'' and ``hypocrisy.'' This speech my friend \ngave--I would suggest he walk into his office, his little bathroom in \nthere, and look into that mirror because over that mirror he should be \nable to see the words ``hypocrisy'' and ``cynicism'' because the speech \nhe gave was fervent with hypocrisy and cynicism.\n  We have tried very hard since the first of the year to cooperate with \nthe Republicans, and we have done it. On this bill which is before us \nnow, the Defense authorization bill--it is a bill I will talk about a \nlittle later in more detail--this is a piece of legislation which the \nPresident said before it left the committee was going to be vetoed. He \nnot only said it, he put it in writing. We cooperated. We allowed it to \ngo on the floor without the normal filibuster and the motion to proceed \nthat I had to approach when I led the Senate as the majority leader \nhundreds of times--hundreds of times. So we have cooperated. We haven't \nfilibustered getting on the bill, as I mentioned, and we have allowed \namendments to get pending and get votes. That is something the \nRepublicans would not let us do when this bill came up the last 2 \nyears. It is a major bill.\n  The Republican leader said a couple years ago, and I quote, ``The \nDefense authorization bill requires 4 or 5 weeks to debate.'' That is \nwhat he said.\n  So this work that he has done on this Defense authorization bill is \njust the height of hypocrisy and cynicism. He comes to the floor today \nand blames Barack Obama for the hacking that the Chinese did. He talks \nabout what a great bill we have. He stuck on this bill the cyber \nsecurity--for 5 years we tried to get up a cyber security bill. Every \ntime we brought it up, it was stopped by the Republicans. Every time. I \nmet in my office 5 years ago with five different committee chairs, and \nthey moved forward to try to get a bill out. Every step of the way, my \nRepublican friends blocked us. So talk about cynicism, hypocrisy.\n  On the Defense bill they talk about what a gift they gave to the \nPresident. They gave a gift to the President of $39 billion more \ndeficit spending. That is more deficit spending on the overseas \ncontingency fund. They refused to allow that on virtually everything \nelse.\n  My friend the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, in years past \nand, in fact, when this bill first came from the House, complained \nabout this phony gimmick they were using, but now my friend, with whom \nI came to Congress 33 years ago, suddenly likes this bill. I don't know \nhow he can do the backflip he did to come to this reasoning.\n  There is no better example of the dysfunction created by the \nRepublican leader and his party than what we have seen not in the last \n5\\1/2\\ months, the last 24 hours. Think about what he has done. We are \non the Defense authorization bill that the President said out loud and \nin writing he is going to veto. Everyone knows that. Every Republican \nknows that. But the Republican leader is hell-bent on moving forward \nwith this cynical ploy to pass a bill that is destined to be vetoed.\n  Yesterday, he even went further and intimated that Republicans love \nthe defense of this country through our military and we don't. At that \ntime, I said, and I repeat, every one of my Democratic Senators is a \npatriot. They believe in this country, and they support the military. \nSo supporting the military isn't a lock that the Republicans have.\n  To make matters worse, the Republican leader is now using this bill \nwhich should be focused on funding our troops to pull these diverting, \ndeceitful ploys on cyber security. On cyber security, with the \nRepublican leader's blessing, Senators Burr and McCain employed a \nrarely used device to get a cyber security amendment pending with no \nagreement, and then, before any action was taken, the Republican leader \nquickly filed cloture.\n  When the Senate considered the 2012 cyber security bill--and we tried \nso hard to get that out--Senator McConnell complained about cloture \nbeing filed too quickly, which I did because they wouldn't let us move \nat all on the bill.\n  In 2012, Senator McConnell said:\n\n       The few days the bill was on the floor, the majority \n     limited its consideration to debate only and then . . . filed \n     cloture. But, of course, that is kind of par for the course \n     around here. . . . The notion that we should just roll over \n     and wave through these bills without having a chance to \n     improve them and that Democratic Senators would be willing to \n     be rolled in such a way is ridiculous, especially on a bill \n     of this significance.\n\n  Yet, here the Republican leader is doing just what he lambasted \nbefore. Now, that really is par for the course over these last 5 \nmonths.\n  For 6 years, in three different Congresses, virtually everything \nPresident Obama tried to do and we tried to do was filibustered. That \nis no secret. Hundreds of times--hundreds of times on motions to \nproceed, gobbling up 30 hours here, 2 days here. Hundreds of times.\n  So now what we find is something that to me is even more troubling. \nThere have been press reports today that Republicans on the House side \nare involved in a vote-buying scheme on the trade bill by promising \nnever to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank. They are saying to these \nfew Republicans: If you vote to allow us to go forward with this trade \nbill, we won't do anything on the Export-Import Bank. What a shame.\n  Let me get this straight. Republicans want to pass a trade bill that \nhurts American workers, and in order to buy votes to make that happen, \nthey are going to kill 165,000 more jobs by letting Ex-Im Bank lapse. \nThe number of Americans working today because of the Bank, as we speak \ntoday, is 165,000.\n  Another part of this cynical ploy unfolded here on the Senate floor. \nThe Republican leader, who is intent on letting the Export-Import Bank \nlapse, allowed a token vote on the measure to try to appease the Bank's \nsupporters. The Republican leader immediately walks out in the last 24 \nhours and files an amendment on Ex-Im Bank and within hours files a \nmotion to table the amendment. Wow.\n  So we should not be easily fooled, and we are not. If the Bank \nexpires, there is no telling how long it will take to renew it--if, in \nfact, it ever happens. None should be fooled by these sham votes. If we \nwant to preserve the Bank, we should vote to extend it before it \nexpires on June 30 this year--in a couple weeks.\n  I am amazed it is even an issue. It wasn't that long ago that \nRepublicans believed that this Bank was good for America. Republican \nPresidents believed in it--Reagan, Bush, and Bush.\n  I remember when the Republican leader was in favor of the Bank. In \n1997, the Senator from Kentucky cosponsored legislation reauthorizing \nthe Bank's charter. With Senator McConnell's help, the Senate passed \nthat bill unanimously. That is the way we used to do it because it was \nso good for America. Again, 4 years later, the Republican leader signed \non to a letter encouraging George W. Bush to extend the Bank's charter, \nwhich, of course, he did. At that time, he and 29 other Republican \nSenators argued that allowing the Bank to lapse would be devastating to \nthe economy and in particular our trade deficit. Now the senior Senator \nfrom Kentucky has turned a legislative backflip and today wants the \nBank to disappear. Talk about hypocrisy. Talk about cynicism. Wow. As \nhe continues to remind everyone, he sets the schedule around here. Yet, \nhe cannot be bothered to schedule a vote on the Export-Import Bank \nbefore it lapses.\n  So what changed? Here is what changed. The Republican leader is not \nthe only Republican performing a breathtaking about-face on this issue. \nThe chairman of the banking committee supported the Export-Import Bank \nas recently as a year or two ago. In fact, the senior Senator from \nAlabama supported a 4-year renewal. If the\n\n[[Page S4066]]\n\nSenator from Alabama had gotten his way, the Bank would still have a \nyear left before the charter expired. But now the senior Senator from \nAlabama, speaking on the Bank's reauthorization, said, ``I believe at \nthe end of the day if it expires, we won't miss it.'' Tell that to \n165,000 people who will lose their jobs. Just last night, the banking \ncommittee chairman tried to table an amendment reauthorizing the \nExport-Import Bank. That motion failed overwhelmingly and displayed \nthat the Bank has a lot of support for reauthorization.\n  I don't mean to point a finger at just the Republican leader and the \nbanking committee chairman. Many other Senate Republicans have flipped \non this also and so quickly that I am sure their heads are spinning \neven as we speak.\n  To understand the Republican change of position, one need only look--\nwhere do we look? What do the Koch brothers want us to do? What do the \nKoch brothers want us to do? These Koch brothers are their billionaire \nbenefactors. Charles and David Koch adamantly oppose the Export-Import \nBank today but not yesterday. They were not always against the Bank.\n  Just like most other businesses in America, Koch Industries is always \nlooking for new markets for its goods. They should. That means the Koch \nbrothers are all for exports. How could they not be? After all, the \nKoch brothers got into business by selling services to Joseph Stalin. \nThat is where they got started--Joseph Stalin and his brutal Communist \nSoviet Union.\n  More recently, Koch Industries and its subsidiaries have used the \nExport-Import Bank to find an international marketplace for their \ngoods. The Hill newspaper reports that Koch companies Georgia-Pacific, \nJohn Zink, Molex, and Koch Heat Transfer, among others, received over \n$16 million in loans from the Bank. That is what the Bank is intended \nfor. That $16 million is to help sustain American jobs.\n  But it is stunningly hypocritical that the same Koch brothers are \nusing the Bank for loans they could literally write a check for and \nthat they are attacking as a corporate giveaway. This reminds me of the \ntime the Kochs attacked ObamaCare as collectivism. They probably know a \nlittle bit about it. That is where their business started. The Kochs \nattacked ObamaCare as collectivism, while collecting health subsidies \nthrough the Affordable Care Act. Talk about cynicism. Talk about \nhypocrisy.\n  Now, after benefiting from the Export-Import Bank, the Koch brothers \nfigure we have it all. Why should we try to help anybody else? We are \nmultibillionaires. That is an understatement. They are labeling it \n``corporate welfare'' and ``a handout'' for big business. I wonder if \nCharles and David got whiplash from their extreme turnaround. The \nKochs' main political arm, Americans for Prosperity, is now leading an \nall-out assault on the Bank. It is going to great lengths to pressure \nRepublicans to let the Bank's charter lapse.\n  It is one thing for a couple of oil baron billionaires to oppose a \nprogram for their own financial purposes; it is an entirely different \nthing for governing Republicans in Congress to do their bidding. But \nobviously that is what is happening. Why else the turnaround? \nRepublicans in Congress were for the Export-Import Bank until the Kochs \nwere against it. Now Republicans are running for cover, waiting to find \na way that they can try to rationalize not being for it, when they were \nfor it before.\n  One conservative news outlet run by the Heritage Foundation went so \nfar as to report that Republican Presidential hopefuls have to reject \nthe Export-Import Bank if they want the Koch's endorsement and \nfinancial backing. You cannot make up stuff better than this. The Daily \nSignal, for example, reports, ``An endorsement would likely turn on a \ncandidate's approach to one or more issues of importance to the Koch \nbrothers, beginning with their opposition to the Federal Export-Import \nBank.''\n  It would be tragic if the Export-Import Bank was not reauthorized \nbecause Republicans with White House ambitions or Senators who are \nafraid they are going to get a primary here in the Senate are more \ninterested in auditioning for the Koch brothers, as Presidential \ncandidates are and Republican leaders in Congress do. They go meet with \nthem a couple times a year to make sure they bow when they are supposed \nto and don't crowd and make sure they are called upon when they are \nasked to.\n  The Republican leader and his colleagues have completely altered \ntheir position on a program that supports 165,000 American jobs, jobs \nhere right in our country, many in their own States. Every State in the \nUnion benefits. Republicans have changed their opinion on a bank that \nhas returned $7 billion to the Treasury, our Treasury. It is a flip \nthat would make a trapeze artist cringe.\n  I say to my Republican friends: Just because the Koch brothers tell \nyou to jump, do you have to say: Well, how high do you want me to jump? \nWe do not have much time. The Export-Import Bank charter expires at the \nend of this month. Last night's vote proves there is support in this \nChamber to reauthorize this Bank. Sixty-five Senators voted in support \nof it last night. So I urge Senate Republicans to put aside their \nnonsensical backtracking on a program they themselves admitted was a \njob creator and understand where the real cynicism and hypocrisy lies \nin this Chamber.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/senate-section/article/S4066-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last month, the Senate passed the \nBipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of \n2015, which renews trade promotion authority or TPA. Years of hard work \nand compromise enabled us to pass this bill with strong bipartisan \nsupport in the Senate. Now with the Senate having already acted, all of \nour eyes are turned to the House of Representatives, where I know the \nSpeaker and the Republican leadership, not to mention the chairman of \nthe House Ways and Means Committee, who is the coauthor of the bill, \nare working to move this important bill forward.\n  I want to take some time to address some of the concerns I have heard \nfrom our House colleagues and others about this bill and the concept of \nTPA, in general. For example, I know some have claimed that TPA cedes \ntoo much congressional authority to the executive branch. This is a \nparticularly troublesome proposition for some of my Republican House \ncolleagues who might be wary of granting new powers to the current \noccupant of the White House.\n  Now, let me be clear. I have spent as much time as anyone in Congress \ncriticizing President Obama's Executive overreach. I have come to the \nfloor numerous times to catalog all the ways the current administration \nhas overstepped its authority on issues ranging from health care to \nimmigration, to labor policy. In fact, I was here just yesterday \ntalking about efforts on the part of the administration to unilaterally \nundermine welfare reform.\n  So when people say they are worried about legislation that would take \npower from Congress and give it to this President, believe me, I \nunderstand. I would worry about that, too, but that is not what our TPA \nlegislation does. Simply put, TPA is a compact between the House, the \nSenate, and the administration.\n  With TPA in place, the administration agrees to pursue negotiating \nobjectives established by Congress and is required to consult with \nCongress on a regular basis during the whole negotiating process. In \nreturn, the House and Senate agree to vote on any trade agreement that \nmeets those requirements under a specified timeline without amendments. \nThe President does not have any new powers under this compact and \nCongress does not give up any powers.\n\n[[Page S4067]]\n\n  In fact, the primary purpose of TPA is to enhance Congress's role in \nthe negotiating process. That is right. Despite some claims that TPA is \nan abrogation of congressional power, the opposite is actually true. \nWithout TPA, the Members of Congress and their constituents have no \nstrong voice on establishing our trade priorities. With TPA, Congress \ncan define trade negotiating objectives and priorities.\n  Without TPA, the administration is under no formal obligation to \nprovide Congress with meaningful information on the status of ongoing \ntrade negotiations. With TPA, Congress can require the administration \nto provide frequent updates and consultations. For example, the Senate-\npassed TPA bill will ensure that any Member of Congress who wants \naccess to the negotiating text, at any time during the negotiations, \nwill get that access.\n  In addition, Members of Congress will, once again at any time, be \nable to request and receive a briefing from the USTR, the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, on the current status of ongoing trade negotiations. In \nother words, TPA gives Congress a much stronger say in the substance of \nour country's trade negotiations and provides mechanisms to hold the \nadministration far more accountable.\n  Right now, the Obama administration is negotiating trade agreements \nwith only ad hoc and informal direction from Congress. That will change \nonce Congress renews TPA. Still, I know there are some who believe that \nby agreeing not to allow amendments or filibusters of trade agreements, \nCongress is giving up most of its power to influence trade agreements \non the back end once an agreement is actually signed.\n  Again, let me be clear. Under TPA, Congress at all times--all times--\nmaintains the ultimate authority over a trade agreement, the power to \nreject it entirely. TPA does not guarantee the passage of any trade \nagreement now or in the future, nor does it, as some have argued, \nreduce votes in Congress to a ``rubberstamp'' for the administration.\n  This is important, as there has been some confusion on this point. \nWith the coming vote on TPA, the House of Representatives is not voting \nto approve any individual trade agreement. I know pundits and talking \nheads in the media have tried to conflate passage of TPA with \nCongress's approval of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but in reality \nthese are separate and distinct propositions.\n  Case in point: Over the last couple of years, I have been the most \noutspoken advocate in Congress in favor of renewing TPA. However, \nthroughout that time, I have made it abundantly clear that my support \nfor TPA does not guarantee any support for the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership. Indeed, I am fully prepared to vote against the TPP if the \nadministration falls short on reaching high-priority negotiating \nobjectives. Many on this side of the aisle and on the other side of the \naisle have informed them of some of these high-priority negotiating \nobjectives.\n  But even if maintaining the power to accept or reject the trade \nagreement is not enough, the Senate-passed TPA bill contains \nprocedures, including an all-new procedure that will enable Congress to \nstrip procedural protections from any trade agreement if it determines \nthere was inadequate consultation or that the negotiating objectives \nhave not been met.\n  Additionally, under the bill, both the House and the Senate maintain \ntheir constitutional prerogative to change their respective rules to \noverride TPA. So as you can see, the Congress has not given up any of \nits powers under TPA. In addition to preserving and enhancing \nCongress's role in trade policy, the Senate-passed TPA bill contains a \nnumber of provisions that actually constrain the administration as it \nnegotiates and implements new trade agreements.\n  For example, the bill ensures that implementing bills to trade \nagreements will include--and I am quoting the text of the bill here--\n``only such provisions as are strictly necessary or appropriate to \nimplement'' trade agreements. Additionally, the bill makes clear that \nany commitments made by the administration that are not disclosed to \nCongress before an implementing bill for an agreement is introduced \nwill not be considered as part of the agreement and will have no force \nof law.\n  Furthermore, the bill also ensures that trade agreements cannot be \nused to undermine U.S. sovereignty, another concern I have heard about \nTPA and one I wanted to make sure we were protecting against. The bill \naccomplishes this goal in four important ways; first, it makes clear \nthat any provision of the trade agreement that is inconsistent with \nFederal or State law will have no effect; second, the bill states \nspecifically that Federal and State laws will prevail in the event of a \nconflict with the trade agreement; third, it affirms that no trade \nagreement can prevent Congress or the States from changing their laws \nin the future; fourth, it confirms that the administration cannot \nunilaterally change U.S. law.\n  All of these provisions have been drafted with an eye toward \nmaintaining the separation of powers and ensuring that no \nadministration can use trade agreements to unilaterally write U.S. laws \nor policy. Now, we have all heard claims that the President intends to \nuse trade agreements to change our immigration laws or enact strict \nclimate change standards. TPA ensures that throughout the process of \nnegotiating, finalizing, and approving a trade agreement, Congress \nstays in the driver's seat.\n  Finally, I want to address the concerns I have heard about the \nsupposed secrecy surrounding the TPP agreement. Some of our House \ncolleagues, as well as a number of people in the media, have decried \nthe fact that details of the TPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, have \nnot yet been made public. They have also argued that by renewing the \nTPA before the details of the deal are disclosed, Congress would be \nenabling further secrecy. Again, this reflects a simple \nmisunderstanding of simple negotiation tactics.\n\n  The TPP is still being negotiated. As with any high-stakes \nnegotiation, some level of confidentiality is a must if we are going to \nget the best deal possible with 11 other countries at the table.\n  In all sensitive negotiations, there is a time for disclosure and a \ntime to hold your cards close to your chest. So I recognize that with \ntrade negotiations, our government is negotiating on behalf of the \nAmerican people. We need to ensure that the maximum amount of \ntransparency is possible.\n  Fortunately, the Senate-passed TPA bill strikes an appropriate \nbalance to deal with these issues, providing unprecedented levels of \ntransparency and oversight into the trade-negotiating process. Under \nour bill, the full text of a completed trade agreement must be made \npublic at least 60 days before the President can even sign it--be made \npublic at least 60 days before the President can even sign it. Talk \nabout transparency--this is an all-new requirement, giving the American \npeople new and unprecedented access and knowledge of all trade \nagreements well before they are even submitted to the Congress for \napproval.\n  After that 60-day period has expired and the President signs an \nagreement, he must submit to Congress the legal text of the trade \nagreement and a Statement of Administrative Action at least 30 days \nbefore formally submitting an implementing the bill. As I noted \nearlier, the bill includes all-new requirements giving Members of \nCongress access to text and information throughout the negotiating \nprocess.\n  Any Member of the House of Representatives that supports free trade \nwho is concerned about the secrecy of current negotiations should be \nthe first in line to support the Senate-passed TPA bill. Once again, \nany supporters of expanded U.S. exports who are also wary of executive \noverreach should be trumpeting their support for our bill.\n  The Senate TPA bill enhances Congress's role in trade negotiations. \nThe Senate TPA bill maintains Congress's power to accept or reject any \nfuture trade agreement. The Senate TPA bill prevents the President from \npursuing unilateral changes to U.S. law or policy. And the Senate TPA \nbill provides unprecedented levels of transparency and oversight into \nthese trade agreements or into any trade agreements that may come \nforward, including TPP.\n  I am sure that some of the cynics out there have one more question: \nIf TPA imposes all of these requirements and restrictions on the \nadministration, why does the President want it so badly?\n\n[[Page S4068]]\n\n  The answer to that question is simple. TPA is necessary in order for \nour negotiators to get a good deal. We know this is the case. Without \nTPA in place, our negotiating partners have no guarantees that the deal \nthey sign will be one Congress will consider.\n  Without those guarantees, they are less likely to put their best \noffers on the table because they will have no assurance that our \ncountry can deliver on the deal or any deal they enter into with us. \nMake no mistake, we need to get good deals at the negotiating table.\n  More than 95 percent of the world's consumers live outside of our \ncountry, the United States. If our farmers, manufacturers, and \nentrepreneurs are going to compete on the world stage, they need access \nto these customers.\n  History has shown that high-standard free-trade agreements expand \nmarket access for U.S. exporters and reduce our trade deficits. Most \nimportantly, they grow our economy, create good, high-paying jobs for \nworkers here at home, and improve living standards for our citizens and \nfor our trading partners. If the United States is going to advance its \nvalues and interests in the international marketplace, we need to be \nwriting the rules and setting the standards. We cannot do that if we \nare sitting on the sidelines.\n  This is an important bill. I was very pleased to see it pass the \nSenate with bipartisan support.\n  I hope that in the coming days, we will see a similar result in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

BURWELL\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, we expect a ruling this month in the \nSupreme Court case of King v. Burwell, which will have such an impact \non families all across America and on the affordability and \navailability of health insurance for them and for their families. This \nis an incredibly important issue.\n  As someone who was there in the Senate Finance Committee at virtually \nevery meeting--and who helped write the tax credit section of the \nbill--I wish to remind my colleagues of what is at stake in this \ndecision.\n  During the Finance Committee markups, I worked very hard to make sure \nthe affordability tax credits, which provide tax cuts for millions of \nAmericans, were meaningful in helping people buy health insurance \nthrough the marketplaces. It took a lot of work to get those tax \ncredits written into the Affordable Care Act. In fact, as my colleagues \nknow, certainly on this side of the aisle, I would go to every meeting \nwith charts and graphs, looking at what people would have to pay under \nvarious levels of tax cuts and how to make sure it was affordable. The \ngreat news is that the majority of Americans today are able to purchase \naffordable health insurance for less than $100 a month, and that was a \nlot of work to get done. That is really what is at stake right now.\n  Now, I know there are people who don't like the law that was written, \nbut the legal argument being presented in the Supreme Court right now \nmakes absolutely no sense. Folks on the Republican side of the aisle \nare asking the Supreme Court to raise the taxes of some 6.4 million \nAmericans. We are talking about $1.7 billion in tax increases going to \nall these States in the red, including my own.\n  We have Members of the Senate cheering on a court that could rule \nthat there would be a $1.7 billion tax increase on their own \nconstituents. Don't count me in as one of those who are cheering that \non. I don't understand it.\n  These Members of Congress are effectively saying that people in \nMassachusetts, where there is a State exchange, can have a tax cut and \nthe affordable coverage that comes with it, but people in Oklahoma \ncan't have a tax cut. They are suggesting it is fine for people who \nlive in the District of Columbia to get tax cuts to help pay for their \ninsurance, but people in Louisiana cannot or that people in New York \ncan have tax cuts to help pay for their insurance, but people in Texas \ncannot.\n  Now, to drive this point home, I wish to take a moment to look at how \nmany people in each State are at risk of a tax increase based on the \nSupreme Court ruling, because this is very important to literally \nmillions and millions of Americans.\n  In Alabama the Supreme Court could raise taxes through their decision \non 132,253 people. Over 132,000 people will find out this month whether \nthey get a tax increase as a result of the Supreme Court decision.\n  In Alaska, we see the possibility of 16,583 people in the Last \nFrontier State who would see an average of $536 more in taxes as a \nresult of the possible decision being urged on by Republicans in the \nHouse and Senate.\n  In Arizona, the Grand Canyon State, over 126,000 people--Americans--\nwould see a tax increase. There would be $20 million total in tax \nincreases in Arizona, depending on how the Supreme Court rules.\n  Let's go on to what is called the Natural State, Arkansas, where \n48,100 people will see an average increase of $284 as a result of the \nSupreme Court decision if they rule against what we know was done \ncorrectly in terms of writing the Affordable Care Act.\n  Let's go on and look at Delaware, the First State, where 19,128 \npeople would see their taxes go up--a tax increase in Delaware, \ndepending on what the Supreme Court does later this month.\n  In Florida, the Sunshine State, it is over 1.3 million people--\n1,324,516 people--and we are looking at almost $390 million in tax \nincreases that would be coming from the State of Florida if the Supreme \nCourt sides with Republicans and makes that decision that will increase \npeople's taxes.\n  In Georgia, the Peach State, 412,385 Georgians will see a tax \nincrease as a result of the Supreme Court if the Supreme Court does \nwhat the Republicans want to have done.\n  In Illinois, 232,371 people living in Illinois, next to Michigan, our \ngreat friends in Illinois--almost $50 million in tax increases in \nIllinois will happen beginning at the end of this month if the Supreme \nCourt rules the way Republicans want them to rule.\n  In Indiana, also next to the great State of Michigan, 159,802 people \nliving in Indiana, Hoosiers, will see their taxes go up if the Supreme \nCourt rules against providing tax cuts.\n  In Iowa, the Hawkeye State, 34,172 Iowans will see their taxes go up. \nThese are families. These are working families. These are families \nworking hard, with one job, maybe two jobs, maybe three jobs. There \nprobably are folks who are certainly included in this who lost the \nequity in their homes after what happened with the great recession and \nare trying to dig themselves out of the hole and are celebrating the \nfact that they can go to bed at night not having to worry if the kids \nget sick, if they can take them to the doctor. Most of them are able to \nbuy health insurance for less than $100 a month because of the tax cuts \nwe passed in the Affordable Care Act.\n  In Kansas, the Sunflower State, 69,979 people--almost 70,000 people \nin Kansas--will see their taxes go up if the Supreme Court sides with \nthe Republican position on the Affordable Care Act.\n  In Louisiana, the Pelican State, 137,940 people who live in \nLouisiana--almost $45 million would come out of this State in tax \nincreases if the Supreme Court sides with the Republican position \nregarding the Affordable Care Act.\n  In Maine there are 60,939 people who represent families--people who \nhave families, who have children, spouses--who are now able to afford \ninsurance, most of them for under $100 a month, maybe for the first \ntime ever because of the tax cuts, tax credits that are translated into \ntax cuts for people in the Affordable Care Act.\n  This one means the most to me, of course, and that is my home State \nof Michigan. There is no way, by the way, I would have ever voted to do \nthis. The idea that we voted for something that would make all of this \nhappen is pretty crazy. Obviously, that was not legislative intent. But \nin Michigan, 228,388 people in my State, men and women and their \nchildren, will, in fact, see a tax increase if the Supreme Court rules \nwith the Republican position at the end of this month.\n  Missouri, the Show Me State: Well, I will tell you what they don't \nwant to show are more tax increases--197,663 people in Missouri, and we \nare talking about $55 million coming out of the State of Missouri. \nThese are families\n\n[[Page S4069]]\n\nwho will pay more and, in many cases, not be able to afford health care \nanymore for their families. So they are going to pay more, and they are \nnot going to have health care.\n  Mississippi, the Magnolia State: There are 75,613 people. That State \nwill see over $26 million in total tax increases.\n  Montana, the Treasure State: 41,766 people in Montana. It is close to \n$10 million in total that will come out of Montana, from Montana \nfamilies, in tax increases, if the Supreme Court sides with the \nRepublican position in the House and the Senate and raises people's \ntaxes.\n  Nebraska: 56,910 Nebraskans will see their taxes go up an average of \n$257 each--almost $15 million in total coming from Nebraska.\n  New Hampshire: The Supreme Court decision could raise taxes on almost \n30,000 people--29,996 people--in New Hampshire who have health \ninsurance now, most for under $100 a month. They will probably lose \ntheir health care and the bonus is they will get a tax increase that \nwill, in total, be almost $8 million.\n  New Jersey, the Garden State: 172,345 people in New Jersey are all \nlooking at about $54 million in tax increases--this is New Jersey \nalone--who will get less health care and more taxes.\n  North Carolina, the Tar Heel State: 458,738 people. That is a lot of \npeople in North Carolina--458,738 people--who today have the peace of \nmind of knowing if they get sick, they can go to a doctor, take their \nchildren to the doctor, they can prevent themselves from getting sick \nby having preventive care and cancer screenings and all those things we \nwant for ourselves and our families. They will see their taxes go up if \nthe Supreme Court sides with the Republican position.\n  North Dakota: 14,115 individuals will see their taxes go up. We are \nlooking at $3.3 million in small States such as North Dakota where \nfamilies will pay an increase in taxes.\n  Ohio: 161,011 people in Ohio. The Buckeye State--the great rivals of \nmy State. There are 161,011 Ohioans who are looking at $41 million in \ntotal tax increases. They are looking at less health care and more \ntaxes if the Supreme Court sides with the Republican position sometime \nbetween now and the end of the month.\n  The Sooner State of Oklahoma: 87,136 people living in Oklahoma. This \nis another State near and dear to me. This is where my mom grew up. She \nlived on a farm and actually picked cotton. I know how hard they work. \nSo 87,136 people in Oklahoma will see over $18 million come from this \nState. These are men and women who just want to make sure they have \nhealth care for their children so they can respond if somebody gets \nsick, if somebody has cancer, if somebody needs to have some health \ncare help. They will see less health care and $18 million more in tax \nincreases if the Supreme Court sides with the Republican position this \nmonth.\n  Pennsylvania, the Keystone State: 348,823 people. Again, a big State \nand a lot of people in Pennsylvania--348,823 people. This State will \nsee almost $80 million in total tax increases. So less health care, \nmore taxes, if the Supreme Court gets this wrong and sides with the \nRepublican position.\n  South Carolina: 154,221 people in South Carolina will see their taxes \ngo up, meaning about $43 million in total if this decision goes against \nthe American people.\n  South Dakota, the Mount Rushmore State: This is another small State, \nbut every single person there who is getting health care today and is \npaying less for it--most folks under $100 a month--is going to care \nabout this. There are 16,811 people in South Dakota who will get tax \nincreases and less health care if the Supreme Court makes the wrong \ndecision, if the Supreme Court in this case sides with the Republican \nposition.\n  Tennessee: 155,753 people in Tennessee will see their taxes go up, \nwith a total of about $34 million just from Tennessee alone.\n  Texas: And here we begin to see bigger numbers. Again, big State, big \nnumbers--832,334 people in Texas, and we are talking about over $205 \nmillion in increased costs, increased taxes on people who live in Texas \nwho just want to be able to provide health care for themselves and \ntheir children. That is all. This is not some big frill we are talking \nabout here. It is pretty basic. We cannot control whether we get sick. \nWe are looking at 832,000-plus people who are holding their breath \nwaiting to see what the Supreme Court is going to do and whether they \nare going to side with them or they are going to side with the \nRepublican position.\n  Utah: 86,330 individuals in Utah who will see their taxes go up, all \ntogether about $18 million.\n  Virginia: 285,938 people. Pretty close by in Virginia. Again, on \naverage, they will see a $258 increase in their taxes or a total of $74 \nmillion from Virginia. This is just across the bridge here.\n  West Virginia, the Mountain State: We have 26,145 West Virginians who \nwould all, in total, see over $8 million coming out of the State of \nWest Virginia if the Supreme Court sides with the Republican position \non the tax credits under health care.\n  Wisconsin: 166,142 people. This is another close neighbor of ours in \nMichigan. There are 166,000-plus people who will see over $52 million \ncoming right across Lake Michigan, as we look across at Wisconsin. So \nless health care and taxes go up if the Supreme Court gets this wrong \nand sides with the Republican position.\n  And finally, Wyoming: 16,937 individuals and over $7 million coming \nfrom the State of Wyoming in total taxes if the Supreme Court gets this \nwrong.\n  Madam President, a central question for Justices to consider in King \nv. Burwell is legislative intent. That is a question I am, frankly, \nvery qualified to answer, given how engaged I was in crafting the \nAffordable Care Act and especially the tax cuts represented in the \naffordable tax credits. I was there. I can speak firsthand to what the \nintent was.\n  The core purpose of this law was to make sure health care coverage \nwas affordable for every American. Pretty simple. And to achieve that, \nI fought very hard to make sure these tax credits would be available; \nthat they would be enough to make the difference.\n  I pushed so hard for these tax cuts in the Finance Committee markup \nthat Chairman Baucus ended up calling me ``Senator Affordability'' in \nthe process. I knew we had to get that right for every American, \nincluding those in my State. The key to this Affordable Care Act is for \nindividuals and small businesses to be able to pool their risk to help \ndrive down the cost for everyone, and it is doing that.\n  So the law created the marketplaces where Americans could shop. We \nalso wanted to give States the right to create a marketplace of their \nown, if that was their preference. Now, here is the important part. We \ndidn't want States to feel like they were being forced to create a \nmarketplace, so we gave them a choice: either a Federal marketplace or \nyou could choose a State marketplace.\n  The Federal marketplace created healthcare.gov. With healthcare.gov, \nevery American has an opportunity to go online to see if they qualify \nfor these savings, driven by the tax credits created within the \nAffordable Care Act. The great news is that 6.4 million Americans are \ngetting those tax cuts right now.\n  Now the Court is considering the ludicrous idea that Congress \nactually meant to make those tax credits available in States that \ncreated their own exchanges but only in those States; that somehow we \nwere not trying to make sure everybody in the United States had access \nto affordable health care and lower taxes and to put that money toward \nproviding health care--not every exchange, not every State, not every \nperson buying health insurance, only Americans living in States with a \nState-created exchange. That is what they have to believe in order to \ntake the position the Republicans are asking us to take.\n\n  I can't think of a single instance in the history of our country \nwhere Members of the U.S. Congress have voted to give tax cuts to \npeople in one State and not to people in another State, particularly if \nit is their own State that is not getting the tax cut.\n  Senator Max Baucus from Montana was chair of the Finance Committee at \nthat time. In Montana, there was no plan to set up a State health care \nexchange. It is totally absurd to suggest that Senator Baucus would \nhelp write--would lead the writing of a health care bill with tax cuts \nfor the\n\n[[Page S4070]]\n\npeople of other States and not his own State. Why would I, as a Senator \nfrom Michigan, push so hard for these tax credits in the Affordable \nCare Act that my own constituents wouldn't qualify for but people in \nother States would? That makes no sense whatsoever. The legislative \nintent here is crystal clear.\n  So we have this bizarre situation where colleagues across the aisle \nare asking the Court to strike down the tax cuts and raise taxes on \nmillions of their own constituents.\n  My belief on this issue is the same as it was 5 years ago when I \npushed the tax credits through the Finance Committee: The right to get \nthose tax credits has nothing to do with where you live in the United \nStates of America; it has to do with whether you need health care for \nyourself and your children. If you are an American, then you deserve \nthe opportunity to receive these tax cuts that will make health care \naffordable for you and your family. Whether you get your plan through a \nState exchange or through the Federal Government, it doesn't matter. \nThat was intent of the law when we wrote it; that is how the law has \nworked since the marketplace opened; and that is how it should continue \ninto the future.\n  Finally, I want to make it absolutely clear that the bill authored by \nthe Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Johnson, is not a repeal-and-replace \nplan; it is a Trojan horse that would completely destroy the health \ncare law that is currently providing medical care for over 16 million \nAmericans in our country. Experts tell us it would lead to a death \nspiral, where rates would go up so high that only sick people would be \nwilling to pay the premiums, making insurance completely unaffordable \nfor American families. It would let your State decide what health \nbenefits are essential to your family, meaning a family in Iowa could \nhave completely different protections from someone living a few miles \naway in Minnesota. It puts an expiration date on the tax credits that \nmake health coverage affordable. Conveniently enough, though, it \nextends the tax cuts until after the 2016 election. And there is the \nreal danger that when the guarantee of these tax cuts expires in \nSeptember 2017, they will not be renewed. By putting that expiration \ndate after the election, it is clear that this bill's first priority \nisn't finding a way to make health care affordable; its priority is \ndelaying a massive tax increase until after the election. The priority \nis to win an election first and dismantle affordable health care \ncoverage second.\n  My hope and, frankly, my prayer is that the Court recognizes what I \nknow to be true: that the language of this law is consistent with the \noriginal intent, which is clear from the very first words of the law, \ntitle I, page 1. Here is what it says: ``Quality, Affordable Health \nCare for All Americans''--not Americans in some States and not others, \nall Americans.\n  It is my deep hope that the Court ruling will allow us to lock in \naffordable health care coverage for good. Then we can move on and spend \nour time more productively, focusing on how to make a good law even \nbetter for families, communities, businesses, and providers. I hope \nthat will be the opportunity we will have.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer).

Madam President, I rise today to speak about the growing \nburden of Federal regulations and the need to rein in the creation of \nnew rules and the expansion of existing rules. The regulatory burden in \n2014 is reported to be nearly $2 trillion, and the Federal Register \nlast year came out to nearly 78,000 pages of new rules and regulations. \nThis chart shows that 78,000 pages of regulations is all too common, \nespecially for this administration, where regulatory overreach has \nbecome normal, and the size of the Federal Register has topped 80,000 \npages for 4 out of the 6 years of the President's time in office. With \nthis administration, we are seeing a high-water mark of regulations \nthat are drowning American families and businesses.\n  The flood of regulations has been getting bigger every year for the \npast 2\\1/2\\ decades under administrations from both parties. We can't \nafford to keep piling on these rules. The economic burden of Federal \nregulations is clear. One study estimated that the regulatory burden in \nthe United States cost more than $1.8 trillion in 2014 and was bigger \nthan the GDP of India.\n  My second chart puts this in perspective: Only the 10 largest \neconomies are bigger than the U.S. regulatory burden all by itself.\n  This burden is real. Some studies have estimated the regulatory drag \non economic growth in the United States to be as high as 2 percent per \nyear over the last 6\\1/2\\ decades. An annual report from the \nCompetitive Enterprise Institute also noted that in 2014 regulations \ncost the average household nearly $15,000. A study by the Small \nBusiness Administration found that regulations increase costs by more \nthan $10,000 per employee.\n  The fact that we cannot afford this burden is just as clear. Economic \ngrowth in the first quarter shrank by seven-tenths of 1 percent. If we \nget a growth of 1 percent, it increases the revenue, without raising \ntaxes, to the United States by $300 billion. That is according to the \nCongressional Budget Office. According to the President's budget \nperson, it would increase it by $400 billion. Imagine what a seventh-\ntenths loss costs us.\n  Complex regulations are costly and time-consuming, especially for \nsmall businesses. Small business owners and their employees have to \ntake on dozens of different responsibilities to make their business \nwork. They have to be compliance experts now, and that takes time and \nresources away that they need to put toward growing their business and \nsucceeding. I have spoken to many businesses in Wyoming that have \nstopped measuring their permitting applications in pages because it is \neasier to measure them in feet.\n  Businesses are struggling in this regulatory environment because they \ncan't make long-term plans for investments. They don't know what new \nregulation might come out next month that will change their entire \nbusiness model. And the problem with complex permitting and regulatory \nrequirements is not just the cost that existing businesses have to \nbear; it also comes as a cost in businesses that don't even get started \nbecause the Federal Government has placed a mountain of paperwork \nbetween their idea and success.\n  The rush of regulations by this administration is clear. President \nObama's administration has issued\n\n[[Page S4071]]\n\nmore than 80 regulations that have a price tag of more than $100 \nmillion each. That is, at a minimum, $80 billion in costs for this \nadministration's rules.\n  But what is more disturbing is not just the willingness to churn out \nmore redtape but to find new and creative ways to do it. Agencies are \nonly supposed to create new rules when they have clear authority from \nCongress to do so and can demonstrate a real need for the regulations. \nHowever, we are seeing more and more examples of the administration \nfinding new justifications and new interpretations of laws that \nCongress has passed in order to get around Congress.\n  President Obama said that because he is unable to rely on Congress to \nachieve his agenda, he intends to use Executive orders. We have seen \nthat with the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Labor \nRelations Board, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is \ncollecting everybody's data as we speak, the National Security Agency, \nand so many other Federal agencies that are willing to read new \nauthorities into existing laws and grant themselves new powers that \nCongress never intended.\n  One place that is willing to force through an agenda regardless of \ncongressional intent, the will of the people, or the Constitution, is \nin the energy sector. Energy is one of the main drivers of our economy. \nYet, this administration is doing everything it can to wage a \nregulatory war on coal by releasing rules and regulations designed to \nmake coal harder to produce and making energy more expensive to use in \nour Nation. Anyone who uses electricity should be concerned about \nthis--oh yeah, that is everybody, isn't it?\n  I recently talked to some sisters who were driving from Arizona to \nWyoming. They were running low on gas, so they stopped in Colorado to \nfill up. The power was out at the gas station, so they couldn't pump \ngas or get a snack or use the restroom. All of these things--the gas \npump, the cash register, the restroom lights--depend on electricity. \nThink of all the things around you that depend on electricity. Almost \neverything we do depends on electricity. Yet, this administration seems \nto want to do anything it can to drive up the cost of electricity.\n  A few years ago, Senators on both sides of the aisle realized that \ncoal is one of our best sources of energy, the only stockpileable one, \nand rejected a cap-and-tax as an extremely expensive and bad idea--\nbipartisan. Now the administration is moving forward on a backdoor cap-\nand-tax proposal. They believe the best way to reach their goals of \npromoting alternative energy sources is to make the current sources \nmore and more expensive to produce and to use. This hurts consumers, it \nhurts jobs, and it hurts our economy.\n  It is a simple fact: Make it more expensive to mine coal, and the \ncoal industry will be less profitable. Make it more expensive to use \ncoal to produce energy, and consumers will see a hit on their energy \nbills each and every month. Make it more difficult to turn a profit \nwith coal, and coal workers will find themselves with fewer benefits, \nless job security, and a lot less employment, which costs the \ngovernment more for unemployment.\n  This administration has made it clear that they do not care about \nthese costs. The Small Business Advocate wrote EPA that their review \npanel on the Clean Power Plan was only checking the box and ``is \nunlikely to succeed at identifying reasonable regulatory alternatives \nfor small businesses.'' The incomplete information they provided \n``greatly limits [small entity representatives'] ability to propose \npotential regulatory flexibilities or discuss the costs and benefits of \nparticular regulatory alternatives.''\n  Rural electric cooperatives, transmission companies, and municipal \nutilities are going to bear the costs of these coal regulations. This \nis where our communities get their electricity, so those costs will \nlikely be passed on to consumers. Businesses really have no other \nchoice.\n  Several Members are pushing back on this regulatory overreach. For \nexample, I am proud to cosponsor a bill Senator Vitter introduced \nearlier this week to protect small business from the onslaught of \nregulations. But the recent case of the Colowyo mine is a good example \nof how the administration does not care about a loss of jobs or costs \nto consumers and is a clear signal to Congress that we have to do more \nto oppose this.\n  Coal produced by this mine is responsible for employing over 200 \npeople. The Craig Power Station in Senator Gardner's State of Colorado \nsends power to a tristate cooperative which provides service in the \nWest. If the cooperative goes offline, electricity prices for electric \ncustomers will rise. Why would it go offline? Because of a little \nvacation on the mine planned from 2007.\n  Senator Gardner, will this affect your State's mine? But it also sets \na wider precedent against our most dependable fuel source.\n  So what does taking this one mine offline--I know they are picking on \na small one. That is easier to do than pick on a big one. But what does \nit mean to your constituents?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. GARDNER. I thank the Senator from Wyoming through the Chair for \nbringing that point to our colleagues about what is happening in \nwestern Colorado and the Colowyo mine.\n  The Senator from Wyoming mentioned in his comments that sometimes the \nregulations from this administration can and should be measured in a \nmatter of feet and not just pages because that is how many new \nregulations are being piled upon businesses in this country.\n  In the case of the Colowyo Mine, though, a 2007 permit is being \nbrought into question by a Federal court that has given this mine 120 \ndays--the Office of Surface Mining--to rectify a decision that was made \nback in 2007. This is a court case that was brought 8 years after the \n2007 permit was granted.\n  If the 120 days go by and the court decides that the review was not \ncomplete by the Office of Surface Mining, it could result in a shutdown \nof the Colowyo Mine. As you mentioned, this will result in 220 layoffs. \nCommunities in western Colorado of Craig and Meeker will be devastated.\n  This mine is responsible for about $200 million in economic impact to \nWestern Colorado. It pays almost $10 million to the Federal Government \nin terms of taxes. It pays about $1 million to the State of Colorado in \nterms of severance taxes. Think about the impact that losing 220 people \nwould have on the Main Street of Craig, CO, and on the people of \nMeeker, CO. Think about the impacts this would have on families and the \nkids of the 220 employees who are being pulled out of school systems. \nMaybe $100,000 or more of impact to schools that can barely afford the \nloss already. That is just to mention the direct impacts to those \ncommunities of this court decision, and, by the way, we only have about \n85 or 86 days left to rectify this permit decision if the Department of \nthe Interior decides they are not going to appeal this decision. You \nhave about 80-some days to make this decision that could affect the \nlives of 220 people, that could affect $200 million worth of economic \nactivity.\n  You mentioned that this power is from an electric co-op. The Senator \nfrom Wyoming mentioned that this power is from an electricity co-op, a \ncooperative. There are no shareholders. There are no stockholders. \nThere is no guaranteed income to Tri-State.\n  This is an organization that is a cooperative. It is designed to be \nowned by its members, those people who receive power through the \ncooperative. When we increase the cost of electricity by closing down a \nmine that feeds the Craig Power Station, in this case, you are \nincreasing the cost of that electricity. You are taking money out of \nthe hands of members across the Tri-State region, whether that is in \nWyoming, Colorado, New Mexico or Nebraska. Those costs will get borne \nby the members of the cooperative.\n  One thing that we know as well is that Tri-State is one of those \ncooperatives that provide electricity to some of the poorest areas in \nColorado. They are some of the areas that can least afford it. As a \nresult of this decision, it will increase the cost of electricity, and \nthose costs will be borne by those people who can least afford it--\npeople on low income, people on fixed income, people in rural areas of \nour State who do not have as high an income as other areas in the State \nor country may have. This will have a significant economic impact.\n\n[[Page S4072]]\n\n  In fact, the Senator from Wyoming may or may not know that a number \nof Members of Congress from the Colorado congressional delegation have \nwritten letters to the Department of the Interior urging them to appeal \nthis decision as well as to put a stay on this decision, as we have 80-\nsome days left and because 220 people, their lives, their livelihoods, \ntheir jobs are at stake, and these are small communities. They are \ncommunities that can be economically devastated with 220 job losses.\n  The Presiding Officer represents a State where there are many towns \nwhere five jobs are a really big deal, two jobs are a really big deal, \none job is a really big deal. For a community that is the size of the \ntown that I live in--3,000 people or so--to lose 220 jobs would be \neconomic catastrophe.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a letter from Governor John Hickenlooper to the Honorable Sally \nJewell, Secretary of the Interior, asking for an appeal of this \ndecision. I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nletter written by Congressman Ed Perlmutter to appeal this decision. In \naddition, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nletter that I wrote, as well as Congressman Scott Tipton wrote, asking \nand urging for an appeal of this decision.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                State of Colorado,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                         Denver, CO, May 22, 2015.\n     Hon. Sally Jewell,\n     Secretary of the Interior, Department of the Interior, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Jewell: On May 8, 2015, a federal District \n     Court judge in Denver issued a decision that could have \n     significant impacts to communities in Moffat and Rio Blanco \n     Counties, in northwest Colorado. That ruling found that the \n     Interior Department's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation \n     and Enforcement (OSMRE) failed to perform adequate public \n     notice and environmental analysis when approving a mining \n     plan for the Colowyo Coal Mine pursuant to the National \n     Environmental Policy Act. Colowyo employs 220 people, \n     contributes over $200 million to the regional economy, \n     generates royalties and taxes estimated at $12.0 million \n     annually, and provides affordable and reliable electricity to \n     Colorado and the Intermountain West.\n       The final judgment in the Colowyo case stated that the \n     court will void OSMRE's approval of the mining plan if the \n     agency does not, within 120 days, supplement the \n     environmental analysis, provide public notice and an \n     opportunity to comment, and render a new decision. Such a \n     result would effectively shut down the Colowyo Coal Mine, \n     result in layoffs for all 220 individuals, impact hundreds of \n     other families and businesses in the region, and eliminate \n     the principle source of coal for the Craig Station Power \n     Plant.\n       We have expressed our concerns to OSMRE about these impacts \n     and pledged to play whatever role we can to minimize them, \n     including participation as a cooperating agency in OSMRE's \n     supplemental environmental review. Given the importance of \n     this mine to the economies of the region, we ask that you do \n     everything possible to respond to the judge's order and \n     remedy the situation as expeditiously as possible. If needed, \n     we encourage OSMRE to petition the court for an extension of \n     the time granted to complete the supplemental environmental \n     review. In addition, we encourage you and OSMRE to appeal the \n     decision if appropriate, given potential adverse impacts on \n     mines in Colorado and other federal permitting decisions.\n       Thank you for your consideration. If we can be of any \n     assistance, please do not hesitate to call on us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             John W. Hickenlooper,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                                     June 2, 2015.\n     Hon. Sally Jewell,\n     Secretary, Department of the Interior, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Jewell: I write regarding the recent federal \n     District Court ruling affecting the Colowyo mine in Colorado. \n     The ruling found the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and \n     Enforcement (OSMRE) failed to fulfill the requirements of the \n     National Environmental Policy Act when approving the amended \n     mining plan in 2007. The ruling gave OSMRE 120 days to re-\n     examine the application and comply with the deficiencies \n     identified by the Court.\n       I am concerned this ruling could have a damaging impact on \n     communities in Moffat and Rio Blanco Counties. The mine \n     supports more than 200 employees, over $200 million in annual \n     economic impact to the region, and is important to the steady \n     supply of coal for Craig Station Power Plant which provides \n     electricity to thousands of Coloradans. Quick resolution to \n     this case is important so these workers and communities have \n     the certainty they need.\n       I understand OSMRE is working with the State of Colorado \n     pursuant to the Court's 120-day timeline to conduct \n     additional public outreach and considerations in the \n     environmental assessment. The Colowyo Coal Company also filed \n     an appeal of the decision last week. While OSMRE must \n     continue working to follow the Court's orders, I believe the \n     Interior Department should also direct the Justice Department \n     to appeal the Court's decision.\n       Thank you for your consideration and your attention to this \n     important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Ed Perlmutter,\n     Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 21, 2015.\n     Hon. Sally Jewell,\n     Secretary of the Interior, Department of the Interior, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Secretary Jewell: On May 8, 2015, the Federal District \n     Court for the District of Colorado issued an order \n     determining that the Office of Surface Mining (``OSM'') \n     failed to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act \n     (``NEPA'') in 2007, when it issued a mine plan approval for \n     the Colowyo Coal Mine. The Court gave OSM 120 days to prepare \n     a new analysis and issue a new decision. If OSM does not \n     complete the process in 120 days, the Court stated that it \n     would vacate the mine plan, effectively shutting down the \n     Mine.\n       We write to urge you to take all necessary and appropriate \n     action to ensure the continued operation of the Colowyo Coal \n     Mine, which is a critical component of northwest Colorado's \n     regional economy and has responsibly operated in the eight \n     years since the mine plan approval was issued by your office. \n     Coal produced by this mine, located in Moffat and Rio Blanco \n     counties, is then used to generate power at the Craig station \n     and is responsible for employing over 200 people with a \n     payroll of around $20 million dollars. Requested actions \n     include urgently deploying sufficient personnel with the \n     resources and expertise to complete the supplemental NEPA \n     work within the 120 day window provided by the District \n     Court.\n       Colowyo Coal Mine is a significant contributor to both of \n     the counties' economies. The adverse effects of shutting down \n     this mine go beyond the jobs at the mine that would be lost. \n     We surely do not need to impress upon your office the \n     potentially devastating impact of reducing operations at two \n     of the counties' largest employers as well as one of the \n     largest electricity providers in the western half of the \n     state.\n       In addition, we strongly urge OSM to evaluate the propriety \n     of an appeal. Without remarking on the reasoning of the Court \n     contained within the decision itself, the result nonetheless \n     creates adverse precedent with other suits pending, which \n     would harm not only Colowyo and the town of Craig, but \n     potentially numerous other mining operations and towns in \n     other states as well. The federal government must vigorously \n     defend the legality of its permitting actions, and leave \n     policy debates over the role of coal to the legislative and \n     rulemaking proceedings where those debates belong.\n           Respectfully,\n     Cory Gardner,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Scott Tipton,\n       Member of Congress.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Colorado for his \ninsights. This is the beginning of a process of eliminating coal mining \nin the United States. Here is a company that has their permit for 8 \nyears for mining coal, and that permit took extensive permitting. Now \nwhat they are saying is that you have to take a look at where the coal \nis burned to see what the impacts are. That has never been one of the \nrequirements. Again, it is one of those increases in regulation that \nthis administration is fond of. It is designed to put things out of \nbusiness, to raise costs.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article \ncalled ``The Case For Legislative Impact Accounting Economics 21,'' \nwhich is part of the Manhattan Institute.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             [June 9, 2015]\n\n The Case For Legislative Impact Accounting Economics 21 (part of the \n                          Manhattan Institute)\n\n             (By Jason J. Fichtner, Patrick A. McLaughlin)\n\n       For the first time in six years, Congress finally passed a \n     budget resolution. The federal budget process, when it works, \n     permits Congress to monitor and fund programs based on their \n     fiscal impact. Yet every Congressional budget masks the true \n     economic costs of federal spending. Mandatory spending, which \n     makes up the vast majority of federal spending and includes \n     interest on the national debt, Social Security, Medicare and \n     Medicaid, is not part of the annual budget process. Also \n     excluded from the annual budget\n\n[[Page S4073]]\n\n     process are the costs of regulations. In fact, the vast \n     majority of economic costs induced by federal actions remain \n     off the books.\n       We propose reforming the legislative and regulatory \n     processes to put these costs on the books. After all, proper \n     budgeting is about making trade-offs between competing wants \n     and limited resources, and it requires planning, setting \n     priorities and making difficult decisions. But these \n     decisions cannot be made without a more complete \n     understanding of the direct and indirect costs of proposed \n     legislation and spending bills, and their regulatory Progeny. \n     Our proposal, called legislative impact accounting, would \n     provide that information to Congress.\n       Estimates of the total cost of regulations vary widely, but \n     by any account, they represent a significant cost to the \n     economy. Government economists in the Office of Management \n     and Budget tally up the direct compliance costs associated \n     with rules created in the last decade that have an effect of \n     more than $100 million annually. OMB's most recent estimate \n     was that annual costs fall between $57 and $84 billion. \n     Conversely, economists John Dawson and John Seater estimated \n     how the economy would look if federal regulations were held \n     to 1949 levels--essentially asking the question: What if, \n     instead of spending resources on regulatory compliance, \n     businesses invested in research and development? The answer \n     was shocking. In 2011, instead of $15.1 trillion, annual GDP \n     would have equaled $54 trillion . . .\n       Our proposal, legislative impact accounting, would \n     incorporate economic analyses of legislation and regulation \n     into the budget process in two ways: First, when new \n     legislation is proposed, an independent office--perhaps the \n     Congressional Budget Office--would produce an estimate of the \n     economic costs the legislation would create. Importantly, a \n     legislative impact assessment would attempt to consider \n     economic costs of proposed legislation, not just budgetary \n     outlays. Examples of some of the effects that could be \n     included as specific line items are: direct compliance costs, \n     employment effects, technological hindrances, trade \n     distortions, and changes to the cumulative regulatory burden. \n     This type of analysis is not unprecedented. The European \n     Commission provides impact assessments on all legislation \n     considered by the European Parliament.\n       Second, legislative impact accounting would require \n     retrospective analyses of the economic effects of \n     legislation, starting five years after the legislation \n     passed. The idea is to learn what the real effects have been, \n     and to then update the original estimates produced in the \n     first stage. This would effectively create a much-needed \n     feedback loop that communicates information about the \n     economic effects of legislation back to Congress.\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, as we return to the legislation, \nunfortunately we are still, apparently, unable to move forward with \nmanagers' packages and amendments and others. So I would like to \napologize to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have pending \namendments, who have parts of managers' packages, and who have invested \nso many hours of time and effort to this legislation, not to mention \nmembers of the committee who spent an inordinate amount of time putting \ntogether a Defense authorization bill that I think all of us on both \nsides, with the exception of four who voted against it, were proud of \nand a product that was accomplished in a bipartisan fashion.\n  I, again, want to thank my friend from Rhode Island for all of his \nhard work. But apparently right now we are still stuck in resistance. \nRather than go through all of the reasons why, I hope we can have some \nserious negotiations in order for us to move forward and complete this \nlegislation.\n  Meanwhile, the world moves on, and there are greater and greater \nchallenges to our security. In fact, this morning the New York Times \nsays: ``Trainers Intended as Lift, but Quick Iraq Turnaround Is \nUnlikely.'' That is The New York Times.\n  The New York Times says:\n\n       Mr. Obama's plan does not call for small teams of American \n     troops to accompany Iraqi fighters onto the battlefield, to \n     call in airstrikes or advise on combat operations. Nor is it \n     likely to significantly intensify an air campaign in which \n     American warplanes have been able to locate and bomb their \n     targets only about a quarter of the time.\n       ``This alone is not going to do it,'' said Michele A. \n     Flournoy, who was the senior policy official in the Pentagon \n     during Mr. Obama's first term. ``It is a great first step, \n     but it should be the first in a series of steps.''\n\n  One of the reasons I have that quote from Michele Flournoy is that it \nis not just former Bush administration officials. It is former Obama \nadministration officials who all agree that what we are doing is \nwithout strategy and without prospect of success.\n  POLITICO article: ``Obama's Iraq quagmire.''\n\n       The President finds himself dragged back into a war he was \n     elected to end.\n       When pressed on why the latest efforts do not include \n     having American troops serve as spotters for airstrikes or \n     sending Apache aircraft to back up the Iraqi troops, Deputy \n     National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters the \n     president ``has been very clear he'll look at a range of \n     different options.''\n\n  That is encouraging that the President has been very clear. I love \nit. All these spokespeople use two sorts of fillers: One is ``very \nclear'' and the other is ``quite frankly.''\n  Do you ever notice that? Isn't that interesting? Maybe we should take \nthat out of their vocabulary--``very clear'' and ``frankly''--when they \nare neither clear nor frank.\n  But anyway, Mr. Rhodes said--he is really a very interesting guy: \n``The U.S. military cannot and should not do this simply for Iraqis, \nand, frankly, Iraqis want to be in the lead themselves.''\n  ``The U.S. military cannot and should not do this simply for \nIraqis.''\n  Does anyone in the world think that the United States of America \nwould be engaged simply for Iraqis? Has Mr. Rhodes ever listened to Mr. \nBaghdadi and ISIS and their intentions to attack and destroy America as \nmuch as they possibly can?\n  POLITICO: ``Trainers or advisors? White House and Pentagon don't \nagree.''\n\n       The White House says the new batch of troops deploying to \n     Iraq are going to train Iraqi recruits to fight the Islamic \n     State. The Pentagon says the 450 American personnel headed to \n     Al-Taqaddum Air Base are going over just as advisers.\n       The mixed signals come as President Barack Obama struggles \n     to find a balance between achieving his goal of ``degrading \n     and ultimately destroying'' the terrorist group known as the \n     Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant while avoiding \n     restarting a war in\n\n[[Page S4074]]\n\n     Iraq that he has worked to end since he became President in \n     2009.\n\n  From The Wall Street Journal editorial this morning: ``Obama's Latest \nIraq Escalation.''\n\n       President Obama all but admitted on Wednesday that his \n     strategy against the Islamic State is flailing by ordering an \n     additional 450 U.S. military advisers to join the 3,500 \n     already in Iraq. Alas, this looks like more of the half-\n     hearted incrementalism that hasn't worked so far.\n       The fundamental problem with Mr. Obama's strategy is that \n     he is so determined to show that the U.S. isn't returning to \n     war in Iraq that he isn't doing enough to win the war we are \n     fighting. In September he pledged to ``degrade'' and \n     ultimately ``destroy'' ISIS--the kind of commitment a U.S. \n     President must never make lightly. But his fitful bombing and \n     timid special-forces campaign hasn't been able to stop the \n     jihadist advances, much less drive it out of Iraq's western \n     cities.\n       The longer ISIS stands up to a U.S. President pledging its \n     destruction, the more of a magnet it becomes for young men \n     willing to die for its perverted form of Islam.\n\n  Again, an article in the Wall Street Journal today: ``To U.S. Allies, \nAl Qaeda Affiliate in Syria Becomes the Lesser Evil.''\n  This is what so many of us were so concerned about when we literally \nbegged for help for the Free Syrian Army back as long ago as 3 years \nago--that we would end up in a situation where we had the Faustian \nchoice of Al Qaeda, Bashar al-Assad versus Al Qaeda or Al Qaeda-\naffiliated organizations. That is a scenario that most of us said might \nhappen, unless we supported the Free Syrian Army.\n  The Wall Street Journal says:\n\n       In the three-way war ravaging Syria, should the local Al \n     Qaeda branch be seen as the lesser evil to be wooed rather \n     than bombed?\n       This is increasingly the view of some of America's regional \n     allies and even some Western officials.\n       Outnumbered and outgunned, the more secular, Western-backed \n     rebels have found themselves fighting shoulder to shoulder \n     with Nusra in key battlefields.\n\n  The list goes on and on.\n  Lebanon's Labor Minister, who is a prominent Lebanese Christian \npolitician long opposed to Mr. Assad, said:\n\n       ``This is great error--we refuse the choice between ISIS \n     and Nusra, We want to choose between democracy and \n     dictatorship, not between terrorism and terrorism. If the \n     Syrians have to choose between ISIS, Nusra or Assad, they \n     will choose Assad.''\n\n  That is exactly the situation that Assad has been hoping for.\n  The New York Times: ``Russian Groups Crowdfund the War in Ukraine.''\n\n       The Novorossiya Humanitarian Battalion boasts on its \n     website that it provided funds to buy a pair of binoculars \n     used by rebels in eastern Ukraine to spot and destroy an \n     armored vehicle.  . . . It is unclear just how extensive the \n     fundraising network is, or how much money flows through \n     it, though the separatist groups identified by The Times \n     claim in social media posts to have raised millions of \n     dollars.\n\n  The New York Times, ``Increasingly Frequent Call on Baltic Sea: `The \nRussian Navy Is Back.' ''\n  The Wall Street Journal, ``The New Cold War's Arctic Front: Putin is \nmilitarizing one of the world's coldest, most remote regions.''\n  The Washington Post:\n\n       The U.S. should send aid to democracy's front lines in \n     Ukraine.\n       In the past several months, Ukraine's freely elected \n     government has taken dramatic steps to reform its economy, \n     fight corruption and rebuild democratic institutions. It has \n     imposed painful austerity on average Ukrainians, stripped \n     oligarchs of political and economic privileges and rewritten \n     laws to encourage free enterprise and foreign investment. It \n     has done all this even while fighting a low-grade war against \n     Russia, which has deployed an estimated 10,000 troops to \n     eastern Ukraine and, with its local proxies, attacks \n     Ukrainian forces on a near-daily basis. . . . What's missing \n     is a decision by Mr. Obama to make the defense of Ukraine a \n     priority. The president has ceded leadership on the issue to \n     Germany and France and overridden those in his administration \n     and Congress who support arms deliveries. . . . A stronger \n     U.S. commitment to Ukraine will not guarantee its success. \n     But Mr. Obama's lukewarm support risks a catastrophic failure \n     for the cause of Western democracy.\n\n  I cannot emphasize enough to my colleagues that this is a critical \nand fundamental issue as to whether we will provide defensive weapons \nto Ukraine, and I would remind my colleagues who don't want to send \nAmerican troops anywhere that they are not asking for American troops. \nThey are not asking for a single boot on the ground. Why in the world \nwe can't provide them with defensive weapons is something I will never \nunderstand as long as I live.\n  The New York Times, ``Hackers May Have Obtained Names of Chinese with \nTies to U.S. Government.''\n  And, of course, we all know that in the last week some 4 million \nAmericans, at least, have been hacked into and had some of their most \nsensitive information broken into, which is one of the arguments many \nof us had for consideration of the cyber bill on the floor of the \nSenate as part of the Defense bill. Obviously, we are in a cyber war. \nObviously, it requires the involvement and engagement of the Department \nof Defense, along with our intelligence agencies, and that is why I am \na bit taken aback by the vociferous opposition by my colleagues on that \nside of the aisle to addressing this issue since it is clearly part of \nthe defense and security of this Nation.\n  I would like to mention--and I appreciate the indulgence of my friend \nfrom Rhode Island--the issue of Russian rocket engines. Less than 6 \nmonths after the prohibition was enacted in last year's NDAA, which \nwould end the use of RD-180 on military space launches by 2019, the \nadministration has stated they want access to 14 more Russian rocket \nengines. Agreeing to the administration's request endorses another 8 \nyears of Russian rocket engines and over $300 million for Vladimir \nPutin and his cronies.\n  We must not reward Vladimir Putin and the Russian military industrial \ncomplex. We cannot in good conscience agree to reward the Russian \nmilitary industrial base with over $300 million in rocket engines while \nthey occupy Crimea, destabilize Ukraine, send weapons to Iran, and \nviolate the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.\n  The bill before us today would limit the use of Russian rocket \nengines and restates the committee's direction to end the use of \nRussian engines for national security space launches by 2019. There are \nsome who want to continue our Nation's dependence on Russian rocket \nengines. The NDAA would put an end to this dependence and stop hundreds \nof millions of dollars from going to Vladimir Putin. We can meet our \nnational security space needs without Russia, and we must lead by \nexample by eliminating our dependence as quickly as possible and \nfostering competition.\n  I say to my colleagues, we have two launch providers, ULA and SpaceX. \nRegardless of the Russian RD-180, we will be able to provide full \nredundant capabilities by 2017 with the Delta IV, Falcon 9, and Falcon \nHeavy. There will be no capability gap. The Atlas 5 is not going \nanywhere anytime soon. With the engines allowed under this amendment, \nULA has enough Atlas 5s to get them through at least 2018, if not \nlater.\n  As the New York Times editorial board stated last week:\n\n       When sanctions are necessary, the countries that impose \n     them must be willing to pay a cost, too. After leaning on \n     France to cancel the sale of two ships to Russia because of \n     the invasion of Ukraine, the United States can hardly insist \n     on continuing to buy national security hardware from one of \n     Mr. Putin's cronies.\n\n  I have a Reuter's article from last year. ``Comrade Capitalism: In \nmurky Pentagon deal with Russia, big profit for a tiny Florida firm.''\n  ULA's dealings with Russia are troubling and ethically questionable. \nA Reuters investigation this past November on the RD-180 raises \ntroubling issues regarding the businesses and shell companies that \nfacilitate the purchase of Russian rocket engines. The report describes \na five-person company called RD AMROSS, a joint venture between Russian \nrocket engine manufacturer Energomash and Pratt and Whitney Rocketdyne \nthat collects nearly $93 million in cost markups.\n  The article uncovers that in the past, RD AMROSS was investigated by \nthe Defense Contract Management Agency, which determined that in a \nprevious contract, RD AMROSS had collected $80 million in ``unallowable \nexcessive pass-through charges.''\n  The article titled ``Comrade Capitalism'' also exposed the role \nsenior Russian politicians and close friends of Vladimir Putin play in \nthe in the Energomash management. The article states that according to \na Russian audit of Energomash, the Russian rocket manufacturer had been \noperating at a loss because funds were\n\n[[Page S4075]]\n\n``being captured by unnamed offshore intermediary companies.''\n  Well, I just want to say there is no argument for the continued \npurchase of these rocket engines from the Russians--from Vladimir Putin \nand his cronies, one of whom was involved in the management and has \nbeen sanctioned by the United States of America.\n  I have confidence America is capable of building our own rocket \nengines, and I am confident we can do that in a reasonable period of \ntime--like 1 to 2 years. For us to commit to the continued use of these \nrocket engines and making millions and millions of dollars, in this \ncase $300 million, for Vladimir Putin and his cronies is--the question \nhas to be asked of individuals who want to continue the purchase of \nthese rocket engines from this Russian shell company: Why do you want \nto help Vladimir Putin? Why do you want to help Vladimir Putin and his \ncronies by giving them as much as $300 million? That is a legitimate \nquestion.\n  If any of my colleagues who support this basically unlimited or \ncontinued purchase of rocket engines from Russia rather than having it \nterminated in a reasonable and very short time, the question has to be \nasked: Why are you helping Vladimir Putin? Why are you helping his \ncronies? That is a legitimate question, and if any of my colleagues try \nto force this continued and unnecessary purchase of Russian rocket \nengines, that question needs to be asked of them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1473, As Modified\n\n  Mr. VITTER.

Madam President, I discussed this amendment yesterday on \nthe floor. It deals with brigade combat teams in the Army, making sure \nwe don't cut through fat and into meat and bone with regard to that \nessential part of our force. I urge bipartisan support of this \ncommonsense amendment.\n  There is already language in the underlying bill that takes similar \naction on the Air Force side and on the Navy side with regard to major, \nsignificant key units in those forces, and it is the same principle \nthat would be applied to the Army's brigade combat teams.\n  This amendment is strongly supported by the national organizations \nbuilt around both the Army National Guard and the Regular Army.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Bipartisan Solutions\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, this morning I heard the distinguished \nmajority leader say it was a time for bipartisan solutions. He said: \n``What America needs right now is a season of serious bipartisan \nsolutions.''\n  Democrats couldn't agree more. We have been asking for weeks for all \nparties to sit down and start talking about the budget--not at the \neleventh hour, not when we are already at the edge of a cliff, but now.\n  From a substantive perspective, this only makes sense. Both parties \nhate the sequester. Both parties understand there is a smarter way to \nbudget than senselessly acting as though we are hostage to these \narbitrary, meat-cleaver cuts that were never intended to go into \neffect, whether on the defense side or on the nondefense side.\n  So, Mr. Majority Leader, let's sit down and start talking about some \nserious bipartisan solutions.\n\n[[Page S4077]]\n\n  The majority leader makes it seem as though he has been negotiating \nand being fair. Every number in the Appropriations Committee had no \nconsultation from the Democrats. They just chose the numbers. That is \nnot bipartisan. They did not talk to the White House, which has veto \npower over every one of these. That is not bipartisan.\n  We all know that the only way we are going to get something done on \nthe budget, on the spending bills is by sitting down together and \ntalking. Why not sooner rather than later? Why not now rather than at \nthe last minute?\n  There is a charade going on by my friends on the other side. They \ntotally decide the appropriations numbers by themselves. They totally \ndecide to use OCO for defense but they do nothing for the nondefense \nside. Then they say: Let's move forward with those bills.\n  That is not bipartisan. Have any Democrats been consulted? I ask the \nmajority leader: Who has he consulted on the other side of the aisle \nabout his numbers? Who has he consulted at the White House about his \nnumbers? He knows he needs input from both to get anything done.\n  I think what the majority leader wants to do is play a game of \nchicken--wait until the end and then say: Do it our way. Well, that is \nnot going to work.\n  Over the next month or two, the American people are going to see that \nwe will not move forward on these proposals until--but certainly with \ngreat vigor when--there is a bipartisan discussion and agreement. We \nall know how this place works. The Senate and our system of \ngovernment--both the executive and the Congress--are involved in doing \nthe budget and doing the appropriations bills in particular. It works \nonly when both parties come to agreement. When one party tries to shove \nthings down the other party's throat, which, in all due respect, is \nwhat the majority leader is now doing, we end up with worries and \nsometimes the reality of a government shutdown. If the majority leader \nwants that, he should continue with this strategy, and any shutdown \nwill be on his hands. We don't want that, the American people don't \nwant that, and my guess is most of the Members on this side of the \naisle don't want that. We want to come to an agreement.\n  All we want the majority leader to do is talk to us, not to decide in \nhis office or maybe with the chair of the Appropriations Committee what \nall the numbers should be--how much to spend on defense, how much to \nspend on education, how much to spend on highways. Those are some of \nthe most important decisions we make around here, and they will not be \nmade without bipartisanship, sooner rather than later.\n  Mr. Majority Leader, like it or not, we have a Democratic President, \nand we have 46 Democratic votes in the Senate--enough to stop us from \nmoving forward if we can't negotiate--like it or not, Mr. Majority \nLeader.\n  The path the majority leader is pursuing is a cul-de-sac that will \neither force us to sit down and negotiate later in the day or force a \nCR, which no one wants, or even if some of the people on that side of \nthe aisle have their way, a government shutdown, as they did once \nbefore. None of those is a good solution. The best solution is for us \nto all sit down and talk. We should not keep kicking the can down the \nroad. Yet, here we are.\n  In Roll Call this week: ``McConnell Cool to Budget Summit.''\n  When he was asked: Is it time to start talking about the budget, he \nreplied: No, of course not. Why? What is his logic? His logic is \nDemocrats should just accept everything Republicans want.\n  That is not why we have two parties. That is not how the Senate \nworks. That is not how democracy works. There is nothing left for \nDemocrats to conclude other than that there is a yawning chasm between \nthe Republican leader's stated intentions and his actions to date, \nbecause the current posture by the majority has been this: my way or \nshut down the government. Well, we have seen that before, it didn't \nwork, and it is not going to work this time.\n  We are saying, let's negotiate and let's start those negotiations \nsoon, before it is too late. If the Republican leader truly wants a \nseason of bipartisan solutions, well, the winds are blowing in one \ndirection. Sit down with Democrats and let's start negotiating a \nsensible budget, and let's start doing it now. We are ready to sit down \nthis afternoon. We are ready to sit down at any moment that he gives us \na signal. Let's get in the room and start the real work of finding \nbipartisan agreement on the budget, plain and simple.\n  One other thing, when the American people ask why Washington so \ngridlocked, just look at how the majority leader is handling one of the \nmost important parts of what the government does, where the dollars go. \nThere is gridlock when one side insists that it has to get all of its \nway and not sit down with the other side. That is the path at the \nmoment that the majority leader is on. We hope he gets off of it. It is \nuntenable. It won't work. It will lead to a bad solution.\n  Once again, I repeat: We are willing to sit down and start talking \nabout the budget, talking about how much to spend on defense and \ntransportation and education and medical research today. We are \nwaiting, Mr. Majority Leader, for you to give us that ability, that \nsignal, so we can actually enact a budget without acrimony and that \nwill work for this great country of ours.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1569, as Modified\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, earlier this year, the Senate \nIntelligence Committee reported the Cybersecurity Information Sharing \nAct to the Senate floor. This bill is intended to facilitate sharing of \ncyber threat information between the private sector and the government. \nWhile this could be useful in protecting against cyber attacks, I am \nconcerned that certain provisions in the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee's bill would severely undermine Americans' privacy.\n  Senator Burr's bill would remove all existing legal restrictions to \nallow an unprecedented wave of information--including Americans' \npersonal communications--to flow from the private sector into \ngovernment databases without any meaningful controls or limitations. It \nwould explicitly authorize the government to use this information to \n``prevent'' crimes that have nothing to do with cybersecurity, such as \nfirearms possession, arson, and robbery.\n  These problems are compounded by the fact that this bill requires all \ninformation provided to the government through the information-sharing \nregime to be immediately disseminated, which does not allow time for \nremoval of unnecessary private information, to a number of Federal \nagencies--including the National Security Agency and others. We do not \nknow whether this information would also be shared with the Drug \nEnforcement Administration, or the Internal Revenue Service, for \nexample. We do know this would open a new flow of information to the \nFederal Government, without appropriate restrictions on how these \nagencies can store, query, or mine this information.\n  Congress should enact cybersecurity legislation to protect American \nbusinesses and the American people. But we need a cyber security bill, \nnot a cyber surveillance bill.\n  There are also provisions in this bill that add entirely new \nexemptions to the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA. These provisions \nare completely unnecessary, and have the potential to greatly weaken \ngovernment transparency.\n  Senator Burr's information sharing bill is major legislation that \ndeserves full debate and a meaningful opportunity for Senators to offer \namendments to improve the bill. It has had neither.\n  The bill was drafted behind closed doors. It has not been the subject \nof any open hearings or public debate. The text of the bill was only \nmade public by the Intelligence Committee after it was reported to the \nSenate floor, and no other committee of jurisdiction--including the \nJudiciary Committee--was allowed to consider and improve the bill. I \nshared with Chairman Grassley my concern that the Judiciary Committee \nshould also consider this bill, and Chairman Grassley assured me that \nthere would be a ``robust and open amendment process'' if this bill \nwere considered on the Senate floor. I expect that the Senate Homeland \nSecurity Committee received the same assurances.\n  Senator Burr's attempt to offer the Intelligence Committee's \ninformation sharing bill as an amendment to the\n\n[[Page S4078]]\n\nNational Defense Authorization Act runs directly counter to those \nassurances. This is not a sincere effort to consider and pass this bill \nunder regular order. Instead, through a series of procedural maneuvers, \nRepublican leadership is deliberately preventing any type of meaningful \ndebate on this bill.\n  I agree that we must do more to protect our cyber security, but we \nshould not rush to pass legislation that has significant privacy \nimplications for millions of Americans. We must be thoughtful and \nresponsible. Attempting to stifle meaningful debate and pass this bill \nas an amendment to the NDAA is the wrong answer. That is not how the \nSenate should operate. I urge Senators to vote no on cloture.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1473, as Modified\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, Senator Vitter spoke about his amendment, \nNo. 1473, to the fiscal year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, \nwhich makes certain our U.S. Army is able to maintain the current \nnumber of brigade combat teams to prevent further reductions to the \nArmy force structure.\n  I support Senator Vitter's amendment and encourage my colleagues to \ndo the same so that our military men and women are prepared to face our \nNation's evolving national security threats.\n  Our Army and soldiers here at home and abroad need all the support we \ncan give them. In the coming months, I look forward to welcoming home \nMajor General Funk, who is currently serving in Iraq and leading the \nfront against ISIS. We must remember that he and the soldiers he \ncommands need our help and protection, just as they serve and protect \nus.\n  The across-the-board cuts called for in the Budget Control Act, \nincluding a reduced force structure, make no sense when our country \ncontinues to face global threats. The cuts fail to establish priorities \nand suggest that every program has equal value, which is not the case.\n  In my home State of Kansas, these reductions could have a significant \nimpact on the Intellectual Center of the Army, Fort Leavenworth, and \nthe Army's First Infantry Division, the Big Red One.\n  The Big Red One is just one of the many divisions across the country \nthat could lose entire brigade combat teams, BCTs, degrading our Army's \nability to meet current and emerging challenges such as Russian \naggression, Ebola response operations, and taking on terrorist \norganizations like ISIS or Al Shabaab. I mention these specific \nexamples because they are the most recent situations over the last 12 \nmonths that call on our Armed Forces to be ready and resilient.\n  Without arbitrary budget reductions, the Army would not intentionally \nchoose to downsize the Army and let valuable soldiers go.\n  As the cochair for the Senate Defense Communities Caucus, we must \nconsider our towns and citizens who overwhelmingly support our \nmilitary. These reductions make no common sense for our communities and \nthe soldiers and their families who call our towns home.\n  These reductions impact the morale of the men and women who serve our \ncountry, as well as their families, at a time when we need their \ncommitment and readiness the most.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Senator Vitter's amendment. \nMaintaining our Nation's military forces must be our top priority. A \ncapable and strong national defense is critical to the security of the \nUnited States and is our Federal Government's primary constitutional \nresponsibility.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. ROUNDS. Madam President, I rise today to encourage my colleagues \nto join the bipartisan group of Armed Services Committee members who \nsupport a very important measure for our troops. Last month, we \noverwhelmingly voted in favor of the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor 2016 that the Senate is considering today.\n  The defense of our Nation is a fundamental responsibility of the \nFederal Government, and the annual passage of the NDAA is an important \nstep in making sure that our servicemembers have what they need to do \ntheir job and to succeed. These brave men and women selflessly \nsacrifice everything to keep us safe from the forces of darkness that \nwish to do us harm. We owe it to these men and women to wisely work \ntogether to make certain they have the necessary tools to accomplish \ntheir dangerous and demanding missions, and that is what we did in the \nArmed Services Committee just a few weeks ago.\n  Under the leadership of Chairman McCain and Ranking Member Reed, we \nreported a bill out of committee that not only supports our Armed \nForces but makes a host of needed reforms as well, and we did this \noverwhelmingly by a bipartisan vote of 22 to 4.\n  I would like to cite a number of the bill provisions which make our \nNation stronger and which I hope Congress and the President will enact \ninto law.\n  Our bill cuts nearly $10 billion in wasteful and duplicative \nspending, thereby freeing up additional funds to develop and procure \nweapons systems of the future, while also giving our troops in combat \nthe tools they need today.\n  This bill also makes important reforms aimed at recruiting and \nretaining the All-Volunteer Force that has so consistently defended our \ncountry for over four decades.\n  The Armed Services Committee produced this legislation by using the \nlimited and admittedly less than optimal funding tools at its disposal. \nFor now, the hand we are dealt is limited by the Budget Control Act, \nwhich includes arbitrary spending caps and the threat of sequestration. \nSo in our bill we are funding our Armed Forces using funds from the \noverseas contingency operations account. We are doing so at a level \nabove that requested by the President for this account. OCO was \nincluded in the Budget Control Act because Members of the 112th \nCongress recognized the importance of funding our men and women who \nserve on the frontlines.\n  I believe that many Members of the Senate fervently hope that in the \nnear future we will be able to fund our government in a fiscally sound \nmanner, without the irrational budget caps and threat of sequestration \nthat pervades all of Congress's budgetary deliberations.\n  I am willing to work with any of my colleagues on either side of the \naisle to fix the Budget Control Act, but until that day comes, we need \nto use the funding options we have available to keep America safe. The \nlegislation before us today does exactly that. We are following the \nrules that are in force today.\n  I am proud of my colleagues who serve with me on the Armed Services \nCommittee for coming together to achieve a truly bipartisan, \ncomprehensive bill. Our bill will support our troops and meet the \ndemands of a military that needs to continue its dynamic evolution in \nthe face of ever more sophisticated threats. And I am pleased that a \nnumber of provisions I offered are included in the final package we are \ndebating today.\n  Now that we have completed our work in committee and Leader McConnell \nhas brought our bill to the full Senate for debate, we must come \ntogether to pass the NDAA, as the Senate has done each year for more \nthan five decades. It is no coincidence that the NDAA is the only \nlegislation to achieve this track record; rather, it indicates the \nvital importance that generations of Senate Members have attached to \nit. The defense of our country is not a partisan issue.\n  The bipartisan NDAA sustains what our servicemembers need to succeed \nin a world that grows ever more dangerous. From the Russian aggression \nin Ukraine and mounting Chinese coercion in Asia to the ugly aggression \nof the self-proclaimed Islamic State in the Middle East, new threats \ncontinue to rise throughout the world. These threats are multifaceted, \nand our enemy's tactics ever-changing. We must make certain our Armed \nForces can continue to face these challenges, and we must uphold our \ncommitment to them.\n  I encourage my colleagues to pass the NDAA, and I encourage our \nPresident to work with Congress to keep Americans safe.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                      Zivotofsky v. Kerry Decision\n\n  Mr. COTTON. Madam President, earlier this week, the Supreme Court\n\n[[Page S4079]]\n\nwrongly decided the case of Zivotofsky v. Kerry, an unprecedented \ndecision which impairs Congress's role in foreign policy and which is \nan affront to our close ally Israel.\n  The Zivotofsky case concerned the executive branch's refusal to \nimplement a 2002 law passed by Congress and signed by the President. \nThe law required State Department officials to offer U.S. persons born \nin Jerusalem the option of listing Israel as their location of birth on \npassports and other consular documents. The State Department's practice \nhad been to list the place of birth only as Jerusalem, reflecting the \nPresident's policy of not recognizing any national sovereign authority \nover the Holy City.\n  Despite the fact that a President signed the statute into law, the \nexecutive branch has fought tooth and nail for 13 years to free itself \nfrom what it viewed as the heavy burden of writing the word ``Israel'' \non one line in a tiny number of U.S. passports, and it argued its case \nall the way to the Supreme Court.\n  In litigating the Zivotofsky case, it is no surprise that the \nPresident outlined a maximalist vision for his power to steer the \nNation's foreign policy, leaving little room for the people's \nrepresentatives in Congress. But it was a surprise that the Supreme \nCourt acquiesced to the President's position.\n  Before Monday, in the entire 225-year history of our Nation, the \nSupreme Court had never sided with a President's blatant refusal to \ncomply with a duly-passed statute affecting the conduct of foreign \naffairs. This is a remarkable and disturbing break with precedent and \none made through a poorly reasoned judicial opinion. The Court \nannounced that the President possesses an exclusive constitutional \npower to recognize other nations and that this power crowds out any \nattempt by Congress to legislate in this area, including on how \nlocations of birth are characterized on passports.\n  But this conclusion suffers from a number of problems. The Court is \nsupposed to only find a preclusive executive power where such a power \nis clearly committed to the executive branch in our Constitution. But \nnowhere in the text of the Constitution is there a reference to a \nrecognition power, let alone an allocation of such a power to the \nPresident alone. The Court acknowledges this in its opinion, so it \ninstead finds the recognition power embedded in the constitutional \nprovision stating that the President ``shall receive Ambassadors and \nother public Ministers.'' But, as Alexander Hamilton wrote in \nFederalist 69, that provision was understood to be a matter of \n``dignity,'' not ``authority'' that would have ``no consequence for the \nadministration of government.'' In other words, that provision does not \nimbue the President with a power; it imposes an obligation on him, and \na ceremonial one at that.\n  The provision furthermore appears in the section of the Constitution \nthat imposes an array of obligations on the President, not the section \ninvesting him with any powers. Ironically, it appears right before the \nprovision that obligates the President to ``take care that the Laws be \nfaithfully executed.'' I would assume the Framers believed that ``the \nLaws'' would include ones regarding passports.\n  I want to be very clear on this. The recognition power the Court \nidentified is not enumerated in the text of the Constitution, and no \none at the time of the founding believed it to be included. At the same \ntime, the Constitution explicitly entrusts Congress with grave \ninternational responsibilities, including the power to declare war and \nraise and support armies. These powers place the legislative branch in \na central role in the conduct of our Nation's foreign policy. The \nSupreme Court therefore stood on remarkably shaky ground when it \nannounced a supposedly exclusive Presidential power--one that can \nnullify contrary congressional enactments. And it unwisely and \nindeterminately expanded the President's unchecked discretion in the \nconduct of foreign affairs. That is a potentially dangerous opening, \nparticularly with the current President. President Obama has shown an \nunhealthy penchant for granting unilateral concessions to longtime \nenemies abroad. That tendency cannot and must not go unchecked.\n  Beyond the constitutional infirmities of the Court's opinion, I want \nto comment on the broader issue in the background of the Zivotofsky \ncase.\n  The executive branch based its refusal to comply with the passport \nlaw on the fear that identifying a person born in Jerusalem as having \nbeen born in Israel would upend the peace process. The State Department \ndeclared that compliance with the law ``would critically compromise'' \nU.S. efforts to forge an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, \n``significantly harm'' our foreign policy, and ``cause irreversible \ndamage'' to the role of the United States as an honest broker.\n  That is embarrassing hyperbole, and it is also complete nonsense. The \nrole of an honest broker in negotiations is just that--to be honest. So \nlet's be honest. Israel's seat of government is located in Jerusalem. \nIsrael administers the entire city. Over 500,000 Israelis live and work \nin Jerusalem. The reality is that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, \nand any final agreement--whether or not it includes some sort of \nsharing arrangement--will not change that. The United States and the \nworld should not deny that reality; they should accept it and then \nbegin the hard work of helping the parties forge a lasting peace.\n  The role of an honest broker is to ground negotiations in truth. It \nis to quell unreasonable reactions and expectations. It is to strip \naway issues that are peripheral and focus on those that are essential.\n  That the President believes the designation of Jerusalem as a part of \nIsrael on a passport can throw the entire prospect of peace into a \ntailspin says much about his confidence in his abilities as a mediator, \nand it perhaps also says much about the current political climate in \nthe Middle East, where deepened divisions would render renewed talks at \nthis point unproductive.\n  Ultimately, a resolution of the Israel-Palestinian dispute should be \nreached, but progress toward that resolution will not move forward if \nthe Palestinians remain unreasonably sensitive to peripheral issues \nsuch as passports. It will not move forward if the President is afraid \nto speak the truth. It will not move forward if the United States \nCongress is restrained from adding a dose of reality to the conduct of \nour foreign affairs.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Transportation Reauthorization Bill\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, we have 2 more weeks remaining before \nthe scheduled district work period with regard to the Fourth of July. \nThen, when we come back from there, in the next work period there will \nbe another deadline. The deadline I am referring to is the enactment of \na 6-year transportation reauthorization bill.\n  We have been talking about finding a 6-year reauthorization solution \nnow for over a year--well over a year. We have been working with short-\nterm extensions. We had a 10-month extension that expired just \nrecently. We did another 2-month extension with a commitment that our \ncommittees would work to come together, that Democrats and Republicans \nwould work to come together for a 6-year reauthorization of the \ntransportation programs for this country.\n  My constituents are frustrated. I am frustrated. You see, I commute \nbetween Baltimore and Washington every day. This community or this area \nhas the second worst traffic congestion in the country. We desperately \nneed a more robust Federal partner in dealing with the transportation \nchallenges of my State and of every State in this country. We need to \nmove forward with transit projects. Every person we can get to use mass \ntransit is one less car on the road.\n  It helps all of us. It helps our transportation infrastructure and \nthe wear and tear. It helps our environment. We have bridges that \nliterally must be replaced. In the southern part of my State, the Nice \nBridge desperately\n\n[[Page S4080]]\n\nneeds to be replaced. That costs money. You need a Federal partner to \ndo that. We have road maintenance and expansion issues in every State \nin this country.\n  We have safety concerns that are not being addressed today. I would \nlike to take my colleagues to some of the overpasses in Baltimore that \nneed to be upgraded for the purposes of safety. Route 1 through College \nPark desperately needs attention. In my State, there is Georgia Avenue \nand Randolph Road in Montgomery County and 301, a major artery on the \nEastern Shore of Maryland, which need real serious safety upgrades that \nare important.\n  Each one of these is extremely expensive. I know that every Senator \ncould list dozens of projects in their own State that need to move \nforward for safety reasons. Then there is the issue of jobs. We all \nknow that without the predictability of a 6-year program, \ntransportation construction is delayed. That costs us not only \nconstruction jobs--and there are literally millions of construction \njobs that depend upon the Federal partnership in transportation--but \nthe economic impact of a reauthorization of the surface transportation \nprogram. So many projects in Maryland are affected by this.\n  But let me talk about one part of Maryland that does not always get \nthe same attention, and that is the western part of our State. It is \nnot where the real population of Maryland is located. But the \ncompletion of the Appalachia Highway, the north-south highway, is \ncritically important to the economic future of western Maryland--and I \nmight tell you also Pennsylvania and West Virginia. We need to get that \ndone.\n  Quite frankly, without a long-term reauthorization of the surface \ntransportation program, I do not know if we will get that done. That \nmeans jobs. That means our economy. We know that we have to be more \ncompetitive as a country. We know we are involved in global \ncompetition. The countries that we compete with are putting much more \nof their economy into transportation than we are into infrastructure. \nWe must do a better job.\n  Well, the Federal partnership in constructing the roads, the bridges, \nand the transit systems is called MAP-21. It expires at the end of \nJuly--again. This is not the first time. We have not reauthorized the \n6-year program for a long time. We need a 6-year program. Why? Because \nwhen you enter into a transportation project, it is more than just a 2-\nmonth commitment or a 10-month commitment. Our States cannot go into \nthese multiyear projects unless they know they have a Federal partner. \nThe only way they know they have a Federal partner is if we give them \nthe certainty of a 6-year reauthorization bill.\n  So it is critically important. So what should we do? Starting now, \nthe committees of jurisdiction need to have hearings and working \nsessions and report out legislation. That should be done now. There \nneeds to be a commitment as to what schedule will be followed so we do \nnot miss this deadline. That was the commitment that the leadership \ngave us--that we will get this done in this 2-month period.\n  Well, unless our committees are working to come together with \nlegislation--in the Environment and Public Works Committee, which both \nthe Presiding Officer and I serve on, we need to bring out a bill. We \nhave done it before. The Senate Finance Committee, which I serve on, is \nresponsible for the financial aspects on how we get together on that.\n  I am going to come back to that in one moment. Of course the banking \ncommittee is responsible for the transit section, as are other \ncommittees involved. But let me make an observation; that is, yes, we \nhave to come out with a 6-year reauthorization. That is critical. We do \nnot want any more short-term extensions. Secondly, it has to be a \nrobust program.\n  We know that if we just reauthorize at the current level, it will be \ninadequate. We know that. We know that, each of us in talking to our \nState transportation agencies. They tell you they need a more robust \nFederal partnership and that the challenges today are more expensive. \nAnd we have delayed for so long that it is even more expensive. So we \nneed to come to grips with a 6-year reauthorization but at a level that \nwill allow for a stronger Federal partnership.\n\n  The President's number is $478 billion over 6 years. I think that is \na reasonable level. If we just have a level-funded adjusted-for-\ninflation program, it would be $331 billion. I would hope that we would \nrecognize that the additional $147 billion the President is talking \nabout over 6 years is a modest increase but an important increase to \nthe Federal share to deal with our urgent needs of safety, economic \ndevelopment, jobs, and competitiveness.\n  Now, here is the problem. As to the current revenues in the \ntransportation trust fund, if we just use the $331 billion, which is \nbasically a freeze adjusted for inflation for the next 6 years, there \nis a $97 billion gap. We do not have enough money projected in the \ntransportation trust fund for a basically stand-still 6-year \nreauthorization. We are $97 billion short.\n  So we need to come to grips as to how we are going to fill that void. \nI said I serve on the Senate Finance Committee. There are lots of \nrevenues that go into the trust fund that we should look at adjusting. \nThere are other ideas about how we can bring in transportation \nrevenues. I hope we look at all of that. Then there has been the \nrecommendation that has been done by both Democrats and Republicans. We \nhave to find a way to bridge the gap here. It does not do any good if \nwe just have one party that agrees on how to deal with this. We all \nhave to deal with it.\n  It is incumbent upon the Republican leadership to get engaged in that \ndebate--and the Democratic leadership. We have already said that we are \nopen to the current revenues that go into the transportation trust \nfund. But there is one area that seems to be in agreement between \nDemocrats and Republicans, and that is looking at international reform. \nWe have all talked about the fact that we have a lot of earnings from \nour corporations--American corporations--that are trapped overseas \nbecause the companies have made a decision not to repatriate the money \nback into the United States because it would be subject to a higher \nU.S. corporate tax rate.\n  They do not want to pay that higher tax. That is a business decision \nmade by U.S. businesses. Now, obviously, the way to solve that is to \nreform our business taxes here. Senator Thune and I are cochairing a \nworking group of the Senate Finance Committee to try to come to grips \nwith that. It is going to be difficult for us to do that. You heard the \nnumbers I have already given you.\n  But every 1-percent reduction in the corporate tax rate costs about \n$100 billion over 10 years. If you include relief for those who pay the \npersonal tax rates for their business income, it is probably closer to \n$150 or $160 billion to get a 1-percent reduction in the corporate tax \nrate. So that is going to be challenging.\n  In the meantime, there have been recommendations in order to unleash \nthose funds: Why don't we find a charge that is less than the full \ncorporate tax for those revenues that are returned to the United \nStates? We have Democrats and Republicans working together on a bill, \nincluding the President, who has submitted that in his budget. He has \nsubmitted a toll charge for the revenues that are trapped overseas that \ncorporations would have to pay.\n  That toll charge would be at a 14-percent rate. Then he has projected \na minimum tax on foreign earnings at 19 percent that would have to be \npaid with certain reforms on trying to move the United States more to a \nterritorial corporate tax rate. I mention that because I think there is \ninterest by both Democrats and Republicans to take a look at reforming \nthe way we tax foreign income for American companies so that we can \nhave greater economic activity here in the United States. These \nproposals generate a significant amount of revenue, both one-time-only \nand permanent revenue.\n  I mention that because we could take a look at the international tax \nreform proposals. Democrats and Republicans have both submitted \nproposals on this. That could help us get to a robust 6-year \nreauthorization of the surface transportation bill. We could get that. \nMy reason for mentioning it right now is this: Let's talk about it. \nLet's have the Republicans come to the table and talk about it also. \nLet's not just wait these next 2 weeks, go into the work\n\n[[Page S4081]]\n\nperiod, come back, and be faced with another deadline with no game plan \non how we are going to resolve it and say: We have to pass another \nshort-term extension so we can get together and talk about it.\n  Let's start talking about this now. I tell you that there are viable \noptions. The one thing I found is that Democrats and Republicans agree \nthat infrastructure is important and we have to have a stronger program \nin this country for infrastructure. I always enjoy hearing from Senator \nInhofe, the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, a \nperson with whom I came to the Congress. He says frequently that he may \nbe a conservative but when it comes to infrastructure spending, it is \nimportant that we have a robust Federal program.\n  Under his leadership and under Senator Boxer's leadership, we have \nbeen able to bring out bills from the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee to reauthorize a 6-year program. The challenge is this: Can \nwe find the revenue? Of course, there we need to work together as \nDemocrats and Republicans. So I come to the floor to urge my \ncolleagues: Let's work together. That is what the American people \nexpect us to do. They expect us to work together to solve the problem.\n  I don't think there is a Member of the Senate who would disagree that \nwe should have a robust reauthorization of a 6-year transportation \nprogram for this country, that our States need it, that our country \nneeds it, and that we need it for our economy. Let's put aside our own \nindividual differences. Let's sit down and work out a bill. Let's start \nworking it out now. Let's not wait until the next deadline.\n  I urge my colleagues to do this. That is what the American people \nwant us to do. That is what we need to do to move this country forward.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Nuclear Agreement With Iran\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I know we are on the national defense \nbill and, of course, national defense is ultimately about national \nsecurity, and one of the concerns I have about national security and \nour national interests is the challenge of a nuclear-armed Iran.\n  I came to the floor last week to say that when it comes to dealing \nwith Iran--as we count down to the deadline for an agreement--the truth \nis always elusive. I said then that international inspectors reported \nthat Tehran's stockpile of nuclear fuel, rather than decreasing, \nactually increased by 20 percent.\n  Now, in the last days before the agreement deadline is reached, David \nAlbright, a well-respected expert on Iran's nuclear program, in an \narticle for the Institute for Science and International Security, says \nthat the State Department's explanation of Iran's newly produced 3.5 \npercent enriched uranium falls short and that the State Department \nseemed to be making excuses for the fact that Iran has not reduced its \nenrichment level, which they agreed to do in the Joint Plan of Action. \nThe fact is uranium enrichment, when taken to the maximum, can lead to \nbomb material. So reducing the enrichment level is critical, in terms \nof possible breakout time in Iran's ability to develop a nuclear \nweapon.\n  Albright says:\n\n       The core of the State Department's explanation in the last \n     few days appears to be that Iran meets the conditions of the \n     Joint Plan of Action once it feeds newly produced low \n     enriched uranium hexafluoride gas into the uranium conversion \n     plan at Esfahan. . . .\n\n  Now, to bring this down into lay terms, this conversion plant is \nthere to take this enriched uranium--that if further enriched, can lead \nto bomb material--to transform the enriched uranium that can be \nprepared for potential nuclear material to an oxide form, and that is a \nform in which the bomb threat is dramatically reduced.\n  But the Esfahan plant didn't even become operational until the fall \nof 2014, a year after it was supposed to have opened, and--conveniently \nfor the Iranians--it is having operational difficulties, making it \nhighly unlikely Iran can convert the low-enriched uranium hexafluoride, \nwhich we are concerned about, into enriched uranium dioxide used for \nmaking nuclear power reactor fuel.\n  Put simply, at the end of the day, once again Iran will not have \nlived up to what they agreed to.\n  Now, we knew from the beginning it was going to be a challenge. We \nknew it was going to be difficult for the Iranians to blend down their \nnuclear fuel, rather than to ship it out to another country, which so \nfar they have refused to do. We knew it would be a concern if they \nweren't able to convert low-enriched uranium hexafluoride into the \nenriched uranium dioxide--the one in which, obviously, we have far less \nconcerns. And, frankly, because that is obviously a problem, I am \nconcerned, because as the Albright article states, ``The amounts of LEU \namount to about 4,000 kilograms of 3.5 LEU hexafluoride, enough to \npotentially make 2 to 3 nuclear weapons if further enriched to weapons-\ngrade uranium.''\n  Two to three nuclear weapons if further enriched to nuclear-grade \nuranium. Now, I am concerned this is more blue smoke and mirrors that \noverlooked the real ambitions of an untrustworthy negotiating partner. \nI am concerned Iran is still saying it will not ship out excess low-\nenriched uranium but somehow blend it down and store it at the plant, \nwhich can't possibly blend down enough at this point to meet the \nrequirements under the Joint Plan of Action.\n  I am concerned this is more of an issue than the administration is \nwilling to concede, particularly if, at the end, there is no deal and \nwe, through sanctions relief, paid them to convert and then they walk \naway with massive amounts of low-enriched uranium that can be fed into \ntheir centrifuges and be easily converted to highly enriched uranium \nand on to weapons-grade uranium.\n  According to David Albright:\n\n       Based on the IAEA's report--\n\n  That is the International Atomic Energy Administration's report to \nmember states--\n\n     the problems in making enriched uranium oxide were apparent \n     by the fall of 2014 . . . but the Administration decided not \n     to make a major issue about the lack of oxide production.\n\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       Concluding that Iran has met the Joint Plan of Action \n     condition to convert to oxide newly-enriched up to 5 percent \n     is incorrect.\n\n  And it further says:\n\n       In this case, the potential violation refers to Iran not \n     producing the enriched oxide at the end of the initial six \n     month period of the Joint Plan of Action and again after its \n     first extension.\n\n  This is a continuing quote:\n\n       The choosing of a weaker condition which must be met cannot \n     be a good precedent for interpreting more important \n     provisions in a final deal. Moreover, it tends to confirm the \n     view of critics that future violations of a long-term deal \n     will be downplayed for the sake of generating or maintaining \n     support for the deal.\n\n  It says:\n\n       The administration relied on a technical remedy that Iran \n     had not demonstrated it could carry out.\n\n  The article concludes:\n\n       The State Department has some explaining to do.\n\n  Now, the enrichment issue is one thing, but then there is the \nrecently released U.N. Security Council report on a whole host of the \nexisting Security Council resolutions and mandates as it relates to \nIran, and there are other problems as well. They are well documented in \nthis just recently released report; that Iran has continued to deny the \nlegitimacy of Security Council resolutions not addressed in the Joint \nPlan of Action; that Iran's arms transfers have actively continued, \nraising concerns in particular in the region; that cases of \nnoncompliance with the travel ban have also been observed; that Iran \nhas continued certain nuclear activities, including enrichment and work \nat Arak; and that there is no progress by Iran in addressing possible \nmilitary dimensions that had been agreed to be addressed by Iran and \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency. The most troubling relates to \nallegations of large-scale high- explosives experimentation at Parchin.\n\n  The report goes on to talk about Iran's missile technology. Here we \nhave a sense from the U.N. Security Council's report where it speaks to \nIran's missile capability. And I am using a\n\n[[Page S4082]]\n\nmap here that I give credit to the New York Times for to demonstrate \nwhat that means. Iran has two kinds of ballistic missiles capable of \ndelivering a nuclear weapon, according to the report--the Ghadr \nmissile, which is a variation of the liquid-fuel Shahab-3, with a range \nof about 1,600 kilometers, or 995 miles, and the other is the Sejil \nmissile, with a range of about 2,000 kilometers, or about 1,250 miles. \nThe first missile encompasses most of the gulf and certainly our ally, \nthe State of Israel, as well as Afghanistan and Pakistan, not to \nmention Turkey, among others, and then the longer range missile \nactually goes as far as into Europe. And this is missile technology \nthat is still in development. As the U.N. Security Council report \npoints out, we can see the range of Iran's missiles and the potential \nmilitary dimensions of its pursuits.\n  Then there is the issue of arms embargo violations and the transfer \nof conventional arms. For whatever reasons--and the report speculates \nthat maybe member states, meaning member countries of the United \nNations, don't want to upset the apple cart of the negotiations--there \nhave been no reports--even in the midst of very clear violations taking \nplace, and those have been largely reported--from member states of the \nU.N. about the transfer of conventional arms by Iran. But the U.N. \nreport nevertheless says that ``the panel notes media reports pointing \nto continued military support and alleged arms transfers to Syria, \nLebanon, Iraq and Yemen, and to Hezbollah and Hamas.''\n  The report also says that a shipment of arms was confirmed by Massoud \nBarzani, president of Kurdistan's regional government, who said: ``We \nasked for weapons and Iran was the first country to provide [them].'' \nThis is a clear violation if ever there were one.\n  According to the report, some member states informed the panel that \nIran's nuclear procurement trends and circumvention techniques remain \nbasically unchanged. In fact, Great Britain informed the U.N. panel \nthat they are aware of an active Iranian nuclear procurement network \nassociated with Iran's centrifuge technology company known as TESA and \nKalay Electric Company, which are listed sanction entities under the \nU.N. Security Council resolutions.\n  The report further says that member states have reported on the \nmethods Iran has used and continues to use to carry out financial \ntransactions below the radar to conceal any connection to Iran. Some \nstates that import oil, for example, have authorized their banks to \nreceive payments into accounts belonging to the Central Bank of Iran. \nThe funds were reportedly paid out against invoices for exports of \ngoods to Iran although the goods were never exported, meaning money was \ntaken out and ultimately made its way to Iran even though they were not \nfor payment of anything because nothing was shipped.\n  The simple fact is--and there are many other examples in the U.N. \nSecurity Council report, to which I commend my colleagues' attention--\nwe can't trust Iran to abide by its agreements or to abide by U.N. \nresolutions even when they are in the midst of negotiations, when you \nwould think they would be behaving the best. One would think they would \nwant to put their best foot forward. Why would we think we can trust \nthem if they are violating U.N. Security Council resolutions? That is \nthe world--not the United States, not even the P5+1, but the world--\ntelling them they can't do these things or they violate an \ninternational order. So why would we think we could trust them not to \nenrich uranium, not to pursue a weapons program, and not to find any \nway possible to renege on any agreement they reach when they are \nviolating existing Security Council resolutions?\n  As I have said, I will come to the floor to reiterate my skepticism \nthat Iran will not do all it can to pursue their agenda. I believe, \nrather, they will try to find a way to pursue their agenda, to play \nfast and loose with the truth, to hide the truth, to cover it up, and \nto buy time. Iran needs to be held responsible for its commitments--\nforget about its work; its commitments. There can be no slippage, no \ndelays, no obfuscation. That is how they succeeded in the past in \nbringing themselves to be on the verge of becoming a threshold nuclear \nstate.\n  So where do we go from here? It remains to be seen whether compliance \nwith that which has already been agreed to by the Iranians--even at \nthis early stage while the world is watching--can be realized or will \nit be explained away.\n  I intend to come to the floor again and again to hold Iran \naccountable for its actions and to keep a laser-like focus on the \nmullahs in Tehran. I fear that when that spotlight is off, when the \npress is gone, when the agreement is out of the headlines and the \ncurtain closes on the P5+1 talks, Iran will pull back into the shadows. \nWhen that happens and if it goes wrong, what will we do then?\n  We haven't seen the final agreement, so we will have to wait to make \na final judgment on it. But if the final agreement follows in the line \nof the framework agreement, then we will have a set of circumstances \nwhere we will not be solving the problem. I think some of the experts \nwho were before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday in a \nbriefing admitted to the fact--and one or two of them are proponents of \nan agreement--they said this does not solve the problem but only kicks \nthe problem down the road.\n  Those are hard choices no matter what, but I would rather confront a \ncountry that is on the path to nuclear weapons before it gets it and \nwhen it is at its weakest point, not when it becomes a country at its \nstronger point, with far more resources, with sanctions that have \nlargely dissipated. And even with snapback provisions--which I think we \nshould have, but several years down the road when the world has now \nengaged Iran in doing business and Iran has risen in its economy--its \neconomy has already stopped its free-fall just on the basis of \nexpectations--and it decides possibly to break out 3 or 4 years down \nthe road, putting all of those international sanctions back together, \nas someone who was the author of those sanctions here in the Congress, \nI can tell you that is going to take a lot more work. There is no \ninstantaneous snapback: Oh, we will put the sanctions back and they \nwill have effect immediately. You have to tell the world, you have to \ngive them notice that, in fact, there are sanctions back in effect. You \nhave to tell companies now doing business and give them time to \ndisinvest from those businesses. By the time you add that, if \nexperience is a good barometer, we gave at a minimum 6 months' lead \ntime to tell the world this is going to be a sanctionable activity, and \nby the time we actually pursued enforcement and implementation of \nthose, it was far beyond--close to a year. Well, that happens to be the \ntime we are actually vying for breakout time.\n  So I am going to continue to come to the floor to continue to shine a \nspotlight on the challenges we have with Iran and on the shortcomings \nof the interim agreement as we hope for a good final agreement. But I \nwill use the refrain that the administration at one time used, which is \nthat no agreement is better than a bad agreement, and that is what my \nconcern is--that we are headed toward a bad agreement.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                                Earmarks\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a problem that, \ndespite a congressional ban on the practice, continues to plague our \nbudget. That problem is earmarks.\n  Back in 1986--just a little history lesson here--as Congress engaged \nin a last-minute scramble to fund the government, a Republican \nCongressman from Pennsylvania slipped an earmark into a massive \nspending bill. He turned a small exhibit of steam-powered trains, known \nas Steamtown USA, into a national park. Three decades, nearly $100 \nmillion, and one congressional earmark ban later, that project \ncontinues to cost taxpayers millions of dollars annually. The bridge to \nnowhere, the North Carolina teapot museum, the indoor rainforest in \nIowa, and, yes, Steamtown USA, are among the many egregious earmarks \nthat led fed-up taxpayers to press for a ban on this kind of spending.\n  Like triceratops and velociraptors, earmarks that were declared \nextinct, fossilized relics of a bygone era, are somehow making a \nreappearance. What taxpayers and many in Congress didn't\n\n[[Page S4083]]\n\nrealize is that despite the successful ban on earmarks, we are still \npaying millions of dollars for the old ones. Through unexpended funds, \ncarve-outs in the Tax Code, and grant awards, spending on past earmark \nprojects and their recipients still roam the Federal budget landscape.\n  Today, I am releasing a report--``Jurassic Pork''--which will \nhighlight the fossilized pork projects that are still embedded or \nburied deep in the Federal budget. It should serve as a reminder of the \npast scandals that brought about the extinction of earmarks and serve \nas a warning that the cost of earmarking often outlives the practice \nitself.\n  ``Jurassic Pork'' digs into just two dozen of the many earmarked \nprojects and recipients of congressional bounty that continue to cost \ntaxpayers millions of dollars.\n  Take for example the aptly named VelociRFTA, a bus rapid transit \nsystem in Colorado that covers the 40 miles between Aspen and Glenwood \nthat began as an $810,000 earmark. Since the earmark ban took place in \n2010, thanks to continued Federal funding, this project--this vestige--\nhas cost taxpayers $36 million.\n  Also highlighted in the report is the American Ballet Theater, which \nsupplemented a flow of Federal grant money with more than $800,000 in \nearmarked funds from a Member of Congress who also happened to perform \nin one of the group's recent productions.\n  Then there are the 6,000 unspent highway earmarks representing $5.9 \nbillion that sit idle in the Department of Transportation account. \nThese include pork projects such as the $600,000 Upper Delaware Scenic \nByway Visitor Center in Cochecton, NY. Unfortunately for taxpayers, the \nvisitor center ended up being built in Narrowsburg. Because the \nlocation was specified as Cochecton, the money will likely continue to \nsit on the Federal Government's ledger.\n  Now, within these unspent transportation earmarks, there is a smaller \ngroup that is often referred to as ``orphan'' earmarks. These are \nearmarks that have had less than 10 percent of their expended--or their \nanticipated funds spent over 10 years. According to the Congressional \nResearch Service, 70 earmarks worth more than $120 million remain on \nthe books, and in August 2015, more than 1,200 earmarks from the last \nmajor highway bill that was passed in 2005 will officially become \norphan earmarks. These represent $2 billion in yet-to-be-spent funds.\n  With the near bankrupt highway trust fund, Congress needs to find a \nway to permanently park these unspent funds. To that end, I have also \nintroduced a Jurassic Pork Act, which will rescind funding for orphan \nearmarks and will return this money to the highway trust fund. We all \nknow the highway trust fund could use it about now.\n  Now, like John Hammond, the billionaire CEO of the failed theme park \nin the first ``Jurassic Park'' film, not everyone in Congress is \ncontent to leave these as relics of the past. Not a year after the \nearmark ban was implemented in the Senate, the then-majority leader \nproclaimed: ``I've done earmarks all my career, and I'm happy I've done \nearmarks all my career.''\n  Others from both sides of the aisle have argued that a return to \nearmarking would help to lard up or incentivize votes. But taxpayers \ndon't exist for political horse trading or as a reward for powerful \nMembers to dole out as tributes. Taxpayers need to remain vigilant \nagainst all this kind of parochial spending, and we cannot return to \npork as we knew it.\n  The moratorium on earmarks in 2010 didn't put an end to these kind of \nshenanigans. But as readers of ``Jurassic Pork'' will see, the spending \non their legacy continues. Taxpayers have already seen the end of this \nmovie. We don't need to be treated to a sequel.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will continue to call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk continued with the call of the \nroll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am fully aware that we are not going to \nbe able to get past a unanimous consent request, but I wanted to make \nsure the Chair knew and others know that we have an amendment that I \nwill do the best I can to bring out.\n  It is an amendment that already has 21 cosponsors. There is a \nprovision in the Senate bill that was put in by the Senate that is not \nin the House bill that has to do with commissaries. It is viewed upon \nas privatizing commissaries. It is not really that. It is an attempt to \nevaluate the idea of the commissaries being privatized by using five \ncommissaries as test cells to see what kind of result we would get if \nwe did privatize them.\n  What we are doing with my amendment is taking it back--taking that \nlanguage out--in order to go ahead with an assessment before we do \nthat. It wouldn't make sense to me that if we wanted to get this done, \neven if we felt very passionately about privatizing, that we would do \nit before we had an assessment. So the assessment would be first.\n  We had a lot of discussion about this in the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. As I said, we now have 21 cosponsors who would like to \nreverse this so we can do the assessment and then make the \ndetermination.\n  It is kind of interesting, even though most people say privatizing is \nnot going to actually save or make any money, the amendment simply \nrequires the assessment on privatizing before we make any significant \nchanges to our servicemembers' privatized commissary benefits. This is \nsomething that is very popular among members of our service, wives, and \nhusbands, when surveyed last year. Approximately, 95 percent of the \nservicemembers were using the commissaries to purchase household goods \nto achieve needed savings in their family budgets with a 91-percent \nsatisfaction rate. We don't get 91 percent satisfaction rates around \nhere very often. The language in this bill as it is now ignores the \nrecommendations made by the Military Compensation and Retirement \nModernization Commission that we are all very familiar with. In the \nreport released in January, it specifically stated, in recommendation \nNo. 8, ``to protect access and savings to DOD commissaries and \nexchanges.'' Well, that is exactly what we want to do.\n  I have a very impressive list, which I will not read, of 41 \norganizations and associations, including labor unions, the Gold Star \nWidows, American Veterans, and others, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthis list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Organizations Supporting Inhofe/Mikulski Amendment\n\n       1.

I also have a synopsis of letters of support that is from \nsix different organizations, including the Military Officers \nAssociation of America; the Armed Forces Marketing Council; the \nInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters; the American Federation of \nGovernment Employees, AFL-CIO; the American Military Retirees \nAssociation; and saveourbenefit.org.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the synopsis of these six \nletters representing these organizations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Military Officers Association of America: ``This amendment \n     requires a study in lieu of the Senate Armed Service \n     Committee (SASC) language that mandate a privatization pilot \n     in at least five commissaries chosen from the commissary \n     agency's largest U.S. markets. MOAA commends this approach. \n     To conduct a privatization pilot without proper assessment \n     could result in unintended consequences, putting this highly \n     valued benefit at risk The commissary is a vital part of \n     military compensation providing a significant benefit to \n     military families. The average family of four who shops \n     exclusively at the commissary sees a savings of up to 30 \n     percent.''\n       Armed Forces Marketing Council: ``What is at stake for \n     military families: Loss of up to 30% savings on a market \n     basket of products for military families. That equates to \n     over $4000 per year for a family of four. Loss of jobs for \n     military family members. Over 60 percent of DeCA employees \n     are military related and their jobs are transferable, \n     allowing them to retain their positions and seniority when \n     the military provides permanent change of station orders. \n     Families would be required to pay sales taxes on groceries. \n     Loss of a cherished benefit that is enjoyed by 95% of the \n     active force. Loss of traffic at commissaries will adversely \n     impact sales in military exchanges by up to 40%. This will \n     diminish the dividend that supports quality of life programs \n     for military families.''\n       International Brotherhood of Teamsters: ``The commissary \n     system is a vital benefit to our nation's active military, \n     their families, and veterans across the country. The system \n     provides thousands of jobs for American Teamsters in the \n     warehouse, shipping, and food distribution industries. \n     Commissaries also provide a needed benefit for military \n     spouses and family members, who make up nearly 30 percent of \n     Department of Commissary employees.''\n       American Federation of Government Employees (AFL-CIO): \n     ``The Department of Defense's (DoD) commissaries and \n     exchanges (Army and Air Force Exchange Service, AAFES) are an \n     earned benefit treasured by military families and an \n     important contributor to their quality of life. The modest \n     cost of providing military families with inexpensive but \n     essential goods and services is almost invisible in the \n     Department's overall budget. Given that privatization of the \n     commissaries has been repeatedly rejected by the executive \n     and legislative branches and that this option was explicitly \n     not recommended by a recent commission which looked \n     comprehensively at the commissaries, it makes no sense to \n     begin to privatize the commissaries before understanding the \n     impact on costs and services as well as morale and \n     recruitment. Senator Inhofe's amendment would wisely direct \n     DoD to study the impact of privatization, and the Government \n     Accountability Office to review the DoD's finding, before the \n     Department is directed to privatize the commissaries.''\n       American Military Retirees Association: ``The American \n     Military Retirees Association believes commissary and \n     exchanges are a vital part of military pay and compensation. \n     Ninety percent of the military community uses these benefits \n     and consistently rank[s] them as a top compensation benefit, \n     yielding returns that far outweigh taxpayer support. They \n     also provide critical jobs for military families and \n     veterans--over 60 percent of employees are military \n     affiliated--and provide healthy living alternatives both \n     stateside and overseas.''\n       SaveOurBenefit.org: ``The Inhofe-Mikulski amendment offers \n     a sensible, pragmatic and thoughtful approach to examining \n     private operation of military commissaries. Senators Inhofe \n     and Mikulski are right. Study before deciding to implement. \n     Nearly 40 organizations--representing tens of millions of \n     active duty, Guard and Reserve, retirees, military families, \n     veterans and survivors--agree. The Military Compensation and \n     Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC) surveyed the \n     private sector and found no interest among major retailers to \n     operate on military bases. The Commission, chartered by the \n     Senate, found that commissaries were worth preserving and \n     recommended changes to the current structure--not \n     privatization.''\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my intention, as soon as we get to \nthe point where we can get into the queue and get unanimous consent to \nset the current business aside--it would be my intention to do that to \nconsider this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding rule XXII, the cloture vote on amendment No. 1569 be \nmoved to 3 p.m. today. I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to \ncall up the following amendments: Ernst No. 1549, Gillibrand No. 1578, \nWhitehouse No. 1693, Fischer-Booker No. 1825, Collins No. 1660, Cardin \nNo. 1468; that at 11 a.m. on Tuesday, June 16, the Senate vote in \nrelation to the following amendments in the order listed: Fischer-\nBooker No. 1825; Collins No. 1660; Cardin No. 1468; Gillibrand No. \n1578; Ernst No. 1549; Whitehouse No. 1693; Durbin No. 1559, as \nmodified; and Paul No. 1543; that there be no second-degree amendments \nin order to any of these amendments prior to the votes, and that the \nGillibrand, Ernst, Whitehouse, Durbin, and Paul amendments require a \n60-affirmative-vote threshold for adoption; also, that there be 2 \nminutes equally divided between the votes and that all votes after the \nfirst be 10 minutes in length.\n  I further ask that notwithstanding rule XXII, the cloture vote on the \nMcCain substitute amendment No. 1463 occur at 3 p.m. on Tuesday, June \n16.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \ninitially say to my impatient friend, he has to be patient and allow me \nto say a few words. During the short time we have been in the minority, \nwe have behaved in a way that I think is proper for a responsible \nminority. For example, on this bill dealing with the authorization of \nour defense capacity in the United States, we have been very clear how \nwe support the troops. But remember, we have this little difficult \nissue. The President of the United States has said he is going to veto \nthis bill. So we have worked through all this with that in mind. Having \nsaid that, in spite of that, we did not ask for a cloture vote on the \nmotion to proceed. When we were in the majority, having the minority \nnot do that was a big day. It happened extremely rarely. We have been \ndoing that consistently--with some exceptions but not many.\n  On this Defense bill, we have allowed amendments to become pending. \nThere are a dozen or so pending right now. We have allowed the Senate \nto conduct votes. We have allowed managers' amendments to be cleared--\nlots of them. We have reacted in a responsible way. We have no regret \nfor having done that.\n  The two managers were working together to get amendments pending in a \nmutually agreed-upon fashion when out of the blue, up comes this cyber \nsecurity amendment. It was also done in a very unusual way where \nSenator Burr employed parliamentary devices to get the cyber security \nbill pending to where we are right now. We could have been playing \naround all week with our offering amendments, but I have always felt \nthat it should be done extremely rarely, for the minority to do \nsomething like that. We could have done that.\n\n  If you look at the amendments that have been offered by us Democrats, \nthey are all, with rare exception, dealing with the security of this \nNation--not sage grouse, not all the other things the Republicans have \nbrought up in this bill.\n  To say that the Ex-Im Bank and the cyber security amendments have \nimpeded progress is a gross understatement. The cyber security bill is \na major bill in its own way--a major bill. I can speak with some \nauthority in this regard. Five years ago, I got every committee chair \nwho had jurisdiction over this subject and we met over a period of days \nto come up with a cyber security bill. We did that. Republicans stopped \nus. We kept getting a smaller\n\n[[Page S4086]]\n\ngroup of people involved as we were narrowing the bill, and we actually \nwere scheduled to finally have a vote on the cyber security bill. It \nwasn't as good as I thought we should have, but it was an important \nbill. And what happened on that? The chamber of commerce made a call to \nsome of the Republican leaders in the Senate, and suddenly that bill \nwas gone and we were voting on another ObamaCare amendment that, of \ncourse, went nowhere.\n  But we have tried cyber security.\n  The Intelligence Committee reported out this bill, and I appreciate \nthat they did. It was on a bipartisan basis, but it also contains a lot \nof matter within the jurisdiction of other committees--for example, the \nHomeland Security Committee and the Judiciary Committee.\n  To her credit, the ranking member, Senator Feinstein, recognized that \nand went to the Democrats and said: We will work with you and make sure \nthe problems you have with this bill when it gets to the floor--we will \nwork with you on this.\n  Senator Feinstein is a person of her word. I know she will do that, \nand she will do that.\n  This morning, the Republican leader, who is on the floor, was saying \nthat we just had an attack on 4 million people and that it is Obama's \nfault. I think that is stretching things a little bit, especially \nrecognizing that I have only given a brief travel through the times we \nhave tried to get up the cyber security legislation. We should take the \ntime to do it right.\n  I have told the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and I have \nchecked with our ranking member of the Finance Committee, who is \nextremely interested--and hasn't been for 10 minutes or 10 days or 10 \nmonths but 10 years--in privacy. He has been our leader on privacy on \nthis side of the aisle, and he believes we could finish it, if we had a \nfree shot at this cyber bill, in a couple of days--and I agree with \nhim--at the most. So we are not trying to avoid cyber. I believe--we \nbelieve it is an important part of what we need to do. But we should \ntake time to do it right. We should not be tacking this important piece \nof legislation onto a bill the President has already said he is going \nto veto just so the Republicans can blame Obama for vetoing this bill \nas well.\n  If the majority would withdraw their cyber amendment and agree to \ntake it up after this bill, we could do it in a couple of days and then \nwe could return to working on the Defense bill. But we cannot take up \nall these new amendments my friend the chairman of the committee wants \nto set up votes on--we have the 9 he talks about, plus 6; that is 15--\nuntil we resolve this matter dealing with cyber security.\n  So without belaboring the point--and I appreciate my impatient friend \nbeing patient with me and listening to me go through all of this--I ask \nthe majority leader or my friend the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee if he would modify his consent request as follows.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture motion with \nrespect to amendment No. 1569--that is cyber security--as modified, be \nwithdrawn; that the pending amendment No. 1569--again, that is cyber \nsecurity--as modified, be withdrawn; and that upon the disposition of \nH.R. 1735, the Defense authorization bill, the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 28, S. 754. That is the bill which came \nout of the Intelligence Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I am \ngoing to propose a modification of the consent request propounded by \nthe Democratic leader: that following disposition of H.R. 2685, the \nDefense appropriations bill, the Senate turn to consideration of S. \n754, the cyber security measure reported by the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee. I further ask that there be 10 relevant amendments to be \noffered by each bill manager or designee, with 1 hour of debate \nfollowed by a vote on the amendments offered, with a 60-vote threshold \non those amendments that are not germane to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nmajority leader?\n  The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object to my friend's \nmodification, I repeat, the cyber security bill is important and the \nSenate should turn to it, but putting it after the Defense \nappropriations bill is a false promise. It is a facade. I think it is \nvery clear. I heard the Republican leader give a speech on the floor \ntoday that he knows, unless there are some changes made, we are not \ngoing to get on the Defense appropriations bill. So this is a false \npromise.\n  If we could do it in a more specific, determined time, that would be \none thing, but the Republican leader obviously has no plan to complete \nthe Defense appropriations bill if this is how we are proceeding; \nrather, they are proceeding ahead with his partisan budget plan--a plan \nthe President said will not become law.\n  Until Republicans sit down to work out a bipartisan Senate budget, \nthe Senate will not finish the Defense authorization bill. Once again, \nthe right way to do this would be to consider the cyber security bill \non its own merits after the Defense authorization bill is done. It \nwould take 2 days.\n  So I ask the majority leader if he would modify his consent request \nto the following: that upon disposition of the Defense authorization \nbill, H.R. 1735, the Senate proceed to consideration of Calendar No. \n28, S. 754, which is the cyber security bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill object, I will point out that the Defense appropriations bill was \nreported out of the Appropriations Committee today with only three \nmembers voting against it. There was a lot of discussion about the \nDemocratic leader saying ``We are not going to pass the bill,'' but \nwhen the votes were counted, only three members--all on the Democratic \nside but only three--voted against reporting the bill out of committee.\n  My good friend the Democratic leader and I have had this discussion \nback and forth, but one of the advantages of being in the majority is \nthat we set the schedule, and we are going to do the Defense \nappropriations bill after we do the Defense authorization bill; \ntherefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nmajority leader?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Does the Senator from Arizona modify his request with the request of \nthe Democratic leader?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, may I make a couple of comments real quick \nbefore the distinguished majority leader modifies his request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would remind my good friend from Nevada, the Democratic \nleader, for the last 2 years we took up the Defense authorization bill, \nand it was taken up so late there was not a single amendment--not a \nsingle, solitary amendment on the Defense authorization bill for the \nlast 2 years. So I understand the Democratic leader's commitment to \namendments. It is too bad that for 2 years we never had a single \namendment to the Defense authorization bill.\n  As far as relevant amendments are concerned, one of the things about \nthis body is that everybody has the right to propose an amendment until \ntheir amendments are not made germane. The three pending Democratic \namendments we have now on the bill are not germane.\n  So all I can say is that I hope we can get a modification. I hope we \ncan move forward.\n  I just wish to point out one more time what I know that my colleagues \nhave heard over and over, and I will make it brief. Henry Kissinger \ntestified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that the world has \nnever been in more crises. This world is at risk, and we have to--we \nhave to protect the men and women who are serving in our security. I \nwould argue that a national defense authorization act is probably more \nimportant now than it has been at any time in recent history.\n  I refuse to modify my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator's original \nrequest?\n  Mr. REID. Which Senator?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n[[Page S4087]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding rule XXII, the cloture vote on amendment No. 1569 be \nmoved to 3 p.m. today and that the mandatory quorum call be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will be extremely brief. We can have a \ndebate here. We can look at all the press clippings of both sides on \nwhat happened in the last 2 years on Defense authorization. We didn't \nget a bill. We got a bill, but it was done in secret by the managers of \nthe two bills in the House and the Senate. The reason that happened--it \nwasn't our fault. They wouldn't let us on the bill--``they'' meaning \nthe Republicans. So we can debate that all we want. Those are the \nfacts.\n  I do not object to my friend's request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk on \nthe McCain substitute amendment No. 1463.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the McCain \n     amendment No. 1463 to H.R. 1735, an act to authorize \n     appropriations for fiscal year 2016 for military activities \n     of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and \n     for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to \n     prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, \n     and for other purposes.\n         Mitch McConnell, John McCain, Richard C.

Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk \nwith respect to the underlying House bill, H.R. 1735.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on H.R. 1735, an \n     act to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2016 for \n     military activities of the Department of Defense, for \n     military construction, and for defense activities of the \n     Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel \n     strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes.\n         Mitch McConnell, John McCain, Richard C. Shelby, Jeff \n           Flake, John Barrasso, John Cornyn, Mike Rounds, Jeff \n           Sessions, Shelley Moore Capito, Lamar Alexander, \n           Lindsey Graham, Joni Ernst, John Hoeven, Roger F. \n           Wicker, Kelly Ayotte, Richard Burr, Thom Tillis.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1569, as Modified\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in just a moment, the Senate will \nconsider an important cyber security measure. I urge every one of my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  USA TODAY recently cited a cyber security expert who noted that this \nSenate legislation has the potential to greatly reduce the number of \nvictims targeted by the kinds of hackers we have seen in recent years. \nIt contains modern tools to help deter future attacks against both the \ngovernment and the private sector, to provide them with knowledge to \nerect stronger defenses, and to get the word out faster about attacks \nwhen they are detected.\n  The top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee reminded us that the \ncyber security measure before us would also protect individual privacy \nand civil liberties. She has urged Congress to ``act quickly'' to deter \na threat that is literally impossible to overstate.\n  The White House has also urged Congress to act.\n  The new Congress has been asked to act, and today we are, with a \ngood, strong, transparent, bipartisan measure which has been thoroughly \nvetted by both parties in committee and which has been available for \nmonths--literally months--for anyone to read. It was endorsed by nearly \nevery Democrat and every Republican on the Intelligence Committee, 14 \nto 1. It is also backed by a broad coalition of supporters, everyone \nfrom the chamber of commerce to the United States Telecom Association.\n  It is legislation that is all about protecting our country, which is \nwhy it makes perfect sense to consider it alongside defense legislation \nwith the very same aim. Cyber security amendments can be offered, and \nthe debate will continue.\n  So let's work together to advance this measure. There are now 4 \nmillion extra reasons for Congress to act quickly. The sooner we do, \nthe sooner we can conference it with similar legislation that passed \nthe House and get a good cyber security law enacted to help protect our \ncountry. The opportunity to begin doing that will come in a few moments \nwith a vote for cloture on this bipartisan cyber security bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have on the Senate floor an authorization \nbill for about $600 billion--Defense authorization for about $600 \nbillion. I can't imagine the procedural games, the chicanery involved \nin this. Why did we yesterday have on this bill something on Ex-Im \nBank? Was it just to check it off so they could say we tried and \nDemocrats wouldn't let us do it? Why would we have on this $600 billion \nbill dealing with the security of this Nation something else that also \ndeals with the security of this Nation and that deserves a separate \npiece of legislation so we can have amendments and talk about that? We \nhave agreed to do it in a very short period of time.\n  There is no good reason for doing it this way. We should limit the \nmatter at hand to the Defense authorization bill at some $600 billion, \nand then we have agreed to go to cyber security. We are willing to do \nthat. But I cannot imagine--I cannot imagine--why the Republican leader \nis doing this. It makes a mockery of the legislative process.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield to the ranking member of the \ncommittee for a question.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Leader, I strongly oppose cloture on this cyber measure \nand I want to ask the Senator a question.\n  I think we all understand how dangerous hackers are. They are \nincreasingly sophisticated. The most dangerous hackers rarely use the \nsame technique twice. I believe what the Senator is saying is we can't \ndeal with this responsibly by stapling the cyber bill to something \nelse. Is that one of the key reasons the leader is opposing this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, respectfully, I suggest we are on leader \ntime now. My time is protected--or used to be--and the Senator asked me \na question. I yielded to him for a question. He should have the right \nto answer the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I will be very brief.\n  I oppose cloture on the cyber measure. I think what the leader is \nsaying is that the cyber measure is so serious we shouldn't deal with \nit by stapling it to something else. It is so important we ought to \nhave an opportunity over that 2-day period to deal with it separately; \nis that the leader's view?\n  Mr. REID. Without any question.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on amendment No. \n     1569, as modified, to the McCain\n\n[[Page S4088]]\n\n     amendment No. 1463 to H.R. 1735, an act to authorize \n     appropriations for fiscal year 2016 for military activities \n     of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and \n     for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to \n     prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, \n     and for other purposes.\n         Mitch McConnell, Lamar Alexander, John Cornyn, Orrin G. \n           Hatch, David Perdue, Bob Corker, Michael B. Enzi, Susan \n           M. Collins, Jeff Flake, Mike Rounds, Richard Burr, \n           David Vitter, James M. Inhofe, Daniel Coats, John \n           McCain, Deb Fischer, Tom Cotton.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on \namendment No. 1569, as modified, offered by the Senator from Arizona, \nMr. McCain, for the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Burr, to the \nsubstitute amendment No. 1463, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, now that we concluded the vote, I would \nlike to announce for the Record that I am privileged and honored to be \nable to host a number of people from my alma mater, Wheaton College. \nThe board of trustees is holding a meeting here in Washington. They are \nvisiting the Capitol and we are about to go on a tour.\n  I want to thank them for their service to our college and to America. \nThey are spending a good amount of time here working through issues \nthat are very important to the school. Wheaton College is an \nevangelical school that has been true to the faith in dealing with the \nchallenges that exist today. I am pleased to be able to acknowledge \nthat they are here visiting the Capitol, and enjoying the sites of \nWashington while making some tough decisions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Sanders pertaining to the introduction of S. 1564 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                Federal Vehicle Repair Cost Savings Act\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support \nthe bipartisan legislation I introduced with my colleague Senator \nLankford, the Federal Vehicle Repair Cost Savings Act.\n  I am pleased the Senate is considering the first bill I introduced as \na Senator, which was approved by the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee on a unanimous vote earlier this year.\n  I appreciate Senator Lankford partnering with me to work on this \nlegislation in committee and as it has moved to the Senate floor. I \nlook forward to continuing to work with him as a member of the \nsubcommittee he chairs, the Regulatory Affairs and Federal Management \nSubcommittee.\n  I also appreciate that my colleague from Michigan Representative \nHuizenga has introduced bipartisan companion legislation in the House \nof Representatives.\n  The Federal Vehicle Repair Cost Savings Act is a bipartisan, \ncommonsense measure that will help save taxpayers money and promote \nconservation by encouraging Federal agencies to use remanufactured auto \nparts when they are maintaining their fleets of vehicles.\n  In addition to saving money, this legislation also supports \nremanufacturing suppliers and their employees in Michigan and across \nthe country. Remanufactured parts are usually less expensive than \nsimilar parts and have been returned to same-as-new condition using a \nstandardized industrial process.\n  The United States is the largest producer, consumer, and exporter of \nremanufactured goods. Remanufacturing of motor vehicle parts accounts \nfor over 30,000 full-time U.S. jobs, and our country employs over \n20,000 workers remanufacturing off-road equipment.\n  In addition to the cost savings using remanufactured parts, it also \nhas significant environmental benefits. Remanufacturing saves energy by \nreusing raw materials such as iron, aluminum, and copper. On average, \nthe remanufacturing process saves approximately 85 percent of the \nenergy and material used to manufacture equivalent new products.\n  I urge my colleagues to support S. 565, the Federal Vehicle Repair \nCost Savings Act, commonsense legislation that is good for taxpayers, \nour environment, and American manufacturers.\n  Mr. President, I also rise to support the bipartisan Ayotte-Peters \namendment to authorize bilateral research and development with Israel \non anti-tunnel capabilities.\n  I appreciate Senator Ayotte's efforts to work together on this \ncritical matter of national security. Israel remains our closest ally \nin the Middle East, and this amendment will further our shared \ncooperation to increase security for both Americans and Israelis.\n  Our ally Israel faces significant threats from underground tunnels \nbuilt by terrorists intent on murdering innocent Israelis. Hamas and \nHezbollah threaten Israel with an extensive network of sophisticated \ntunnels which are used to smuggle weapons and carry out kidnappings and \nattacks against Israeli citizens.\n  These are not simple tunnels dug by hand with shovels. These tunnels \ncost millions of dollars and are built with thousands of tons of \nconcrete. Often they are built using resources intended for \nhumanitarian purposes in Gaza but are instead diverted to terrorist \nactivity. They are constructed with machinery designed to avoid \ndetection. In some cases, Hamas has filled the tunnels with provisions \nto last several months. The Israeli Defense Forces called the tunnels \nunderneath Gaza an underground city of terror.\n  Bomb attacks from tunnels dug by terrorist organizations are a \ngrowing threat to forward deployed U.S. forces and our diplomatic \npersonnel abroad. Terrorists carry out these attacks by digging tunnels \nunderneath a target and detonating explosives.\n  Earlier this week, the publication Defense One reported that ISIS is \nalso using tunnel bombs as a tactic, detonating at least 45 tunnel \nbombs in Iraq and Syria over the last 2 years.\n  We face threats from tunnels on American soil as well. Our own Border \nPatrol and law enforcement on the\n\n[[Page S4089]]\n\nsouthern border are up against drug smugglers, human traffickers, and \nother global criminal organizations using tunnels to sneak drugs, \nweapons, and people across our border illegally.\n  I serve on the Homeland Security Committee and understand the threat \nour Border Patrol agents and law enforcement face from transnational \ncriminal organizations using tunnels along our southern border. These \ncriminals flow to the path of least resistance, and as our border \nsecurity efforts address one threat, they seek other methods to avoid \ndetection and continue their criminal activity.\n  When the U.S. Border Patrol blocked drug smugglers and human \ntraffickers from utilizing existing drainage tunnels, the criminals \nbegan digging their own tunnels. We need to stay ahead of these \nthreats, and that is why we must conduct critical research and \ndevelopment so we can detect and destroy these dangerous tunnels.\n  This amendment will authorize joint research and development with \nIsrael on anti-tunnel capabilities. This joint approach will help us \nwork together on research and development against this shared threat.\n  The amendment requires Israel to share in the cost of this research \nand provides a framework for sharing intellectual property developed \ntogether before action is carried out. This amendment will allow the \nDepartment of Defense to work with Israel to develop a capability that \nwill be used to protect our homeland and our troops abroad as well as \nthose of our ally.\n  This amendment will make clear that joint research and development on \nanti-tunnel capabilities can and should be part of our security \ncooperation with Israel. It will also send a strong message that the \nSenate recognizes the threat posed by tunnels intended for attacks \nagainst Israel, and this cooperation will help us secure our own \nborders as well.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support the Ayotte-Peters amendment No. \n1628.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. \n1569, as modified, be withdrawn; that the next first-degree amendments \nin order to H.R. 1735, the Defense authorization bill, be the \nGillibrand amendment No. 1578 and the Ernst amendment No. 1549; and \nthat the Gillibrand and Ernst amendments be subject to a 60-\naffirmative-vote threshold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, over the last few days, this Chamber has \nbeen discussing the Defense authorization bill, thus fulfilling one of \nour basic responsibilities as part of the Federal Government; that is, \nour national security, and in the process making sure our warfighters--\nthe people who are on the cutting edge of the knife, so to speak, in \nterms of our national security--have the resources we are morally \ncommitted and duty-bound to provide them.\n  So when voting for the Defense authorization bill, we as legislators \nare fulfilling our responsibilities, just as those who wear the uniform \nare performing their duties--no more, no less--although I must say ours \nis a tad safer than they are experiencing, to be sure.\n  With so much at stake for the security of our country, the well-being \nof our folks in uniform as well as the families of those servicemembers \nhanging in the balance, as I mentioned yesterday, it is particularly \ndisappointing that the Democratic leader has characterized the \ndiscussion of this bill as ``a waste of time.'' I really have to \nbelieve he would want to take those words back because it certainly is \nnot a waste of time.\n  Unfortunately, it is becoming more and more evident that the threats \nof the Democratic leader and the President of the United States to \nstall Republicans' efforts to get this bill passed quickly is just the \nfirst step to a larger political strategy. The reason I know that is \nnot because it just occurred to me--an epiphany--it is because they \nsaid so in the pages of the Washington Post just yesterday.\n  The headline says it all: ``Democrats prepare for filibuster \nsummer.'' That is the headline in the Washington Post yesterday.\n  The article goes on to say: ``Democrats have decided to block all \nspending bills starting with the defense appropriations measure headed \nto the floor next week.''\n  So imagine my surprise when yesterday the Democratic leader came to \nthe floor and accused Republicans of threatening to shut down the \ngovernment, the same day his colleague, the senior Senator from New \nYork, detailed their strategy to block all appropriations bills, in the \nWashington Post.\n  One thing we have to love about our friends across the aisle: They \nare not unclear, nor are they timid, about telling us what their plans \nare. Indeed, it is there for the world to read and for us to read.\n  But let me say it again. Hours after the Democratic leader laid out \ntheir plans to filibuster all government spending bills, their leader \nclaimed Republicans were the ones threatening a shutdown.\n  This type of cynical political maneuvering is what the American \npeople so soundly rejected in the last election on November 4. Stifling \ndebate and shutting down the Senate are not what the American people \nsent us to do, and it is certainly not what my constituents expect me \nto do on their behalf.\n  Today, our colleagues across the aisle have now blocked an amendment \nthat would provide for greater sharing of information to address the \nrampant and growing cyber threat this country faces. The sharing of \ncyber threat information will help us as a country deter future cyber \nattacks, and it helps both the public and the private sector to act in \na more nimble way when attacks are detected. So the fact that seven \nDemocrats joined virtually all Republicans to move forward with this \nbill, tells me the Democratic position is not monolithic. In other \nwords, when the Democratic leader and the senior Senator from New York \nsay it is our plan to shut down the Senate and not to cooperate to get \nthe people's work done, not every Member of the Democratic minority are \ncomfortable with that cynical strategy--and good for them.\n  The refusal to move forward with this legislation, particularly the \ncyber security part of this discussion, is just unconscionable.\n  Let me give my colleagues some other headlines. Just last week, there \nwas a massive breach at the Office of Personnel Management. The \nsensitive personal information of up to 4 million--4 million--current \nand former Federal employees may have been compromised. There are now \nreports that the stolen data includes login information and credentials \nthat is actively being traded, bought, and sold online.\n  Now, we will await the details of the current investigation into \nthis, but we know it has great potential to harm not only the privacy \ninterests and the financial interests of the people affected but also \nour national security. We know there are state actors--notably China \nand Russia--who are, on a regular basis, engaged in cyber attacks \nagainst the United States in an effort to steal our intellectual \nproperty as well as in order to do intelligence operations using the \nInternet and using cyber space.\n  Now, in terms of the personal interests of these employees, it may \nexpose them--many of whom may work with national security matters--to \nfurther targeting by hackers, identity thieves, and even foreign \nintelligence agents.\n  At the end of last month, it was reported that the data of more than \n100,000 taxpayers was stolen at the IRS. Just so colleagues understand \nthe reason for my concern, the former Acting Director of the CIA, on \nJune 11, 2015, when asked about former Senator and former Secretary of \nState Hillary Clinton's decision to put all of her official emails at \nthe Secretary of State's office on a private email server, Michael \nMorell said: ``I think that foreign intelligence services, the good \nones, have everything on any unclassified network that the government \nuses.''\n  So not only do they have it on unclassified networks such as the one \nHillary Clinton maintained, but also if they are able to breach the \nsecurity measures we have in place on government networks, they are \nhappy to steal\n\n[[Page S4091]]\n\nthat for whatever their purpose may be, whether it is intelligence-\ngathering or whether it is economic harm that they can impose on \nAmerican citizens by hacking their identity or stealing their bank \naccounts or what have you.\n  So we also have to be worried about the 100,000 people whose accounts \nwere hacked at the IRS. The suggestion that was made by the IRS \nCommissioner at the Finance Committee recently is that these identity \nthieves steal this information so they can then file false tax returns \nand then claim the refunds or the other credit that those taxpayers \nwould have otherwise been able to receive. Imagine when these 100,000 \nor so taxpayers go about the business of filing their own tax returns, \nonly to find out that a cyber thief has stolen their identity and filed \na tax return and taken their refund or their tax credit before they \never had a chance to do it.\n  At the IRS, we know the breach included access to past tax returns. \nAs we all know, we have to put a lot of sensitive information on tax \nreturns. That is why they are not public information. But they also \ninclude sensitive information such as Social Security numbers, \naddresses, birth dates--all stolen and potentially in the hands of \ncriminals.\n  The hypocrisy of the administration in this area is just \nbreathtaking. It was just June 6--last Saturday--that Josh Earnest, the \nWhite House Press Secretary, chastised Congress, on behalf of the \nPresident of the United States, for not acting urgently enough on the \nissue of cyber security. Here is what Mr. Earnest said: ``We need the \nUnited States Congress to come out of the Dark Ages and actually join \nus here in the 21st century to make sure that we have the kinds of \ndefenses that are necessary to protect a modern computer system.''\n  That is what White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said on June 6, \n2015.\n  Then our colleagues on the Democratic side have the temerity to come \nhere and block the very type of legislation that the White House has \ncalled for. How hypocritical can you get? How cynical can you get? \nIndeed, the Democratic leader then says, well, they are doing \neverything the way they should be doing it, and it is really a \nRepublican conspiracy to shut down the government.\n  These are just the most recent examples of a threat that should be \nkeeping us up at night--a threat that should cause us to quickly act to \nfind solutions to the cyber security threat to the American people and \nto the United States Government and, yes, to our national security.\n  Some of our Democratic friends act as if the fact that we have \ndecided to file an amendment to the Defense authorization bill, which \nrepresents an almost unanimous vote of the bipartisan vote of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, was some sort of dirty trick--that we \npulled a fast one on them. Well, this legislation has been out there \nfor the world to see for quite a while now, and it was negotiated by \nthe senior Senator from California, the ranking member on the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, Senator Feinstein, and Senator Burr, the \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee, and as I said, it only had one \ndissenting vote in the Senate Intelligence Committee. So to have the \ngall to come on the Senate floor and act as if this is some sort of \npulling a fast one or some sort of trick is just disingenuous. I could \nprobably think of some other words to describe it, too, but \n``disingenuous'' will have to suffice for now.\n  To come out here and to block debate on a vote on a cyber security \nbill at a time when the news is chock-full of the nature of this threat \nand its intrusive invasion into the privacy of the American people and \nits danger to our national security is just flat out irresponsible. \nThese are not threats we can afford to ignore.\n  And here is the coup de grace--the icing on the cake. Two months ago \nthe Democratic leader came to the floor and said he was ``committed'' \nto getting cyber security legislation done, and that was before these \nmost recent attacks. So for the Democratic leader to claim this morning \nthat Senate Republicans were--these are his words--using ``deceitful \nploys'' to ensure our Nation is safe from these threats is really \nbeyond the pale.\n  In addition to the clear and undeniable urgency of the problem, I \nwould like to also point out that this was the same language that was, \nas I said, passed out of the Intelligence Committee in March. So \nperhaps you can understand why I am so confused by our Democratic \ncolleagues' position and actually by the White House's position.\n  The White House called for cyber security legislation. Cyber security \nlegislation gets voted out of the Senate Intelligence Committee 14 to \n1. The Democratic leader said we need to act on cyber security, and we \ntry to act on cyber security legislation, only to be blocked by the \nDemocratic leader. All I can see is the Democratic leader's \n``commitment'' to work on cyber legislation has given way to partisan \ngamesmanship by our Democratic colleagues who are promising ``a \nfilibuster summer.'' Well, welcome to the filibuster summer.\n  But this is not what the American people deserve. This isn't why they \nsent us here, and this is what they affirmatively rejected this last \nelection. But somehow our Democratic colleagues just can't stand it \nthat we have actually turned things around and we have been able to \nmake some slow, incremental progress. We passed the first budget since \n2009. You know, that should be a scandal, but I guess it represents \nprogress that we finally have been able to do it with the new majority \nstarting in January. We have worked with the White House to pass trade \npromotion authority and some things that are tough and are \ncontroversial on both sides of the aisle. We have taken a number of \npositive steps on child trafficking and on a number of other topics. \nNow we are trying to do our most basic duty and deal with our Nation's \ndefense, and that includes protecting our Nation's cyber security \ninfrastructure while we fund our Armed Forces to make sure they have \nthe resources to do what they volunteered to do so bravely on our \nbehalf.\n  The men and women of this country and particularly the men and women \nwho wear the uniform of the U.S. military deserve better. This National \nDefense Authorization Act, this basic bill to which the cyber security \nlanguage was being offered, has strong bipartisan support, and it \npassed out of the Armed Services Committee overwhelmingly. And do you \nknow what? It even authorizes funding levels at the figure requested by \nthe President of the United States. Yet our Senate Democratic \ncolleagues are still dragging their feet, refusing to allow us to vote \non amendments to this bill and defeating the very cyber security \nprovision that the Democratic leader said we ought to get to and that \nJosh Earnest chastised Congress for not passing. Yet Members of his own \npolitical party--the President's own political party--blocked that \ncyber security legislation.\n  So this bill should not be held hostage to political gamesmanship. \nThe American people's security and safety should not be held hostage to \npolitical gamesmanship, and the Senate, which used to be known as the \nworld's greatest deliberative body, should not be used just purely for \npartisan gain.\n  So I hope that the seven Democrats who actually voted to proceed on \nthis cyber security bill will get some more allies. I can tell that not \nall of our friends across the aisle are comfortable with the Democratic \nleader's direction to block this cyber security legislation, and \nperhaps over the weekend, some will have second thoughts. I hope as \nthey have those second thoughts, they will focus on our collective duty \nto our troops and their families and to our duty as Members of the \nSenate to promote and protect the security of the American people.\n  So let's get back to basics. Let's do what the American people \nelected us to do by voting on a bipartisan bill that will protect our \ncountry and provide for our troops.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last month I was here on the Senate floor\n\n[[Page S4092]]\n\nto address the topic of the riots in Baltimore and the unfortunate and \ncompletely misguided scapegoating of police officers that has been \ngoing on far too often in parts of our country today. So I rise again \ntoday on the same topic because in just the last month or so there have \nbeen some more very harmful developments in this area.\n  One of those developments is the dramatic decline in police arrests \nand a massive increase in violent crime and murders in the city of \nBaltimore. Now, some of my friends would say: Why is the Senator from \nPennsylvania speaking out so often about these tragic circumstances \nthat are happening in Baltimore? Well, first of all, as a U.S. Senator, \nI am concerned with what goes on in our entire country, not just my \nState. Baltimore is a great American city that is going through a very \ndifficult period, and we should all be concerned about it. Second of \nall, Baltimore is, of course, less than 100 miles away from \nPennsylvania. Most importantly, what is happening in Baltimore is not \nhappening only in Baltimore. The scapegoating of police and the rise of \nviolent crime is happening in New York City and in other places as \nwell. And, frankly, it is a threat to public safety and security in \nevery city.\n  Some, including the police chief of St. Louis, MO, have described \nwhat has come to be known as the Ferguson effect. This can be traced \nback to the riots and lawlessness that followed the unfortunate death \nof Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO, last August. As you will remember, in \nthe Ferguson case, Officer Darren Wilson acted in self-defense and shot \nand killed Brown when Brown attacked him while he was resisting arrest. \nIn the weeks and months that followed the incident, and after Officer \nWilson was cleared of wrongdoing, violent protests erupted. Protesters, \npolice, and bystanders were injured. Buildings were burned to the \nground. Property was destroyed. But instead of placing the onus on \nthose who were actually causing the havoc, it was portrayed by many as \nif law enforcement was somehow responsible for the violence and unrest. \nAnti-law enforcement sentiments were even expressed by some of the \nlocal officials in Ferguson. This endorsement of violent protesters \nempowered those who wished to turn peaceful protests into violent \nriots, and it also left the police feeling powerless.\n  What has happened in Ferguson since is as tragic as it was \npredictable. The homicide rate in Ferguson increased 47 percent in the \nlatter portion of 2014, and robberies in St. Louis County jumped by 82 \npercent. This really should be no surprise. This is what happens when a \ncity puts these views of ``police as the problem'' into practice, such \nas when a city determines that police are the cause of the violence as \nopposed to the brave defense against it, when a city justifies \nlawlessness, stops law enforcement from doing its job, and allows law \nbreakers to go unpunished. The results of those practices are that the \ninnocent members of those very communities pay a horrible price.\n  These tragic circumstances are now playing out in the city of \nBaltimore. On April 18 of this year, many Baltimore residents began \npeaceful protests over the injury and eventual death of Mr. Freddie \nGray while he was in police custody. As I mentioned in my speech about \nthis last month, in my view, Freddie Gray's death absolutely calls out \nfor justice and calls out for a thorough investigation, and the \njudicial process is now proceeding and playing out exactly as it \nshould. But what has happened in Baltimore since then is not about \nFreddie Gray.\n  A week after the Baltimore protests began, on April 25, they turned \nviolent. Over the next 5 days rioters damaged 200 businesses. They set \nfire to a newly constructed senior center, burned down a CVS drugstore \nand cut the fire hose of the firemen who were trying to put out the \nflames, and set fire to 144 cars. And 130 law enforcement officers were \ninjured, many seriously. The chaos was so extreme that the city had to \nimpose a curfew for 5 days and had to call in 3,000 National Guard \ntroops.\n  Now with all that mayhem, how did the public officials of Baltimore \nrespond? On the first day of the violence, the mayor held a press \nconference in which she legitimized the violence. She said: ``We also \ngave those who wish to destroy space to do that as well.''\n  Seriously, space to destroy? Destroying other people's property, \nsetting buildings and cars ablaze, attacking police officers? These are \nnot legitimate acts, and no mayor should be accommodating those kinds \nof acts with ``space.'' In fact, they are criminal. They are harmful. \nThese are exactly the kinds of activities that a mayor should be all \nabout stopping and preventing. But that is not all.\n  Next the Baltimore police were given a stand-down order, and they \nwere forbidden from arresting the looters and the rioters. Then \nofficials announced that half of all those arrested for the destruction \nand violence would be released without charges. Mobs would gather \naround police when they tried to enforce the law. All this is a clear \nillustration of the impact that the Ferguson effect is having on \nBaltimore.\n  Lawbreakers are in control, and the city's residents are at the mercy \nof the lawbreakers. Law enforcement has been limited because of a lack \nof support from the community and the civic and the political leaders.\n\n  Baltimore has seen the disastrous effects of this policy. The riots \nbegan to subside on April 30 when six police officers were arrested in \nthe death of Mr. Gray, but the violence has continued. The month of May \nthat just passed was Baltimore's deadliest month in over 40 years. \nThere were 43 homicides in the month of May alone. Shootings have more \nthan doubled compared to May of the previous year. These murders have \nnothing to do with anger over the death of Freddie Gray; they have \neverything to do with public policy that disparages police and turns a \nblind eye on criminal activity. You see, in Baltimore in the month of \nMay, arrests were nearly 70 percent lower than the same month last \nyear.\n  Some attempt to portray this whole crisis in racial terms, but \ntragically all too often the victims of this surge in violent crime are \ninnocent African Americans who live in cities in which the police are \nno longer permitted to do their jobs.\n  Consider the case of an 8-year-old boy police found shot in the head \non Thursday, May 28 at 8:20 a.m. He was lying dead beside his mother, \nwho had also been fatally shot in the head.\n  Take the case of 23-year-old Charles Dobbins, who was killed on \nMonday, May 25. Charles' cousin reports that Charles was killed in a \nrobbery. Charles worked at BWI. He worked transporting handicapped \npeople to and from the terminals. He loved kids. When he graduated from \nhigh school, he worked for Baltimore city schools as a bus aid \nassisting disabled children.\n  Consider the case of 4-year-old Jacele Johnson. She was in a car with \nher teenage cousin when someone opened fire on the car, seriously \nwounding them both.\n  These are not just statistics; these are real people who are now lost \nto us. Their lives matter. That 8-year-old boy and his mother, 23-year-\nold Charles Dobbins, a little 4-year-old girl, Jacele Johnson, and her \ncousin--their lives matter.\n  The Ferguson effect, unfortunately, is not the only phenomenon that \nis at work here. Unfortunately, our President seems to have bought into \nthe notion that the police are the problem and the solution is to deny \nthem valuable tools.\n  This last month, the President announced extensive restrictions on \nwhen local police may access lifesaving Federal surplus equipment. The \ngear we are talking about is almost all purely defensive. It is riot \nhelmets, riot shields, armored personnel transport vehicles. This is \nsurplus gear. The Federal Government has already paid for it but has \ndecided it has no use for it. It has long been the practice that this \nsurplus protective gear has been made available to local police forces.\n  Why is this administration making it harder to send this purely \ndefensive gear--gear that would otherwise go unused--to insufficiently \nprotected police officers across the country? Why would the \nadministration do that? Well, they released a report telling us why. \nHere is what they said in their own report. According to this report by \nthe administration, the Federal equipment ``could significantly \nundermine community trust'' and that this concern outweighs the \ninterest in ``addressing law enforcement needs (that could not \notherwise be fulfilled).'' President Obama likewise opined that Federal \nequipment ``can sometimes give people\n\n[[Page S4093]]\n\na feeling like there's an occupying force'' and ``can send the wrong \nmessage.''\n  So this is the concern that justified keeping lifesaving gear from \npolice officers. So, according to the administration, the need to save \npolice officers' lives in the line of duty is something that should be \nweighed against and, in fact, sacrificed to the desire to prevent \ndistrust or discomfort on the part of others. How many police officers' \nlives are we going to sacrifice? One? Twenty? One-hundred? This is \noutrageous.\n  Each day across America, there are 780,000 law enforcement officers \nwho put on a badge and uniform, and they answer the call of those in \nneed no matter the danger. When others run away, they run to the \nproblem. The rest of us in America rely on these law enforcement \nofficers doing their job. The people who live in high-crime areas, \noften ethnic minorities living in high-poverty areas of our inner \ncities--these are the folks who most depend on those officers. When \nthose officers are held back, we all pay a steep price, but the \nresidents of those communities pay the steepest price.\n  I just hope we in the Federal Government will stop putting obstacles \nin the way of law enforcement and start supporting them. I hope we as a \nnation will stop scapegoating law enforcement and start thanking them. \nIf we fail to reverse the Ferguson effect, what we will see is more \nviolent crime and more suffering of our people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, over the past few years, bipartisanship \nhas not always fared well in the Senate. We have been able to change \nthe Chamber's culture for the better in 2015. Now that is in jeopardy \nonce again.\n  In the first half of the year, we had a number of bipartisan \naccomplishments. It kicked off with the passage of the Clay Hunt \nSuicide Prevention for American Veterans Act at the beginning of the \nyear. The new law will provide the VA with the personnel, services, and \nproper tools to help veterans facing mental illness struggles, which is \nvital as it is estimated that 22 veterans commit suicide every day. The \nClay Hunt act will help stop this tragic and unacceptable trend.\n  Then we were able to pass the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act \nin a unanimous fashion. This law will save lives. It will restore \ndignity to the victims of these heinous crimes, and it will help end \nmodern-day slavery.\n  We followed that with legislation that will give Congress a voice in \nthe President's negotiations with Iran over its illicit nuclear \nprogram. There was such a strong show of bipartisanship on this vote \nthat it forced President Obama to drop his initial veto threat. Had we \nnot maintained bipartisan unity, there would be no review of the Iran \ndeal. There would be nothing stopping President Obama from signing a \nbad agreement with Iran. It is because we stood together across party \nlines that the American people will now have a say in negotiations.\n  Before we adjourned for the Memorial Day work period, we approved \ngranting the President trade promotion authority. We worked together to \nprovide the President with the necessary tools to negotiate a fair \ntrade deal while maintaining Congress's important role in the process.\n  I say all this to highlight what we can accomplish when we work \ntogether. Unfortunately, the minority leader seems intent on ending \nthat streak.\n  We are in the midst of discussing another bill which should have \nsubstantial bipartisan support, the National Defense Authorization Act. \nYet, Minority Leader Reid has called this vital, traditionally \nbipartisan bill ``a waste of time.'' This is a bill which, as the \nsenior Senator from Arizona has noted, Congress has passed for 53 \nconsecutive years, including those when the minority leader controlled \nthe Senate schedule.\n  Far from a waste of time, the NDAA helps us modernize our military to \nface today's security challenges. We live in a dangerous world. We have \nto stay ahead of those who would seek to harm us, not fall behind them. \nThis is no time to be dismissive of our national security needs.\n  It is also about the livelihood of over 1.4 million men and women on \nActive Duty and 718,000 civilian personnel. We are talking about the \nNation's largest employer. The NDAA helps us ensure that we are doing \neverything we need to do to help them. So I think we can all agree \nthere is much in this bill that needs to get done.\n  Unfortunately, the White House is taking what should be a bipartisan \nbill and using it to push for its own political end game to increase \ndomestic spending. Worse yet, the President has somehow convinced \nSenate Democrats to go along with this misguided strategy.\n  Instead of approaching this in a bipartisan manner, the minority \nleader is forcing his caucus to carry water for President Obama, who \nhas indicated he would veto the NDAA unless he gets the domestic \nspending increases he is demanding. That means the President stands \nready to block the policy prescriptions and funding levels for the \nDepartment of Defense unless we give other agencies, such as the EPA, \nas they try their additional power grab through things like the Clean \nWater Act and extending that, and the IRS, as they waste money on \nbonuses for their employees--all of this is very dangerous.\n  There will be plenty of time to debate our domestic spending \npriorities and allotments, but now is not the time. Let's get that \nbipartisan mentality back and finish the work that needs to be done to \nprotect our Nation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today, as I have for a number of weeks, \nI rise to speak about 11 North Dakotans who did not come home from the \nVietnam war. Each of these men gave his life for our country.\n  Before I begin speaking about the 198 North Dakotans who died during \nVietnam, I wish to thank my great friend, Bill Anderson of Rutland, ND. \nBill is a marine, and he is a veteran of the Vietnam war.\n  Bill grew up in Rutland, attended the University of North Dakota, and \nthen started law school at the University of Colorado. It was the late \n1960s, and young men with college degrees were being drafted. So Bill \nleft law school, enlisted in the Marine Corps, and was trained to be an \nofficer. In 1970, he arrived in Vietnam and became the commander of the \n2nd Platoon of Delta Company, 1st Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment.\n  Bill's own written words about the impact the Vietnam war had on him \nstrike me. He didn't choose to write about his blindness caused by the \nmalaria vaccine that he took or his lymphoma caused by Agent Orange \nexposure. Instead, Bill focused on his experience in Vietnam and on the \ngreatness of the 18- and 20-year-old Marines with whom he served. Bill \nwrites:\n\n       I am proud, every day, of the Marines I served with in \n     Vietnam. They did not shrink from danger. They did not flinch \n     at combat. They did their duty with steadfast courage of \n     United States Marines, and for that Americans can, and \n     should, be proud and grateful.\n\n  I am grateful for Bill's service to our country. I am also proud of \nhis service to my State. After his time in the Marines, Bill ran his \nfamily-owned insurance business. And then, when he was 40 years old and \nhad lost most of his vision, he returned to law school. Since the \n1980s, Bill has served many communities in southeastern North Dakota as \na private practice lawyer. In fact, I can tell you this, as a lawyer \nmyself: Bill Anderson is one of the most brilliant\n\n[[Page S4094]]\n\nlawyers I have ever worked with. And since 2004, Bill has been a \nSargent County Commissioner.\n  So thank you, Bill. I hope that you will have a great reunion later \nthis month in Tennessee with the Marines of Company D.\n  Mr. President, I now wish to take a few moments to talk about the \nlives of those Vietnam veterans who did not come home.\n\n\n                              Arlan Gable\n\n  Arlan Gable was from Rolette. He was born February 3, 1938. He served \nin the Army's 25th Infantry Division. Arlan was 29 years old when he \ndied on June 10, 1967.\n  He was the youngest of 10 children and grew up on his parents' farm \noutside of Rolette. Arlan's niece, Sandi, remembers all the animals on \nthe farm, and in particular, she remembers chasing his mother's geese.\n  Each of the five boys in the family served our country in the \nmilitary. Right after graduating from high school, Arlan enlisted in \nthe Army. He served in Korea and Germany, and he served two tours of \nduty in Vietnam. Arlan was killed while serving as the gunner on a tank \nwhen the tank hit a landmine. About 1 month before, Arlan had been home \non leave. After his death, Arlan's mother's health deteriorated very \nrapidly.\n\n\n                              Mark Mangin\n\n  Mark Mangin, a native of Verono, was born April 29, 1949. He served \nin the Marine Corps' 3rd Marine Amphibious Force. On October 1, 1969, \nMark died. He was only 20 years old.\n  He grew up on his parents' small farm and had one brother, Marvin. \nMarvin said that during high school Mark played basketball and loved \nfixing old cars. The brothers both worked for neighboring farmers. \nBefore graduating, Mark enlisted to serve because he wanted to become a \nmarine. He earned his GED while at basic training.\n  Mark sent letters home from Vietnam asking Marvin to take care of \ntheir mom and dad, and he wrote that he was an expert marksman and \nliked what he was doing. He included pictures of himself holding young \nVietnamese children.\n  When he had less than 1 month left of his tour of duty in Vietnam, \nMark was killed when someone near him tripped the wire of a boobytrap. \nHis brother believes that with his mechanical abilities, he would have \nbecome a mechanic.\n\n\n                            Michael Meyhoff\n\n  Michael Meyhoff was from Center and was born February 3, 1948.

Two of his brothers, Rick and Brent, also served in the \nArmy.\n  While growing up, Michael enjoyed helping his grandparents on their \nfamily farm near Center, ND. Michael's brother, Rick, says that Michael \nwas a good athlete and was an explorer. He always had to see what was \nover the next hill. He especially loved fishing with his father and \nalways looked forward to fishing trips as opportunities to explore and \nspend time with his family in the outdoors. Michael was very family-\nminded and was excellent at writing letters and responding to letters \nfrom his brothers, sisters, parents, and grandparents.\n  When he died, Michael's community was deeply affected. Now, 47 years \nafter his death, his family and community still think about him or talk \nabout him daily.\n  Michael's mother, Harriet, will turn 90 years old next month. She has \ntold the family that when she dies, she wants to be buried with \nMichael's Purple Heart.\n\n\n                           Charles Piper, Jr.\n\n  Charles Piper, Jr., was born November 21, 1937. He was from Durbin. \nHe served in the Navy on the USS Robison as a master chief boiler \ntechnician. Charles was 34 years old when he died on August 30, 1972.\n  Charles and his sister Marion worked on nearby farms after their \nfather died when they were children. Marion says that Charles was a \ngood listener and was always a good mentor to her son. When Charles was \n17 years old and had just graduated from Casselton High School, he \nenlisted in the Navy. He didn't like water, but his cousins serving in \nthe Navy inspired him to join.\n  Charles made his Navy service a career. He had about a year left in \nthe Navy before he planned to retire. His dream after retirement was to \nwork for the game and fish department and to live with his wife Marie \non their farm near Kalispell, MT.\n\n\n                             Thomas Welker\n\n  Thomas Welker was born on February 23, 1938, and made his home in \nMinot with his wife Frances. He served in the Army 101st Airborne \nDivision. His unit was called the Screaming Eagles. Thomas died on July \n27, 1967. He was 29 years old.\n  Before going to Vietnam, the Army stationed Thomas, Frances, and \ntheir sons, John, Thomas, Rodney, and Dean, in several places in the \nUnited States. Thomas' older stepson, Rodney, said that Thomas loved to \nhunt and fish. He worked two jobs to support his family, working as a \nbartender on the base in the evenings.\n  In Vietnam, Thomas was killed when someone nearby stepped on a \nBouncing Betty. The Army awarded him a Bronze Star Medal for his valor \nthat day. Thomas is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.\n\n\n                           Irvin Knippelberg\n\n  Irvin Knippelberg was born in Turtle Lake on January 17, 1939. He \nserved in the Army's 25th Infantry Division. He was 27 years old when \nhe died on May 19, 1966.\n  He was the youngest of five children. His two brothers served our \ncountry during the Korean war--Jack in the Army and Darold in the Navy.\n  Growing up on his family's farm near Turtle Lake, Irvin was the big \nlittle brother. He was 6 feet 4 inches tall, but he was the kid \nbrother. His brother Darold is Irvin's only living sibling. Darold said \nthat when the brothers played together boxing, Irvin's arms were so \nlong that he could hit his brothers four times before they could ever \nget close to him. Darold remembers Irvin as a good-natured, loveable \nguy who everyone liked. Darold says he knows that Irvin's faith helped \nhim along in life.\n  After high school, Irvin first enlisted in the Marine Corps. He later \nenlisted in the Army and spent time in Alaska and Japan before his tour \nof duty in Vietnam. He planned to make the Army his career. Irvin had \nonly been in Vietnam about 1 month when he was shot and killed.\n\n\n                          Delbert Austin Olson\n\n  Delbert Austin Olson was from Casselton, and he was born on January \n4, 1926. He served as a commander in the Navy. Delbert was 42 years old \nwhen he went missing on January 11, 1968.\n  Delbert was the youngest of four children who grew up on his family's \nfarm. His brothers also served in the military--Charles in Korea and \nHarold in World War II. Delbert's family said that he loved flying and \nwas committed to his Navy career. He was a phenomenal naval officer and \npilot.\n  Delbert was 6 feet 4 inches tall, and his son, David, is 6 feet 6 \ninches tall. Delbert's brother, Charles, told David that he looks just \nlike his dad, ``Delly.''\n  In 1968, Delbert and eight other Navy crewmen went missing when their \naircraft crashed into a mountain in Laos. In the 1990s, investigation \ncrews were finally able to search for the remains from the crash. All \nnine crewmen were identified and, in 2003, they were buried together in \nArlington National Cemetery.\n  In addition to his siblings, Delbert is survived by his daughter Dana \nand his son David.\n\n\n                              Donald Soby\n\n  Donald Soby was from Rugby. He was born on December 15, 1946. He \nserved in the Army's 101st Airborne Division. Donald died on July 7, \n1967. He was 20 years old.\n  Donald was the youngest of three children. His brother William also \nserved in Vietnam in the Air Force.\n  Their sister Margaret said that Donald always lived for today. He was \na good kid, but if he wanted to do something, he would go and do it \nthat day because he may not get another chance. She remembers Donald's \nsense of humor and good-natured pranks.\n  Donald and his best friend, Terry, shared many adventures together, \nincluding taking Margaret's young son with them to a nearby town to \nattract girls and running into the game warden, who sent them home \nafter discovering the ducks they were supposed to\n\n[[Page S4095]]\n\nbe hunting looked a lot more like pheasants.\n  Donald and his brother William both served in Vietnam at the same \ntime. The brothers inquired about Donald's leaving Vietnam since they \nwere both serving, but they were advised to wait until William's \ndischarge. They were able to spend Christmas of 1966 together. That was \nthe last time William saw Donald.\n  In May, Donald was wounded, and he died in July as a result of those \nwounds. The family is extremely grateful to Wanda Nielson of Rugby for \ncoordinating efforts for the military to fly Donald's mother to the \nPhilippines to be with Donald at the time of his death.\n\n\n                               John Joyce\n\n  John Joyce, a Minot native, was born on November 15, 1944. He served \nin the Marine Corps, Kilo Company, 3rd Battalion, 26th Marines. John \ndied on April 17, 1969. He was 24 years old.\n  John was one of four children and enjoyed playing sports in his free \ntime. In addition to playing football, basketball, and track, John left \na legacy of being an excellent baseball player. He played baseball for \nMinot State University and for Northern Arizona University. In 2001, he \nwas inducted into the Minot Baseball Hall of Fame.\n  After college John became a teacher and coach for a year in Montana. \nHe then enlisted in the Marines and served in Vietnam. One of John's \nbest friends, Jan Olson, who taught with John and also served in \nVietnam, said this about John: ``Inch for inch, pound for pound, he was \nthe toughest man I ever knew and he was also the nicest man.''\n  About 6 weeks after his death, John was awarded the Bronze Star Medal \nfor his heroic actions. His Bronze Star citation describes John putting \nhimself in the line of fire while defending his platoon with a grenade \nlauncher and then carrying a wounded companion to a covered position.\n  Ronald Jensen is a Marine who served under John in Vietnam. Ronald's \n2003 book, titled ``Tail End Charlie,'' describes John like this:\n\n       He was a great guy, no questions about it. He helped \n     everybody, always in the front, and he saved me. He was most \n     liked by his men. He saved a lot of lives over there.\n\n\n                      William ``Bill'' Kristjanson\n\n  William ``Bill'' Kristjanson was born October 13, 1943, and was from \nInkster. He served in the Army's 1st Infantry Division. His unit's \nnickname was the Black Scarves. Bill died on February 26, 1970. He was \n26 years old. He was the only child born to Sig and Frances \nKristjanson.\n  He attended elementary school in Conway and high school in Inkster. \nIn 1967, Bill graduated from the University of North Dakota. He also \nattended the University of Michigan and the University of Oslo in \nNorway. Bill's pride and interest in his father's Icelandic heritage \ninspired him to tour Iceland after graduating from UND.\n  In 1968, Bill was drafted into the Army. In Vietnam, he was involved \nin both ground and air combat. About 5 months after arriving in \nVietnam, Bill was promoted from private first class to sergeant on the \nbattlefield.\n  On February 11, Bill was injured when the vehicle he was riding in \noverturned. About 2 weeks later, he died in a military hospital in \nJapan. The ten medals the Army awarded him, both before and after his \ndeath, demonstrate that Bill was a heroic soldier the Army valued \ngreatly.\n\n\n                             Patrick McCabe\n\n  Patrick McCabe was from Bismarck, and he was born on July 20, 1924. \nHe served in the Army as a master sergeant. Patrick died May 6, 1968, \nat the age of 43.\n  He came from a family dedicated to serving our country. Four of the \nsix boys in his family served in the military, and all three of \nPatrick's sons followed in his footsteps and joined the military. Two \nof his sons served in Vietnam after Patrick's death--Mark as a medic in \nthe Marines and Scott as an Air Force pilot. Patrick's third son, \nDavid, served in the Air Force for over 20 years.\n  Patrick's daughter, Kathy, said that her dad was a good man who \nhelped anyone who needed it. Her dad loved his country and felt like \nthe Army was his family.\n  Patrick served in World War II and two tours of duty in Vietnam. He \nvolunteered to return to Vietnam and died during his second tour of \nduty.\n  We tell these stories because we cannot ever forget that every life \nmatters. I am always struck by imagining what these young men would \nhave been had they been allowed to grow up, whom these young men could \nhave been when they were grandfathers and whom they would have taken \nfishing or hunting or taught how to play football. But these lives were \ngiven in sacrifice to their country and in sacrifice so that all of us \ncan live in freedom, and we must never forget, during this period of \ncommemoration of the Vietnam war, those people who gave the ultimate \nsacrifice, those people who were killed in action in Vietnam.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in support of the National \nDefense Authorization Act. I rise in support to move this bill forward \nand the amendments that many of us in this body want to have heard, \ndebated, and voted on.\n  I also rise in opposition to obstruction--obstruction to this bill, \nobstruction to the key issues of national defense for our country. Make \nno mistake, there is obstruction going on, on the Senate floor right \nnow, with regard to this important bill.\n  A little bit of background here: This bill, the NDAA, came out of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee after a lot of hard work, bipartisan \nwork, by all the members of the committee. We worked together to \ninclude over 185 amendments. Almost all of these were bipartisan \namendments.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle talked about voting \nagainst the bill because they did not like the way it was funded, even \nthough our committee had nothing to do with the funding. But at the end \nof the day, after much debate in the committee, we worked and passed a \nstrong, important, reform-oriented bipartisan NDAA by a vote of 22 to \n4. That is bipartisan.\n  I thank the chairman of that committee Senator McCain and the ranking \nmember Senator Reed on their great leadership in getting this committee \nto work so closely together to move the bill forward.\n  As part of the Armed Services Committee, just 2 weeks ago, I had the \ndistinct honor of traveling with both of them to Vietnam and to \nSingapore for an important Defense Ministry conference. It was a huge \nhonor for me as a new Member of the body to travel with John McCain and \nJack Reed--two veterans who have sacrificed a lot for their country--to \nVietnam and other places. They did a fantastic job on this bill.\n  Then, this bill came to the floor and it all stopped. Everything came \nto a halt. There are over 500 amendments of Senators who want to move \nforward on a bipartisan basis to try to improve this bill. We have \ngotten to barely a trickle--barely a trickle--and nothing has happened. \nFor 2 weeks we have been on this bill and nothing has happened after \nthe great work we did in the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  What is going on here? It is the same obstructionist playbook that my \ncolleagues and particularly the minority leader used for the last few \nyears, and the American people have rejected it. They rejected it last \nNovember, and they rejected it when they realized this body had only 14 \nrollcall votes on amendments during the entire year of 2014. That is \nnot how this body is supposed to work. Nobody on either side of the \naisle wants this body to work that way. It is certainly not how it is \nsupposed to work when it comes to the defense of our Nation and the \ncritical bill to take care of our men and women in uniform. Yet, the \nminority leader said this bill is a waste of time. I will repeat that. \nThe National Defense Authorization Act, one of the most important \nthings we do in this body, is ``a waste of time.''\n  I understand that the parties have ideological differences, and that \nis certainly the way it should be. That is the\n\n[[Page S4096]]\n\nway it has been since the founding of our great Nation. But if leaders \non the other side of the aisle believe that protecting the country, \ntaking care of the men and women in uniform, and keeping our promises \nto them is a waste of time, then we don't belong to different parties, \nwe belong in different universes. In this world, in this universe, in \nthe U.S. Senate, our most important job is to protect this country and \nto take care of the men and women who so courageously serve our \ncountry. It is not a waste of time to be doing that. It is the most \nimportant thing we were sent here to do.\n  We took an oath. We pledged to solemnly swear to defend the \nConstitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and \ndomestic. That is what this bill does, and that is what we--Members on \nboth sides--are trying to do in terms of improving it with amendments, \nbut none of those are moving. None of those are moving, and that is a \nshame.\n  One of the things we tried to address in the bill is the serious \nthreats and challenges our Nation faces.\n  At the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing we had several weeks \nago, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said:\n\n       The United States has not faced a more diverse and complex \n     array of crises since the end of the second world war.\n\n  We know what they are--the growth and brutality of ISIS, a rising \nChina, Iran on the verge of obtaining a nuclear weapon. The largest \nstate sponsor of terrorism is possibly on the verge of gaining a \nnuclear weapon, and a resurgent Russia has invaded the sovereign \nterritory of another country. It is the first time since World War II \nin the heart of Europe.\n  So at this time we not only have obstruction on the other side of the \naisle from the leader there, the President of the United States is \nthreatening to veto the NDAA. I am not sure they are reading about what \nis going on in the world. I am not sure they recognize the critical \nimportance of this bill. And to threaten to veto this bill, and \ntherefore what--we are going to stop? No. We are going to do our duty, \nand we will put this on the President's desk, and we will see if he \nvetoes it when the United States faces this huge array of challenges.\n  Let me talk about one of those challenges for a few minutes. It is an \nimportant area. As a Senator from Alaska, it is certainly an important \narea for me. It is the Arctic and the increasing militarization of the \nArctic by Russia.\n  Earlier this year, Russia began a 5-day Arctic war exercise that \nincluded 38,000 troops, 50 surface warships, in addition to submarines, \nand 110 aircraft in the Arctic. And the Russians are not being shy \nabout their ambitions in the Arctic. President Putin has said he wants \nto build 13 new airfields and add four new Russian combat brigades in \nthe Arctic. He is going to stand up a new Arctic command, and he is \ngoing to add several new icebreakers to their already robust fleet.\n  The chairman of the Armed Services Committee talked about this. He \ntalked about what the Russians are doing in the Arctic. There is no \nmystery here. As a matter of fact, today there was an outstanding \narticle in the Wall Street Journal entitled ``The New Cold War's Arctic \nFront,'' with the subtitle ``Putin is militarizing one of the world's \ncoldest, most remote regions.'' Well, in my State, this is home. \nAmerica is an Arctic nation because of Alaska.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [The Wall Street Journal, Jun. 9, 2015]\n\n                     The New Cold War's Artic Front\n\n                           (By Sohrab Ahmari)\n\n       Helsinki.--G-7 leaders gathering in Bavaria on Monday vowed \n     to extend sanctions if Russia doesn't dial back its \n     aggression against Ukraine. Previous sanctions haven't \n     deterred Kremlin land-grabs, and the question now isn't if \n     Russian President Vladimir Putin will strike again but whom \n     he'll target next. Mr. Putin considers Europe's eastern \n     periphery, stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea, \n     part of Russia's imperial inheritance.\n       Yet in recent years the Russian leader has also turned his \n     attention northward, to the Arctic, militarizing one of the \n     world's coldest, most remote regions. Here in Finland, one of \n     eight Arctic states, the Russian menace next door looms \n     large.\n       ``That is a tough nut to crack, to know exactly what the \n     Russians want,'' newly appointed Finnish Foreign Minister \n     Timo Soini says. ``But I'm sure they know. Because they are \n     masters of chess, and if something is on the loose they will \n     take it''--a variation on the old proverb that ``a Cossack \n     will take whatever is not fixed to the ground.''\n       There is much that ``is not fixed to the ground'' already \n     in the Arctic, and more every year. Climate change is \n     transforming the High North. By 2030, the Northern Sea Route \n     (NSR) from the Kara Strait to the Pacific will have nine \n     weeks of open water, according to the U.S. Navy, up from two \n     in 2012. The NSR is a 35% to 60% shorter passage between \n     European ports and East Asia than the Suez or Panama routes, \n     according to the Arctic Council. The Northwest Passage, which \n     connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans via the Canadian \n     Arctic Archipelago, will have five weeks of open water by \n     2030, up from zero in 2012. It represents a 25% shorter \n     passage between Rotterdam and Seattle than non-Arctic routes, \n     according to a NATO Parliamentary Assembly study published in \n     March. As with other claims about the climate, these aren't \n     universally accepted prognostications.\n       These changes have implications not just for trade but also \n     for the ability to exploit the vast energy resources beneath \n     the Arctic. Energy fields in the region have to date produced \n     some 40 billion barrels of oil and 1,100 trillion cubic feet \n     of natural gas. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates the \n     region also holds 13% of the world's undiscovered \n     conventional oil, a third of the world's undiscovered \n     conventional gas and a fifth of the world's undiscovered \n     natural-gas liquids.\n       No wonder Moscow has been racing to reopen old Soviet bases \n     on its territory across the Arctic and develop new ones. Mr. \n     Putin wants by the end of 2015 to have 14 operational \n     airfields in the Arctic, according to the NATO Parliamentary \n     Assembly, and he has increased Russia's special-forces \n     presence in the region by 30%.\n       ``In the Arctic area they have twofold objectives,'' says a \n     senior official at the Finnish Defense Ministry. ``To secure \n     the Northern Sea Route and [exploit] the energy-resources \n     potential. And they are increasing their ability to surveil \n     that part of the world, to refurbish their abilities for the \n     air force and the Northern Fleet. They are exercising their \n     ability to move their airborne troops from the central part \n     of Russia to the north.''\n       The Russian buildup in the region is made worse by the fact \n     that Moscow makes no effort to be a good neighbor. The \n     Kremlin's propensity for holding unannounced exercises in the \n     region can only be a deliberate attempt to provoke. The \n     senior official voices the concern that the Kremlin might use \n     yet another such drill ``as deployment for a real \n     operation''--which is considerably less paranoid than it \n     sounds given Mr. Putin's record.\n       Russian warplanes have violated Finnish airspace as \n     recently as August, and pro-Kremlin media have also launched \n     a systematic propaganda campaign against Finland. ``They are \n     writing things about us and our defense forces that are not \n     from this world,'' says the senior official, such as the yarn \n     that the Finnish government removes children from ethnic-\n     Russian Finnish families for adoption by gay couples in the \n     U.S.\n       Another Defense Ministry official says that he finds it \n     hard to view as spontaneous ``one of their pro-Putin \n     demonstrations with crowds shouting `Thank you, Putin! You \n     gave us Crimea. Now give us Poland and Finland.' ''\n       Despite such developments, the possibility of conflict here \n     might seem distant for now. But it poses troubling questions \n     about the West's readiness in the Arctic-security race. So \n     far there has been plenty of Allied strategizing, including a \n     2013 White House paper on Arctic strategy heavy on climate-\n     change alarmism but offering little by way of real \n     mobilization. Russia still has the world's largest fleet of \n     icebreakers, many of them nuclear-powered. Washington, by \n     contrast, fields just one heavy icebreaker, the Coast Guard's \n     aging Polar Star.\n       For the Finns, the Kremlin menace raises another touchy \n     issue: their nonmembership in NATO. The April election that \n     sent Mr. Soini to the Foreign Ministry and the centrist Juha \n     Sipila into the premiership relegated Alexander Stubb, an \n     uncommonly pro-NATO Finnish prime minister, to the Finance \n     Ministry in the new government. Mr. Soini, who leads the \n     right-wing populist True Finns party, has denounced Mr. Stubb \n     in the past as a ``radical market liberal NATO hawk.'' But \n     now in government, Mr. Soini strikes more nuanced notes that \n     belie his party's anti-Atlanticist reputation.\n       ``If we think that the paradigm [in the region] is going to \n     be changed,'' he says,``there is no hesitation that we will \n     do it,'' meaning join NATO. He adds: ``Whatever the system or \n     situation in Russia we have to cope, and we have some \n     experience with them. And they also respect us. They know our \n     history. . . . We want to be independent and free.''\n\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. The writer of this article talks about what is at stake \nand about what the Russians are doing in the Arctic.\n  Here is a map. It is a little small, but it shows Russia's Arctic \npush and the dramatic increase of airbases, operational infrastructure \nall around the\n\n[[Page S4097]]\n\nArctic, and the different exercises. We know that it is an important \nplace--transportation, natural resources. This is a critical area.\n  Our leaders are taking notice, our military leaders. ADM Bill Gortney \nwith the U.S. Northern Command stated: ``Russian heavy bombers flew \nmore out-of-area patrols in 2014 than in any year since the Cold War.''\n  Secretary of Defense Carter just 2 months ago said: ``The Arctic is \ngoing to be a major area of importance to the United States, both \nstrategically and economically in the future--it's fair to say that \nwe're late to the recognition of that.''\n  This is why the NDAA is so important. Congress heard this testimony. \nThe Senate Armed Services Committee heard this testimony. We have been \nfollowing what has been happening in the Arctic, and we have acted. The \nNDAA has provisions to start to address the challenges we see in the \nArctic. It certainly is focused on making sure the Arctic remains a \npeaceful and stable place, but it also starts to focus the leadership \nof our military on the Arctic, and that is important.\n  There is language in the NDAA which was unanimously voted on in the \ncommittee--it is very bipartisan--that requires the Secretary of \nDefense to submit a report that updates the U.S. military strategy in \nthe Arctic and requires a military operations plan to be described for \nthe protection and security of our interest in the Arctic. It lays out \nwhat the issues are, what the threats are, and what the Russians are \ndoing in the Arctic.\n  President Putin is certainly going to be watching, and maybe he is \ntaking notice that we are noticing, and that is one reason why this is \nan important bill.\n  As we can see here, today's Wall Street Journal article talked about \nPresident Putin moving forward and possibly having the ability to send \nairborne troops and airborne brigades to the Arctic. Yet, right now, \nour own U.S. Army is thinking about removing the only airborne brigade \nin the Arctic. That is not good strategy.\n  That is why we need this bill. We need to set the direction in terms \nof strategy and to make sure we are not making strategic mistakes as \nthe Russians move forward in the Arctic and we start looking at \nreducing our capabilities there. Weakness is provocative, and if anyone \nknows that, it is President Putin. We need to show strength, and that \nis why we need to pass this bill.\n  Finally, I want to talk briefly about an amendment I wanted to offer. \nI am still trying to get it offered as part of the NDAA. As I \nmentioned, there is a lineup of hundreds of amendments. Unfortunately, \nthe leader on the other side of the aisle doesn't want to move them. \nThis is one of those amendments. It is a very bipartisan amendment. If \nit were allowed to come to the floor, it would probably pass \noverwhelmingly. It is a simple amendment. All it does is ask the \nPresident to follow the law when it comes to raising the pay of members \nof our military. It is a simple amendment.\n  The law States that our servicemembers are entitled to get a larger \npay increase--not much, but when there is a pay increase, they should \nget a slightly larger pay increase than their civilian counterparts. \nThat is the current law. My amendment expresses the sense of the Senate \nthat when giving a pay increase to members of the Department of \nDefense, military and civilian, that the President simply needs to \nfollow the law.\n  I want to emphasize something as somebody who has served in the \nmilitary and is still serving in the Reserves. Our civilian DOD \nemployees and members do a superb job. They are patriotic, they work \nhard, and they deeply respect the members of the military with whom \nthey serve. I have seen this throughout my entire career.\n  The current law, however, recognizes the unique sacrifices our \nservicemembers make wearing the uniform of our country and mandates a \nhalf-a-percent greater pay increase when there is a pay increase for \nour men and women in uniform. Right now, the President is not abiding \nby that law. It is simple. He needs to do it. My amendment would \nrequest and focus on this issue, and I think we could probably get 100 \nSenators to vote for it.\n  What is the origin of this law and the intent behind it? It is \nsimple. It recognizes the unique sacrifices our men and women in the \nmilitary make. These sacrifices are well known to the American people. \nThey include long hours and serious, difficult separations from family. \nOf course, they include the risk of combat when our troops are deployed \noverseas in combat zones. It includes hardship to families. When our \ntroops are deployed, they miss weddings, birthdays, first communions. \nIt even takes training into account because the members of the military \ndon't work on a 9-to-5 basis.\n  I will give one example. I had the great opportunity to head out to \nthe National Training Center in Fort Irwin, CA. It is one of the great \ntraining bases in our country--one of the great training places in the \nworld. I was there to watch the training of the 1st Stryker Brigade, \nwhich is based in Fairbanks, AK. They were out there for a month \ndeployment and training hard. They were not punching a clock 9 to 5; \nthey were training around the clock every day.\n  I happened to be out there on Super Bowl Sunday. The vast majority of \nAmericans were enjoying the Super Bowl, as they should have been. They \nwere having fun, going to parties, watching the game, drinking Coke, \nPepsi, and a little beer. But there were some Americans who were out in \nthe middle of Fort Irwin in the desert training. They were not watching \nthe Super Bowl; they were training to make sure that when their country \nnext called them up, they would be ready to protect our Nation. That is \nthe reason this law states that we treat our military members a little \nbit different than other members of the Department of Defense.\n  That is all my amendment would do, but unfortunately, this one, like \ndozens, if not hundreds, is not going to be heard--at least for the \ntime being--because the minority leader on the other side is trying to \nbring back the way they used to run the Senate last year and the year \nbefore and the year before that.\n  We know. We heard the stories. Last year, again, there were 14 \namendments that were brought to the floor for a rollcall vote in 2014. \nThey essentially shut down the greatest deliberative body in the world. \nWe have heard the stories of how the previous majority leader used his \nposition to block consideration of amendments more than twice as often \nas the previous six majority leaders combined, and now we are doing it \non a bill that relates to the national security of our Nation and the \ncritical issue of taking care of the men and women in uniform.\n  I hope we can move through this. I hope we can get to regular order. \nI hope this body can take up amendments such as mine--commonsense, \nbipartisan amendments that are going to keep our Nation safer, take \ncare of our troops and their families, and give the American people \nfaith that we are doing the job they sent us here to do. That is my \nhope.\n  We are already doing it under the new majority leader. We voted on \nalmost 200 amendments already this year, but right now we are stuck on \none of the most important bills this body will consider for the entire \nyear. It is a shame. We need to get unstuck.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CON. RES. 11\n\n  Mr. HATCH. On March 27, 2015, the Senate functioned properly by \nadopting S. Con. Res. 11 on the congressional budget for the U.S. \nGovernment for fiscal year 2016.\n  Section 3112 of that budget resolution contains a specification of \nprocedures governing cost estimates for what is defined to be ``major \nlegislation'' as defined in section 3112(c)(1).\n  I wish to provide a few comments to clarify that section of the \nbudget resolution, and I understand that my distinguished colleague \nfrom Oregon, Finance Committee Ranking Member\n\n[[Page S4098]]\n\nWyden, also wishes to provide separate and related comments.\n  In setting out what is to be taken as ``major legislation,'' the \nbudget resolution specifies that legislation may be designated to be \n``major'' if the Senator or House Member who is chairman or vice \nchairman of the Joint Committee on Taxation, or JCT, designates the \nlegislation as such ``for revenue legislation.'' Of course, such \nlanguage is entirely consistent with existing laws and practice, under \nwhich the responsibility and control over revenue estimates in the \ncongressional budget process lies squarely with the chair and vice \nchair of the JCT.\n  The budget resolution also specifies that legislation may be \ndesignated to be ``major'' if the chair of the Committee on the Budget \nin the Senate or the House designates the legislation as such ``for all \ndirect spending and revenue legislation.'' Of course, existing laws and \npractice assigns responsibility and control over spending estimates \nwith the Budget Committees. However, the budget resolution includes \n``revenue legislation'' as part of what the Budget Committee chairs may \nuse for designating legislation as being ``major.''\n  As I understand the intent of the language, when major legislation is \nto be considered, there can be cases in which the legislation may \nrequire estimates both from the JCT and from the Congressional Budget \nOffice, or CBO. In such cases, there is nothing to prohibit use of \nlongstanding practice in which the Budget Committees consult with the \nchair and vice chair of the JCT to ensure that any necessary revenue \nestimates are arrived at by the JCT, for use in scoring major \nlegislation. To be clear, however, nothing in the budget resolution \nshould be taken to mean that the chairs of the Budget Committees have \nauthority to interfere with the responsibility and control over revenue \nestimates in any part of the congressional budget process which, as I \nidentified earlier, lies squarely with the chair and vice chair of the \nJCT.\n  It is my understanding that the budget resolution does not direct or \nallow for any possibility of such interference, and my purpose in the \nremarks I am making today is to make that understanding clear. As I \nhave mentioned, longstanding practice has been that if a need arises \nfor the CBO to obtain information on major legislation from the JCT in \nterms of revenue estimates or effects of legislative proposals on \nmarginal effective tax rates, Budget Committee members can ensure that \nthose estimates and effects are obtained by consulting with the chair \nand vice chair of the JCT. This longstanding practice ensures smooth \nprocessing of the JCT's workload, and prevents any direct control or \nintervention in JCT's workload from other committees with other \njurisdictions.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I share the concern of my colleague, the \nFinance Committee chairman, and I support his interpretation of this \nprovision. In accordance with longstanding historical practice, and \nbecause of important practical considerations, the chair and vice chair \nof the Joint Committee on Taxation should exercise principal control \nover the revenue estimating process, and section 3112 should not be \ninterpreted to authorize the chairs of the Budget Committees to \ninterfere with JCT's responsibility for and control over revenue \nestimates in any part of the congressional budget process.\n  However, I must note that on the broader point of dynamic estimates, \nI am opposed, and I was therefore opposed to section 3112 being \nincluded in the budget resolution and conference agreement to start \nwith. Dynamic estimates rely on shaky math and convenient assumptions \nthat reward advocates of tax cuts while punishing advocates of long-\nterm investments in people and our Nation's infrastructure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/senate-section/article/S4098-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4098-S4099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAIR ELECTIONS NOW ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it was 8 years ago that I first introduced \nthe Fair Elections Now Act. Former Senator Arlen Specter, our late \ncolleague and former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was my lead \ncosponsor. We introduced the bill because we believed that America \nneeds a system that rewards candidates with the best ideas and \nprinciples--not just the person who is the most talented in raising \nspecial interest money.\n  I noted that day that our democracy was in trouble because special \ninterests and big-donor money were choking the system and preventing us \nfrom facing up to the big challenges of our time. Little did I know \nthat almost a decade later, this problem would have grown much worse.\n  Through a series of recent cases--including the infamous Citizens \nUnited decision--the Supreme Court has allowed wealthy, well-connected \ncampaign donors and special interests to unleash a deluge of cash in an \neffort to sway Federal, State, and local elections across our Nation. \nWhen it comes to understanding the influence of wealthy donors and \nspecial interests on Federal elections, the numbers speak for \nthemselves.\n  In the 2012 election cycle, candidates for both the House and Senate \nraised the majority of their funds from large donations of $1,000 or \nmore. Forty percent of all contributions to Senate candidates came from \ndonors who maxed out at the $2,500 contribution limit, representing \njust 0.02 percent of the American population.\n  We saw this trend continue during the recent midterm elections. The \n100 biggest donors gave a combined $323 million during the 2014 \nelection cycle through official campaign contributions and donations to \nnational party committees, PACs, Super PACs, and 527 organizations. In \ncontrast to those 100 donors, an estimated 4.75 million people gave a \ncomparable amount of $356 million through small-dollar donations of \n$200 or less. Astonishing as these figures are, they don't include the \n$173 million spent in the 2014 election cycle by tax-exempt ``dark \nmoney'' groups that are not required to publicly disclose their donors.\n  Deep-pocketed special interests are aiming to control the agenda in \nCongress. It is time to fight back and fundamentally reform the way we \nfinance congressional elections. We need a system that allows \ncandidates to focus on constituents instead of fundraising--a system \nthat encourages ordinary Americans to make their voice heard with \nsmall, affordable donations to the candidate of their choice.\n  That is why I am once again introducing the Fair Elections Now Act. \nWhile this bill cannot solve all of the problems facing our Nation's \ncampaign finance system, the Fair Elections Now Act will dramatically \nchange the way campaigns are funded. This bill allows candidates to \nfocus on the people they represent, regardless of whether those people \nhave the wealth to attend a big money fundraiser or donate thousands of \ndollars.\n  I would like to thank Sens. Baldwin, Boxer, Brown, Franken, \nGillibrand, Heinrich, Klobuchar, Leahy, Markey, McCaskill, Menendez, \nMerkley, Murphy, Sanders, Shaheen, Udall, and Warren for cosponsoring \nthe Fair Elections Now Act and joining me in this effort to reform our \ncampaign finance system.\n  The Fair Elections Now Act will help restore public confidence in \ncongressional elections by providing qualified candidates for Congress \nwith grants, matching funds, and vouchers from the Fair Elections Fund \nto replace campaign fundraising that largely relies on lobbyists, \nwealthy donors, corporations, and other special interests. In return, \nparticipating candidates would agree to limit their campaign spending \nto amounts raised from small-dollar donors plus the amounts provided \nfrom the Fair Elections Fund.\n  The Fair Elections system would have three stages for Senate \ncandidates. First, candidates would need to prove their viability by \nraising a minimum number and amount of small-dollar qualifying \ncontributions from in-state donors. Qualified candidates would then be \nrequired to limit the amount raised from each donor to $150 per \nelection.\n  In the primary, participants would receive a base grant that would \nvary in amount based on the population of the State that the candidate \nseeks to represent. Participants would also receive a 6 to 1 match for \nsmall-dollar donations up to a defined matching cap. After reaching \nthat cap, the candidate could raise an unlimited amount of $150 \ncontributions, as well as contributions from small-donor People PACs.\n  In the general election, qualified candidates would receive an \nadditional\n\n[[Page S4099]]\n\ngrant, further small-dollar matching, and vouchers for purchasing \ntelevision advertising. The candidate could continue to raise an \nunlimited amount of $150 contributions, as well as contributions from \nsmall-donor People PACs.\n  Under the Fair Elections Now Act, candidates would have an incentive \nto seek small donations. And citizens would have an incentive to donate \nto the candidate of their choice, knowing that their small donation of \n$150 would be converted to a $900 donation through the 6 to 1 Fair \nElections match.\n  Citizens would also be eligible for a modest, refundable tax credit. \nThe Fair Elections Now Act establishes the ``My Voice Tax Credit'' to \nencourage individuals to make small donations to campaigns. Citizens \ncould also make their voices heard by aggregating small contributions \nof $150 or less into a type of small-donor political action committee, \nknown as a ``People PAC.'' People PACs would then be permitted to make \ncampaign contributions to qualified Fair Elections candidates. Coupled \nwith the Fair Elections public financing system, People PACs would \nelevate the views and interests of a diverse spectrum of Americans, \nrather than those of the traditional, wealthy donor class.\n  Our country is facing major challenges. We need to continue to create \nmore jobs and restore economic security for the middle class. We need \nto build and sustain our transportation infrastructure. We need to fix \nour broken immigration system. We need to ensure that the right to vote \nis protected and preserved.\n  But with high-powered, special interest lobbyists fighting every \nproposal to make our country stronger, it is incredibly difficult for \nmembers of Congress to make progress on behalf of their constituents. \nThis bill would dramatically reduce the influence of these special \ninterests and wealthy donors, because Fair Elections candidates would \nnot need their money to run campaigns. As a result, the bill would \nenhance the voice of average Americans. Let me be clear: the \noverwhelming majority of people serving in American politics are good, \nhonest people, and I believe that most members of Congress are guided \nby the best of intentions. But we are nonetheless stuck in a terrible, \ncorrupting system.\n  A recent poll found bipartisan concerns about our current system. \nAccording to the poll, more than four out of five Americans say money \nplays too great a role in political campaigns. Two-thirds say that the \nwealthy have more of a chance to influence the electoral process than \nother Americans. The perception is that politicians are corrupted by \nbig money interests . . . and whether that is true or not, that \nperception and the loss of trust that goes with it make it very \ndifficult for Congress to solve tough issues.\n  This problem--the perception of pervasive corruption--is undermining \nour democracy, and we must address it. Everyone is entitled to a seat \nat the table, but wealthy donors and big corporations shouldn't be able \nto buy every seat.\n  The Fair Elections Now Act will reform our campaign finance system so \nthat members of Congress can focus on implementing policies in the best \ninterest of the people who elected them--not just the wealthy donors \nand special interests that bankrolled their success. I urge my \ncolleagues and the American people to support this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/senate-section/article/S4099-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNIZING THE 90TH BIRTHDAY OF LESTER CROWN\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I recognize the 90th birthday of one \nof the outstanding business leaders of our time--Chicago businessman, \nLester Crown.\n  Lester Crown was born on June 7, 1925, to Henry Crown, the son of \nJewish immigrants from Lithuania, and his wife, Rebecca Kranz. Like \nmany other Illinoisans, Lester came from a family of Lithuanian \nimmigrants with humble beginnings who moved to America to pursue a \nbetter life for their children.\n  Lester's father worked hard with his two brothers to build their \nfamily construction supplies company, the Material Service Corporation. \nAs a young man, Lester worked with his father at the Material Service's \nquarry over the summers to lend a hand. Through the hard work and \ndedication of the entire Crown family, the Material Service Corporation \nbecame one of the most successful companies in America. Several years \nlater, that family business merged with General Dynamics Corporation to \nbecome America's largest defense contractor.\n  From the start, Lester saw his father's work and learned what it took \nto be a successful businessman. He used his experience to excel and \nquickly became the president of Marblehead Lime and Royal Crown (RC) \nCola. After years of managing companies, Lester took over as chair of \nGeneral Dynamics and as the head of the family investment firm.\n  One of Lester's many talents has been his ability to recognize great \npotential. His eye for promising investments has led him to grace the \nForbes 400 list every year since 1982. With a quick glance at his \nimpressive list of investments we can easily see why--he is a major \nshareholder in Maytag, Hilton Hotels, Alltel, Aspen Skiing Company, New \nYork's Rockefeller Center, the New York Yankees, and Illinois' very own \nChicago Bulls.\n  But Lester is not just a successful businessman, he is also a \ndedicated philanthropist, husband, and father. He has channeled his \nsuccesses to provide generous contributions to a wide array of local \nand national projects. His charitable footprint can be seen in \nlandmarks such as the famous Crown Fountain in Millennium Park, the \nLyric Opera of Chicago, Stroger Hospital, and in universities across \nthe Nation.\n  Lester and his wife Renee have been happily married for more than 60 \nyears and have seven children. Renee serves as a founding member and \nformer president of the Women's Board of Northwestern University and a \nlife director of the Multiple Sclerosis Society. She also serves on the \nboard of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago, the Field Museum, the \nJoffrey Ballet, and as an honorary chair of the Shoah Visual History \nFoundation.\n  Lester and Renee are an inspiration for many in their family who have \nbecome successful investors and philanthropists. Their son Jim is \ncontinuing the legacy started by Lester's father nearly a century ago \nby now serving as the lead director of General Dynamics. Together, the \nCrown family works with roughly 600 groups a year and donates millions \nof dollars annually to support organizations that focus on education \nand community development.\n  In addition to the energy Lester has poured into his family and \nbusiness life, he has been a pillar in the Jewish-American community in \nhis support of Israel. Few can match his dedicated commitment to the \nsurvival and success of the nation of Israel.\n  While few share Lester's long list of business achievements, even \nfewer share his level of leadership and generosity. It is with great \npride that I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the 90th \nbirthday of Lester Crown and to congratulate him on his legendary \ncareer and his many contributions to the city of Chicago, the Nation, \nand the world. I offer my best wishes as he continues to provide \nvisionary leadership through his business endeavors and family \nphilanthropy for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/senate-section/article/S4099-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4099-S4100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CONFIRMATION OF ERIC MILLER TO BE VERMONT'S U.S. ATTORNEY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, the hallmark of our Nation's economy has \nlong been the ability of anyone with creativity, ambition, and a good \nwork ethic to realize their dreams and move America forward. From the \nlightbulb to the iPhone, the legacy of American invention has shone \nbrightly throughout the world. Yet while our culture of innovation and \nentrepreneurial spirit remain strong, the policy framework that \nempowers that spirit to flourish is losing its competitive edge.\n  For years, enabling our Nation's innovative drive was an economic \nsystem unparalleled around the world--from competitive tax laws to \npublic investments in research, infrastructure, and education. We have \nlong understood something that many other countries haven't: for \ninnovation and the entrepreneurial spirit to thrive, we need a strong, \ncompetitive economic ecosystem. There simply is no single silver bullet \nfor economic growth.\n  While other nations catch up, our system is deteriorating in a number \nof ways. Federal investments in basic research and development are not \nkeeping up with inflation and our tax code remains riddled with \ncomplexity, unable to spur growth and provide the certainty our \nbusinesses need. We also have to address the tough questions about how \nto fund our infrastructure, transportation, and education systems. In \nour dynamic market economy, the natural churn of businesses opening and \nclosing keeps our Nation competitive, as long as we are creating more \nbusinesses than we are closing, of course. According to the Census \nBureau, however, U.S. businesses are now failing faster than they are \nbeing created for the first time in 35 years--since the data began \nbeing recorded. Meanwhile, the 2014 Global Innovation Index saw the \nU.S. innovation ecosystem fall to 6th, while ranking 39th in ease of \nstarting a business. These declines are coupled to a global R \nforecast that projects leading competitors--like China--will surpass \nthe U.S. in total R investment by 2022.\n  Yet even with these challenges, we do retain a competitive edge. \nAmericans' entrepreneurial drive still spurs our economy; manufacturing \noutput continues to increase; our colleges and universities remain the \nenvy of the world; innovations in the American energy industry have \nreduced our trade deficit and improved our energy security; and private \nsector R has rebounded after several years of stagnation.\n  We now find ourselves at a competitive inflection point. We can \neither do more to nurture and take advantage of our strengths--only \nsome of which we have mentioned--or we can fall behind in the 21st \ncentury. In order to support our competitive strengths, Senator Jerry \nMoran and I are launching the bipartisan Senate Competitiveness Caucus, \na forum to bring together Democrats and Republicans to address the most \npressing issues facing our economy.\n  Rather than focus on just one issue or one bill, we have built the \ncaucus with the understanding that it will take a whole range of \npolicies working in concert to sustain our innovation ecosystem.\n  We will pursue ways to invest in our roads, bridges, ports, and \nhighways so they meet the needs of a 21st century economy. We will work \nto make our tax code more competitive so the United States will remain \nthe best country in which to do business and raise a family. We will \nseek to streamline regulations to protect consumers and make it easier \nto start and grow a business. We will look at our Federal budget and \nfocus Federal resources on pro-growth policies that will create an \nenvironment for job creation now and into the future. We will work \ntogether to boost manufacturing because no country can support a strong \nmiddle class without a thriving manufacturing sector. That is just a \nstart.\n  If the last century has taught us anything, it is that other \ncountries will not slow down when it comes to chasing America's \neconomic success. That means that even though the United States remains \na world leader in innovation and competitiveness, it will only become \nmore difficult to retain that position as the years go by. Members of \nthe Competitiveness Caucus understand that we are now competing with \nevery country, every government, every worker, and every business on \nthe planet. Congress must come together to turn our economic challenges \ninto opportunities for growth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/senate-section/article/S4100-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4100-S4101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE: A PATH TOWARDS IMPROVING THE QUALITY AND \n                   VALUE OF HEALTH CARE FOR PATIENTS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a copy of my remarks at the Senate Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee hearing earlier this week.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Health Information Exchange: A Path Towards Improving the Quality and \n                   Value of Health Care for Patients\n\n       We're here today to outline our plans to conduct an \n     intensive review of electronic health records.\n       There is a great deal of bipartisan interest in this on the \n     committee. My staff and Sen. Murray's staff have been meeting \n     with experts every day, the staff of each of our committee \n     members have been meeting once a week, and Sen Murray and \n     myself have been speaking with the administration regularly \n     as well.\n       The administration understands our level of interest and is \n     working with us to improve these records.\n       Here's what we're talking about:\n       The Meaningful Use Program began in 2009 to encourage the \n     491,000 physicians who serve Medicaid and Medicare patients \n     and almost 4,500 hospitals who serve those patients to begin \n     to adopt and use electronic health records systems.\n       Of those 491,000 physicians, 456,000 have received some \n     sort of Medicare or Medicaid incentive payment from the \n     Meaningful Use Program. All hospitals and most physicians \n     that tried were able to meet the first stage requirements. \n     For those who met the requirements, the government paid \n     incentive payments in the form of higher Medicare \n     reimbursements. It has so far paid out $30 billion in \n     incentive payments.\n       But the program's stage 2 requirements are so complex that \n     only about 11 percent of eligible physicians have been able \n     to comply so far, and just about 42 percent of eligible \n     hospitals have been able to comply.\n       The next step in the program is penalties for doctors and \n     hospitals that don't comply. This year, 257,000 physicians \n     have already begun losing 1 percent of their Medicare \n     reimbursements and 200 hospitals may be losing even more than \n     that.\n       Our goal is to identify the 5 or 6 steps we can take to \n     improve electronic health records--a technology that has \n     great promise, but has, through bad policy and bad \n     incentives, run off track.\n       To put it bluntly, physicians and doctors have said to me \n     that they are literally ``terrified'' on the next \n     implementation stage of electronic health records, called \n     Meaningful Use Stage 3, because of its complexity and because \n     of the fines that will be levied.\n       My goal is that before that phase is implemented, we can \n     work with physicians and hospitals and the administration to \n     get the system back on track and make it a tool that \n     hospitals and physicians can look forward to using to help \n     their patients instead of something they dread.\n       Today will mark the start of a series of hearings we will \n     hold this summer to address various possible solutions.\n       Senator Murray and I are today announcing the next two \n     hearings in the series, which will be chaired by different \n     members of our committee to examine solutions to the problems \n     we identify.\n       The first hearing is on the burden physicians face with \n     these systems, and I have asked Senator Cassidy, who is a \n     physician himself, to chair that hearing.\n       The second hearing is on the question of whether you and I \n     control information about our health, and I have asked \n     Senator Collins to chair that hearing.\n       On March 17, we held our first hearing to identify the \n     problems with electronic health records, and the government's \n     Meaningful Use Program.\n       At today's hearing, we will set the table for this series \n     of hearings by discussing how we can solve those problems and \n     improve electronic health records.\n       I was in Nashville at Vanderbilt University two weeks ago \n     for a public workshop of the National Institutes of Health \n     Precision Medicine Working Group, which is working out the \n     details of the president's precision medicine initiative. \n     That will involve creating a collection of 1 million \n     sequenced genomes\n\n[[Page S4101]]\n\n     that researchers and scientists and doctors nationwide can \n     consult in treating patients and curing diseases.\n       It's cutting edge medicine that has the potential to change \n     the way we treat everything from diabetes to cancer.\n       But it will only work the way it's supposed to if \n     electronic health records systems work the way they are \n     supposed to.\n       Number one, electronic health records can help to assemble \n     and understand the genomes of the one million individuals. \n     And, second, if we want to make genetic information useful, \n     being able to exchange information will help doctors when \n     they write a prescription for you.\n       So that's just one important medical breakthrough \n     initiative that will rely on a big improvement to electronic \n     health records.\n       This committee is interested not least because the \n     government has invested $30 billion to encourage doctors and \n     hospitals to install these expensive systems.\n       The program has increased adoption. According to the \n     Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), since 2009, \n     the percentage of physicians with a basic electronic health \n     record system has grown from 22 percent to 48 percent. And \n     the percentage of hospitals with a basic records system has \n     grown from 12 percent to 59 percent. But the program hasn't \n     done enough to make the systems easy to use or \n     interoperable--meaning able to communicate with one another--\n     or really achieved much beyond adoption.\n       According to a Medical Economics survey nearly 70 percent \n     of physicians say their electronic health record systems have \n     not been worth it. They are spending more time taking notes \n     than taking care of patients, and they are spending a lot of \n     their own money on systems that have to comply with \n     government requirements, not satisfying their own needs to \n     serve patients with the latest in cutting edge medicine that \n     could be accessed with the kind of technology Health IT is \n     supposed to promise.\n       Or as the conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer, a \n     doctor himself, wrote recently: ``The EHR technology, being \n     in its infancy, is hopelessly inefficient. Hospital \n     physicians will tell you endless tales about the wastefulness \n     of the data collection and how the lack of interoperability \n     defeats the very purpose of data sharing.''\n       Today we have invited experts representing various \n     perspectives:\n       Medical informatics, the profession focused on what \n     information to use and how to use it to improve care; a \n     records system vendor, one of the companies tasked with \n     building the records systems; a health system chief \n     information officer, the expert in charge of implementing \n     Health IT for a hospital's many different types of care \n     providers across many different types of care settings; and \n     the perspective of the patient so that we can hear \n     recommendations on how improvements in Health IT can improve \n     the patient experience and patient involvement in their own \n     care.\n       I am especially interested to hear from our witnesses their \n     recommendations to improve the exchange of health \n     information, which has been a glaring failure of the current \n     state of electronic health records.\n       Patients will receive better care if we can improve the \n     exchange of information so that a patient's health record can \n     be accessed by physicians and pharmacists in an efficient and \n     reliable way, the term industry experts use for this exchange \n     of information is interoperability.\n       We're fortunate that a report was published May 28, 2015, \n     by the American Medical Informatics Association offering \n     immediate strategies to the challenges in electronic health \n     records that I've been detailing. The report was written by a \n     task force of experts from all aspects of Health IT: \n     physicians, researchers, vendors, patient advocates, and \n     others.\n       We know that improvements need to be made to these \n     programs, and they need to be done quickly. One of the things \n     I like about this report is that the recommendations are \n     targeted for the next 6 to 12 months and could make \n     improvements quickly.\n       The report makes recommendations in these five areas:\n       Simplify and speed documentation--that means using \n     technology to help doctors spend less time taking notes and \n     more time taking care of patients.\n       Refocus regulation--that means the government requirements \n     should be clear, simple, and streamlined towards better \n     patient care.\n       Increase transparency and streamline certification, such as \n     using detailed tests for records systems to receive \n     certification, so purchasers can easily judge performance and \n     compare products.\n       Foster innovation--The brilliant minds working in \n     Information Technology should be allowed to innovate new \n     ideas, not just react to satisfying government ideas for \n     Health IT. Standards are important, but they should support \n     and enable innovations--not stifle them.\n       And ``support person-centered care delivery''--Today, with \n     a click of a mouse or a swipe on a smart phone, one can see \n     the prices for airplane tickets from competing airlines or, \n     mortgage rates from hundreds of banks. But, in health care, \n     Information Technology has not made much difference to the \n     patient experience. Patients still fill out paper forms with \n     clipboards at every doctor appointment, call multiple offices \n     to make appointments, and piece together their health \n     information one doctor office and one hospital visit at a \n     time. Electronic health records could change that experience \n     for all of us so that when an individual visits a doctor, his \n     care team can access his information no matter where the \n     patient has been or which doctors he's seen in the past and \n     deliver more accurate and higher quality care for the \n     patient.\n       I look forward to hearing our witnesses' recommendations, \n     their thoughts on this report, and also advice on how we can \n     make improvements as quickly as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/senate-section/article/S4101-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      COMMEMORATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF KIWANIS INTERNATIONAL\n\n Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Kiwanis \nInternational for its 100th anniversary celebration. Since its \nformation in 1915, Kiwanis has become a global service organization, \nsupporting communities both in its Indianapolis headquarters and \nbeyond.\n  Last year, I had the pleasure of meeting Stan Soderstrom, who serves \nas the executive director of Kiwanis International and oversees the \norganization's branches and clubs in 80 nations, from the Kiwanis Club \nof Pike Township in Indianapolis. With a hands-on approach and great \nleadership from folks like Stan, as well as previous leaders such as \nState Representative Christina Hale, Kiwanis clubs provide a place for \nfellowship, as well as personal and community growth. Kiwanis and its \naffiliates boast more than 600,000 members who raise more than $100 \nmillion and contribute more than 18 million volunteer hours each year. \nTheir impact is tremendous and felt globally.\n  In the State of Indiana, there are more than 190 Kiwanis clubs and \nmore than 6,000 adult members participating in a wide variety of \ncharitable efforts. Kiwanis has served the Indianapolis area by \nproviding everything from playground projects to scholarship programs. \nHoosier Kiwanis clubs have raised more than $234,000 to benefit the \nChild Life program at Riley Hospital for Children and contributed more \nthan $1.1 million toward the Eliminate Project, which works with \ndeveloping countries to help immunize millions of women in the fight \nagainst maternal and neonatal tetanus. These Hoosiers serve as an \nexample of the hard work and service that make Indiana a great place to \nlive. Each year, Kiwanis clubs in Indiana serve nearly 300,000 children \nand youths, raise more than $1.1 million, and donate more than 50,000 \nvolunteer hours of invaluable service. I commend the Indiana district \nKiwanis leaders for these great accomplishments in doing good for \nIndiana communities and the world.\n  On behalf of the citizens of Indiana, I congratulate and thank each \nand every member of Kiwanis International for helping Kiwanis evolve \ninto the thriving and impactful organization that it is today. For a \ncentury, Kiwanians have faithfully served their local communities and \ncommunities around the world. I wish them continued growth and success \nfor many more years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/senate-section/article/S4101-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4101-S4102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    CONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA, LAS VEGAS ROBOTICS TEAM\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today, I wish to congratulate the \nUniversity of Nevada, Las Vegas, UNLV, robotics team on being selected \nas one of the top ten in the world by competing in the 2015 U.S. \nDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency Robotics Challenge. The \ncompetition included a dozen teams from the United States, including \nthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration, and Lockheed Martin. Eleven teams from Japan, \nGermany, Italy, South Korea, and Hong Kong also participated.\n  The competition was initially created in response to the humanitarian \nneed after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactor incident in 2011. The \ngoal of the program remains to accelerate the development of advanced \nrobots capable of entering areas too dangerous for humans and acting as \nfirst responders in the disaster zone. The robots chosen as finalists, \nincluding UNLV's Metal Rebel, competed in eight tasks related to \ndisaster response, including climbing stairs, turning valves, tripping \ncircuit breakers, walking among\n\n[[Page S4102]]\n\nrubble, and driving alone. Metal Rebel took eighth place out of 23 \nteams, bringing in a score of 6 out of 8 and a time of 57:41. This team \nof students and faculty stands as a tribute to what dedication and hard \nwork can achieve. I am proud to call them fellow Nevadans.\n  The team of 15 UNLV engineering students was led by Paul Oh, Lincy \nprofessor of unmanned aerial systems and expert in robotics and \nautonomous systems for UNLV's Howard R. Hughes College of Engineering. \nMr. Oh joined the competition to help UNLV and Nevada become a national \nleader in the autonomous systems industry. He was also the former \nprogram director for the National Science Foundation robotics. His work \nfor this university and our State is greatly appreciated.\n  I am excited to see local students and faculty bringing recognition \nto both Nevada and to UNLV for their advancement in a global \ncompetition. These students should be proud to call themselves top \ncontenders in this international competition.

Mr. President, today, I wish to recognize five of \nNevada's brightest students--Becky Bosshart, Michael Pfurr, Rohan \nDharan, Michael Moncrieff, and Ryan Larsen--on being selected as 2015 \nrecipients of the Fulbright scholarship.\n  The Fulbright Scholar Program was developed shortly after World War \nII by former U.S. Senator James William Fulbright due to language \nbarriers experienced by Americans and their allies during the war. \nStudents selected for the program study and teach English abroad, \nbuilding upon their language skills, as well as growing international \ngood will. The scholarship is highly competitive, with thousands \napplying from colleges and universities across the country. I am proud \nto congratulate these five students on their achievement, as well as \nthe University of Nevada, Las Vegas, UNLV, on receiving its largest \namount of Fulbright scholarship selections in a single year in Rebel \nhistory. The students are shining examples of how hard work leads to \nsuccess, and stand as role models for future Rebels.\n  The five students will teach English and expand upon their language \nskills in countries from Eastern Europe to Asia. Ms. Bosshart served in \nthe Peace Corps in Chernvisti, Ukraine, and worked diligently to return \nto Eastern Europe. She will spend her time in Romania. Mr. Larsen spent \nthe last 6 years mentoring Fulbright scholarship applicants and will \nspend time in Japan. Mr. Moncrieff will complete his Ph.D. while \nstudying in Kistanje, Croatia. Mr. Dharan, a member of Teach for \nAmerica, will expand upon his teaching experience in New Dehli, India. \nFinally, Mr. Pfurr will build upon his experience in Austria.

Mr. President, I congratulate my good friend \nWoody Overton on his retirement after 14 years as director of \ngovernmental affairs and community relations at JE Dunn Construction \nand his many years of leadership and service to Kansas City. Woody \ndemonstrated exceptional professionalism, and I am pleased to recognize \nhis outstanding career today.\n  Woody, a native of Trenton, MO, received his bachelor's degree in \npolitical science from the University of Missouri--Kansas City. He is a \nU.S. Army veteran and is deeply involved with nonprofit and civic \norganizations in the Kansas City area.\n  Woody served as assistant to former U.S. Senator Thomas Eagleton in \ncharge of major projects and constituent services from 1977 to 1986. He \nlearned from the best and embodied the lessons he learned from Senator \nEagleton throughout his life and career. Each time you talk to Woody he \nwill share a lesson he learned through an anecdote. That time in his \nlife was the defining moment of his career, and his love of public \nservice and community involvement came directly from his respect and \nadmiration for his boss and friend, Senator Tom Eagleton.\n  In 1992, Woody ran the Clinton Presidential campaign in Missouri, \nhelping President Clinton secure a must-win State by ten points. In \n1993, Woody was appointed as the Regional Administrator of the General \nServices Administration's, GSA, Heartland Region which includes \nMissouri, Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas. Woody served as its chief \nexecutive officer and regional liaison to other Federal agencies, State \nand local Governments. Woody's leadership and accomplishments in \nproviding better customer service to Federal agencies earned him the \nGSA Administrator's ``Exceptional Service Award'' in May 2001.\n  Woody's ability to work with Democrats and Republicans to help Kansas \nCity remain a Federal regional center during his tenure as head of \nKansas City's GSA should be commended. He oversaw construction of \nseveral important Kansas City buildings including the Federal \ncourthouse, the Illus W. Davis Civic Mall, the FBI office, and the \nAgriculture Department complex and in Kansas City, Kansas another \ncourthouse and the Environmental Protection Agency headquarters.\n  Woody is looking forward to spending more time with his family, and \nespecially his grandchildren. I know they will enjoy the opportunity to \nspend more time with him.\n  It is my pleasure to honor Woody Overton today. He has touched the \nlives of many and immensely improved the Kansas City community.\n  I ask that the Senate join me in congratulating and honoring Glen W. \n``Woody'' Overton.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/senate-section/article/S4102-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING MAINSTREET SELF STORAGE\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, small businesses are able to \nrecognize what their neighbors and communities need, and what is even \nmore impressive is that they are able to meet those needs quickly and \nefficiently. This is especially important when a natural disaster \nstrikes. That is why this week's Small Business of the Week is \nMainstreet Self Storage of Shreveport, LA.\n  Northwest Louisiana is currently struggling with major flooding, \nwhich has driven families out of their homes and shut down small \nbusinesses. In response, Mainstreet Self Storage is doing its part to \nhelp those affected by offering free storage space for the next 3 \nmonths. Through this program, Mainstreet aims to provide folks a safe, \nsecure space to store their belongings--truly a fine example of \nLouisiana's ingenuity and generosity.\n  In May of 2009, the Delaney family opened a facility offering storage \nand moving solutions for Shreveport-Bossier city residents. Mainstreet \nSelf Storage's complex is comprised of climate-controlled units, \nnonclimate controlled-units, car garages, cover RV storage, and open or \nclosed storage for boats and vehicles. Mainstreet's top-of-the-line \nsecurity system and humidity-controlled units give clients a peace of \nmind in the stowing of their belongings. Shortly after opening, \nMainstreet partnered with the U-Haul company in order to offer moving \nand transportation equipment to their customers. In the years since, \nMainstreet Self Storage has become a Top 100 U-Haul Dealer and was \nrecently named the eighth in the Nation for customer service.\n  Congratulations to MainStreet Storage for being selected as the Small \nBusiness of the Week. We appreciate and recognize your generosity and \ncommitment to aiding your neighbors in Northwest Louisiana during these \ntimes of need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/senate-section/article/S4102-4", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4102-S4103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n[[Page S4103]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/senate-section/article/S4103-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The message received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/senate-section/article/S4103-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:31 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2393.

A bill to amend section 455(m) of the Higher Education Act \nof 1965 in order to allow adjunct faculty members to qualify for public \nservice loan forgiveness; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I introduced the Adjunct Faculty \nLoan Fairness Act, a bill that would enable faculty working less than \nfull-time to participate in the Public Service Student Loan Forgiveness \nProgram.\n  Contingent faculty members are like full-time instructors. They have \nadvanced degrees. They teach classes and\n\n[[Page S4107]]\n\nspend many hours outside the classroom preparing for class. They hold \noffice hours, grade papers and give feedback to students. They provide \nadvice and write letters of recommendation. Students rely on them. \nSince most adjuncts have advanced degrees and, as almost 75 percent of \ngraduate degree recipients have an average of $61,000 in student loans, \nthey are also among the 40 million Americans with student debt.\n  The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is meant to encourage \ngraduates to go into public service by offering student loan \nforgiveness for eligible federal loans after 10 years of full-time work \nin government or the nonprofit sector. Public service fields like \nnursing, military service, and public health qualify. Many education \njobs qualify, including full-time work at public universities and part-\ntime work at community colleges in high-needs subject areas or areas of \nshortage. But other faculty members, those who work part-time, are not \neligible for loan forgiveness because the law requires an annual \naverage of 30 hours per week to qualify for the program. For adjunct \nfaculty working at several schools on a contingent basis, this \nrequirement can be difficult or impossible to meet, even when they are \nputting in more than 30 hours of work each week.\n  The number of faculty hours given for each class is calculated \ndifferently at different schools. Some give one hour per hour in the \nclassroom while others actually take into consideration the time \nrequired outside the classroom. So, even as these faculty members are \nworking hard and as their options for tenured, full-time positions \nbecome slimmer, more of them are overworked and undervalued for their \nwork in public service.\n  The Adjunct Faculty Loan Fairness Act of 2015 would solve this by \namending the Higher Education Act to expand the definition of a \n``public service job'' to include a part-time faculty member who \nteaches at least one course at an eligible institution of higher \neducation. They would still have to meet all the other requirements to \nqualify for the program, including making 120 on-time payments while \nemployed at a qualifying institution, and they could not be employed \nfull-time elsewhere at the same time.\n  This bill would benefit someone like Alyson, an adjunct professor \nfrom Chicago, IL, who graduated with $65,000 in student loan debt and, \nafter 10 years of on-time payments, has over $56,000 left. Like most \nadjuncts, Alyson strings together multiple teaching assignments along \nwith part-time work to afford her monthly living expenses and minimum \nstudent loan payment. She comes from a family of educators and \nconsiders teaching her dream job. Alyson would like to participate in \nthe Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. This bill would ensure \nthat Alyson and many thousands like her, could obtain credit towards \nthe Public Service Loan Program for loan payments she made while \nteaching, whether she was teaching one course or seven.\n  Unfortunately, for all their contributions to the college programs \nand the students they work with, adjunct faculty don't have the same \nemployment benefits or job security as their colleagues. The number of \nclasses they teach every semester varies. To make ends meet, these \nprofessors often end up teaching classes at more than one school in the \nsame semester, getting paid about $3,000 per class and making an \naverage annual income that hovers around minimum wage. This also means \nthat, in some parts of the country, they spend as much time commuting \nas they do teaching.\n  Nationally, over half of all higher education faculty work on a \ncontingent basis, facing low pay with little or no benefits or job \nsecurity. In the past, these were a minority of professors who were \nhired to teach an occasional class because they could bring experience \nto the classroom in a specific field or industry. Over time, as \nuniversity budgets have tightened and it has gotten more expensive to \nhire full-time, tenure track professors, higher education institutions \nhave increasingly hired adjuncts.\n  From 1991 to 2011, the number of part-time faculty in the U.S. \nincreased two and a half times from 291,000 to over 760,000. At the \nsame time, the percentage of professors holding tenure-track positions \nhas been steadily decreasing--from 45 percent of all instructors in \n1975 to only 24 percent in 2011. The number of full-time instructors, \ntenured and non-tenured, now makes up only about 50 percent of \nprofessors on U.S. campuses. The other 50 percent of the 1.5 million \nfaculty employees at public and non-profit colleges and universities in \nthe U.S. work on a part-time, contingent basis.\n  Illinois colleges rely heavily on adjuncts. In 2012, 53 percent of \nall faculty at public and not-for-profit colleges and universities in \nthe State, more than 30,400 faculty employees, worked on a part-time \nbasis. This is a 52.6 percent increase in part-time faculty in Illinois \ncompared to a 13 percent increase in full-time faculty since 2002.\n  Not surprisingly, in Illinois, 69 percent of all part-time faculty \nwork in Chicago, where the cost of living is 16 percent higher than the \nU.S. average. Based on an average payment of $3,000 per class an \nadjunct professor must teach between 17 and 30 classes a year to pay \nfor rent and utilities in Chicago.\n  They would have to teach up to seven classes to afford groceries for \na family of four and two to four classes per year just to cover student \nloan payments. Because they are part-time, they are not eligible for \nvacation time, paid sick days, or group health-care. So they would have \nto teach an additional two to three classes to afford family coverage \nfrom the lowest priced health insurance offered on Get Covered \nIllinois, the official health marketplace.\n  Even though these professors are working in a relatively low-paying \nfield, teaching our students, their part-time status also means they \naren't eligible for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program\n  This bill does not completely fix this growing reliance on part-time \nprofessors who are underpaid and undervalued. But it would ensure that \nmembers of the contingent faculty workforce are no longer excluded from \nthe loan forgiveness program for public servants. I would like to thank \nmy colleague, Senator Al Franken from Minnesota for joining me in this \neffort. I hope my other colleagues will also join me to provide this \nbenefit to faculty members who provide our students with a quality \neducation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1556\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require that employers provide not less than 10 \ndays of paid vacation time to eligible employees, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about family \nvalues. ``Family values'' is an expression that has been used for many \nyears by my Republican colleagues. Generally speaking, what they mean \nby ``family values'' is opposition to a woman's right to choose, \nopposition to contraception, opposition to gay rights. I happen to \nstrongly disagree with many of my Republican colleagues on those \nissues. Let me take the opportunity to briefly give a somewhat \ndifferent perspective on family values--on real family values, on the \nvalues that really matter to millions of families in this country.\n  When a mother gives birth to a baby and is unable to spend time with \nthat newborn child during the first weeks and months of that baby's \nlife because she does not have the money to stay home and is forced to \ngo back to work, which is the case for millions of mothers in this \ncountry, that is not a family value. Separating a mother from a newborn \nbaby for economic reasons is not a family value. In fact, that is an \nattack on everything that a family is supposed to stand for.\n  When a wife is diagnosed with cancer and her husband cannot get time \noff of work to take care of her because he does not have any family or \nmedical leave time or sick leave time, that is not a family value. That \nis an attack on everything that a family is supposed to stand for.\n  When a husband, wife, and kids, during the course of an entire year, \nare unable to spend any time on a vacation, when they cannot get \ntogether in leisure activity, when they cannot relax and spend quality \ntime with each other, that is not a family value.\n  Let us be very clear in understanding that, in fact, in terms of \nprotecting the needs of our families, in terms of real family values, \nin many, many respects the United States of America lags behind \nvirtually every other major country on earth.\n  When you look at other major countries, what you find is that the \nUnited States is the only advanced economy that does not guarantee its \nworkers some form of paid family leave, some form of paid sick time, \nsome form of paid vacation time. In other words, when it comes to basic \nworkplace protections and family benefits, workers in every other major \nindustrialized country in the world get a better deal than our workers \nhere in the United States. That is wrong. That is a travesty, and that \nhas got to change.\n  Last place is no place for America. It is time for us to join the \nrest of the industrialized world by showing the people of this country \nthat we are not just a nation that talks about family values but that \nwe are a nation that is prepared to live up to these ideals by making \nsure that workers in this country have access to paid family leave, \npaid sick time, and paid vacations, just like workers in virtually \nevery other major country on earth.\n  Simply stated, it is unacceptable that millions of women in this \ncountry give birth and are forced back to work because they do not have \nthe income to stay home with their newborn babies.\n  When we talk about family values, what is more important than for \nmothers and fathers to bond with their babies at a time when almost \nevery psychologist will tell you those are the most important weeks and \nmonths of a human being's life? What kind of family value is it when \nyou tell a woman who has just had a baby that she cannot spend time \nwith her child because she has to go back to work? This is not a family \nvalue. That is an insult to every mother, every father, and every \nnewborn child in this country, and we have to change that.\n  The reality is that the Family and Medical Leave Act that was signed \ninto law in 1993 is totally inadequate. Today, nearly 8 out of 10 \nworkers in this country who are eligible to take time off under this \nlaw cannot do so because they cannot afford to do so, according to the \nDepartment of Labor. Even worse, 40 percent of American workers are not \neven eligible to receive this unpaid leave because they work for a \ncompany with fewer than 50 employees.\n  In my view, every worker in this country should be guaranteed at \nleast 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, and that is why I am a \nproud cosponsor of the FAMILY Act, introduced by Kirsten Gillibrand. \nThe FAMILY Act would guarantee employees 12 weeks of paid family and \nmedical leave to take care of a baby, to help a family member who is \ndiagnosed with cancer or has some other serious medical condition or to \ntake care of themselves if they become seriously ill. Just like Social \nSecurity retirement and disability, it is an insurance program that \nworkers would pay into at a price of about one cup of coffee a week.\n  That is not all. We have to make certain that in this country workers \nhave paid sick time. It is absurd that low-wage workers in McDonald's \nand Burger King and low-wage employees all over this country who get \nsick are forced to work because they cannot afford to take time off. \nNot only is this unfair to the workers, it is also a public health \nissue. I do not know about you, but I am not crazy about the idea of \nsomebody who is sick coming to work and preparing the food that I eat \nin a restaurant.\n  That is why I am supporting the Healthy Families Act, introduced by \nSenator Patty Murray, which guarantees 7 days of paid sick leave to \nAmerican workers. This bill would benefit 43 million Americans who \ntoday do not have access to paid sick leave, and it would create a \npermanent floor in workplaces where employers already provide some paid \nsick leave.\n  Last but not least, when we talk about the disappearing American \nmiddle class, we are talking about millions of American workers working \nlonger hours for lower wages. We are talking about Americans who are \noverworked, underpaid and, in many cases, living under enormous stress. \nIn my State of Vermont, I see it every week I am home. You talk to \npeople who work not one job but who are working two jobs or sometimes \nthree jobs in order to cobble together some income and some health \ncare.\n  Here is an amazing irony. Many of us can remember in school reading \nabout workers protesting, taking to the\n\n[[Page S4109]]\n\nstreets 100 years ago, and they held up large banners. Do you know what \nthose banners said 100 years ago? They said: We want a 40-hour \nworkweek. A 40-hour workweek was the demand 100 years ago. Today, we \nstill have not achieved that goal.\n  In fact, today 85 percent of men who are working and 66 percent of \nworking women are working more than 40 hours a week. In fact, in \nAmerica today--not widely known but true--our people are working the \nlongest hours of any major country on Earth, because as real wages go \ndown, people have to work 50 hours or they have to work 60 hours. \nHusbands are working here, and wives are working there--all to cobble \ntogether some income in order to provide for the family.\n  Today Americans are working 137 hours a year more than workers in \nJapan--and the Japanese are very hard workers. We are working 260 hours \nmore than the British and almost 500 hours a year more than French \nworkers.\n  That is why I am introducing legislation today to require employers \nto provide at least 10 days of paid vacation to workers in this \ncountry. This is already done in almost every other major country on \nEarth. It is one more way to demonstrate our commitment to real family \nvalues. What we are saying is that if families are overworked and if \nhusbands and wives do not even have the time to spend together with \ntheir kids, what family values are about is that at least for 2 weeks a \nyear, people can come together under a relaxed environment and enjoy \nthe family. That is a family value that I want to see happen in this \ncountry.\n  The time is long overdue for us to start talking about real family \nvalues, not about abortion, not about gay rights but the values the \nAmerican people want to see inscribed in law to protect their families. \nLet us make sure every American worker is entitled to paid family and \nmedical leave, paid sick time, and guaranteed at least some vacation \ntime. Those are real family values. Let's go forward and make that \nhappen.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Warner, \n        Mr. Merkley, Ms. Warren, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Franken, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mr. Kaine, and Ms. Hirono):\n  S. 1565. A bill to allow the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection \nto provide greater protection to servicemembers; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today, along with Senators Schumer, \nMenendez, Warner, Merkley, Warren, Blumenthal, Franken, Durbin, Kaine, \nand Hirono, I am introducing the Military Consumer Protection Act, \nwhich reinforces our commitment to consumer protections for \nservicemembers.\n  Our country has a strong tradition of ensuring that our \nservicemembers are protected while they sacrifice to keep our Nation \nsafe. Building on such efforts, Congress passed the Soldiers' and \nSailor's Civil Relief Act as World War II escalated to provide crucial \nfinancial protections for servicemembers to ``enable such persons to \ndevote their entire energy to the defense needs of the Nation.'' Now \ncalled the Servicemember Civil Relief Act, SCRA, this law includes such \nprotections as prohibiting the eviction of servicemembers and their \ndependents from rental or mortgaged properties and capping the interest \nat 6 percent on debts incurred prior to an individual entering active \nduty military service.\n  Despite the SCRA's importance, enforcement of this critical law has \nbeen found to be inconsistent and subject to the discretion of our \nfinancial regulators. Indeed, misinformation, lapses, and mistakes that \nthe SCRA was intended to fix continue to persist. Moreover, according \nto a July 2012 report from the Government Accountability Office, ``in \n2010, examinations for SCRA compliance occurred in an estimated 26 \npercent of all [financial] institutions, compared with 2007 when about \n4 percent of all institutions were reviewed for SCRA.''\n  Without a change in the law, SCRA enforcement will continue to be \nsubject to the changing priorities of the financial regulators. Simply \nput, prioritizing the consumer protection of our servicemembers should \nnot be discretionary. It should be mandatory, and my legislation \nensures that SCRA enforcement will be a permanent priority for the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau, CFPB, which Congress created to \nenforce Federal consumer financial protection laws.\n  In 2010, as we were debating the creation of the CFPB, I led the \nbipartisan effort to ensure it would contain a key role in protecting \nservicemembers through the establishment of an Office of Servicemember \nAffairs. Since that time, the CFPB has coordinated with other \nenforcement agencies and regulators to help servicemembers recover \nmillions in relief from unscrupulous actors in the financial \nmarketplace. With this demonstrated record of success in protecting our \nservicemembers, the CFPB is an ideal focal point for enforcement of \ncertain key SCRA provisions, such as the protections against default \njudgments and the maximum rate of interest on debts incurred before \nmilitary service.\n  As we take steps to protect our servicemembers, we should do all we \ncan to make sure there is a strong watchdog on the beat that can \nenforce the protections we have put in place. Our legislation is \nsupported by the National Guard Association of the United States, the \nNational Military Family Association, the Military Officers Association \nof America, Americans for Financial Reform, the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica, Consumer Action, the National Consumer Law Center, and the \nU.S. Public Interest Research Group. I urge our colleagues to help \nhonor our commitment to our Nation's servicemembers by joining us in \nthis effort to improve the supervision and enforcement of the SCRA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/senate-section/article/S4109-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4109-S4110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 199--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING \n                ESTABLISHING A NATIONAL STRATEGIC AGENDA\n\n  Mr. NELSON (for himself and Mr. Thune) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs:\n\n                              S. Res. 199\n\n       Whereas the United States needs its leaders to pursue \n     policies in the interest of the United States that are \n     foremost national priorities;\n       Whereas the United States faces many fiscal and long-term \n     policy challenges that not only threaten the opportunities, \n     hopes, and aspirations of the citizens of the United States, \n     but the overall ability of the United States to be a world \n     leader in bringing peace and stability around the world;\n       Whereas the United States needs its leaders to unite behind \n     common goals and concrete solutions to create the next \n     generation of growth and opportunity;\n       Whereas a National Strategic Agenda can provide both a \n     long-term vision and a priority list, oriented around common \n     goals for the United States, both of which, as of May 2015, \n     do not exist in the Federal Government;\n       Whereas adopting a National Strategic Agenda would bring a \n     long-term vision to a policymaking process that has become \n     too often dominated by short-term political considerations;\n       Whereas a National Strategic Agenda can provide a \n     consistent framework and focus the attention of the Federal \n     Government on the most urgent problems facing the United \n     States;\n       Whereas millions of people in the United States are \n     currently seeking employment opportunities to improve their \n     lives and provide a better future for their children;\n       Whereas, as of May 2015, the Federal debt is higher as a \n     percentage of gross domestic product than at any time since \n     World War II and will be an unsustainable burden on future \n     generations if left unaddressed;\n       Whereas the Social Security and Medicare benefits that \n     millions of people in the United States have earned must be \n     preserved and protected;\n       Whereas a fiscally responsible solution to secure Social \n     Security and Medicare for future generations is needed now, \n     as waiting longer will further jeopardize the ability to \n     preserve and protect these programs;\n       Whereas the United States can become energy secure by \n     pursuing an all-of-the-above energy plan that develops more \n     affordable and sustainable domestic energy sources, increases \n     energy efficiency, and builds a more reliable and resilient \n     system for energy generation and transmission; and\n       Whereas the creation and implementation of a new National \n     Strategic Agenda for the United States will require the \n     participation of both the legislative and executive branch \n     along with agreement by all parties to work together: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the 4 goals of the National Strategic Agenda are to--\n\n[[Page S4110]]\n\n       (A) create 25,000,000 new jobs over the next 10 years;\n       (B) balance the Federal budget by 2030;\n       (C) secure Medicare and Social Security for the next 75 \n     years; and\n       (D) make the United States energy secure by 2024;\n       (2) the Senate should strive to create, debate, and adopt \n     policy solutions to achieve the 4 goals of the National \n     Strategic Agenda to address the national interest and \n     priorities represented by the agenda; and\n       (3) in achieving success toward the National Strategic \n     Agenda, the goal of the Senate should be to reach solutions \n     through--\n       (A) collaboration, not division;\n       (B) mutual respect, not partisan bickering; and\n       (C) a commitment to honor the public duty of the Senate to \n     the United States as a body of representatives elected by \n     people across the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/11/senate-section/article/S4110-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 200--WISHING HIS HOLINESS THE 14TH DALAI LAMA A HAPPY \n    80TH BIRTHDAY ON JULY 6, 2015, AND RECOGNIZING THE OUTSTANDING \n CONTRIBUTIONS HIS HOLINESS HAS MADE TO THE PROMOTION OF NONVIOLENCE, \n    HUMAN RIGHTS, INTERFAITH DIALOGUE, ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS, AND \n                               DEMOCRACY\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Kirk, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \nCardin, and Mr. Menendez) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.
