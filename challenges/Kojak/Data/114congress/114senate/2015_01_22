Mr. President, the Senate, as I indicated, will \ncontinue its work on the Keystone jobs bill today. It is great to see a \nreal debate on the floor of the Senate again. We saw some action in the \nChamber yesterday and even some unpredictability. We saw how democracy \nin the Senate has looked many times in the past. It is great to see \nboth sides able to offer amendments once more.\n  I know many of our Democratic friends have been ready to give more of \na voice to their constituents too. I know they have been waiting for \nthis moment for some time. The assistant Democratic leader said he \nwelcomes our vision of the Senate where Members ``bring amendments to \nthe floor, debate them, vote on them, and ultimately pass \nlegislation,'' and that is what we are doing.\n  Another Democratic colleague, the senior Senator from West Virginia, \nsaid he was ``very excited'' about the prospect of an open amendment \nprocess. He also noted that it gave Members of his party a valuable \nopportunity to pursue some of their own priorities through the \nlegislative process.\n  The Senator makes an important point about the more open Senate we \nare working toward. A more open Senate presents more opportunities for \nlegislators with serious ideas to make a mark on the legislative \nprocess. It can give Members of both parties a real stake in the \nultimate outcome of the bill on the floor. And because it does, it \nrepresents one of our best avenues to secure passage of sensible \nlegislation centered on jobs and the middle class. That is something we \nshould all want.\n  So I hope Members in both parties will help us continue our efforts \nto make the Senate function better. That would be a good thing for our \ncountry. It would represent a change from the kind of Senate we have \nseen in recent years. And it would represent a positive step forward, \nnot just for Congress but for the people we represent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/22/senate-section/article/S367-7", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me join the majority leader in saying \nthat I think we are in a healthy environment on the floor of the Senate \nwhere we are pursuing amendments and active debate, and it is great to \nsee that happening. The only way that happens in the U.S. Senate is \nwhen the majority and the minority both work for it to happen. The \nrules of the Senate are constructed, as we both know well, so that \nliterally any one Senator can stop the process. But the good-will and \ngood-faith efforts of Senators on both sides of the aisle have really \nbrought us to a good moment here.\n  I wish to commend especially the leaders on the floor for this \nlegislation, Senator Murkowski of Alaska on the Republican side, and on \nour side Senator Maria Cantwell and Senator Barbara Boxer. The two of \nthem, in an extraordinary show of cooperation, have been able to work \ntogether to process amendments.\n  The fact is we voted on nine amendments so far on this Keystone \nPipeline measure. We have eight amendments pending today. So there is a \ngood-faith effort on both sides to call up these important amendments \nwith fairness to\n\n[[Page S368]]\n\nboth sides of the aisle. I want to see that continue.\n  I hope no one believes we are finished with eight amendments. We are \nnot. There are other important amendments to be considered. Members \nhave brought them to the attention of both sides, and I hope as quickly \nas we can that we will schedule them for consideration and a vote and \nmove forward.\n  Yesterday, what was fascinating was the fact that we branched off \nfrom this conversation about the Keystone Pipeline itself and the \njobs--35 permanent jobs--that will be created for this Canadian \ncorporation and started talking about some underlying, critically \nimportant issues. We spent a great deal of time on the floor discussing \nthe environmental impact not just of the pipeline but of the Canadian \ntar sands which will be brought by the pipeline, if it is approved, \ninto the United States for processing.\n  It is interesting what we have learned so far during the course of \nthis debate. When the Democrats insisted that this pipeline's product--\nthe oil that is refined and used for consumption--be sold in the United \nStates, the Republicans voted no. The Republicans voted no. I have a \nlengthy memo on my desk of all of the Republican Senators who have come \nto the floor insisting that the Keystone Pipeline was going to create \nmore gasoline, more diesel fuel, and help the American economy. Yet, \nwhen Senator Markey of Massachusetts offered an amendment to say keep \nthe products coming from the Keystone Pipeline in the United States, \nthe Republicans, to a person, voted no.\n  Then Senator Franken came forward and said, Well, let's agree that if \nthis is about jobs in America that the Keystone Pipeline will use \nAmerican steel. That seems reasonable to me, and I voted for it. The \nRepublicans voted no. They defeated the notion that we would use \nAmerican steel to build this pipeline.\n  This pipeline is Senate Bill 1 for the Senate Republicans. It is \ntheir highest priority. One would think that if it truly is a jobs \nbill, they would want American steel to be used to build the pipeline; \nlet our steel mills build this pipeline in the future, create the jobs \nin America, and they voted no.\n  Yesterday I offered an amendment as well. We know at the end of this \npipeline, if tar sands reach the United States through this means or \notherwise, it is a pretty nasty process taking the tar and sand out of \nthe oil, and what is left over is a nasty product known as petcoke.\n  Petcoke is now being stored in three-story-high piles in the city of \nChicago. I have seen it. And the city is trying to get to the point \nwhere it is at least contained and covered. Yet, the company that owns \nit, which incidentally is a company owned by the Koch brothers--what an \nirony--this company has resisted the idea of covering these petcoke \npiles, so this nasty black substance blows through the community in \nsoutheast Chicago. The city of Chicago is in a battle.\n  I tried to put in an effort yesterday so that we would establish \nstandards for transportation and storage of petcoke, and the \nRepublicans insisted it was a benign substance, it isn't hazardous, not \ndangerous, don't worry about it. If some of the Senators who voted \nagainst my amendment, tomorrow, God forbid, face this issue in their \ncommunity, I think they will have a little different view of petcoke \nand what it can do to people, the impact it has on respiratory disease \nand asthma.\n  Yesterday I didn't prevail. But I can tell my colleagues how over the \nyears, as I fought the tobacco companies and they insisted there was \nnothing dangerous about tobacco, I heard those arguments from industry \njust as we are hearing the petcoke arguments from the petcoke industry. \nUltimately, good sense prevailed, public health prevailed, and we moved \ntoward regulation of tobacco products. We should do the same--basic \nregulation--to protect the public from any negative impact on their \nhealth relative to petcoke.\n  The amendments continue today. Some of them are extraordinarily \nimportant. I hope we will continue to move toward the completion of \nthis task in an orderly manner. I commend not only the leadership on \nthe majority side, but I commend my colleagues too. We found over the \npast many years that the process of amendment would break down when one \nRepublican Senator would stand up and say, I won't let any amendment be \nconsidered until my amendment is considered, No. 1. It even reached a \npoint where Republican Senators would say, I won't let any amendment be \nconsidered unless I am guaranteed my amendment will pass. Well, when \npeople take unreasonable positions and threaten filibusters, we break \ndown the amendment process.\n  We have tried, now being in the minority, to be more constructive, \nand we have reached that goal so far this week. I hope we continue to \naspire to it and I hope we can wrap this bill up next week in an \norderly manner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/22/senate-section/article/S368-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S368-S370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks \naround the world--particularly in Paris--the American people know that \nterrorism, sadly, is a threat to us even to this day. We count on one \ndepartment of government as much if not more than any other to protect \nus--the Department of Homeland Security.\n  This is the Department which monitors the terrorist threats to our \ncountry on a minute-by-minute basis. This is the agency that provides \nthe inspectors at airports and in many other places to try to thwart \nterrorism before it strikes. It is a critically important part of our \ngovernment--one of the most important departments.\n  That is why it is curious to me that House Republicans insisted that \nthe budget--the regular budget for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity--be held up until the end of February. They need their \nDepartment budget. They need to invest it to keep America safe. Yet, \nthe House Republicans said no. They gave a continuing resolution to the \nDepartment, which basically lets them operate on a day-to-day basis \nwith no certainty for the future. That is no way to run an agency, \nparticularly one that is supposed to keep America safe.\n  Then, last week, the U.S. House of Representatives took another step \nand really revealed what was behind this strategy. They added five \nnegative riders to this Department of Homeland Security appropriations \nbill. Their riders are the subject of immigration. Of course, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security has a responsibility when it comes to \nimmigration. These riders were onerous and they threatened the very \npassage of this important legislation, so much so that the President of \nthe United States has issued a veto threat if the Republican riders \nfrom the U.S. House of Representatives are included in the bill when it \npasses the Senate.\n  The right thing to do, the smart thing to do, the thing to do to \nprotect America is for us to pass the homeland security appropriation \nnow so this agency has its money. We should remove the onerous and \nunfair riders that were attached by the House of Representatives. If we \nare to debate the negative aspects of immigration, let's save it for \nanother day and not put this Department of Homeland Security at risk \nand the safety of America at risk over this political effort by the \nRepublicans in the House of Representatives.\n  One aspect of the House measure, an amendment to the Department of \nHomeland Security appropriation, I find particularly troublesome. It \nwas 14 years ago when I introduced the DREAM Act. It is hard to imagine \nit has been that long. But the notion behind the DREAM Act was if a \nchild is brought to America by a family and is undocumented in this \ncountry and that child grows up in America, completes high school, and \nhas no serious criminal problems in their background, they ought to be \ngiven a chance to either enlist in our military, to go to college, to \nget on a path toward legalization. That is the DREAM Act.\n  Originally the DREAM Act had some Republican sponsorship, but over \nthe years that support melted away. Yet, many Republicans have said \nfrom time to time: I think the DREAM Act is fair; we just haven't \nenacted it into law. Because of that, 2\\1/2\\ years ago many of us \nappealed to President Obama to protect these DREAMers, these young \npeople. Many of them completed school and had nowhere to go. Being \nundocumented, they didn't qualify for a penny of assistance in going to\n\n[[Page S369]]\n\ncollege and, many times, if they completed college, they couldn't get a \njob because of their immigration status.\n  Back in 2012 President Obama created a program called DACA. The DACA \nProgram said that if these DREAMers--these young people who might be \neligible under the law I described--would come forward and register \nwith the government and submit to a background check and pay a filing \nfee, they would be given temporary status to live in the United States \nwithout being deported, to go to school, to work.\n  We estimate that some 2 million young people could qualify for this \nprogram, and 600,000 have signed up--so far, 600,000. In the State of \nIllinois, 30,000 have signed up. They have come forward.\n  I have met some of these young people who have qualified under DACA. \nThey are extraordinary young people. I went to Loyola Medical School in \nChicago. At the medical school I believe there are 10, perhaps 12 \nstudents who are DACA-protected who are now going to medical school. \nThere are two things to be said. First, they are extraordinary \nstudents. They had no chance to go to medical school before DACA, and \nnow they do. They are well qualified to go to medical school. Secondly, \nthey have only come to Loyola with the promise that after they receive \ntheir medical license, they will practice in underserved areas in \nIllinois and across America, whether it is rural areas or inner city. \nThey are prepared to dedicate their professional lives to serving \npeople who otherwise might not have access to medical care.\n  That is just one example. Let me tell you about some others. I would \nlike to update the Senate on two people whom I have come to the floor \nand talked about in the past--Carlos and Rafael Robles. They were \nbrought to the United States when they were small children. They grew \nup in suburban Chicago in my home State of Illinois. They were both \nhonor students at Palatine High School and Harper Community College.\n  In high school Carlos was the captain of the tennis team and a member \nof the varsity swim team. He volunteered for Palatine's physically \nchallenged program, where every day he helped to feed lunch to special \nneeds students. Carlos graduated from Harper Community College and went \non to attend Loyola University in Chicago, majoring in education. This \nis what one of his teachers said about him:\n\n       Carlos is the kind of person we want among us because he \n     wants to make the community better. This is the kind of \n     person you want as a student, the kind of kid you want as a \n     neighbor and friend to your child, and most germane to his \n     present circumstance, the kind of person you want as an \n     American.\n\n  After he received DACA protection--President Obama's Executive \norder--Carlos was able to work as a tennis coach at his high school and \nhelp pay his tuition.\n  After he graduated from Loyola with a major in education, Carlos \nworked as a teacher in a public high school in Chicago. I ran into him \nat a meeting last year, and he told me about his ambition to be a \nteacher. He is now attending graduate school at the Gerald R. Ford \nSchool of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, where he is \nstudying education policy. He is a bright and engaging young man who \nwants to make our schools more effective.\n  In high school, his brother Rafael was captain of the tennis team and \na member of the varsity swim team and soccer team. He graduated from \nHarper Community College and now attends the University of Illinois, \nwhere he is majoring in architecture. One of Rafael's teachers said:\n\n       Rafael is the kind of person I have taught about in my \n     Social Studies classes--the American who comes to this \n     country and commits to his community and makes it better for \n     others. Raffi Robles is a young man who makes us better. \n     During my 28-year career as a high school teacher, coach, and \n     administrator, I would place Raffi in the top 5 percent of \n     all the kids with whom I have ever had contact.\n\n  Since receiving DACA, Rafael has been a full-time student while also \nworking at Studio Gang Architects, an award-winning architectural firm \nin Chicago. Rafael will graduate this spring with a 3.8 GPA.\n  In a letter to Congress, the Robles brothers shared their thoughts \nabout efforts to overturn DACA. Here is what they said:\n\n       We ask you today to see it in your heart to do the right \n     thing, to listen, and to reward the values of hard work and \n     diligence, values that made America the most beautiful and \n     prosperous country in the world and that we're sure got you, \n     as members of Congress, to where you are today in life. These \n     are values we have come to admire and respect in the American \n     people. We will continue to uphold these values until the \n     last days of our lives. We hope eventually as citizens of the \n     United States we will become part of a country we now see as \n     home.\n\n  These two individuals, Carlos and Rafael Robles--extraordinary \nDREAMers--were brought to this country as children by their parents, \nundocumented with no future in America, and look what they have done \nwith their lives. One has dedicated his life to education and has \novercome the odds and graduated from Loyola University without any \ngovernment assistance. Because he is undocumented, he doesn't qualify. \nNow he is going for a master's degree, again at his own expense. His \nbrother is pursuing a degree in architecture.\n  Do you know what House Republicans say? Deport the Robles brothers. \nThat is what their amendment to the Department of Homeland Security \nappropriations says. Deport these two young men. Send them out of this \ncountry despite the fact that they have worked so hard and succeeded in \nwhat they have set out to achieve.\n  The House Republicans want to deport the 600,000 just like them who \nhave qualified under the President's DACA Program. And they have gone \nfurther--not a penny, they have said, for any additional young people \nto apply for the DACA Program. Two million young people, many of whom, \nlike the Robles brothers, just want to make America a better place--the \nHouse Republicans say: Deport them. Further, they say: We won't pass \nthe Department of Homeland Security appropriations to protect Americans \nfrom terrorism until you deport the Robles brothers and young people \njust like them.\n\n  What is wrong with this picture? Have the Members of the House of \nRepresentatives forgotten who we are as a nation? It is a nation of \nimmigrants. My mother was an immigrant to this country. Her \nnaturalization certificate is sitting right behind my desk upstairs. I \nam proud of it. She came to this country at the age of 2 from Lithuania \nand raised a family--a proud American citizen. Her son is honored to \nrepresent the State of Illinois in the U.S. Senate. That is my story. \nThat is my family's story. That is America's story. That is the Robles' \nstory.\n  Why do the House Republicans have such a vengeance against these \nyoung men and women who through no fault of their own found themselves \nin America and made the best of it and only want to make this a better \nNation? It drives the House Republicans into a rage to think that the \nRobles brothers might stay in the United States and make this a better \ncountry. I don't get it. I don't understand their thinking.\n  I really would encourage the House Republicans to meet some of the \nDREAMers and get to know them. When they do, the images which perhaps \nthey have in their minds would be dispelled quickly.\n  We have a job ahead of us. The Senate needs to pass the Department of \nHomeland Security appropriations and the sooner, the better. God forbid \nwe face another terrorist attack. Let's not let it happen with this \nimportant Department facing the restrictions they have been facing \nbecause of this Republican strategy. Let's give them a full \nappropriation and tell them to do their best every single day to keep \nus safe. Let's not embroil their work in a political debate about \nimmigration, which is what the House Republicans insist on. Let's do \nsomething different here in the Senate. Let's pass a clean Department \nof Homeland Security appropriations bill. Take out the immigration \nriders. Save them for another day. Save them for amendments on another \nbill. Let's fund this Department, and let's get it done now. For the \nsafety and security of this Nation, we need to come together on a \nbipartisan basis and put this political tactic by the House Republicans \nbehind us.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, many have now heard the sad news that \none of the giants of Kentucky politics passed away last night. Wendell \nFord first came to the Senate in the 1970s, calling himself just ``a \ndumb country boy with dirt between his toes.'' But over a distinguished \ntwo-decade career, this workhorse of the Senate would prove he was \nanything but.\n  I had the opportunity to watch my Senate colleague up close as he \nascended to leadership in his party and established himself as a leader \non issues of importance to my State. A proud Kentuckian who rose from \npage in the statehouse to Governor of the State, Ford shaped the \nhistory of the Commonwealth in ways few others had before him.\n  He never forgot the lessons about hard work he learned while milking \ncows or tending to chores on the family farm. This World War II veteran \nnever backed down from a fight either.\n  We imagine he approached his final battle with the same spirit. \nElaine and I, and I am certain I speak for the entire Senate, send our \ncondolences to his wife Jean--Mrs. Ford, as Wendell often called her--\nand the rest of the Ford family at this difficult time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Senator Enzi was going to be here, so I am hoping his \nschedule will allow him to use his time this afternoon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/22/senate-section/article/S370-4", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S370-S372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, yesterday we had an interesting debate on \nclimate change in the Senate, and there were three separate votes. The \nfirst one I and virtually all the Republicans supported, the Whitehouse \namendment No. 29, said climate change is real and not a hoax.\n  This is true. Climate has always changed, and I think there is an \neffort by those on the other side who are trying to promote the big \nObama program that would cost $479 billion and not accomplish anything \nin terms of setting up a new bureaucracy of trying to say we are \ndenying that climate changes.\n  As I said on the floor yesterday, climate has always changed. If we \ngo back and read history, look at archeological findings, and read the \nScriptures, it has changed since the very beginning of time. We know it \nis real.\n  The hoax is that somehow there are people so arrogant who are going \nto go along with the President's program to say: Yes, if we spend \nenough money we, the human beings, can stop the climate from changing. \nI think people do understand that is not going to happen. So I am very \nhappy we were able to get it out so it cannot be used in a way that \nwould be deceptive to the public--because the climate has been changing \nsince the beginning of time.\n  The hoax I have referred to since 2002 is that man is going to be in \nthe position to change climate. That is not going to happen.\n  What is interesting is these votes could have taken place any time \nover the last year. I hope I am not divulging something someone else is \ngoing to use, but we are on pace now to have more amendments and votes \non this one bill--a popular bill--than we had on amendments in the \nentire year last year.\n  We were very critical of the majority and the fact that we were not \ndoing anything here. I would go home this last year and people would \nsay: What did you accomplish?\n  Nothing. We didn't have any votes. We didn't do anything.\n  We had 15 votes on amendments in the entire year last year. By the \nend of today we will have that many votes on amendments just in 1 week. \nSo it is very significant that we are actually getting things done.\n  Why did the Democrats not have a vote on the Keystone Pipeline or on \nclimate? Because voters don't care or because people have lost interest \nin that. They have caught on. They know that, despite the money that \nhas been put in this thing by Tom Steyer--we have already talked about \nthat on this floor--that went into midterm elections, the proglobal \nwarming votes would be seen negatively by voters.\n  This wasn't true back in the 1990s. At that time they had everyone \nscared that global warming was coming and the world was going to come \nto an end. There was polling by the Gallup polls, and that was the No. \n1 and No. 2 concern in America. Environmental concerns are now No. 14 \nout of 15 in America.\n  So that is where it is. That is why Tom Steyer has spent, by his own \nadmission, some $70 million on the elections. He stated he was going to \nget involved in eight senatorial elections--and I say to the Presiding \nOfficer, he knows which ones they would be--and they lost them all. But \nTom Steyer is not out of money, and they are going to do what they can \nto try to resurrect this global warming as an issue.\n  So the Gallup polls--and not just the polls. The Pew Research Center \nsaid 53 percent of Americans either don't believe global warming exists \nor believe it is caused by natural variation. I don't have it here, but \nI do know there was a university that put together a poll of all of the \ntelevision weather people and it came out to the same thing: It was 63 \npercent said either it doesn't exist or, if it does exist, it exists \nbecause of natural causes.\n  What do the American people care about? They are concerned about the \ndeficit and they are concerned about jobs.\n  Yesterday on the floor we talked about the deficit. Under this \nPresident--not a believable figure but an accurate figure--he has \nincreased the debt in America more than all Presidents in the history \nof America, from George Washington to George Bush.\n  So that is what people care about.\n  As chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, one of my \ntop priorities in this Congress is to conduct vigorous oversight of EPA \nregulations and getting into President Obama's excessive regulation \nregime through numerous hearings. We are going to have hearings on \nthese regulations. We actually have dates set already to have hearings \nso people will understand what the cost is of these regulations.\n  The Presiding Officer is from a rural State, as I am. I am from \nOklahoma. When I talk to farmers--in fact, Tom Buchanan, president of \nthe Oklahoma Farm Bureau, said I can use his quote: Our farmers in \nOklahoma--and I suggest all throughout America--are more concerned \nabout the EPA regulations than they are all the other problems that are \nout there or anything that you will see in the farm bill.\n  He talks about the endangered species, that they can't plow their \nfields anymore in certain places because there might be some kind of a \nbug down there. He talks about containment of fuel on their farms. He \ntalks about the water of the United States. That bill is probably the \nNo. 1 concern of farmers.\n\n[[Page S371]]\n\n  The western part of my State is arid. I was out in Boise City, in the \npanhandle, and it is one of the most arid parts of the United States. \nIt could actually be declared a wetland if we were to pass this and \nallow the Federal Government to replace the States and come in and \nregulate water on the land.\n  These are the things they are concerned about.\n  We should look closely at this, and this is quite a breakthrough. Our \nfriends in Australia already tried regulating their emissions. I think \nwe all know the IPCC is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, \nand that bureaucracy is supposedly the scientific community. Yet we \nfind out now--and I talked about this yesterday. All the scientists \nwere not believers in this, but a lot did believe and Australia did \nbelieve. So they joined in a Kyoto-type treaty and started stopping \ntheir emissions. They imposed a carbon tax on the economy a few years \nago, and it caused horrendous damage--$9 billion in lost economic \nactivity per year, and destroyed tens of thousands of jobs. It was so \nbad that their government recently voted to repeal the carbon tax they \nimposed just a couple years ago, and their economy is now better for \nit. In fact, it was announced just following the repeal that Australia \nexperienced record job growth of 120,000 jobs--far more than the 10,000 \nto 15,000 jobs economists had expected.\n  We also looked closely at this because scientists are having a \ndifficult time explaining the 15-year hiatus we have seen in \ntemperature increases. This isn't me. The IPCC agrees with this, Nature \nmagazine agrees with this, the Economist magazine agrees. They are \nreputable publications.\n  Reviewing the science is one thing they have to do in the EPW \nCommittee, the committee I chair, because it is on this disputed \nscience the EPA is building its significant greenhouse gas regulation \npackage scheduled for this summer, which all together would be the \ncostliest regulation in history. The component regulating \nCO2 emissions from existing sources is the cause of a great \nconcern in particular.\n  We heard in the President's message on Tuesday night that as proposed \nright now, the EPA's regulation will raise energy prices, destroy jobs, \nand impose billions of dollars in costs on the U.S. economy without \nachieving any kind of an effect.\n  It is interesting, and I have quoted her many times. The first EPA \nAdministrator appointed by Barack Obama was Lisa Jackson. Lisa Jackson \ncame before our committee many times. I always appreciated her because \nshe would not get a message from the White House and come and repeat it \nin our committee.\n  I asked her a question: If we were to pass any of these regulations \nor the legislation to have cap and trade in America--which is what the \nPresident proposed on Tuesday night--would this have the effect of \nreducing CO2 emissions worldwide.\n  Her answer, live on TV, in our meeting was, no, it wouldn't because \nthis isn't where the problem is. The problem is in China, the problem \nis in India, the problem is in Mexico.\n  So what we do in the United States isn't going to affect what they \ndo. In fact, the opposite is true. Because if we control emissions to \nthe point where our manufacturing base runs out of energy in America, \nwhere do they go? They go to places such as China. China is sitting \nback hoping we pass something so they can benefit from our lost jobs in \nAmerica.\n  The Wall Street Journal on June 3 called the proposal that the \nPresident suggested on Tuesday ``a huge indirect tax and wealth \nredistribution scheme that the EPA is imposing by fiat [that] will \nprofoundly touch every American.''\n  Further quoting the Wall Street Journal: ``It is impossible to raise \nthe price of carbon energy without also raising costs across the \neconomy.''\n  This is clearly worthy of intense congressional oversight, and that \nis what we intend to do. EPA has gone beyond the plain reading of the \nClean Air Act in an attempt to grossly expand its authority. It is \nforcing States to achieve dubious emission reduction targets from a \nlimited menu of economically damaging and legally questionable options.\n  One of the foremost authorities in America is Richard Lindzen of MIT. \nRichard Lindzen some time ago made the statement, ``Controlling carbon \nis a bureaucrat's dream.''\n  That is what they want to do, try to control carbon emissions.\n\n       Controlling carbon is a bureaucrat's dream. If you control \n     carbon, you control life.\n\n  The scientific community has been divided on this. We are in a \nposition to try to make sure this doesn't happen to America, and so we \nare going to be very busy on that.\n  I wish to also mention we have seen Europe go down the road of \nimposing these mandates--the cap and trade and regimes they are \nproposing for America and in the green energy subsidies--and we have \nseen where that has gotten them. Electricity prices are up to 2\\1/2\\ \ntimes higher than those in the United States. In Germany, in 2012, \nCO2 emissions actually rose by 1.3 percent over the 2011 \nlevels, while the U.S. emissions fell by 3.9 percent--and they were \nimposing these new restrictions, we were not.\n  As a matter of fact, things got so bad in Germany that they backed \noff of their disastrous renewable fuels program and now plan to build \n10 new coal-fired powerplants in Germany.\n  Make sure we heard that, 10 new coal-fired powerplants. This is what \nthey are trying to do away with altogether in America--as if we could \nrun the ``machine'' called America without fossil fuels and without \nnuclear. We can't do it.\n  A look closer to home: California has adopted similar carbon \nreduction policies, and its cap-and-trade scheme alone will increase \nelectricity rates by 8 percent, according to the California Public \nUtilities Commission.\n  That is in California today. If we pass this, I don't have a figure \nas to how much that is going to increase out in California. Do we want \nour entire economy following the path of the State of California? It \nhas one of the country's highest electricity rates. The rates in \nCalifornia are 65 percent higher than our rates in the State of \nOklahoma, and it has one of the worst unemployment rates, one of the \nworst insolvent fiscal positions of any State, not to mention some of \nthe worst air quality in the country.\n  Predictions of this rule's devastating impacts are prevalent. In \nOklahoma, residential rates are projected to increase by 15 to 19 \npercent and industrial rates by 24 percent; that is, in the event they \nare successful in this program.\n  I notice the other side has not arrived. I ask unanimous consent to \ngo an additional 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The Kansas Corporation Commission calculates that \ncompliance with the rule as proposed would cost the State $5 to $15 \nbillion, the equivalent of a 10- to 30-percent increase in electric \nrates. The loss of cheaper and more reliable coal units will increase \nthe power prices by as much as 25 percent on grids that serve about a \nthird of the Nation's population, according to the Brattle Group in \nMassachusetts.\n  Now, I have gone on and talked about how much more this would cost \nState by State. There isn't time to go over all of it now. But let's \nstop and realize the cost of this. NERA's analysis of the increased \ncost if we were to adopt these programs projects that the cost to \ncomply with the EPA's plan could be a total of $479 billion or more, \nwith 43 States having double-digit electricity increases and 14 States \npotentially facing peak-year electricity price increases exceeding 20 \npercent.\n  I say this because--who is having to pay this? Everybody pays it, and \nthey have to pay it equally. It has to be the most regressive type of \nincrease in taxation that we could have. If you have a pilot program, \nwith a family that is in poverty they have to spend the same amount of \nmoney for their electricity. That is a must, not a luxury. It is \nsomething they have to have. So they could easily spend half of their \nexpendable income on electricity price increases, while wealthy people \nmight only face a 1-percent increase of their income. That is why it is \nimportant and why we need to pay attention to it--to make sure we know \nthe public is aware of this.\n\n[[Page S372]]\n\n  NERA also estimates that atmospheric CO2 concentrations \nwould be reduced by less than one-half of 1 percent--that is if they \nare successful in doing this--equating to reductions in global average \ntemperatures of less than two one-hundredths of a degree. So all these \nthings they say they might be able to accomplish, they have studied it \nand say it is just not true.\n  I have already talked about the fact that within the President's own \nadministration, Lisa Jackson, the former head of the EPA, said even if \nthey are successful, even if they are right about this, it is not going \nto reduce CO2 emissions because this isn't where the problem \nis.\n  So this is going on right now. We have a committee that is clearly \ngoing to be working on this so the American people will be aware of \nwhat is happening. The Energy Information Administration determined \nthat the China agreement would result in a 34-percent increase in \nelectricity prices.\n  I bring this up because we heard in the President's speech on Tuesday \nthat they were negotiating with China and some very successful \nnegotiations took place. The Presiding Officer remembers that this was \nback when our Secretary of State went over and met with President Xi of \nChina and came back and said it was a successful meeting. What came out \nof that negotiation? China said: Well, we will keep increasing our \nemissions until 2020, and then we will look at it and decide whether we \nwant to lower it. That is not much of a negotiation, and it was not \nvery comforting to us.\n  A comprehensive survey conducted by a Harvard political scientist \nshows that people who are worried about climate change are only willing \nto pay energy bills up to 5 percent higher. Whether it is global \nwarming or climate change, the American people understand this proposal \nis in no way about protecting the environment or improving public \nhealth. This rule is an executive and bureaucratic power grab unlike \nanything this country has ever seen, and it is merely the tip of the \nspear in a radical war against affordable energy and fossil fuels.\n  At a time when domestic oil and gas prices through hydraulic \nfracturing continue to be one of the only bright spots in our economy, \na lot of people are trying to stop this from taking place. I kind of \nwind up with this because I think it is important. I come from an oil \nState, so I have to buy it. I understand that. The process of hydraulic \nfracturing started in my State of Oklahoma--in Duncan, OK--in 1948. Did \nyou know that by their own admission the EPA said there has never been \na documented case of groundwater contamination since they started using \nhydraulic fracturing?\n  When the President made the statement in the State of the Union \nMessage that the United States has dramatically increased in the last 5 \nyears our production of oil and gas, that is correct, but that is in \nspite of the President. We have enjoyed a 61-percent increase in the \nproduction of oil and gas in America in the last 5 years--61 percent. \nHowever, all of that is either on State or private land. On Federal \nland we have had a reduction of 6 percent. So I look at that, and I \nbelieve it when people say that if we had been able to increase \nproduction on Federal land such as we have done in the last 5 years on \nprivate land and State land, we could be totally--100 percent--\nindependent from any other country in developing our resources.\n  So I am committed to using our committee, the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, not only to conduct a rigorous oversight of the Obama \nEPA policies which are running roughshod over our economy, operating \noutside the scope of the law, and directly ignoring the intent of \nCongress but also to rein in this out-of-control agency through any and \nall means at our disposal.\n  This has been a problem. People used to say that it was just big \nbusiness that wanted to reduce these regulations. That isn't true. As I \nmentioned before, the farmers of America--just in my State of \nOklahoma--say the overregulation of EPA is the most difficult issue \nthey have to deal with.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/22/senate-section/article/S372-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we are back to continue debate and \nvoting on amendments to this bipartisan Keystone XL bill.\n  I will focus on two main subjects today. The first is to speak to \nwhat I think is the good progress we have made on this bill, moving us \ntoward ultimately a final vote and final passage. I believe we probably \nsurprised a few people yesterday by adopting an amendment on climate \nchange that few thought would be adopted. We have now processed a total \nof nine amendments. Some would say, well, nine is not much, but just to \nput it into context, last year, the Senate held just 15 rollcall votes \non amendments. That was in all of 2014. Over just a couple of days here \nin this new Congress, we are already at 60 percent of last year's \ntotal, and it is still January. We have eight amendments that are \npending at this moment and set to be voted on today. We will work out \nthe timing and order of those votes. My hope is that we will exceed \nlast year's total today.\n  I believe our productivity has been good. I appreciate the \ncooperation of the ranking member on the committee. What we have been \nable to do with this measure is important because I think it stands in \npretty stark contrast to what we have seen in recent years and, quite \nhonestly, to the delays the Keystone XL Pipeline has faced over those \nyears.\n  The second part of my comments this morning--I wish to provide a \nlittle bit of perspective about how long this cross-border permit has \nbeen pending, awaiting a final decision by the President.\n  Sometimes when we talk in terms of the raw numbers, some ask: What \ndoes that really mean? What does it mean to be on the 2,316th day that \nhas passed since the company seeking to build this pipeline first filed \nits first permit with the State Department?\n  It has been more than 6 years, more than 76 months, and more than 330 \nweeks.\n  The President noted in his State of the Union Address this week that \nKeystone XL was just a single oil pipeline. And he is right--it is just \na single oil pipeline. We have multiple pipelines that cross the \nborder. We have hundreds of pipelines that cross the country. So it \nbegs the question: How and why has it taken so long to get action\n\n[[Page S373]]\n\non just one single pipeline? Why has it taken so long?\n  There have been a lot of examples we have heard on floor. I mentioned \nyesterday that President Obama was still a sitting Senator when the \npermit application was filed. Others have said the iPad was not even \nout on the market when the first permit was filed. We heard that 2,300 \ndays is longer than it took the United States to win World War II, \nlonger than Louis and Clark's expedition to explore the West, and \nlonger than Project Mercury, which put the first American into space. \nThere have been a lot of comparisons in terms of what it really means \nto be longer than 2,300 days.\n  I mentioned on the floor many times that in Alaska we are seeking to \ntry to advance our natural gas resource, and in order to do so we need \na big pipeline to move from the North Slope down to tidewater, and so \nwe are working to train welders because we know that when that day \ncomes and we have the opportunity to build that line, we are going to \nwant Alaskans to have those jobs. They may be temporary in that you \ndon't weld a pipeline forever, you do it until the job is complete, but \nthose are good jobs for those Alaskans and for people who come up to \nour State.\n  The Fairbanks Pipeline Training Center in Alaska does a fabulous job. \nIn my opinion, it is the best pipeline training facility we have in the \ncountry. Every year, graduates from the training center are sent out, \nready to go to work on projects such as Keystone XL. We are probably \ntalking about seven sets of welders who have graduated at this point, \nand we need to keep approving projects that can help these young people \nor those who have been retrained as welders to get jobs. That is what \nthey are waiting for.\n  We can even think about this length of time which has ensued since \nthe first permit application has been pending in terms of flying to \nMars and back. We could probably complete about three roundtrips from \nhere to Mars and back, depending, of course, on the distance between \nthe planets, but I am just putting it in context.\n  If we wanted to stay closer to home, we could describe those 2,300 \ndays in terms of how many times we could hike the Appalachian Trail--\nprobably 10 or 12 depending on the weather. One of these days I would \nlike to hike the Appalachian Trail. I don't know that I have the time, \nit is one of those issues when you think about how long this has been \npending before this administration.\n  Today I will add one more example to show the comparison. At this \ntime in the football season, we are all focused on what is going on \nwith Super Bowl XLIX, which is coming up in 10 days now. We will see \nSuper Bowl XLIX pit the reigning NFL champions, the Seattle Seahawks--\nin Alaska we don't have our own professional football team, so we kind \nof adopted the Seahawks. I will let my colleagues know that I will be \nstanding with the ranking member in rooting for the Seahawks on the big \nday next week. A lot of folks are excited about it, and we will be \nwatching it. The game will be played next Sunday.\n  For the moment, let's look back to September 19, 2008, when the first \ncross-border permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline was first submitted to \nthe State Department. Let's specifically focus on the Seahawks because \nthey provide a pretty good example of how much has changed over the \npast 6 years. Back in September of 2008, the Seahawks were about to \nstart a season in which they would have a record of just 4 and 12--\nwinning 4 games and losing 12. At that point they were still a good \nteam and we were still rooting for them, but they were a pretty \ndifferent team. For starters, the Seahawks had a head coach. Their \ncurrent coach, Pete Carroll, was still at the University of Southern \nCalifornia coaching the Trojans. Their star running back, Marshawn \nLynch, was about to start his second year in the NFL as a member of the \nBuffalo Bills. It would be another 2 years before Lynch joined the \nSeahawks and just over 3 years before the Nation discovered his love of \nSkittles during the game against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n  The most famous members of the Seahawks secondary--the Legion of \nBoom--are Richard Sherman and Earl Thomas. Back in September of 2008, \nboth were still in college, respectively playing for Stanford and the \nUniversity of Texas.\n  Of course, we cannot forget Russell Wilson. A lot of Alaskans are \nrooting for him to get a second consecutive Super Bowl as the starting \nquarterback for the Seahawks. Back in September of 2008--he played just \na handful of college games at that time. He was a redshirt freshman at \nNorth Carolina State.\n  My point here is not necessarily about football--although that is \nwhat a lot of us are talking about--it is to demonstrate that a lot can \nhappen over the course of 2,300 days, and it does, whether we are \ntalking about what goes on in politics, in world events, or the world \nof sports. My point is that it should probably take the Federal \nGovernment less time to approve an important infrastructure project--\nwhat the President himself has called just a single oil pipeline--than \nit takes to build an NFL championship team.\n  I would like us to get to the point where we are done discussing the \nmerits of this important project and be done in the sense that we can \nmove forward not only with Keystone XL but move forward as a nation \nwhen it comes to North American energy independence and providing jobs \nand greater economic benefit to this country.\n  I am pleased with the process we have had on the floor over the past \ncouple of days. I look forward to the series of amendments on which we \nwill have votes this afternoon--likely after lunch--and the opportunity \nto be in further discussion about these issues that I think have been \npent-up for a period of time.\n  With that, I acknowledge my colleague on the energy committee and co-\nfan of the Seattle Seahawks.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska. I am \ncertainly tired of hearing about deflate-gate. I don't know if our \nbantering on the floor can keep the focus on the real talent of the \nfootball team and the individuals, but I certainly want to say that she \nhas proven she is a true 12, and that is important to us in the \nNorthwest. I thank the Senator for her comments.\n  We are here today to continue the debate on the Keystone XL Pipeline, \nand I see my colleague from Vermont is here, and he probably wishes to \ngive comments about his amendments. Hopefully we will be voting later \ntoday on the various amendment proposals we discussed yesterday. We \nwill be talking to Members about other amendments they would like to \nsee on this legislation.\n  Before I turn it over to Senator Sanders, I wish to draw focus for a \nfew minutes to the fact that this process, debate, and discussion about \nthe protection of environmental issues, property rights, and \nenvironmental laws is incredibly important in the United States of \nAmerica. I say that because I want to submit for the Record two news \narticles that just came out today. One is entitled ``Montana oil spill \nrenews worries over safety of old pipelines,'' and the other story is \nheadlined ``Cleanup Underway for Nearly 3M-Gallon Saltwater Spill In \nND.''\n  The reason I bring that up is that as we are sitting here today \ndiscussing whether we are going to override current environmental law \nand give special carve-out exceptions to a foreign company to basically \nbuild a pipeline through the United States of America, the fundamental \nquestion in my mind is, What is the hurry in giving them exemptions to \nthese various laws as a way to get the pipeline built? These are things \nU.S. businesses don't get. They don't get these exemptions and they \ncertainly don't get the U.S. Senate voting to basically override the \nPresident's authority--I should say to pass a bill that would basically \nprohibit the President from using his authority on what is in the \nnational interest.\n  To me, the Montana spill in the Yellowstone River is similar to our \ncurrent pipeline debate on Keystone XL and whether we have the right \nsafety provisions in place. So, if anything, we should be discussing \nwhat we can do to further pipeline safety in the United States of \nAmerica and not let a foreign company roll back existing U.S. laws on \nenvironmental issues that they should be complying with.\n  This is such a beautiful part of our country, and this article talks \nabout how oil is floating 28 miles downstream\n\n[[Page S374]]\n\nfrom the Poplar Pipeline spill. This is an issue we should be really \nthinking about.\n  I get that there has been an explosion of both tar sands and Bakken \noil. The question is not are we going to rush to try to help these \ncompanies override rules; the question is whether they comply with \nrules and whether the United States of America has enough protections \nin place to make sure the safety and security of our citizens as this \nnew opportunity and explosion of product is occurring.\n  I can say from my perspective in my State, I have worked with \npractically every city council in the State about how they want new \nsafety regulations for crude oil transported by rail--something they \nare very concerned about, given the explosions that have happened on \noil railcars.\n  Again, regarding this particular issue, I know my colleague from \nNorth Dakota thinks that somehow this alleviates the Northwest from \nhaving trains go through there, but I assure him it doesn't. So we will \nstill have concerns about the safety of our citizens as more crude oil \nis being transported by rail.\n  But we shouldn't now be trying to exempt a foreign company from \ncomplying with U.S. laws; we should be saying they should follow the \nrules. In the meantime, we should be asking the NTSB--we should be \nasking our agencies--whether there are enough safety protections in \nplace, given the large amount of crude that is now moving and the \nissues we have seen as a result. There is nothing more important to me \nthan protecting farmers and landowners to make sure they are actually \ntreated fairly, and to make sure that resources such as clean water are \nprotected.\n  Just because the discussion has been going on for a long time doesn't \nmean we should overrule existing environmental laws and exempt a \nforeign company from complying with it. I would rather them follow the \nrules all the way through the process.\n  So, with that, I yield the floor. I see my colleague from Vermont is \nhere to discuss his amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Associated Press, Jan. 22, 2015]\n\n      Montana Oil Spill Renews Worry Over Safety of Old Pipelines\n\n                           (By Matthew Brown)\n\n       Billings, MT.--A second large oil spill into Montana's \n     Yellowstone River in less than four years is reviving \n     questions about oversight of the nation's aging pipeline \n     network.\n       Investigators and company officials on Wednesday were \n     trying to determine the cause of the 40,000-gallon spill that \n     contaminated downstream water supplies in the city of \n     Glendive.\n       Sen. Jon Tester said Saturday's spill from the decades-old \n     Poplar Pipeline was avoidable, but ``we just didn't have the \n     folks on the ground'' to prevent it.\n       The Montana Democrat told The Associated Press that more \n     frequent inspections by regulators are needed, and older \n     pipelines should face stricter safety standards.\n       ``We need to take a look at some of these pipelines that \n     have been in the ground for half a century and say, `Are they \n     still doing a good job?' '' Tester said.\n       The latest spill comes as Republicans and some Democrats, \n     including Tester, want the Obama administration to approve \n     TransCanada's Keystone XL pipeline from Canada to the Gulf.\n       Keystone would cross the Yellowstone roughly 20 miles \n     upstream of the Poplar Pipeline spill.\n       In 2011, an ExxonMobil pipeline break spilled 63,000 \n     gallons of oil during flooding on the Yellowstone near \n     Billings. The break was blamed on scouring of the river \n     bottom that exposed the company's Silvertip line to \n     floodwaters.\n       Officials involved in the Poplar Pipeline spill have said \n     it's too soon to say if that line also was exposed.\n       Poplar, owned by Wyoming-based Bridger Pipeline, was \n     constructed in the 1950s. The breached section beneath the \n     Yellowstone was replaced at least four decades ago, in the \n     late 1960s or early 1970s, according to the company.\n       Based on the number of miles of pipelines in the U.S. that \n     carry oil, gasoline and other hazardous liquids, just over \n     half were installed prior to 1970, according to the U.S. \n     Department of Transportation.\n       The agency's Office of Pipeline Safety has roughly 150 \n     inspectors overseeing 2.6 million miles of gas, oil and other \n     pipelines.\n       That number is slated to increase by another 100 inspectors \n     under a $27 million budget increase approved last year. That \n     would still leave inspectors stretched thin given the mileage \n     of pipelines.\n       Dena Hoff, a farmer and rancher whose land borders the site \n     of the Poplar accident, said she's had a good working \n     relationship with Bridger Pipeline, and she commended the \n     company for taking responsibility for the spill.\n       But Hoff said the spill should spur second thoughts about \n     Keystone and whether it's a good idea to have pipelines that \n     cross beneath surface waters.\n       ``It's the nature of the beast. Pipelines leak and \n     pipelines break. We're never going to get around that,'' she \n     said. ``We have to decide if water is more valuable than \n     oil.''\n       Authorities continue work to clean up Glendive's public \n     water supply after cancer-causing benzene was detected in \n     water coming from the city's treatment plant. The plant draws \n     directly from the Yellowstone.\n       Bridger Pipeline has committed to providing bottled water \n     for Glendive's roughly 6,000 residents until the water-\n     treatment plant is running again.\n       Late Wednesday night, Dawson County Disaster and Emergency \n     Services Coordinator Mary Jo Gehnert said in an email that \n     the plant has been decontaminated. If tests conducted \n     Thursday show that the plant's water is safe to use, county \n     workers will give information to the public on how to flush \n     the water in homes and businesses, Gehnert said.\n       Workers late Tuesday recovered about 10,000 gallons of oil \n     that was still in the Poplar line after it was shut down \n     because of the breach.\n       Bridger Pipeline Co. spokesman Bill Salvin said Wednesday \n     only a ``very small'' amount of oil has been siphoned from \n     the river itself.\n       Company officials and government regulators say most of the \n     oil is thought to be within the first 6 miles of the spill \n     site. That includes the stretch of the river through \n     Glendive.\n       ``What we're working on is identifying places where we can \n     collect more oil,'' Salvin said. ``The cleanup could extend \n     for a while.''\n       Oil sheens have been reported as far away as Williston, \n     North Dakota, below the Yellowstone's confluence with the \n     Missouri River, officials said.\n       The farthest downstream that free-floating oil has been \n     seen was at an intake dam about 28 miles from the spill site, \n     officials said.\n       Montana Department of Environmental Quality Director Tom \n     Livers said he was concerned that when the ice breaks up in \n     the spring, oil will spread farther downstream.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Associated Press, Jan. 22, 2015]\n\n      Cleanup Underway for Nearly 3M-Gallon Saltwater Spill in ND\n\n                        (By Regina Garcia Cano)\n\n       Cleanup is underway after nearly 3 million gallons of \n     brine, a salty, toxic byproduct of oil and natural gas \n     production, leaked from a pipeline in western North Dakota, \n     the largest spill of its kind in the state since the current \n     energy boom began.\n       The full environmental impact of the spill, which \n     contaminated two creeks, might not be clear for months. Some \n     previous saltwater spills have taken years to clean up. A \n     contractor hired by the pipeline operator will be on site \n     Thursday, assessing the damage.\n       Operator Summit Midstream Partners LLC detected the \n     pipeline spill on Jan. 6, about 15 miles north of Williston \n     and informed North Dakota officials then. State health \n     officials on Wednesday said they weren't given a full account \n     of the size until Tuesday.\n       Inspectors have been monitoring the area near Williston, in \n     the heart of North Dakota's oil country, but it will be \n     difficult to assess the effects of the spill until the ice \n     melts, said Dave Glatt, chief of the North Dakota Department \n     of Health's environmental health section.\n        ``This is not something we want to happen in North \n     Dakota,'' Glatt said.\n       The spill presently doesn't threaten public drinking water \n     or human health, Glatt said. He said a handful of farmers \n     have been asked to keep their livestock away from the two \n     creeks, the smaller of which will be drained.\n       Brine, also referred to as saltwater, is an unwanted \n     byproduct of drilling that is much saltier than sea water and \n     may also contain petroleum and residue from hydraulic \n     fracturing operations.\n       The new spill is almost three times larger than one that \n     fouled a portion of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in \n     July. Another million-gallon saltwater spill in 2006, near \n     Alexander, is still being cleaned up nearly a decade later.\n       Summit Midstream said in a statement Wednesday that about \n     65,000 barrels of a mix of freshwater and brine have been \n     pumped out from Blacktail Creek. Brine also reached the \n     bigger Little Muddy Creek and potentially the Missouri River.\n       Glatt said the Blacktail Creek will be completely drained \n     as part of the initial cleanup, but the water and soil will \n     have to be continuously tested until after the spring thaw \n     because some of the contaminated water has frozen. The Little \n     Muddy Creek will not be drained because it is bigger than the \n     Blacktail Creek and the saltwater is being diluted.\n        ``We will be monitoring to see how quickly it gets back to \n     natural background water quality conditions, and we are \n     already starting to see that,'' Glatt said of the Little \n     Muddy Creek. ``It's getting back pretty quickly.''\n       Summit Midstream's chief operating officer, Rene Casadaban, \n     said in a statement that the company's ``full and undivided \n     attention'' is focused on cleaning up the spill and repairing \n     any environmental damage.\n       Spokesman Jonathan Morgan did not immediately confirm \n     exactly when the spill\n\n[[Page S375]]\n\n     began. It also was not clear what caused the pipeline to \n     rupture. Glatt said the company has found the damaged portion \n     of pipeline and it was sent to a laboratory to determine what \n     caused the hole.\n       North Dakota has suffered scores of saltwater spills since \n     the state's oil boom began in earnest in 2006.\n       A network of saltwater pipelines extends to hundreds of \n     disposal wells in the western part of the state, where the \n     briny water is pumped underground for permanent storage. \n     Legislation to mandate flow meters and cutoff switches on \n     saltwater pipelines was overwhelmingly rejected in the \n     Legislature in 2013.\n       Wayde Schafer, a North Dakota spokesman for the Sierra \n     Club, called the brine ``a real toxic mix'' and ``an extreme \n     threat to the environment and people's health.''\n        ``Technology exists to prevent these spills and nothing is \n     being done,'' said Schafer. ``Better pipelines, flow meters, \n     cutoff switches, more inspectors--something has got to be \n     done.''\n       Daryl Peterson, a grain farmer from Mohall who has had \n     spills on his property, said the latest incident underscores \n     the need for tougher regulation and enforcement.\n        ``Until we start holding companies fully accountable with \n     penalties, I don't think we're going to change this whole \n     situation we have in North Dakota,'' said Peterson, a board \n     member of the Northwest Landowners Association.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 24\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska and the \nSenator from Washington for their work on this legislation.\n  I rise today to say a few words about my amendment to the proposed \nKeystone Pipeline bill, an amendment that will be coming up for a vote \nin a few minutes. I wish to thank Senators Bennet, Carper, Leahy, \nMenendez, Murphy, Warren, and Whitehouse for cosponsoring this \namendment.\n  This amendment is extremely simple. It is about 1 page and I will \nread it in a moment. It raises a very profound question as to how we \nimplement public policy, not just on issues related to climate but on \nissues in general. The question is: As we go forward, tackling the very \ndifficult problems facing our country and the world, to whom do we \nlisten? Whose advice do we take as we proceed?\n  I would argue that historically and appropriately, what we do as a \nnation is we listen to the experts. That is what we do. I think in this \ndebate, when we deal with the Keystone Pipeline and when we deal with \nthe issue of climate change, it is absolutely appropriate that we \nlisten to what the overwhelming percentage of scientists are telling \nus.\n  I hear some of my colleagues say, This is complicated and I am not a \nscientist; I don't know. Let me be very frank. I am not a scientist and \nI did not do terribly well in biology and in physics in college, but I \ncan read. And I can listen and understand what the scientific community \nis saying on this issue.\n  As the Senate moves forward, when we deal with complicated medical \nissues and search for solutions in terms of cancer or heart disease or \ndiabetes, to whom do we go? Who do we listen to for advice as to how we \nshould proceed and allocate public funding? We listen to the doctors \nand the scientists and the researchers who know a lot more than \nvirtually all of us do in terms of cancer or heart disease.\n  We spend a lot of money in this country on infrastructure, on roads \nand bridges and wastewater plants and water systems. That is \ncomplicated stuff. To whom do we look for advice? Who do we have at our \nhearings on these issues? We look to the engineers and the scientists \nwho tell us the best way to proceed in terms of how we build roads and \nbridges in a cost-effective way.\n  We are dealing right now with the issue of cyber security--a huge \nissue--a threat to the Nation. To whom do we look for advice? We look \nto those experts in technology who can tell us the best way to prevent \ncyber security attacks against the United States. On and on it goes. \nWhether it is education or whatever it is, good public policy is \ndependent upon listening to the scientific community, listening to the \npeople who know the best about this issue.\n  In terms of the issue of climate change, the fact is that the \nscientific community is virtually unanimous in telling us that climate \nchange is real. It is caused by human activity. It has already caused \ndevastating problems in the United States and around the world. The \nscientific community tells us there is just a brief window of \nopportunity before the United States and the entire planet suffer \nirreparable harm. They tell us it is imperative that the United States \ntransform its energy system away from fossil fuels and toward energy \nefficiency and sustainable energy as rapidly as possible.\n  That is not the opinion of Bernie Sanders; that is the opinion of the \nscientific community.\n  So to those of my colleagues who say, This is complicated stuff, I am \nnot a scientist, I don't know, let me tell my colleagues who does know. \nThirty-seven major American scientific organizations--people who study \nthis issue--do know. And what they say is that climate change is real. \nIt is caused by human activities. It is already causing devastating \nproblems in the United States and around the world, and we need to \ntransform our energy system.\n  That is what the Sanders amendment says. That is all it says. It is a \nmodest amendment. It is a conservative amendment. It simply tells us \nwhat the scientific community has told us year after year after year.\n  For those of us who are not scientists, let me tell my colleagues the \nscientific organizations that hold that point of view. They are, among \nothers, the American Anthropological Association, the American \nAssociation for the Advancement of Science, the American Chemical \nSociety, the American Geophysical Society, the American Institute of \nBiological Sciences, the American Meteorlogical Society, the American \nPhysical Society, the National Academy of Engineering, the National \nAcademy of Sciences--37 separate scientific organizations, including \nthose I mentioned.\n  That is not all. There are 135 international scientific organizations \nthat say the same thing.\n  I refer my colleagues to the list of 135 international scientific \norganizations, 37 American scientific organizations, and 21 medical \nassociations that all agree with the basic premises that are in the \nSanders amendment that is printed with my remarks in yesterday's \nRecord, Wednesday, January 21.\n  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is the leading \ninternational scientific body that deals with climate change. Let me \nquote to my colleagues what they said last fall:\n\n       Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now \n     evident from observations of increases in global average air \n     and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, \n     and rising global average sea level.\n\n  More than 97 percent of the scientific community in the United States \nand across the globe agrees with these findings.\n  I am going to conclude my remarks by simply reading my amendment to \nmake sure every Member of the Senate understands how simple and \nstraightforward and noncontroversial this amendment is. This is what it \nsays:\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that Congress is in agreement \n     with the opinion of virtually the entire worldwide scientific \n     community that\n       (1) climate change is real;\n       (2) climate change is caused by human activities;\n       (3) climate change has already caused devastating problems \n     in the United States and around the world;\n       (4) a brief window of opportunity exists before the United \n     States and the entire planet suffer irreparable harm; and\n       (5) it is imperative that the United States transform its \n     energy system away from fossil fuels and toward energy \n     efficiency and sustainable energy as rapidly as possible.\n\n  That is it. That is the entire amendment. And every provision in this \namendment is supported by virtually the entire scientific community, \nthe people who best understand this issue.\n  Clearly we are a nation divided politically and clearly we are a \nCongress divided politically. We have different views on almost every \nissue. But I hope very much the U.S. Senate does not reject science, \nbecause in doing so, it would not only lead to bad public policy but it \nwould be an embarrassment before the entire world, that the U.S. Senate \nis rejecting what the overwhelming majority of scientists are telling \nus about what they consider to be one of the great crises facing our \nplanet.\n  So I hope very much for strong bipartisan support for this amendment \nin the Senate and will say, as a Senate, that we are going to listen to \nwhat the\n\n[[Page S376]]\n\nscientific community tells us and that we are going to develop public \npolicy based on their knowledge and that information.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n\n\n                           State of the Union\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I had some concluding thoughts about the \nPresident's State of the Union speech on Tuesday night. Much of it we \nhave heard before. In fact, what the President laid out was largely \nwhat his agenda has been for the last 6 years. In other words, we have \nbeen there and we have done that, and it hasn't worked very well. We \nhave had tired big government proposals. In fact, the President seems \nas though he has doubled down in a lot of ways on higher taxes, more \nredistribution, and more regulations that are out of step with what the \nAmerican people, I believe, want and need.\n  I think what they want more than anything else, from a strictly \neconomic point of view, is to get the economy growing again. Let's \ncreate jobs. Let the private sector actually create jobs--not \ngovernment. We know government is pretty incompetent when it comes to \njob creation. And we now have this nagging little minor detail called \nthe national debt where we keep borrowing money and pushing that down \nthe road to the next generation and beyond.\n  It is ironic in a lot of ways because the President came to the \npeople's House to give his State of the Union speech, which is the \nHouse of Representatives, but his speech was anything but for the \npeople. He claimed that really his focus was on middle-class economics. \nI think he had been listening to the senior Senator from New York who, \nafter this last election, gave a speech at the National Press Club and \nsaid that Democrats had made a terrible mistake leading off with the \nPresident's new term in 2009 with ObamaCare and other big government \nprograms and they had neglected stagnant wages and the middle class. So \nI think the President, in a tipping of his hat to Senator Schumer and \nhis comments post election, has essentially acknowledged that his first \n6 years have failed to address the needs of the middle class. That is \nwhy he kept using the phrase ``middle-class economics'' during his \nspeech. But it wasn't really about the middle class. It wasn't about \nhard-working American taxpayers. Time and again, it seemed his most \nurgent priority was himself. His speech was really about him and his \nagenda, his pet projects, his vision for bigger government.\n\n  I would just point out that the President quite candidly admitted it \nwas his agenda and his policies that were on the ballot on November 4. \nI think that sent a shudder through every incumbent who was running for \nreelection who happened to have voted for his big government agenda. \nBut the point is that it was soundly rejected on November 4. You \ncouldn't tell that from the President's tone and his cheerleading last \nTuesday night. But my point is we have been there, we have done that, \nand it didn't work. So let's try something different.\n  We have felt the experience of this experiment in big government for \nthe last 6 years. If anything, what the voters said on November 4 is \nenough is enough. I can't remember who originally said it, but someone \nsaid famously that the definition of insanity is trying the same thing \nover and over and expecting different results. You can't try the same \nold tired policies over and over and actually expect a different \noutcome. At least to my mind, reality wasn't what was driving the \nPresident's remarks. If it was, he would have focused on the biggest \nconcerns Americans have right now. I mentioned jobs, stagnant wages, \nrising costs, and issues such as health care costs.\n  Unfortunately, ObamaCare really backfired on a lot of middle-class \nworkers, and it actually raised their health care costs rather than \nlowered them. Then there are the stagnant wages I mentioned a moment \nago. But if he really cared about those issues as he should and as we \ndo, he would be working with Congress to address those issues, and he \nwould have given some attention to one of the first major pieces of \nlegislation that we have taken up in the 114th Congress on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  Of course I am referring to the Keystone XL Pipeline that we are \ndebating now, where 11 Democrats joined all of the Republicans who are \npresent to proceed to this bill. So when I say it is bipartisan, I am \nnot just saying it. It actually is.\n  Sometimes you can tell a lot from what a person doesn't say. In this \ncase, the President spoke more than 6,000 words, and he didn't mention \nthe word Keystone in one of them. Instead of using this opportunity \nwhen millions of Americans and people around the world were listening \nto the President to lay out sound reasons why he continues to oppose \nthis jobs and infrastructure project year after year, the President \nmerely said we should look beyond a single pipeline to meet America's \ninfrastructure needs. We need to start somewhere, and the President \nwon't even start by taking the first step of approving this \ninfrastructure and job-creating project known as the Keystone XL \nPipeline.\n  I think there is a Chinese proverb that says a trip of a thousand \nmiles has to start with the first step. That is true here as well. It \nmay be a single pipeline, but it is a single pipeline that his own \nState Department has said has the potential to support more than 40,000 \njobs.\n  Here is what I don't get. There are 2.5 million miles of oil and gas \npipelines in America today--2.5 million. What is this fixation with \nthis roughly thousand-mile pipeline that comes from Canada down to \nsoutheast Texas where it is refined, turned into gasoline, and other \nrefined products? Why has this become such a political football?\n  It is because the President and, unfortunately, some of his own party \nwho are wed to a political base that won't allow them to do the \nrational, realistic, practical thing, which would be to approve this \npipeline. The President tried to minimize this.\n  We have heard people say these are temporary jobs. My job here is \ntemporary. The President's job is temporary. It is going to run out in \na couple of years. Every job is temporary in that sense. To try to \ndenigrate these well-paying construction jobs from welders and others--\npeople who make $125,000, $140,000 a year in my State--and to denigrate \nthem, to minimize them, and to say it is just a temporary job and is \nreally not all that important is a slap in the face to the people who \nare hungry to find work, people who are working part time who want to \nwork full time, people who are working for minimum wage but want to \nimprove their standard of living and their ability to provide for their \nfamily.\n  Then there is this. We need to remember the percentage of Americans \nparticipating in the workforce is at a 30-year low--a 30-year low. What \nthat means to me is that some people just simply have given up looking \nfor work, and so they have dropped out. They have retired. They have \ngone on to do other things. But it is a symptom of a disease in our \neconomy. It is not something we should be proud of. If we are actually \ninterested in getting more Americans back in the workforce, the \nPresident would approve this pipeline.\n\n  Let me tell you about one person with whom I met last Friday in \nBeaumont, TX. We call it the golden triangle. It is a place where \nrefineries are seemingly almost everywhere. It is a blue-collar \ncommunity but one that is proud and contributes a lot to the Texas \neconomy. I was in Beaumont, as I said, and we were there to mark the 1-\nyear anniversary of the southern leg of the Keystone XL Pipeline's \ncoming online. This is a little confusing. But this is the portion of \npipeline that is already in place, and it doesn't require a transit \nwith Presidential approval to cross from Canada into the United States.\n  Believe it or not, there are already 4,800 jobs that have been \ncreated and an average of 400,000 barrels of Canadian crude pumped into \nsoutheast Texas already. We are not talking about doing something that \nis new. We are talking about adding to what already exists by \ncompletion of this pipeline.\n  My point is this. If the President wants to see what the potential \neconomic impact and the impact on jobs and on the standard of living \nwould be for the entire Keystone XL Pipeline, all he needs to do is to \nlook to southeast Texas--to Beaumont, TX--where\n\n[[Page S377]]\n\nthe impact has been nothing but positive.\n  I met with the mayor of Beaumont, the county judge, other local \nbusinesses, officials, and stakeholders. The mayor and the county judge \npointed out that it is the taxes they get from the economic activity \ncaused by this pipeline--which exists and which would do nothing but be \nenhanced by the Keystone XL Pipeline--that helps pay the taxes that \npave roads, provide health care to people who don't have access to it--\nwho can't afford health care. It provides to pay the law enforcement. \nIt provides all of the governmental functions, including education. \nThis is what adds to the tax base which allows local governments, \nincluding school districts, to provide for the education of our \nchildren.\n  Then there is this. There is the multiplier effect of the investment \nby the private investment on this pipeline. It is the multiplier effect \nbecause people who earn these good wages spend the money at \nrestaurants, buy homes, rent apartments. They buy things at retail \noutlets. That is the multiplier effect from this pipeline.\n  One person in particular I want to close with is a gentleman I met by \nthe name of Kenneth Edwards who is a vice president with the United \nAssociation, the union of plumbers, fitters, welders, and service \ntechs. I think Mr. Edwards would agree with me that we wouldn't \nnecessarily see eye to eye on everything. But after being married 35 \nyears, I don't know many married couples that agree on everything. So \nthat is not all that unusual. It isn't a surprise that Republicans and \nunions haven't been on the same page on every issue. But there is an \nissue where we agree 100 percent, and that is the need for the \nPresident to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline after 6 long years.\n  Mr. Edwards speaks on behalf of many union workers nationwide who, as \nhe put it, earn their living from a series of temporary jobs that \nhappen to add up to a lifelong career. He told me last week he wants \nthe President to put his famous veto pen away, to take out his approval \npen, and to sign his approval of this project right away.\n  Speaking of temporary jobs, the President is ending his time in \noffice. He has 2 more years left. His State of the Union Address leads \nme to believe he is not open to changing course and making much of a \ndeparture from the partisanship and gridlock that marked his first term \nand a half. But there is still time to change his mind.\n  With the Keystone XL Pipeline bill that a bipartisan majority of \nCongress will soon send his way, we are presenting him an opportunity \nto say that he heard the message that voters delivered on November 4. I \nheard the American people say we are tired of the dysfunction in \nWashington, DC. We actually want to see Congress and the White House \nwork together to get things done on behalf of the American people.\n  It is not too late. I hope he will listen not only to people such as \nKenneth Edwards and union workers across the country but to the vast \nmajority of Americans who support this important project.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer).\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, for the information of all Senators, \nwe are working now to set up votes on several pending amendments to the \nbill. These votes should be after lunch today. Right now, we are \nlooking at 60-vote thresholds on the Fischer amendment, along with the \nBoxer side-by-side, the Sanders amendment, and the Lee amendment.\n  I do understand that the Boxer amendment is now filed at the desk.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 18, As Modified\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Fischer amendment, No. 18, be \nmodified with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. LIMITATION ON DESIGNATION OF NEW FEDERALLY PROTECTED \n                   LAND.\n\n       (a) Definition of Federally Protected Land.--In this \n     section, the term ``federally protected land'' means any area \n     designated or acquired by the Secretary of the Interior for \n     the purpose of conserving historic, cultural, environmental, \n     scenic, recreational, developmental, or biological resources.\n       (b) Considerations.--The Secretary, prior to the \n     designation or acquisition of new federally protected land, \n     shall consider--\n       (1) whether the addition of the new federally protected \n     land would have a negative impact on the administration of \n     existing federally protected land; and\n       (2) whether sufficient resources are available to \n     effectively implement management plans for existing units of \n     federally protected land.\n       (c) This section shall not apply to\n       (1) congressionally designated federally protected land, or\n       (2) acquisitions of federally protected land authorized by \n     Congress.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, we have a number of Members who have \nasked to come to the floor to speak over the course of these next \ncouple of hours. Many will be speaking to their specific amendment on \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline. Again, we encourage folks to use this time, \nwhile we have a little bit of time before we move to the votes this \nafternoon.\n  I see that my colleague from North Carolina is here to speak. I would \nwelcome his remarks at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. TILLIS. Madam President, long before I was actually sworn into \nthe Senate, I traveled across the State of North Carolina. I promised \nthe citizens of North Carolina that I would work toward commonsense \nsolutions to provide opportunities for economic growth and opportunity.\n  Today I hope to send forth amendment No. 102 with the support of my \ngood friend Senator Burr from North Carolina on the approval of the \nKeystone Pipeline, to take a look at things that we can do to do our \npart in North Carolina to contribute to the ultimate goal of energy \nindependence in this Nation.\n  The amendment, the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf Access and \nRevenue Share Act of 2015, will expand domestic offshore production, \nnatural gas exploration and production, which, in turn, will create \njobs and set our Nation on that track to energy independence.\n  Families across the country are too familiar with the impact energy \nprices play in our day-to-day lives, making decisions that are very \ndifficult for them in these difficult economic situations.\n  When utility bills and gas prices increase, hard-working Americans \nface hardship and struggle to make ends meet. We need to make that \neasier and lift the burden on those hard-working taxpayers.\n  We also cannot underestimate the great impact energy plays in \nAmerica's foreign policy decisions. We are in many ways dependent on \noil from the Middle Eastern States that do not share our democratic \nvalues.\n  The predicament does not certainly place America in a position of \nstrength. America has more energy potential than any other nation. It \nis time that we start realizing its full potential.\n  What the amendment does is fairly straightforward. It instructs the \nSecretary of the Interior to finalize the 5-year program for 2017 to \n2022. That includes annual lease sales in both the Mid-Atlantic Outer \nContinental Shelf and the South Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf \nregion. It grants to States in both of these regions a 37.5-percent \nshare of all revenues collected from the Outer Continental Shelf \nleasing activities.\n  Each State in the region gets a minimum of a 10-percent share of that \nallocation. It directs 12.5 percent of the revenues collected for the \nAtlantic Outer Continental Shelf activities to the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. The 37.5 percent for the States and the 12.5 percent \nfor other regions\n\n[[Page S378]]\n\nmirrors the revenue split given to the Gulf Coast States--Texas, \nLouisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama--under current law.\n  North Carolina has received approximately $209 million in funding \nover the past 5 decades, protecting places such as the Cape Lookout \nNational Seashore, the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, \nPisgah and Nantahala National Forests. The Department of Interior is \ncurrently developing a 5-year leasing program for 2017 to 2022. The \nlanguage of the amendment merely instructs the Department to include \nthe Mid-Atlantic and the South Atlantic regions as part of that plan.\n  Current law requires that the Department of Interior give deference \nto the preferences of States when developing a leasing plan for areas \nwithin 50 miles of the shore. Keep in mind, the drilling that we are \ntalking about in North Carolina, off our coast, is greater than 30 \nmiles off the coast, far beyond the site horizon of our beautiful \nbeaches in North Carolina.\n  I want to close by saying why we are moving this amendment now. \nFirst, it is the fulfillment of a promise I made to the citizens of \nNorth Carolina. It also does enormous progress for creating jobs and \nhelping our economy get back on track in the State and the region.\n  It is estimated that more than 55,000 jobs can be created by 2035; \nmore than $4 billion annually in economic contributions to the State of \nNorth Carolina. Almost $4 billion in government revenue for the State \nof North Carolina--$4 billion. As someone who served as Speaker of the \nHouse of North Carolina, I cannot tell you what an enormous impact that \nwill have in terms of reducing the burden on taxpayers and businesses \nin North Carolina, creating more opportunities for economic expansion \nand job growth. There will be up to $577 million annually in revenue \nshare payments according to a report published by the Southeast Energy \nAlliance in 2009.\n  These numbers increase opportunities in North Carolina unlike \nanything I saw in my 8 years in the State legislature. It is an \nopportunity for North Carolina to do its part to make the Nation energy \nindependent and to help me fulfill my promises to the citizens of North \nCarolina, which is to create jobs and provide great opportunities for \nthis generation and future generations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I come to the floor today to discuss an \namendment that I filed to the pending legislation. It is an amendment \nto modify the Jones Act. The Jones Act is an archaic 1920s-era law that \nhinders free trade, stifles the economy, and hurts consumers, largely \nfor the benefit of labor unions.\n  Specifically, this amendment would effectively repeal a law that \nprevents U.S. shippers from purchasing or otherwise supportively \nprocuring the services of vessels that are built outside the United \nStates for use in American waters. From time to time here in Congress, \nwe find that legislation still remains on the books many decades after \nit has served its original stated purpose. If ever we had one, I think \none of the best examples of this is a law called the Jones Act.\n  As many of you know, the Jones Act is simply a continuation of laws \npassed through U.S. history addressing cabotage--or port-to-port \ncoastal shipping. Those laws have been used to protect U.S. domestic \nshipping dating back to the very first session of Congress.\n  The Jones Act may have had some rationale back in the 1920s when it \nwas enacted, but today it serves only to raise shipping costs, making \nU.S. farmers and businesses less competitive in the global marketplace \nand increasing costs for American consumers.\n  According to the 2002 U.S. International Trade Commission economic \nstudy--by the way, the U.S. International Trade Commission is not a \ngroup of special interests, they are an international trade commission \nwhich is appointed to study issues affecting international trade, \nobviously, as the name implies.\n  Their study reached the conclusion that repealing the Jones Act would \nlower shipping costs by about 22 percent. The Commission also found \nthat repealing the Jones Act would have an annual positive welfare \neffect of $656 million on the U.S. economy.\n  Since these decade-old studies are the most recent statistics \navailable, imagine the impact the Jones Act repeal would have today--\nfar more than a $656 million annual positive impact--likely closer to \n$1 billion, stimulating our economy in the midst of an anemic recovery.\n  The requirement that U.S. shippers must purchase vessels in the \nUnited States comes at a tremendous cost that is passed on to U.S. \nconsumers. For example, just recently the U.S. container line Matson \nplaced a $418 million order for two 3,600 20-foot equivalent unit \ncontainer ships in a U.S. shipyard. The high price of $209 million per \nvessel reflects that the ships will be carrying goods within the United \nStates and therefore governed by the protectionist Jones Act.\n  The fact is that Matson's order at $209 million per ship is more than \nfive times more expensive than if those same ships were procured \noutside of the United States. Ships of that size built outside the \nUnited States would cost closer to $40 million each. For comparison, \neven Maersk Line's far larger ships cost millions less at an average of \n$185 million each.\n  The U.S. Maritime Administration, MARAD, has found that the cost to \noperate U.S. flag vessels at $22,000 per day is about 2.7 times higher \nthan foreign flag vessels--just $6,000 a day.\n  There is no doubt that these inflated costs are eventually passed on \nto shipping customers. In the energy sector, for example, the price for \nmoving crude oil from the gulf coast to the Northeastern United States \non Jones Act tankers is $5 to $6 more per barrel, while moving it to \neastern Canada on foreign flag tankers is about $2.\n  That can mean an additional $1 million per tanker in shipping costs \nfor oil producers.\n  This increased cost is why, according to the Congressional Research \nService, more than twice as much gulf coast crude oil was shipped by \nwater to Canada as shipped to Northeastern U.S. refineries last year--\nall in an effort to avoid paying Jones Act shipping rates.\n  The implications of this fact touches just about every American who \nbuys gasoline. It is American consumers who pay exorbitantly higher \nprices because of a law that protects the shipbuilding industry and \ndomestically manufactured ships that transport crude and other refined \nproducts.\n  But it is not only the energy sector that deals with the distorted \neffects of the Jones Act. Cattlemen in Hawaii who want to bring their \ncattle to the U.S. mainland market, for example, have actually resorted \nto flying the cattle on 747 jumbo jets to work around the restrictions \nof the Jones Act. Their only alternative is to ship the cattle to \nCanada because all livestock carriers in the world are foreign owned.\n\n  I am deeply concerned about the impact of any barrier to free trade. \nI believe the U.S. trade barriers invite other countries to put up or \nretain their own barriers and that at the end of the day the U.S. \nconsumer and the economy at large pays the price.\n  Throughout my career I have always been a strong supporter of free \ntrade. Opening markets to the free flow of goods and services benefits \nAmerica and benefits our trading partners. Trade liberalization creates \njobs, expands economic growth, and provides consumers with access to \nlower cost goods and services.\n  Yet as clear as the benefits of free trade are, actually taking \naction to remove trade barriers and open markets can be almost \nimpossible in Congress. Special interests that have long and richly \nbenefited from protectionism flex their muscles and issue doomsday \nwarnings about the consequences of moving forward on free trade. \nJudging from the hysterical reaction by some of the special interests \nto my simple filing of this amendment, the debate over the Jones Act \nwill be no different.\n  The domestic shipbuilding requirement of the Jones Act is outdated \nand should be abolished.\n  U.S. consumers are free to buy a foreign-built car. U.S. trucking \ncompanies are free to buy a foreign-built truck. U.S. railroads are \nfree to buy a foreign-built locomotive. U.S. airlines are free to buy a \nforeign-built airplane.\n  Why can't U.S. maritime special interests more affordably ship \nforeign goods on foreign-made vessels? Why do U.S. consumers, \nparticularly those in\n\n[[Page S379]]\n\nHawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico, need to pay for ships that are five \ntimes more expensive?\n  If there was a law that long ago outlived its usefulness--if it ever \nhad any--it is the Jones Act. On the Jones Act, it is time to change \ncourse today.\n  I have a letter from the American Farm Bureau Federation which \nstates:\n\n       Farm Bureau believes that there should be no restrictions \n     as to the quantities or vessels on which a commodity is \n     shipped between U.S. ports. Repealing The Jones Act would \n     allow more competition for the movement of goods between U.S. \n     ports, thus driving down transportation costs.\n\n  Continuing to read from the letter ``TO ALL MEMBERS OF SENATE'' from \nthe Farm Bureau:\n\n       Repeal of The Jones Act accomplishes the same purpose: a \n     reduction in energy costs, increased competition to lower \n     costs of U.S. goods and more opportunities to transport \n     agricultural commodities at competitive prices.\n       Due to this importance, Farm Bureau policy, developed by \n     our grassroots members consisting of working farmers and \n     ranchers, explicitly supports the repeal of The Jones Act. \n     Farm Bureau urges you to vote in support of Sen. McCain's \n     amendment repealing sections of the Merchant Marine Act of \n     1920.\n\n  Then there is an article: ``McCain under fire.''\n\n       A growing number of politicians are taking aim at a \n     prominent US Senator's crusade against the Jones Act . . . .\n\n  Oh my God. I am deeply concerned. All the special interests on this \nissue are weighing in. By the way, one of them would have effects on \nthe U.S. shipbuilding and repair base. We all know the U.S. \nshipbuilding industry, because of the Jones Act, is moribund. In fact, \nI have an article from the Daily Signal which says: ``Shipbuilding \nindustry stuck on ground.''\n\n       U.S. shipbuilding exports are tiny compared to exports of \n     semis and trailers. Shipbuilding is subject to the \n     protectionist Jones Act which hinders competition, while the \n     semi industry is not.\n       According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, \n     ``The coastwise laws [like the Jones Act] are highly \n     protectionist `provisions that are intended to create a \n     `coastwise monopoly' in order to protect and develop the \n     American merchant marine, shipbuilding, etc.''\n       But protecting U.S. industries from competition may \n     actually have the opposite effect. Consider U.S. production \n     of vessels designed to transport goods via water compared to \n     U.S. production of semi-trailer trucks and trailers designed \n     to transport goods via land. In 2013, U.S. manufacturers \n     exported $4.1 billion in semi-trailer trucks and trailers, \n     but they exported just $0.1 billion in commercial ships.\n       Americans in most states would benefit from the freedom to \n     ship goods on the best-built, most affordable vessels, \n     wherever they are made. The Alaska governor is actually \n     required to ``use best efforts and all appropriate means to \n     persuade the United States Congress to repeal those \n     provisions of the Jones Act formally codified at 46 U.S.C. \n     861, et seq.''\n       The Jones Act drives up the price of gas, hinders U.S. \n     infrastructure improvements, inflicts high costs on people in \n     Hawaii and Puerto Rico, and makes it difficult to transship \n     goods between U.S. ports.\n\n  The facts are clear. What we have is an old-time 1920s law that may \nhave been, I emphasize the word ``may,'' have had some utility in the \npast.\n  I am aware that all of the special interests have been mobilized and \nhow this can be damaging, frankly, to certain special interests. It \nwould not be damaging to the average citizen who would pay less for the \ngoods that are transported much more cheaply as a result of the Jones \nAct repeal.\n  I say to those critics of this amendment, as has been my habit over \nthe years, I will not quit on this issue. There will be other \nopportunities to put the Senate and Congress on record.\n  Sooner or later the Farm Bureau will be heard. Sooner or later the \npeople of Hawaii and Puerto Rico who are paying exorbitant prices that \nthey shouldn't have to pay will be heard. Sooner or later this \nprotectionist--an anachronism--ancient protectionist act will be \nrepealed and average American consumers will benefit from it and \nunfortunately the special interests will not.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the January 20, \n2015, Farm Bureau letter, the Heritage Foundation piece called the \nDaily Signal, entitled ``Senator McCain's Jones Act Amendment: Good for \nAmerica,'' and another article: ``If You Like Higher Prices, Enriched \nCronies, And Weak National Security, Then You'll Love The Jones Act.'' \nIt is one of my favorite pieces.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              American Farm Bureau Federation,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 20, 2015.\n     To All Members of Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear: The Senate will soon begin consideration of \n     amendments to S. 1, the Keystone XL Pipeline Act. On behalf \n     of the American Farm Bureau Federation, the nation's largest \n     general farm organization, I am writing to convey our strong \n     support for adoption of an amendment by Sen. John McCain that \n     would repeal provisions of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, \n     known as The Jones Act. The Jones Act mandates that any goods \n     shipped by water between two points in the United States or \n     its territories must be transported by a vessel that is U.S. \n     built, U.S. flagged, and at least 75 percent U.S. crewed.\n       Given the ability of ships to move large amounts of cargo, \n     and the bulk nature of most agriculture commodities, shipping \n     via water is a strategic and economic resource that should \n     not be limited by antiquated provisions of U.S. law. Farm \n     Bureau believes that there should be no restrictions as to \n     the quantities or vessels on which a commodity is shipped \n     between U.S. ports. Repealing The Jones Act would allow more \n     competition for the movement of goods between U.S. ports, \n     thus driving down transportation costs.\n       Farm Bureau supports the construction of pipelines in \n     general and the Keystone XL pipeline in particular. We \n     support projects of this nature for their ability to decrease \n     energy and input costs, lower prices for consumers and \n     diversify our transportation infrastructure. Repeal of The \n     Jones Act accomplishes the same purpose: a reduction in \n     energy costs, increased competition to lower costs of U.S. \n     goods and more opportunities to transport agricultural \n     commodities at competitive prices.\n       Due to this importance, Farm Bureau policy, developed by \n     our grassroots members consisting of working farmers and \n     ranchers, explicitly supports the repeal of The Jones Act. \n     Farm Bureau urges you to vote in support of Sen. McCain's \n     amendment repealing sections of the Merchant Marine Act of \n     1920.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bob Stallman,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Daily Signal, Jan. 16, 2015]\n\n         Senator McCain's Jones Act Amendment: Good for America\n\n                  (By Bryan Riley and Brian Slattery)\n\n       Senator John McCain (R-AZ) recently introduced an amendment \n     to repeal harmful aspects of the Jones Act, a 1920 law that \n     restricts the use of foreign-built or foreign-owned ships for \n     transporting goods within the United States.\n       According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, \n     ``The coastwise laws [like the Jones Act] are highly \n     protectionist provisions that are intended to create a \n     `coastwise monopoly' in order to protect and develop the \n     American merchant marine, shipbuilding, etc.''\n       But protecting U.S. industries from competition may \n     actually have the opposite effect.\n       Consider U.S. production of vessels designed to transport \n     goods via water compared to U.S. production of semi-trailer \n     trucks and trailers designed to transport goods via land. In \n     2013, U.S. manufacturers exported $4.1 billion in semi-\n     trailer trucks and trailers, but they exported just $0.1 \n     billion in commercial ships.\n       U.S. commercial shipbuilding accounts for just 21.7 percent \n     of total shipbuilding. Most of the industry produces vessels \n     for the military and will continue to do so with or without \n     the Jones Act. The notion that U.S. defense needs require a \n     ban on the use of foreign-built ships for commercial purposes \n     (but not foreign-built aircraft or foreign-built cars and \n     trucks) seems bizarre. In fact, by artificially inflating \n     prices, protectionist measures such as the Jones Act may have \n     given foreign competitors a competitive edge in international \n     shipping.\n       The Persian Gulf conflict in the early 1990s proved that \n     the Jones Act was not a necessary element in supplying and \n     sustaining a military operation. For example, during the \n     Persian Gulf War, Military Sealift Command shipped millions \n     of tons of cargo to the operation. Of the 191 chartered dry \n     cargo ships involved in this operation, 162 (or 85 percent) \n     were foreign-flagged.\n       Additionally, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) has \n     frequently leased foreign vessels to execute missions that \n     required additional sealift capacity. This further obviates \n     the need for the Jones Act. One could argue that such long-\n     term leasing agreements are not cost-effective, but if that \n     is the case then the military should purchase such vessels \n     outright. The Jones Act doesn't solve this issue.\n       Americans in most states would benefit from the freedom to \n     ship goods on the best-built, most affordable vessels, \n     wherever they are made. The Alaska governor is actually \n     required to ``use best efforts and all appropriate means to \n     persuade the United States Congress to repeal those \n     provisions of the Jones Act formerly codified at 46 U.S.C. \n     861, et seq.''\n       The Jones Act drives up the price of gas, hinders U.S. \n     infrastructure improvements, inflicts high costs on people in \n     Hawaii and Puerto Rico, and makes it difficult to transship \n     goods between U.S. ports.

John McCain has offered an \n     amendment to repeal the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, also \n     known as the Jones Act, which requires, among other things, \n     that all goods shipped between U.S. ports be transported by \n     American-built, owned, flagged, and crewed vessels.\n       By restricting the supply of qualified interstate ships and \n     crews, this protectionist 94-year-old law has dramatically \n     inflated the cost of shipping goods, particularly essentials \n     like food and energy, between U.S. ports--costs ultimately \n     born by U.S. consumers. Thus, the Jones Act is a subsidy \n     American businesses and families pay to the powerful, well-\n     connected U.S. shipping industry and a few related unions. \n     For this reason alone, the law should die, but it turns out \n     that the Jones Act also harms the very industry it's designed \n     to protect and, in the process, U.S. national security.\n\n\n          The Jones Act Inflates Shipping Costs for Americans\n\n       There is no question that the Jones Act inflates U.S. \n     shipping costs. A 2011 Maritime Administration (MARAD) \n     report, with input from the U.S. maritime industry, compared \n     the costs of U.S.-flagged versus foreign cargo carriers, and \n     found that the former far outweighed the latter due to the \n     Jones Act and other U.S. Carriers noted that the U.S.-flag \n     fleet experiences higher operating costs than foreign-flag \n     vessels due to regulatory requirements on vessel labor, \n     insurance and liability costs, maintenance and repair costs, \n     taxes and costs associated with compliance with environmental \n     law . . . [T]he operating cost differential between U.S.-flag \n     vessels and foreign flag vessels has increased over the past \n     five years, further reducing the capacity of the U.S.-flag \n     fleet to compete with foreign-flag vessels for commercial \n     car-\n     go . . .\n       Higher costs are precisely what you'd expect from an \n     industry that has a ``coastwise monopoly'' on shipping, due \n     almost entirely to the Jones Act. As a result, U.S. vessel \n     operating costs are 2.7 times more expensive than their \n     foreign counterparts.\n       Domestic unions and shipbuilders, with a bipartisan \n     coalition of their congressional benefactors, vehemently deny \n     that these outrageous shipping costs differences have any \n     effect on the ultimate cost of U.S. goods that are \n     transported on Jones Act vessels, but several examples belie \n     such claims (and prove that, once again, basic economics \n     still works).\n       First, there is ample evidence that the Jones Act distorts \n     the U.S. energy market and raises domestic gasoline prices. \n     As I noted last year:\n       According to Bloomberg, there are only 13 ships that can \n     legally move oil between U.S. ports, and these ships are \n     `booked solid.' As a result, abundant oil supplies in the \n     Gulf Coast region cannot be shipped to other U.S. states with \n     spare refinery capacity. And, even when such vessels are \n     available, the Jones Act makes intrastate crude shipping \n     artificially expensive. According to a 2012 report by the \n     Financial Times, shipping U.S. crude from Texas to \n     Philadelphia cost more than three times as much as shipping \n     the same product on a foreign-flagged vessel to a Canadian \n     refinery, even though the latter route is longer.\n       It doesn't take an energy economist to see how the Jones \n     Act's byzantine protectionism leads to higher prices at the \n     pump for American drivers. According to one recent estimate, \n     revoking the Jones Act would reduce U.S. gasoline prices by \n     as much as 15 cents per gallon `by increasing the supply of \n     ships able to shuttle the fuel between U.S. ports.'\n       For these and other reasons, the Heritage Foundation just \n     recently called for the complete repeal of the Jones Act as \n     part of its new energy policy agenda.\n       Second, the Jones Act has particularly deleterious effects \n     on water-bound U.S. markets like Puerto Rico, Alaska, and \n     Hawaii. A 2012 report by the New York Fed highlighted the \n     issue for Puerto Rico:\n       Available data show that shipping is more costly to Puerto \n     Rico than to regional peers and that Puerto Rican ports have \n     lagged other regional ports in activity in recent years. \n     While causality from the Jones Act has not been established, \n     it stands to reason that the act is an important contributor \n     insofar as it reduces competition (shipments between the \n     Island and the U.S. mainland are handled by just four \n     carriers). It costs an estimated $3,063 to ship a twenty-foot \n     container of household and commercial goods from the East \n     Coast of the United States to Puerto Rico; the same shipment \n     costs $1,504 to nearby Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic) and \n     $1,687 to Kingston (Jamaica)--destinations that are not \n     subject to Jones Act restrictions . . . Furthermore, over the \n     past decade, the port of Kingston in Jamaica has overtaken \n     the port of San Juan in total container volume, despite the \n     fact that Puerto Rico's population is roughly a third larger \n     and its economy more than triple the size of Jamaica's. The \n     trends are stark: between 2000 and 2010, the volume of \n     twenty-foot containers more than doubled in Jamaica, while it \n     fell more than 20 percent in Puerto Rico.\n       A 1988 study by the U.S. Government Accountability Office \n     found similar harms for Alaska and the U.S. economy. Thus, \n     the idea that the Jones Act doesn't line the pockets of a few \n     U.S. companies and unions at the expense of American families \n     and businesses simply defies reality.\n\n\n                  Regulating Industries Cuts Them Down\n\n       Supporters of the Jones Act often rebut these economic \n     criticisms by explaining that the law is absolutely essential \n     for U.S. national security, but these claims also fail the \n     smell test. Consider first the enervation of the U.S. \n     shipping industry itself. The above-referenced MARAD report \n     shows a U.S. industry that has declined nearly to the point \n     of extinction under the weight of the Jones Act and other \n     regulations--a shameful outcome when you consider the history \n     and importance of the U.S. Merchant Marine, which is a \n     component not just of the United States economy, but also our \n     national defense. Mariners in World War II faced the highest \n     casualty rate of any other service: 1 in 26 men went to their \n     deaths on the sea. In 1950, ships waving the United States \n     flag comprised 43 percent of the global shipping trade. Yet \n     by 2009 the U.S. fleet had withered to 1 percent of the \n     global fleet--while global demand for international shipping \n     surged.\n       As of 2010, the picture was clear: there were 110 U.S.-\n     flagged ships engaged in foreign commerce. Sixty in of these \n     ships were part of the Maritime Security Program. Notably, as \n     of 2012 these ships receive a subsidy (naturally) to the tune \n     of $3.1 million per ship, per year, to offset their higher \n     costs. Compare this to the 540 ships owned by American \n     interests which flew a ``flag of convenience''--typically \n     that of the Marshall Islands, Singapore, or Liberia. Why such \n     a dramatic difference?\n       While it is certainly not the only factor at play, this \n     precipitous decline in the U.S. fleet's standing is due in no \n     small part to burdensome regulations which make American \n     ships more costly and less competitive. The Jones Act \n     requires ships engaged in the U.S. trade to be built in the \n     country, but building a ship in the United States is \n     exorbitantly expensive--three times the cost of a new ship \n     built in Japan or South Korea. In nearly all cases it is far \n     less burdensome to purchase an existing ship and reflag it \n     rather than build new. And these burdens are before factoring \n     the requirement to crew these ships with U.S. mariners, union \n     men who unsurprisingly average more than five times the \n     expense of a foreign crew. Indeed, the MARAD report \n     identified labor costs as the single largest driver of the \n     difference between U.S. and foreign carrier costs.\n       The Jones Act isn't the only harmful regulation, not by a \n     mile. One of the unfortunate realities of operating a massive \n     ocean-going vessel full of complex machinery is that things \n     inevitably require maintenance. These inconveniences often \n     arise overseas and necessitate repairs in foreign countries. \n     Lest you worry the government would be left with beak \n     unwetted in this instance, fear not: 19 USC Sec. 1466 to the \n     rescue (link included if you're having trouble falling \n     asleep). This outgrowth of the Tariff Act of 1930 requires \n     the master, or owner of a vessel, upon the ship's return to a \n     United States port, to declare to U.S. Customs any parts and \n     services received onboard while in foreign waters. The ship \n     owner is then required to pay an ad valorem duty of 50 \n     percent on the dutiable vessel repair costs.\n       A few exceptions written into the law help mitigate this \n     figure, at the further cost of man hours or maritime attorney \n     fees. Free trade agreements between the United States and \n     nations like Oman, South Korea, Singapore, and others help to \n     alleviate these costs by allowing for almost total remission \n     of duty for work performed in those countries. However, it's \n     hardly practical for U.S.-flagged vessels to perform the \n     entirety of their maintenance in these countries when stays \n     in port can be measured in hours. Vessel repair duties are \n     situated to remain a significant, punitive cost of doing \n     business as a U.S. cargo vessel. Even with this 50 percent \n     duty, in the majority of cases it is still less expensive to \n     make the repairs overseas and pay up rather than to perform \n     the work in the United States. This also holds true for the \n     acquisition of new ships.\n       Thus, under the Jones Act, shipping prices (as well as \n     those for the goods shipped) rise and the U.S. fleet \n     degrades. (For more on how the Jones Act imperils U.S. \n     maritime security, see this helpful Heritage Foundation \n     report.) It's quite the double-whammy, and precisely what \n     you'd expect from a protectionist law that thwarts the \n     benefits of foreign competition. In short, the Jones Act has \n     turned the U.S. merchant marine into a fleet of Ford Pintos \n     and Chrysler K-Cars, all in desperate need of the kind of \n     motivation only free market competition can bring.\n\n\n            To Top It Off, the Jones Act Worsens Emergencies\n\n       Moreover, the Act has proven to be a significant and costly \n     obstacle in times of real emergency. Most recently, the deep \n     freeze of 2014 saw New Jersey exhaust its supply of road \n     salt, imperiling the lives of local travelers. Such salt was \n     available in Maine, but it was delayed for days because of \n     the requirement that only U.S. ships could engage\n\n[[Page S381]]\n\n     in coastwise trade to carry the shipment--even though an \n     empty foreign ship was available and headed to Newark. The \n     government denied a request to waive the Jones Act and use \n     the foreign ship to supply the much-needed road salt. By the \n     time a Jones Act barge was found to carry the salt, the cost \n     of the operation had grown by $700,000. Sorry about those icy \n     roads, New Jersey, but the shipping industry and unions gotta \n     get paid.\n       During the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the government \n     similarly refused to issue Jones Act waivers so foreign \n     vessels could aid in the cleanup and containment. Despite \n     several offers for foreign assistance during an ongoing \n     ecological disaster, the government cited the Jones Act to \n     justify turning them away. Many suspect that the Obama \n     administration was reluctant to go against the pro-Jones Act \n     labor unions (tr. every labor union) he needed to cement his \n     re-election. It's not a leap to say that such cronyism may \n     have delayed the eventual resolution of the spill.\n       The Jones Act and its related statutes raise the cost of \n     essential goods for American families and businesses; \n     strangle the life from the industries they were designed to \n     protect; jeopardizes U.S. maritime security; and exacerbates \n     the pain of major national emergencies. (They also are major \n     irritant in foreign trade relations.) So why hasn't Congress \n     repealed these laws? Maybe we should ask the politicians and \n     well-connected cronies who benefit from the current \n     arrangement. I'm sure they'd be happy to explain.\n       McCain's amendment to repeal the Jones Act is a common-\n     sense solution to the problems facing a key American industry \n     and the pain of the U.S. economy. The amendment, as well as \n     any broader proposal to kill off the Act, deserves widespread \n     support from conservatives and liberals alike. Efforts to \n     dispense with this archaic protectionist boondoggle will no \n     doubt meet fierce resistance from entrenched interests, labor \n     unions, and opponents of free trade. However, those same \n     groups stand only to benefit from efforts to make the U.S. \n     fleet more competitive and less costly. American mariners \n     have what it takes to compete on a global scale, and they \n     should be given the chance. More competition translates to \n     more opportunity, and perhaps the expansion and \n     revitalization of a crucial sector of our economy. Where \n     artificial monopolies and ancient restrictions can be \n     removed, American labor, American business, and American \n     consumers will have a chance to thrive.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Alaska.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I would like to talk about an amendment I \nfiled along with my colleague Susan Collins of Maine to support the \nLow-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, the LIHEAP program.\n  As the Senate continues to debate whether to bypass a longstanding \nPresidential permitting process and essentially rubberstamp the \nconstruction of the Keystone XL Pipeline--which, to be clear, would \nlikely benefit major oil companies and could have a harmful consequence \non our environment--I wish to take the opportunity to highlight a \nFederal program that helps our country's most vulnerable citizens, \nincluding seniors, meet their home energy needs.\n  The bipartisan amendment led by Senator Collins and me, along with \nseveral of our colleagues, expresses the sense of the Senate that the \nLow-Income Home Energy Assistance Program--better known as LIHEAP--\nshould be funded at no less than $4.7 billion annually to ensure that \nmore low-income households--those with children, senior citizens, \nindividuals with disabilities, and veterans--are able to access this \ncritical assistance.\n  I must commend Senator Collins. She and I have taken the lead on this \neffort over many sessions of Congress. Her efforts are extraordinarily \ncritical for the continued support of this program, and it is no \nsurprise that once again we are both together urging our colleagues to \nsupport this program.\n  LIHEAP is the main Federal program that helps low-income families, \nseniors, individuals with disabilities, and a growing number of \nveterans across the country pay their energy bills. It provides vital \nassistance during the cold winter months often seen in the Northeast, \nthe Northern Plains, and across the northern part of the country, and \nalso during the summer months in areas of the Southeast and Southwest \nwhere air-conditioning is absolutely critical to the health and welfare \nof seniors. Unfortunately, we often read very disturbing reports of \nindividuals, particularly seniors, with serious medical conditions that \ncan become fatal because they simply can't afford the cost of air-\nconditioning or home heating.\n  This is not a program that is regionally specific; this is a program \nthat has a national impact and, as such, has to be supported. It is an \nindispensable lifeline that ensures recipients do not have to choose \nbetween paying their energy bills and affording other necessities such \nas food and medicine.\n  The funding also supports many small businesses, such as oil heating \ncompanies. They see the benefits of LIHEAP as well. It goes to pay \nutility bills, which indirectly affects small businesses and individual \nratepayers across a broad spectrum. So the benefits of this legislation \nare not just for the specific recipients but also for the overall \neconomy of our States and for small businesses, and that has to be \nnoted.\n  We also recognize that there are many more households eligible than \nreceive the benefits simply because the funding levels are \ninsufficient.\n  Despite bipartisan efforts over many years--again, with Senator \nCollins being right there--funding reductions in 2011 and 2012, along \nwith sequester cuts, mean LIHEAP funding has declined more than 30 \npercent since fiscal year 2010, from $5.1 billion down to about $3.4 \nbillion. This raises another bigger issue.\n  We have seen our deficit decline significantly, from 9.8 percent of \ngross domestic product now to about 2.8 percent. In fact, that is a \nlittle bit below the 40-year average of deficits in the United States. \nThis hasn't been just because of magic; it is because we have been \ncutting programs. This is an example of one of the programs we have cut \nvery significantly, and it is a program that aids so many people in our \ncommunities--particularly seniors and people with disabilities. This \ndeficit reduction has been hard won, and one of the costs has been \nsupporting these people. The money has shrunk, so obviously the number \nof people serviced has shrunk. The number of households LIHEAP funds \nhas declined by 17 percent, from about 8.1 million households to 6.7 \nmillion households, and they have seen this impact directly. Those \nreceiving assistance have also seen their average LIHEAP grant reduced \nby about $100, down to about $400. This is estimated to cover less than \nhalf of the average home heating costs for a household this winter, \nmeaning that many low-income families and seniors will have fewer \nresources available to meet other basic needs.\n  I must point out that we are seeing a temporary reprieve from very \nhigh energy prices--particularly oil prices in the Northeast--because \nof geopolitical developments that have impacted the price of oil. But \nthat is not the solution. The bills these people face, even in this \neconomic climate as well as meteorological climate, are still \nsignificant and challenging to people of very limited means. For many \npeople, this is an issue of safety, it is an issue of their health, and \nit is an issue of just being able to get by and make ends meet.\n  So the need is clear, and I urge my colleagues to join me in support \nof LIHEAP and in support of this amendment.\n  In this context, we need to be proactive in terms of recognizing \nsomething we can do on a bipartisan basis that works.\n  I do believe I should also comment at this moment on the underlying \nproposal, the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  We understand this TransCanada pipeline would move crude oil from the \nCanadian tar sands--one of the dirtiest sources of fuel on the planet--\nto refineries on our gulf coast. There are many ways to extract \nhydrocarbons, and this is one of the most environmentally challenging \nways. Constructing this pipeline runs counter to what we should be \ndoing on a much broader basis, which is addressing climate change and \nprotecting the environment.\n  I was struck yesterday at a meeting of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee--and the Presiding Officer is a distinguished and very \nvaluable member of that committee--where we listened to Lt. Gen. Brent \nScowcroft and\n\n[[Page S382]]\n\nZbigniew Brzezinski, two of the foremost experts on national security \npolicy. General Scowcroft was National Security Adviser for President \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush, and Dr. Brzezinski was National Security \nAdviser for President Carter and was integral in negotiating the Camp \nDavid Accords between Israel and Egypt. I was struck, when asked about \nthe big issues we face, that General Scowcroft said: Well, there are \ntwo big issues--cyber security and climate change. When you have these \nvery authoritative individuals--again on a bipartisan basis--\nessentially saying climate change is a big national security issue, \nthat is the context in which we have to view so many things, in \nparticular this issue of the Keystone Pipeline.\n\n  The second issue is the obvious need in this country to create jobs. \nIn fact--no pun intended--that is job number 1 for us. Now, there are \njobs associated with the pipeline. Even if they are of short duration, \nthey are still pretty good jobs. But the point has to be made that we \nhave to do much more--particularly for our construction workers--than \none single pipeline. I have been told that long-term employment of the \npipeline, once it is built--will be very small.\n  We have to do much more. That is why I think we have to be very \nserious about an infrastructure program that goes way beyond Keystone \nand includes roads, bridges, sewers--all these things we have let \ndecline. If we look at the spending levels--once again, a victim of our \ndeficit reduction, a victim of the cuts we have made--we are at a level \nnow where we are not doing what our fathers, grandfathers, \ngrandmothers, and mothers did, which is invest a lot of money in \nbuilding infrastructure for a productive America. We have been missing \nin action for the last several years as far as doing those things we \nused to do routinely--building new highways, building new sewer \nsystems, improving our pollution control systems, all of those things. \nWe have to do that.\n  We also have to do those things in the context of climate change--in \nother words, look at alternative energy and not just replicate what we \ndid 20 or 30 years ago because this is a different planet.\n  According to the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor unions and \nenvironmental groups, repairing America's crumbling infrastructure \ncould create 2.7 million jobs across the economy, increase GDP by $377 \nbillion, while reducing carbon pollution and other greenhouse gas \nemissions. So it is not thousands of jobs; it is millions of jobs. It \nis not one project; it is a commitment to improving, advancing, and \nrehabilitating our infrastructure in every part of the country, while \nat the same time dealing with climate change, which is so central.\n  So, I would like to see us, as we move past this debate, move \nvigorously into a debate about infrastructure.\n  There is another issue too, and that is this debate about where the \noil is going. Well, given the global market for petroleum products, it \ncould go to parts of the United States, but it could easily go \noverseas. A lot of that is a factor of the price and the demand. We \nhave seen a lot of oil going into Asia in particular. I think that \ntrend will continue for several reasons. One reason is that they have \ndone less, relatively speaking, than many other parts of the world in \nterms of lowering their dependence on oil and moving to alternative \nfuels. So the potential is that a significant amount, if not all, of \nthis product--even though it reaches the gulf coast--will not be used \nin the United States. That is another factor we have to consider.\n  Bypassing the administration's traditional legislative review process \nwith respect to Keystone is not the way to proceed. We have to get our \nenergy policies right. I think we have to recognize climate change. We \nhave to be sensitive to a whole host of issues. We also have to \nrecognize that an energy policy is not just producing and getting these \nproducts into the marketplace, it is also making sure that very \nvulnerable Americans can afford these products, whatever their prices \nmay be. That is where LIHEAP comes in.\n  I am very pleased, once again, that this is a continuation of a \nbipartisan effort Senator Collins and many others have pursued for the \nbenefit of families all across this country. When we are doing that, I \nthink we are doing the best possible work we can for our constituents \nand our Nation.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Mikulski pertaining to the submission of S. Res. \nNo. 35 is printed in today's Record under ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 71\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I stand today to encourage my colleagues to \nsupport my amendment No. 71. This amendment would solve a problem that \nhas severely hamstrung oil and gas development on Federal lands, a \nproblem that is particularly severe in the Western United States and \nthat involves excessive delays in the issuing of permits by the U.S. \nBureau of Land Management.\n  Federal law requires the BLM to approve or deny these permits within \n30 days. They have 30 days to go one way or the other. But according to \na report issued last year by the inspector general within the U.S. \nDepartment of Interior, BLM took an average of 228 days to approve each \ndrilling permit in 2012--228 days. That is 7\\1/2\\ months. That is a lot \nlonger than the 30 days under Federal law. In Moab and in Salt Lake \nCity, UT, the average processing delay is 220 days. In Price, UT, the \nbacklog is around 250 days. It doesn't have to take this long. In fact, \nto explain why, let's look at how States handle it.\n  State governments, by comparison, process these same permits in 80 \ndays or less.\n  Approval of these permits is further complicated by endless \nenvironmental reviews, reviews that sometimes can take years upon \nyears. The result of all this redtape is a serious backlog of about \n3,500 permits.\n  My amendment would address this problem in a few ways. First, it \nwould require BLM to issue a permit within 60 days of receiving an \napplication. If the permit is denied, the BLM would be required to \nspecify the reasons for its decision to deny the permit and to allow \nthe applicant thereafter to address any issues.\n  The amendment would also address delays stemming from reviews under \nthe Endangered Species Act and under the National Environmental Policy \nAct. Reviews under these statutes are required to be completed within \n180 days. To provide companies with certainty and to hold BLM \naccountable, if either of these deadlines is not met, the applications \nwould be deemed approved.\n  Significantly, there are currently 113 million acres of Federal land \nopen and accessible for oil and gas development. Much of this Federal \nland contains abundant domestic energy resources. In Utah alone we have \nhundreds of acres available for drilling, acres that are currently \nbeing held up by bureaucratic delays. My amendment would ensure that \nUtah and other States in the West that are dominated by Federal land \ncan access the energy, the vast wealth that lies within their borders, \nand provide the United States with a reliable source of domestic energy \nproduction.\n  Look, our security--our energy security and our national security, \nmore broadly--depends ultimately on our ability to produce energy. I \nunderstand that fuel prices right now are down relative to what they \nhave been. We cannot get too secure in this. We cannot assume it is \nalways going to be the case. Certainly, when the Federal Government \ninsists on owning this much land--roughly one-third of the land in the \nUnited States as a whole, roughly\n\n[[Page S383]]\n\ntwo-thirds of the land in my State of Utah--if we are going to own this \nmuch land within the Federal Government, we should be using the \nresources within it.\n  We need to make sure we are using that land to shore up our energy \nindependence. The less energy independent we are in this country, the \nmore dependent we become on other countries that are producing their \nenergy, that are using their natural resources--countries such as Saudi \nArabia and Venezuela and other countries where there are a lot of \npeople growing wealthy off of our petrodollars and where many of those \nsame people are using our own petrodollars to fund acts of terrorism \nagainst us, countries that are often hostile to our interests.\n  We need to do this because it makes sense economically and we need to \ndo this because it makes sense from a national security standpoint as \nwell. But in order for any of this to work, we have to have procedures \nin place to make sure that those people who choose to go out and want \nto develop land--want to develop Federal land that has already been \nidentified as suitable for oil and gas production within Federal \nlands--that they have some modicum of due process, that they have some \nability to predict what the procedural outcome is going to be, what set \nof procedures they will have to follow and what kind of timeline they \nwill be facing as they approach this often lengthy process.\n  We do need to be careful. We do need to be sensitive and we need to \nmake sure we are developing our natural resources in a way that \nrespects our environment and doesn't endanger our health or that of our \nFederal land, but this can be done in a way that doesn't have to result \nin open-ended and completely unforeseeable delays.\n  For this reason I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this \namendment, amendment No. 71, with the understanding that as they do so, \nthey will be shoring up America's energy independence, and with it, \nAmerica's national security.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. I also ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Veterans Health Care\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, thank you very much for recognizing me to \ntake the opportunity to address something I hope can readily and easily \nbe solved. If common sense prevails--and we know it doesn't often \nenough here in our Nation's Capital--one, the Department of Veterans \nAffairs certainly, in my view, can solve this problem. If common sense \ndoesn't prevail there, then surely the Senate, the House of \nRepresentatives, and the President could agree upon a legislative fix \nthat is really nothing more than common sense. I am talking about a \nveterans issue--one that is certainly prevalent in a rural State such \nas mine. My guess is it is a problem that occurs in a State such as the \nPresiding Officer's as well.\n  I was very pleased. I came to the Senate floor and talked about the \nimportance of passing and approving the CHOICE Act. We remember the \nscandal of last year in which it became clear the Department of \nVeterans Affairs had significant problems across the country. The VA \nhospital in Phoenix was a poster child for bad behavior that resulted \nin potentially the death of veterans. One of the things we did to try \nto help the Department of Veterans Affairs better take care of \nAmerica's veterans was to pass the CHOICE Act. We did that in August of \nlast year. It was signed into law, and it is now being implemented by \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  There are many issues that are associated with the implementation of \nthis bill, but let me raise one. The crux of that legislation is this. \nIf you are a veteran and you live more than 40 miles from a VA facility \nor if you can't get the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide the \nservices within 30 days or the timeframe in which you need those \nservices, then the Department of Veterans Affairs is required by law to \nprovide those services, if you choose, at a place of your choice, \npresumably your hometown.\n  This is about service to our veterans in their hometowns across \nKansas and across States around the country. The theory is that the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs is incapable of providing those services \nperhaps for a number of reasons, including lack of the necessary \nprofessionals. Therefore, let's take advantage of the professionals we \nhave at home in our hometowns. Let the veterans see his or her hometown \nphysician. Let the veteran be admitted to his or her hometown hospital. \nIt is a pretty commonsense kind of reaction to the inability of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs to meet the needs of veterans across our \ncountry--provide another option. If that is the choice of the veteran, \nthat veteran wants to have care at home, give them that option.\n  As a Senator from a State such as Kansas, this makes sense to me even \nin the circumstance in which the Department of Veterans Affairs can \nprovide the service. For 14 years I represented a congressional \ndistrict in Kansas, the western three-fourths of our State. The \ncongressional district is larger than the State of Illinois and has no \nVA hospital.\n  We pushed for a number of years and were successful in opening \noutpatient clinics so veterans could get that care closer to home than \nthe VA hospital, and those outpatient clinics provide--or at least \nintended to provide--routine care.\n  Here is the problem today. The law says if you live more than 40 \nmiles from a VA facility, then the VA must provide the services at home \nif you choose. The Department of Veterans Affairs is defining facility \nas any facility, including the hospital or the outpatient clinic. That \ndoesn't seem too troublesome to me until you take it to the next step, \nwhich is, even if the VA hospital or the outpatient clinic doesn't \nprovide the service that the veteran needs, they still consider it a \nfacility within 40 miles.\n  In my hometown, where I grew up, we have had an ongoing dialogue with \none of our honored veterans. He needs a colonoscopy. My hometown is \nnearly 300 miles--250 miles from the VA hospital in Wichita. There is \nan outpatient clinic, a CBOC, in Hays, 25 miles away. But guess what. \nThe outpatient clinic in Hays doesn't provide the service of \ncolonoscopies.\n  One would think the veteran in my hometown could go to the local \nphysician or the local hospital and have the colonoscopy performed and \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs provide and pay for the services. \nBut no, because there is an outpatient clinic within 40 miles, even \nthough it doesn't provide the colonoscopy, our veteran is directed to \ndrive to Wichita. Incidentally, we have calculated the mileage expense \nof the veteran doing it. It does not make sense economically, either. \nBut regardless of that, it certainly doesn't make sense for that \nveteran.\n  I have said this many times over the years as we have tried to bring \nservices closer to home to veterans. If you are a 92-year-old World War \nII veteran and you live in Atwood, KS, up on the Nebraska border, how \ndo you get to the VA hospital in Wichita or in Denver?\n  Our initial attempt was to put an outpatient clinic closer. The \nproblem with that--we now have an outpatient clinic in Burlington, CO, \nand an outpatient clinic in Hays, KS. But that is still 2\\1/2\\ hours \nfrom Atwood, KS. If you are a 92-year-old World War II veteran in \nAtwood, KS, how do you get to Hays or Burlington, CO? The answer is you \nprobably don't.\n  Our veterans are not being served. We attempted to address this \nissue. Let me say it differently. We addressed this issue in the CHOICE \nAct and said that if you are 40 miles from a facility, then the VA \nprovides the services at home. The VA is interpreting that facility--\nthe word facility--just to mean any facility there regardless of what \nservice it provides.\n  In many instances--I take Liberal, KS, where there is a CBOC. They \nhaven't had a permanent physician in their CBOC in almost 4 years. But \nyet Liberal--the CBOC in Liberal--counts as a facility even though \nthere is no physician who is regularly in attendance at the clinic. \nThese issues ought\n\n[[Page S384]]\n\nto be resolved in favor of whom? The veteran. Whom, of all people, \nwould we expect to provide the best service to? In any capable way we \ncan, whom would we expect to get the best health care in our Nation? I \nwould put at the top of the list those who served our country.\n\n  The committee that passed this legislation, the CHOICE Act--it says \nin the language--the conferees recognized the issues I just described \nand added report language that allows veterans to secure health care \nservices that are either unavailable or not cost-effective to provide \nat a VA facility, which was intentionally included to give the VA \nflexibility to provide veterans access to non-VA care when a VA \nfacility, no matter what size or location, cannot provide the care the \nveteran is seeking.\n  Yesterday I introduced S. 207. I would ask my colleagues to join me. \nAgain, I guess my first request is, Could the Department of Veterans \nAffairs fix this problem on their own? If not, I would ask that my \ncolleagues join me in fixing this legislatively with one more directive \nto the Department of Veterans Affairs saying, if they cannot provide \nthe service at the CBOC, then it does not count as a facility within \nthe 40 miles.\n  This is a problem across our States. I had my staff at a meeting in \nthe VISN in which they were describing how they were going to implement \nthe CHOICE Act. They put up a chart in which they show how they are \ngoing to have a mobile van work its way through the area of our State \nand Missouri and talked about how that will then satisfy the 40-mile \nrequirement.\n  Why is the VA bending over backward to avoid--let my say it \ndifferently. Why is the VA not bending over backward to take care of \nthe veteran, instead of bending over backward to make sure it is the \nmost difficult circumstance for a veteran to get the health care they \nneed at home?\n  We ought to always err on the side of what is best for veterans, not \nwhat is best for the Department of Veterans Affairs--if you could ever \nmake the case that providing services someplace far away from the \nveteran is good for the VA.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the opportunity to speak to this \nissue. It is an important one. I have mentioned it to a number of my \ncolleagues. They have described similar circumstances in their State. I \nhave met with the Department of Veterans Affairs personnel. I serve on \nthe veterans' committee, have since I came to Congress. We will work in \nevery way with the veterans' committee, Republicans and Democrats, to \nmake certain there is a fix to this issue.\n  But I want to highlight the manner in which the Department is \nimplementing the CHOICE Act is not the way Congress intended, and it is \nnot the way that benefits the veteran. Finally, let me say that even if \nthere was some circumstance in which the Department does not have the \nauthority to do what we are asking them to do in the CHOICE Act, they \nhave the ability today to provide non-VA care whenever they deem it \nnecessary.\n  There is also the opportunity for them to use a pilot program that \nmany of us have in our States. I see the Senator from Maine is on the \nfloor. They have a pilot program, the ARCH Program, in which we are \ntrying to provide services to veterans at home. There are a variety of \nways the Department can solve this problem. I ask them to do that.\n  In the absence of their solution, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nsponsoring, in debating, in potentially amending but most importantly \nin passing and sending this bill to the President so we can resolve \nonce and for all that the Department of Veterans Affairs is created for \nthe benefit of the veteran, not the Department.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, first, as an original cosponsor of the good \nSenator's bill, I compliment him for taking the leadership position he \nhas on this issue, for bringing it forward and so eloquently expressing \nhis support for it.\n  This is an important bill. I think it is one we all can agree on, on \na bipartisan basis. Let's get it through and to the President.\n\n\n                             Cyber Security\n\n  Mr. President, I start with a question, a basic question: Why are we \nhere? Why do we have those jobs? What is it we are supposed to do? The \nclearest expression of the answer to that question comes from the \npreamble to the Constitution, which lays out exactly what our \nresponsibilities are.\n\n       We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more \n     perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic \n     Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the \n     general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to \n     ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this \n     Constitution for the United States of America.\n\n  This is the purpose of the Constitution. It is the purpose of the \ngovernment. The most solemn responsibility of any government, I would \nsubmit--any government, anywhere, any time--is to provide for the \nsecurity of its citizens, to provide for the common defense. That is \nour most solemn and fundamental responsibility.\n  We are not doing that right now. We are avoiding, missing, \nobfuscating, and not dealing with one of the most serious threats \nfacing our country. I refer to the threat of cyber attack. Every \nintelligence official I have talked to in the last 2 years, every \nmilitary official, everybody with any knowledge of the defense and the \nsecurity, the national security of this country, has emphasized that \nthe most serious threat we face right now is cyber.\n  What does that mean? Cyber attacks. The disabling of critical \ninfrastructure, attacks on our businesses, financial systems. This is a \ndirect threat that is heading at us like a freight train on a track. \nThe problem is we see it coming, but we are not doing what we should to \ndeal with it.\n  To say it is coming is kind of an understatement. This is an unusual \nchart, but it goes in time from 2004 until today. It is basically the \nfrequency and size of cyber attacks in our country. The bigger bubbles \nare bigger attacks. The smaller bubbles are smaller attacks. From 2004 \nto 2006, a few but not many. It is bubbling up and it is about to boil \nover. Each year we have seen more attacks, larger attacks, more serious \nattacks. The evidence is overwhelming that this is a threat we are \nfacing. Sony was a wake-up call if ever there was one. What if the Sony \nattack had been the New York Stock Exchange or the railroad system, \nwhere cars bearing toxic materials are derailed, or the natural gas \npipeline system or any other of the critical infrastructure of this \ncountry, financial or physical, would have disabled us?\n  I was at a hearing yesterday in the Armed Services Committee. We had \nthe testimony of two of the wisest men in America--Brent Scowcroft, \nGen. Brent Scowcroft, who was the National Security Adviser to \nPresident Ford and President George H.W. Bush, and Dr. Zbigniew \nBrzezinski, who was the National Security Adviser to Jimmy Carter--\ntalking about threats.\n  Brent Scowcroft said he believes the cyber threat was analogous to \nthe nuclear threat: People would not be killed, but our country could \nbe destroyed. He saw this as one of the two fundamental threats we \nface. Yet what are we doing in Congress? Not much. It is as if we got a \ntelegram from Admiral Yamamoto in 1941 saying, I am steaming toward \nPearl Harbor and we are going to wipe you out, and we did nothing, or a \ntelegram or a text message from Osama bin Ladin saying, We are heading \nfor the World Trade Center, what are you going to do, and we did \nnothing.\n  We have the notice. It is right in front of us. Yet we are not \nacting. What are the risks? The biggest risk is in the nature of our \nsociety. The good news is we are the most technologically advanced \nsociety on Earth. The bad news is we are the most technologically \nadvanced society on Earth--because it makes us vulnerable.\n  It is what they call an asymmetric vulnerability. We are the most \nvulnerable because we are the most wired. We are in the most danger \nbecause of our technical advancement. What can they do to us? This \ngives you an idea of how this risk is accelerating and how it fits. \nThis is the number of devices in the world connected to the Internet. \nBack in 2003 it was very few. By 2010 we were up to 10 billion devices \nconnected to the Internet. The projection is, by the end of this year, \nwe will be at 25 billion devices connected to the Internet. By 2020, \nnot that long from now, 50 billion\n\n[[Page S385]]\n\ndevices will be connected to the Internet and therefore vulnerable to \ncyber attacks.\n\n  Critical infrastructure, I have mentioned. The financial system, what \nwould it do to the country if all of a sudden everybody's bank account \ndisappeared? Most of us, many workers in America, have their--we do not \nsee cash money or a paycheck. It goes electronically into our bank \naccount. What if all of that just disappeared? Chaos would ensue.\n  The same thing with transactions on the New York Stock Exchange or \nthe great transactions of our banks. It would be chaos that would \ntumble through the economy and then into people's daily lives. \nTransportation could be paralyzed. The simply act of messing around \nwith how red and green lights work in a major city could paralyze a \nmajor city for hours, if not days.\n  The transportation of toxic or volatile compounds could be \ncompromised. Of course, the energy system, the electrical grid, we do \nnot realize how dependent we are on these modern facilities until they \ngo down. Periodically in Maine, when I was Governor, we had an ice \nstorm where three-quarters of our people lost electricity for sometimes \n2 weeks at a time. We learned what a disaster that was. One of the \nthings we learned was that home furnaces, heating oil furnaces, need \nelectricity to fire. People got cold. It was not just: Gee. I cannot \nwatch TV tonight. It became life threatening.\n  The second area of vulnerability is financial. Data breaches, that is \nsomething that is happening all of the time. Then, finally, property \nideas, theft of ideas. Where are these threats coming from? All over \nthe place. North Korea, Russia, China, Iran. Terrorist organizations \nare now looking into the cyber field--hackers for hire, somebody in \nsome country or somebody's basement somewhere in the world who hires \nout to take advantage of the vulnerability, particularly of the Western \ncountries and particularly the United States.\n  We are already incurring huge costs, the cost of these data breaches, \nthe cost of protection against these data breaches. Our financial \nsystem is spending a huge amount of money to protect itself from these \nbreaches. We have to act. We have to act. It is beyond time to act.\n  My favorite quote from Mark Twain--and there are many. But my \nfavorite is: History doesn't always repeat itself, but it usually \nrhymes.\n  History doesn't always repeat itself, but it usually rhymes.\n  Nothing new ever happens. This would not be the first time in history \na great nation ignored threats to its existence. In August of 1939, \nWinston Churchill, in talking about the House of Commons, but he could \nhave been talking about the U.S. Congress:\n\n       At this moment in its long history, it would be disastrous, \n     it would be pathetic, it would be shameful for the House of \n     Commons to write itself off as an effective and potent factor \n     in the situation, or reduce whatever strength it can offer to \n     the firm front which the nation will make against aggression.\n\n  Earlier in the thirties he said--and this is a perfect analogy of \nwhere we are today:\n\n       When the situation was manageable it was neglected, and now \n     that it is thoroughly out of hand we apply too late the \n     remedies which then might have effected a cure.\n\n  We are at the line between manageable and too late. I would argue it \nis almost over that line. Now is the time that we have to act, but we \naren't acting because of a variety of reasons: the complexity of our \nprocess--four committees have to consider cyber legislation; the \ndifferences with the House; the differences with the White House. There \nare all kinds of complications in our system which seem to be \npreventing us from acting.\n  Again, Churchill is appropriate:\n\n       There is nothing new in the story. It is as old as the \n     Sibylline Books. It falls into that long, dismal catalogue of \n     the fruitlessness of experience and the confirmed \n     unteachability of mankind.\n\n  Boy, that is a dark judgment. Continuing:\n\n       Want of foresight, unwillingness to act when action would \n     be simple and effective, lack of clear thinking, confusion of \n     counsel until the emergency comes, until self-preservation \n     strikes its jarring gong--these are the features which \n     constitute the endless repetition of history.\n\n  Let's act before the crisis starts. Let's act while we still have \ntime.\n  There are at least three bills that I know of that are available. One \nis a bipartisan bill that was heavily negotiated in the Intelligence \nCommittee, came out of the committee I think 12 to 3 last summer. That \nis available. It is a new Congress, but the ink is barely dry. There is \na bill that came out of the Judiciary Committee. A bill that came out \nof the homeland security committee in December of 2012--and lost in \nthis body by a couple of votes--from my friends Senator Collins and \nSenator Lieberman also dealt with this problem. In other words, we \ndon't have to start from zero. We don't have to invent these solutions; \nwe just have to have the will to put them in place. Yet we don't act.\n  People say: Well, we have national security, Senator. What are you \ntalking about? We are spending almost $600 billion a year on the \ndefense of this Nation.\n  And the answer is yes, but in some ways it reminds me of the famous \nMaginot Line of France in the thirties. The Maginot Line has come to \nsymbolize a faulty defense premise, which really isn't true. The \nMaginot Line worked. The problem was that the Maginot Line stopped. It \nwent from Switzerland to the Belgian border. It stopped at the Belgian \nborder, and the Germans came around it and behind it and overwhelmed \nFrance in 6 days. So the problem wasn't that the Maginot Line was not \nan effective defense--and our defense budget certainly is not \nineffective; it is absolutely essential. But we are not defending the \nwhole frontier. There is a piece of it, like Belgium, that is \nundefended, and that is our failure.\n  So what are we going to say when the crisis strikes? What are we \ngoing to say when we go home to our citizens in our home States when \nthe financial system goes down and people can't get their money? There \nare threats of violence and violence across our country when toxic \nwaste is spilled in our waterways. What are we going to say? ``Well, we \nwould have done something about it, but that was in four committees, \nand that was really hard'' or ``You know, we just got in this argument \nwith the White House and couldn't work it out'' or ``Gee, we would have \nsolved it and your paycheck wouldn't have disappeared except the \nHouse--you know how they are.'' Can you imagine trying to defend \nyourself with that kind of argument? You would be laughed out of the \nplace.\n  Come on. Let's do this. I don't know exactly how to proceed, except \nmaybe those four committees should get together, talk to each other, \nand say: Let's bring a bill to the floor.\n  I would like to see this body decide that we are going to pass cyber \nprotection legislation between now and May 1. There is no reason we \ncan't do it. The bills are drafted. We just have to pull ourselves \ntogether and take collective responsibility for defending our country.\n  If we don't do this--a friend and colleague on this floor yesterday--\nwe were talking about it, and he said: It is political malpractice if \nwe don't get this done.\n  This is a threat we know about. It is important. It is serious. We \nknow at least some of the important things we have to do to coordinate \nbetter between the government and the private sector. We know how we \ncan help to solve this; we just have to summon the political will to do \nit. And it isn't even that controversial. There are differences here \nand there, but this isn't one of the big fights in the Senate where we \nhave great ideological differences, this is one where we should be able \nto come together. It is a lack of coordination and a lack of political \nwill.\n  I don't know how I can say this more strongly. I think this is one of \nour most fundamental responsibilities. I go back to the preamble to the \nConstitution--the primary reason that governments are established and \nthat our government was established, one of the basic reasons is to \nprovide for the common defense. If we don't do that in the face of this \nthreat, shame on us. This is one of the most solemn responsibilities we \nhave as Senators, as Members of the Congress, and as members of the \nFederal Government of the United States.\n  I deeply hope that the next several weeks and months will be a time \nof productive discussions and a commitment to at least an attempted \nsolution, the beginning of a solution to this\n\n[[Page S386]]\n\ngrave threat facing the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss several issues that \nI hope Congress will consider in this Congress.\n  First, I intend to work this year to address our Nation's spending \nproblems because I sit up nights worrying about our Nation's debt and \nhow it will affect our children and grandchildren. As chairman of the \nBudget Committee, I will have a hand in handling that, so I have more \nresponsibility.\n  We have a spending problem in this country, and we cannot spend our \nway to prosperity; rather, we have to stop spending more than we take \nin and find a way to start paying down $18 trillion. The debt is \ngrowing. In fact, last fiscal year we spent $469 billion more than we \ntook in. This fiscal year we are projected to spend $550 billion more \nthan we will take in.\n  The money on which we actually get to make decisions is about $1,000 \nbillion. I could say $1 trillion, but $1,000 billion seems to me like a \nlot more. When we talk about one, we don't pay much attention, whether \nit is a penny or a dollar or a million or a billion or a trillion, but \nif we put it out in real terms, we are talking about $1,000 billion \nthat we could actually make decisions on, and we go ahead and spend \nhalf more than that, half more than we take in. How long do you think \nwe can do that?\n  Well, it is affected by interest. We have to pay interest on the \nmoney we spend that is in addition to the money we take in. Right now \nwe are able to borrow that money at only 1.9 percent. Only? That \namounts to $251 billion that we are paying in interest. It doesn't do a \nsingle program, just pays interest.\n  How many people think the interest rate is going to stay at 1.9 \npercent? Well, nobody does. In fact, the projections for this year for \nthat interest rate, as we sell our bonds, is for 2.1 percent and going \nup. The average would be 5 percent. Let's see--$250 billion. If that \ndoubled, that would be $500 billion. That could happen in 1 year. That \nwould be an extra $250 billion that we couldn't spend out of that \n$1,000 billion that we now get to make decisions on, which is only two-\nthirds of what we actually spend. We have a spending problem, and it is \ncatastrophic in the long run.\n  People would like us to balance the budget, and I have noticed that \n24 States have already passed a constitutional convention balanced \nbudget amendment. There is a provision--article V of the Constitution \nsays you can have a constitutional convention, and there are ways of \nhaving it happen, and that is by two-thirds of the States saying they \nwant to have one. The way all those are being phrased is as though it \nwould be limited to a constitutional convention on the balanced budget \namendment only, but there is no provision to keep it at that. The only \nreal provision in article V is one that says that no matter what you do \nin a constitutional convention, the thing that cannot be violated is \nthat all States have equal representation in the U.S. Senate. Since we \nare the least populated State, that is one of my favorite parts of that \narticle, and that is my favorite article. But everything else could be \ntapped. There are 10 more States that are considering that resolution. \nIf all 34 of them pass it, we will have a constitutional convention.\n  If we had to balance that budget in 1 year, that would mean we would \nhave to cut $550 billion out of $1,000 billion. In other words, we \nwould have to make a 50-percent cut to balance the budget.\n  The real tragedy of this--I am not even talking about paying down the \nnational debt; I am just talking about what we would be able to spend \nafter we pay interest because we overspend.\n  So we are trying to get it on a track where we can at least see the \nend of the tunnel and hope that is not the light of a train coming our \nway. So far it is. That is one of the things that keep me up. Several \nMembers of the Senate have ideas on how we can do that, and I intend to \nwork with them in an effort to find real solutions, eliminate some of \nthe budget gimmicks we have had in the past, and I have some ideas I \nhope my colleagues will consider. One of them is my penny plan. That \ncuts the overall spending by 1 percent for 3 years to balance the \nbudget. It is a little pain for virtually everybody. Everybody gives up \none penny out every dollar they get from the Federal Government. The \nplan doesn't mandate any specific cuts. Congress would have the \nauthority to make targeted cuts and focus on the worst first. That is \nwhat we ought to do--focus on the worst first, and there is plenty of \nworst-first out there. If we focus on identifying and eliminating all \nof the wasteful spending that occurs in Washington, we might not have \nto cut important programs and services. Let's not make the cuts hurt. \nLet's be smart about the spending cuts and prioritize how we spend \ntaxpayers' money.\n\n  My biennial appropriations bill would allow for each of the \nappropriations bills to be taken up for a 2-year period. That means \nagencies would know what they are doing for 2 years. What happens right \nnow is we don't meet the spending deadline--which is October 1--until \nsometime into the next year. So they not only don't know what they are \ngoing to do for 2 years, they don't even know what they are going to do \nfor the year they are in. We need to solve that problem.\n  My biennial budgeting bill actually breaks up the spending into two \npieces. We do 12 of the bills, so we do the six tough ones right after \nthe election and then we do the six easy ones before an election to \nmake that a little easier to get done. But each of them would allow the \nagencies to know what they are going to do for a 2-year period, and it \nwould allow the appropriators to scrutinize the details of those \nbudgets. When you are looking at $1,000 billion, how much detail do you \nthink you can look at when you have to do that each and every year? So \nI am suggesting that we only have to do it once every 2 years for half \nof the budget, and I think that would get us into a position where we \nwould be cutting that worst first.\n  Of course, the Defense appropriations bill would be taken up each \nyear, just as we take up the authorization bill. Some people have \nmentioned that we are funding some things that aren't authorized right \nnow. They were authorized before, but the authorization date has \npassed, so technically they are not authorized to happen. I was curious \nas to how many of those there were. I found out there were over 250 \nauthorizations. So how many of those are current? Well, 150 of them are \nout of date. We are still spending the money, but we haven't looked at \nthe program to see if that is what we intended for them to do and if \nthat is how they are using the money and if it is getting done. It is \nabout time we did that.\n  Eliminating duplication and waste as well as improper payments could \nbe a real part of the solution this year because those are avoidable \nwastes of taxpayer dollars. The Government Accountability Office has \nreported that 31 areas of the Federal Government are in need of reform \nto eliminate duplicative and unnecessary programs. Consolidating \nprograms and agency functions that overlap could save $95 billion.\n\n  Additionally, in fiscal year 2012 there were nearly $100 billion in \nimproper payments. That is the last time we have an accurate record--or \ninaccurate record of inaccuracies. These are payments that shouldn't be \ngoing out the door to people who are no longer eligible for benefits or \noverpayments of benefits or, in the worst cases, payments to people who \nare deceased. Ending waste and duplication could not only help out our \nfiscal house and get it back in order, but it could restore some \nconfidence in the ability of government to operate effectively.\n  Additionally, I believe that now is the time to deal with the \nproblems we have seen each day since ObamaCare was implemented. \nPremiums are skyrocketing for many people this year, while small \nbusinesses continue to hold off on hiring new workers or are keeping \npeople on a part-time schedule so they do not have to go out of \nbusiness.\n  We should repeal this law because it is bad for consumers and bad for \nbusinesses. We need real health care reform that gets health care costs \nunder control and ensures that rural health care providers can afford \nto continue to provide vital services. We can redo that so we provide \nwhat the President promised but hasn't provided.\n  I am also hopeful this Congress can take up tax reform legislation. \nThis will be a challenge since the President\n\n[[Page S387]]\n\nsaid he wants $1 trillion more in revenue from the Tax Code. I disagree \nwith that premise because I don't think Washington needs to spend more. \nTax reform shouldn't raise any more money for the Federal Government \nthan the current system does, but if done correctly tax reform may \ngenerate additional revenue through economic growth. That revenue can \nbe used to reduce the deficits and pay down the debt. I hope we can \nwork on a bipartisan basis to take our Tax Code off of autopilot and \nmake it more simple and more fair for everyone--families, small \nbusinesses, corporations, and particularly individuals. As the only \naccountant on the Finance Committee, I am ready to roll up my sleeves \nand get to work on tax reform.\n  I also hope Congress will work to improve our economy and make energy \nmore affordable by approving the Keystone Pipeline that we are debating \nnow and fighting against the President's war on coal--the only \nstockpileable energy source we have. The Keystone Pipeline application \nhas been pending for more than 5 years, and the State Department has \nhad five reviews of the project and wants more. Every one of those \nreviews has determined the pipeline would cause no significant \nenvironmental impacts and that the pipeline would create thousands of \njobs. Let's get it built.\n  Similarly, we need to encourage coal production and prevent the \nadministration from restricting this low-cost, reliable, stockpileable \nenergy source. The coal industry provided--directly and indirectly--\nover 700,000 good-paying jobs in 2010, but since being sworn into \noffice, President Obama's rulemaking machine has released rule after \nrule designed to make it difficult and more expensive to use coal. \nInstead of running from coal, America should run on coal, and I hope \nthis Congress will embrace its abundance and its power and its \npotential. With the ingenuity of the American people, there isn't any \nproblem I have seen where we couldn't solve it. So let's just go to \nwork on having cleaner energy and putting some of that incentive into \nusing coal.\n  We need to challenge the President's other regulatory overreach as \nwell. President Obama has issued more Executive orders, more \nregulations and other Executive actions than either Presidents Bush, \nClinton or Reagan. In fact, last month USA Today reported this \nPresident is on track to take more high-level Executive actions than \nany President since Truman, with 195 Executive orders and 198 \nPresidential memoranda under his belt. This year we need to fight the \nabuse of Executive power, whether it is used to grant illegal Executive \namnesty to illegal immigrants or to regulate all bodies of water on \npublic and private land or to make unconstitutional political \nappointments. I will be reintroducing my constitutional amendment to \nallow States to repeal Federal regulations and hope to work with my \ncolleagues on other efforts to fight regulatory overreach.\n  I am confident we can make real progress for America this year on \nthese and other issues because I believe the Republican leader has \nestablished regular order. I expect we will use the committee process \nso Senators can offer constructive amendments and debate bills in that \nforum, where they are intensely interested in that legislation. I am \nhopeful we will also have an amendment process on the Senate floor so \nall 100 Members of the Senate have an opportunity to improve the bills \nwe consider. Each of us has a different background and each of us looks \nat every proposal from a different point of view. Working together we \ncan make things better for the American people, and I hope we will do \nit this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I wish to take a couple of minutes to \ntalk about the pending business--the TransCanada tar sands pipeline. I \nthink it is helpful to start out by recognizing that we actually \nhaven't had a global energy bill in the Senate going back to 2005. So \nit has been about 10 years since we have truly looked at our entire \nenergy policy in this country and set a new course for what we should \nbe doing in the future.\n  Despite the fact I think bumper stickers are a little dangerous, I \nthought it would be helpful to at least try to encapsulate the general \ndirection we should be going--the short and sweet of what lens we \nshould be viewing our national energy policy through. I think if I had \nto boil that down to a simple and concise statement, what I would say \nis simply fewer imports and cleaner fuels. So as we look at different \nproposals over the course of this upcoming Congress, I think it will be \nvery helpful, particularly on the energy committee and on the floor, to \nview these projects through that lens.\n  Oddly enough, we are not dealing with a major energy policy as the \nvery first thing the Senate considers as its pending business. We are \ndealing with one single project put forward by TransCanada, an \ninternational corporation, that has spent millions and millions of \ndollars over the last few years lobbying Washington for this particular \nproject.\n  A lot has been said about the tar sands and about oil sands, but one \nof the things I think would be helpful to talk about is the fundamental \ndifference between the oil that is produced around the United States \nand tar sands production. At the end of the line we are talking about \nthe energy that is produced, but at the front end there is an enormous \ndifference between oil that is drilled in Southeast New Mexico, \nNorthwest New Mexico, in West Texas, in North Dakota or Colorado and in \nthe tar sands. If we look through that same lens of fewer imports and \ncleaner fuels, tar sands development fails on both of those fronts.\n  We talk about more dependency in the United States on importing \nenergy, and here we are talking about a substantially dirtier fuel \nsource. In fact, we aren't allowed props on the floor, but when having \nthis conversation in caucus, I brought some tar sands with me so I \ncould show people the difference between oil and tar sands and how just \ntoxic and sticky it is and how it represents a step backward in our \noverall energy policy in this country.\n  When thinking of oil production, most people think of putting a well \nin place, you case the well, and there is a well pad. It has an impact, \ncertainly, but it is substantially limited compared to what we are \nseeing going on in the boreal forest in northern Alberta right now.\n  This is a picture of northern Canada. For those of us in arid \nSouthwestern States, I can't tell you how envious we are of the kind of \nwater one finds in this part of Canada. Also, the fish and wildlife and \nthe forest resources are substantial. If we look at this picture, some \npeople would say: That is the kind of place one might want to see as a \nnational wildlife refuge or a national park. This is what the boreal \nforest looks like before tar sands production.\n  The thing to remember is that tar sands are not drilled for. They are \nnot produced the way oil and natural gas is produced. Tar sands are \nmined, and they are strip mined. Let us see a picture that exemplifies \nthe boreal forest and then the tar sands production area in the back. \nThis in the front is how it started out and the back is what you have \nonce you are producing the tar sands.\n  We heard from our colleague from Wyoming in his statement recently on \nthe floor that there is no significant environmental impact from this \nproject. But when we look at tar sands production, I don't know how we \ncan look at a photo such as this and say there is no significant \nenvironmental impact.\n  Let's look at the next picture, and we can take an even closer look \nat what the tar sands look like when it is in production. We are \ntalking about an enormous area across northern Canada impacted in this \nway. As we can see, the tar sands is not oil, it is sand and bitumen \ntogether.\n  To be able to process tar sands, to send it through this tar sands \npipeline--the Keystone or any other pipeline--to be able to produce it \nand refine it is a very complicated process. You start by removing the \nforest cover, then you scrape off the topsoil, and after that you dig \nup the remaining tar sands and then you have to heat those up and \nprocess it to get the energy-bearing oil portion out. Just to be able \nto move it through a pipeline you have to heat it up, you have to \npressurize it and you have to add caustic solvents.\n  One of the reasons it has been so incredibly difficult to clean up \nthe existing tar sands spills in places such as Michigan and Arkansas \nis because--unlike oil, where we have a fair amount\n\n[[Page S388]]\n\nof experience, though it is not easy to clean up--there are additional \nsolvents and because the very sticky nature of this substance makes it \nalmost impossible to clean up. We have had very little luck cleaning up \ntar sands spills to date.\n  We see in the front of this picture the boreal forest--or what is \nleft of it--and then we see acres and acres and acres, thousands upon \nthousands of acres of tar sands production. So I think the first thing \nthat is important for people to know is that this simply is not \ntraditional oil and gas development. It is not clear a well pad, drill \na hole, and produce oil. It is the kind of impact that if it were \nproposed for New Mexico or New York or California or even Texas we \nwould have enormous outcry. We don't have the kind of open-pit mining \nand strip mining we once had in this country, but that is what it is \nmost analogous to.\n  That said, another one of the claims that has been made repeatedly \nabout this particular project is that the emissions it would create are \ninconsequential. So it is helpful to look at the emissions to \nunderstand that, because tar sands are fundamentally not only harder to \nhandle but fundamentally dirtier from a pollution point of view than \ntraditional oil resources. It is instructive to look at the difference \nbetween if we created the same amount of energy from domestic New \nMexico, Texas, Colorado or North Dakota crude oil versus if we produced \nthat energy from tar sands.\n  Once again, we get an idea of the emissions just at the source of the \ntar sands development here, but if we were to build this tar sands \npipeline and we burned all of that produced tar sands that will move \nthrough it, the incremental pollution impact of that, the incremental \ncarbon pollution--not the base pollution of whether we created the same \namount of energy from oil sources or from some other sources of energy, \nif we used oil from the United States to create this energy--not \nlooking at that but just the increment of burning tar sands oil instead \nof conventional crude oil, it is the equivalent of putting 285 million \ncars on the road for 1 year.\n  So the addition of carbon pollution to the atmosphere is anything but \ninconsequential if we look at it from the point of view that it is the \nequivalent of doubling Pennsylvania's cars--putting another \nPennsylvania's worth of auto traffic on the road every year for 50 \nyears.\n  What that doesn't take into account is the additional carbon released \nsimply because we are cutting down all the forests, eliminating the \npeat bogs, and fundamentally industrializing an enormous portion of \nAlberta and Canada. That increment is another 6 million cars' worth of \ncarbon pollution on the road for 1 year.\n  So that brings me to: What difference does this make?\n  We may have seen in the news a few days ago how 2014 was the hottest \nyear on record. I wish I could say that was an anomaly. Unfortunately, \nit is not. Fourteen of the last 15 years have been record-setting \nyears. And if there is something we know from our geologic records--\nfrom ice cores, from the science that has been done at NASA and NOAA \nand analyzed by our national labs and our university scientists--it is \nthat over time the amount of carbon pollution in the atmosphere--the \nparts per million of carbon dioxide at any given time--tends to \ncorrelate with temperature. It doesn't matter if it comes from a \nvolcano, it doesn't matter if it comes from the exhaust of a car. But \nbecause we have added such an enormous increment in recent years, since \n1880 and the Industrial Revolution, we can see that as the parts per \nmillion of particles go up over time--this is the CO2 \nconcentration over that time period from the Industrial Revolution to \ntoday. It is actually not quite up to date because, unfortunately, we \nare now up here above 400 parts per million. Over that same time \nperiod, the average temperature has gone up year in and year out, with \nfluctuations, but the trendline continues to go up to a very dangerous \nlevel.\n  Adding an additional increment of carbon pollution is simply not \nsomething we can afford at a time when we need to be showing real \nleadership in terms of cleaning up our energy sources, moving forward \nto a clean energy future, and putting Americans to work here, \ndomestically, with that approach.\n  The temporary jobs this tar sands pipeline will create are not \ninconsequential. But since this has been sold as a jobs program, it is \nworth stepping back and talking about how much of a permanent impact \nthis is going to make. I would make the argument that if we were truly \nserious here in the U.S. Senate about the type of temporary \nconstruction jobs this pipeline would create, we would get serious \nabout passing a transportation bill--and not only passing a \ntransportation bill, but financing transportation in this country, \nfinancing infrastructure in this country the way we have historically.\n  We have a deficit of trillions of dollars worth of infrastructure at \nthis point in this country because we won't pay to maintain it. In \nfact, our parents' generation built an infrastructure that is the envy \nof the world. With the current approach in the Congress, we haven't \neven had the decency to maintain the infrastructure they built and pass \nit on to our children unimpaired, much less create additional \ninfrastructure of the type we saw from previous generations.\n  So if we look at the permanent jobs, as articulated in the \nenvironmental impact statement, we are talking about 30 to 50 permanent \njobs from Keystone. That is slightly less than a single McDonald's, \nalthough I would argue that construction jobs are usually higher paying \nthan McDonald's. But it gives us a sense of the kind of scale we are \ntalking about in terms of permanent jobs. If we compare that to just \nregional projects in individual States--a transmission line in the \nSouthwest, three times as many jobs as that; an electric vehicle plant \nin the West in Nevada, substantially many, many increments of permanent \njobs more, which once again brings us to the fact that in this \nrecovery, just in the third quarter of 2014, we saw 18,000 in clean \nenergy jobs created in this country.\n  We need jobs in this country. We need energy in this country. And I \nwould argue that the sooner we commit ourselves to a clean energy job-\nintensive future, the sooner we will address the real challenges that \nare in front of us.\n  I continue to urge the President to exercise his discretion and his \nveto of this. I suspect it will pass the U.S. Senate. But the sooner we \nget through this process, my hope is that we can return to a real \ndebate about how we address the science that all the scientists have \nsaid is out there. We did make a big step forward yesterday in that the \nSenate for the first time--and the Republicans in the Senate in \nparticular for the first time--accepted the reality of climate change. \nUnfortunately, right now the policy prescription is to make that \nclimate change worse.\n  It is time we had an Apollo project for clean energy in this country. \nThat will take transition. That means we are going to continue to \nproduce fossil fuels as a part of that transition. But the sooner we \nget serious about investing in research and development, the sooner we \nget serious in terms of scaling the very real and economically \ncompetitive technologies we already have, the sooner we get serious \nabout building infrastructure, such as transmission lines to carry \nrenewable energy from parts of the country where it can be produced \ntoday to parts of the country where it will be consumed, the sooner we \nwill lead the world and put this country back on track to be the world \nleader in not only energy but in clean energy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              Roe v. Wade\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today is the anniversary of a tragedy. \nForty-two years ago today, the Supreme Court announced its creation of \na right to abortions for virtually any reason at all virtually at any \ntime. The result of that decision is a tragedy for our society, for our \nculture, and for our precious life lost.\n\n[[Page S389]]\n\n  Since even before America's founding, the law was on a steady march \ntoward protecting human beings before birth. In the 19th century, \nmedical professionals and civil rights activists led a movement that \nsucceeded in prohibiting abortion in every State except to save the \nmother's life. America had reached a consensus on the importance of \nprotecting the most vulnerable. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court swept \nall of that aside, imposing upon the country a permissive abortion \nregime that the American people to this day have never chosen or \naccepted.\n  The debate over the morality and legality or policy of abortion \nbegins with one inescapable fact--every abortion kills a living human \nbeing. Many have tried mightily to avoid, obscure, distract from, or \nignore that fact, but it will not go away. Every abortion kills a \nliving human being. That fact informed President Ronald Reagan when he \nwrote a moving essay titled ``Abortion and the Conscience of the \nNation'' in 1983.\n  He wrote, ``We cannot diminish the value of one category of human \nlife--the unborn--without diminishing the value of all human life.'' \nThe real question, President Reagan said, is not about when human life \nbegins, but about the value of human life. I believe that remains the \nreal question today.\n  Today the United States is one of only seven nations in the world to \nallow abortion into the sixth month of pregnancy and beyond. That list \nof nations includes such champions of human rights as China and North \nKorea. Yet, in 1948, the United States voted in favor of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights, which recognizes in its preamble the \ninherent dignity and inalienable rights of ``all members of the human \nfamily.''\n  Article 3 of the declaration states that ``everyone has a right to \nlife.'' Words such as ``universal'' and ``inherent'' and ``all'' are \nunambiguous and clear.\n  Our embrace of the inherent dignity and worth of all human beings in \n1948 stands in jarring contrast to the Supreme Court's decision in Roe \njust 25 years later, that the life of any human being may be ended \nbefore birth.\n  The Supreme Court might have thought in 1973 that it was settling the \nabortion issue. By 1992, however, the Court conceded that the rules it \ncreated in Roe simply did not work and issued revised regulations in a \ncase titled Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The Court said then that the \ncontending sides in the abortion controversy should ``end their \nnational division by accepting a common mandate rooted in the \nConstitution.''\n  National division on any issue, let alone one so profound as the \ntaking and the value of human life, will not end simply because the \nCourt says so. The division over abortion not only continues, but has \nremained largely unchanged even after dozens of Supreme Court decisions \nand four decades of insisting that abortion is a constitutional right.\n  The Supreme Court can render opinions on constitutionality, but it is \nlimited in its ability to forge lasting consensus. That is the \nprovenance of our great deliberative bodies where the people are truly \nrepresented.\n  More than 70 percent of Americans believe abortion should be illegal \nin most or all circumstances. That figure has not changed in 40 years. \nWhat has changed is that more Americans today identify themselves as \npro-life than pro-choice. Large majorities favor a range of limitations \non abortion and last November elected scores of new pro-life Senators \nat both the State and Federal level.\n  We must not avoid the fundamental question of the value of human \nlife, for no question is more important. Do we still, as we once did, \nbelieve that every human being has inherent dignity and worth?\n  Two nights ago, in his State of the Union Address, President Obama \nspoke about the values that are at stake in the public policy choices \nwe must make. Is there any value more important than life itself? He \nspoke about expanding opportunities for individuals, but the first \nopportunity that must be secured is the opportunity for life itself.\n  For many, the right to abortion is a symbol of progress. However, the \nidea that an act resulting in killing a living human being should be \nheld up as a step forward, as a light to guide our way, strikes me as \ndeeply misguided. We should instead be deepening the conviction that \nall human beings have inherent dignity and worth. That has been and \nshould remain the foundation of our culture, society, and even our \npolitics.\n  In his 1983 essay, President Reagan wrote that ``we cannot survive as \na free nation when some men decide that others are not fit to live and \nshould be abandoned to abortion.''\n  Today's tragic anniversary is a reminder of how our Nation's survival \ndepends on respecting the essential dignity and worth of every human \nindividual. Resting in the balance is how we ultimately define who we \nare as a people and what we strive to be as a nation.\n  This is an important issue. It is not one that should be slighted \nover. It is an issue that should strike at the heart of every person in \nthis body. It is an issue that we all should stand up to strengthen and \nfight against in the case of this issue of abortion.\n  I am so grateful that so many people feel the same way, and that more \nand more people in this country are starting to realize every human \nlife is important and that this society has sometimes gotten off track \nand not respected the rights of human beings. I think Roe v. Wade led \nus there, and we should be let out of Roe v. Wade by those who know \nthere is a better way to have the sensitivity that society deserves to \nhave, should have, and I believe will have in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Presiding Officer. I heard the words of my \nfriend, and he was eloquent in his remarks, but I don't think he would \nbe surprised to know that I see this issue very differently.\n  Before Roe v. Wade was decided in the 1970s, women died because they \ncould not end a pregnancy even if they were raped. There are bodies \nburied in America, and we don't know the cause of death because if a \nwoman tried to end an unwanted pregnancy--sometimes as a result of rape \nor even incest--she would be considered a criminal. And that is what \nyou hear from my colleagues on the other side. They say, let's go back \nto the last century--let's undo Roe v. Wade.\n  It is hard for me to believe that here I stand in this century \narguing that women should be respected, that families should be \nrespected, and that everyone's religion should be respected. I support \na woman's right to choose, and that means if your religion says you \nwill never end an unwanted pregnancy, I support you.\n  I believe this decision should be between a woman, her doctor, her \nfamily, and her God. I don't think any Senator should get in the middle \nof a woman's private life. It is dangerous to do so, it is wrong to do \nso, and to do so in the name of doing something that is going to help \nthe family--it doesn't make sense to me.\n  The Republican Party used to be the party of individual freedom and \nindividual rights. When I was on the board of Planned Parenthood so \nmany years ago, before Roe v. Wade, do you know who was very active and \non their board? George Herbert Walker Bush. This was an issue that was \nembraced by Republicans and Democrats--individual respect and rights \nfor women and caring about a woman's health. It was not a partisan \nissue.\n  I don't see how interfering with a woman's health, or her right to \nchoose, in any way is helpful to her in a time of need. It should be \nher decision within the law. We don't want to go back to the last \ncentury.\n  I was glad to see that the Republicans in the House pulled a bill off \nthe floor because it was so nasty to women. It didn't even allow women \nthe right to terminate a pregnancy at a certain date if the woman was a \nvictim of rape. They pulled it, but then they replaced it with another \nterrible bill that also limits a woman's right to choose.\n  My Republican friends would make doctors criminals and put them in \njail for years and years. They would make women criminals. They have \neven had a bill that said that a grandmother should be put in jail if \nshe helps her granddaughter. As a grandmother, that was too much for \nme. How dare some Senator come down here and tell a\n\n[[Page S390]]\n\ngrandma what to do for her granddaughter? This is the party of \nindividual freedom that always decries too much government? Come on. \nThis is putting the government right in the middle of our most personal \ndecisions. It never used to be that way, but that is the way it is now.\n  Everyone deserves respect for their views. They should not be taunted \nfor their views, and that is why the right to choose makes so much \nsense. You don't tell someone that the government says you must do A, \nB, or C. You tell the person within the law--within Roe, which was a \nmodest decision at the time--you make a decision, we respect that \ndecision, and we don't need to know about it.\n  Putting Senators in the middle of our private lives is not why I came \nto the Senate. We have a lot of work to do. We have to work on good \njobs. We have to pass a highway bill. We have to make sure this planet \nis habitable for people. Talk about kindness. Think about future \ngenerations who have to live on a planet that is increasingly \ninhospitable. Scientists tell us if we don't do anything about climate, \nat the end of the day it may be an uninhabitable planet.\n\n  We have a lot of work to do. We all do. It seems to me we should \nstart off by doing what government should do, not putting ourselves in \nthe middle of private lives.\n  Again, I greatly respect my colleagues whose views are different than \nmine. All I ask them to think about is this: If we embrace the right to \nchoose, then we are saying to women all over America that this is a \ntough decision and we understand that. Make it with your God. Make it \nwith your loved ones. But we are not going to be right there in the \nmiddle of people's living rooms telling them what we think is right, \nbecause that is not why we were elected.\n  I am glad I happened to be on the floor to follow the remarks of \nSenator Hatch. I feel very strongly about this. As many of my \ncolleagues know, the Democratic women of the Senate and several of our \nRepublican women colleagues will continue to fight against saying to a \nwoman that she has no right to make a most private, most personal \ndecision without satisfying U.S. Senators, most of whom are men, by the \nway. It is just not right.\n  Speaking of polls, because I think Senator Hatch mentioned one, \npeople want us to have a moderate approach on this. They don't want \nabortion on demand and neither does any pro-choice Senator. Roe v. Wade \nspelled it out. In the early stages we know a woman has that right; \nlater, only if her health or her life is threatened. It is pretty \nmodest. It makes sense. Leave it alone. That decision was made in 1973. \nDon't turn the clock back in this century.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING THE OIL SPILL LIABILITY \n                   TRUST FUND.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Congress should approve a bill to ensure that all forms \n     of bitumen or synthetic crude oil derived from bitumen are \n     subject to the per-barrel excise tax associated with the Oil \n     Spill Liability Trust Fund established by section 9509 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986;\n       (2) it is necessary for Congress to approve a bill \n     described in paragraph (1) because the Internal Revenue \n     Service determined in 2011 that certain forms of petroleum \n     are not subject to the per-barrel excise tax;\n       (3) under article I, section 7, clause 1 of the \n     Constitution, the Senate may not originate a bill to raise \n     new revenue, and thus may not originate a bill to close the \n     legitimate and unintended loophole described in paragraph \n     (2);\n       (4) if the Senate attempts to originate a bill described in \n     paragraph (1), it would provide a substantive basis for a \n     ``blue slip'' from the House of Representatives, which would \n     prevent advancement of the bill; and\n       (5) the House of Representatives, consistent with article \n     I, section 7, clause 1 of the Constitution, should consider \n     and refer to the Senate a bill to ensure that all forms of \n     bitumen or synthetic crude oil derived from bitumen are \n     subject to the per-barrel excise tax associated with the Oil \n     Spill Liability Trust Fund established by section 9509 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 78, as Modified\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify the \nBlunt amendment, No. 78, with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING BILATERAL OR OTHER \n                   INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS REGARDING GREENHOUSE \n                   GAS EMISSIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) On November 11, 2014, President Barack Obama and \n     President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China \n     announced the ``U.S.-China Joint Announcement on Climate \n     Change and Clean Energy Cooperation'' (in this section \n     referred to as the ``Agreement'') reflecting ``the principle \n     of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective \n     capabilities, in light of different national circumstances''.\n       (2) The Agreement stated the United States intention to \n     reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by one-quarter by 2025 \n     while allowing the People's Republic of China to double its \n     greenhouse gas emissions between now and 2030.\n       (3) Analyses have shown that policies limiting greenhouse \n     gas emissions lead to a material increase in electricity \n     prices.\n       (4) The people of China will not see similar electricity \n     price increases as they continue to emit without limit for \n     the foreseeable future, at least until 2030.\n       (5) Increases in the price of electricity can cause job \n     losses in the United States industrial sector, which includes \n     manufacturing, agriculture, and construction.\n       (6) The price of electricity is a top consideration for job \n     creators when locating manufacturing facilities, especially \n     in energy-intensive manufacturing such as steel and aluminum \n     production.\n       (7) Requiring mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions in \n     the United States while allowing nations such as China and \n     India to increase their greenhouse gas emissions results in \n     jobs moving from the United States to other countries, \n     especially to China and India, and is economically unfair.\n       (8) Imposing disparate greenhouse gas emissions commitments \n     for the United States and countries such as China and India \n     is environmentally irresponsible because it results in \n     greater emissions as businesses move to countries with less \n     stringent standards.\n       (9) Union members, families, consumers, communities, and \n     local institutions like schools, hospitals, and churches are \n     hurt by the resulting job losses.\n\n[[Page S391]]\n\n       (10) The poor, the elderly, and those on fixed incomes are \n     hurt the most by increased electricity rates.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Agreement negotiated between the President and the \n     President of the People's Republic of China has no force and \n     effect in the United States;\n       (2) the Agreement between the President and the President \n     of the People's Republic of China is a bad deal for United \n     States consumers, workers, families, and communities, and is \n     economically unfair and environmentally irresponsible;\n       (3) the Agreement, as well as any other bilateral or \n     international agreement regarding greenhouse gas emissions \n     such as the United Nation's Framework Convention on Climate \n     Change in Paris in December 2015, requires the advice and \n     consent of the Senate and must be accompanied by a detailed \n     explanation of any legislation or regulatory actions that may \n     be required to implement the Agreement and an analysis of the \n     detailed financial costs and other impacts on the economy of \n     the United States which would be incurred by the \n     implementation of the Agreement;\n       (4) the United States should not agree to any bilateral or \n     other international agreement on greenhouse gases that \n     imposes disproportionate and economically harmful commitments \n     on the United States.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 126, as Modified, to Amendment No. 2\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       In section 2 of the amendment, strike subsection (e) and \n     insert the following:\n       (e) Private Property Protection.--Land or an interest in \n     land for the pipeline and cross-border facilities described \n     in subsection (a) may only be acquired from willing sellers \n     and consistently with the Constitution.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 99 to Amendment No. 2\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING CLIMATE CHANGE.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that Congress is in agreement \n     with the opinion of virtually the entire worldwide scientific \n     community and a growing number of top national security \n     experts, economists, and others that--\n       (1) climate change is real;\n       (2) climate change is caused by human activities;\n       (3) climate change has already caused devastating problems \n     in the United States and around the world;\n       (4) the Energy Information Administration projects that \n     fossil fuels will continue to produce 68 percent of the \n     electricity in the United States through 2040; and\n       (5) it is imperative that the United States invest in \n     research and development for clean fossil fuel technology.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 113 to amendment No. 2.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress regarding federally \n                            protected land)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING FEDERALLY PROTECTED \n                   LAND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Presidents of both parties have designated public land \n     to preserve the land for current and future generations and \n     to honor the national heritage of the United States, and that \n     designated public land includes--\n       (A) the Statue of Liberty;\n       (B) the Grand Canyon;\n       (C) Acadia National Park;\n       (D) African Burial Ground National Monument;\n       (E) the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal National Historical Park;\n       (F) Muir Woods National Monument;\n       (G) Arches National Park; and\n       (H) Devils Tower National Monument;\n       (2) outdoor recreation, including recreation within Federal \n     land, adds over $600,000,000,000 into the economy of the \n     United States and supports more than 6,000,000 jobs;\n       (3) Federal land, such as National Parks, National \n     Monuments, or other federally designated land, conserves \n     historic, cultural, environmental, scenic, recreational, and \n     biological resources, and positive impacts include--\n       (A) economic opportunities and small business creation;\n       (B) local tourism in gateway communities;\n       (C) new direct and indirect employment opportunities;\n       (D) recreational opportunities; and\n       (E) environmental, historic, and educational opportunities; \n     and\n       (4) regions surrounding National Monuments have seen \n     continued growth or improvement in employment and person \n     income.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) Congress should acknowledge the benefit that public \n     land designations provide to local and regional communities \n     and economies; and\n       (2) designations of federally protected land should \n     continue where appropriate and with consultation by local \n     communities, bipartisan elected leaders, and interested \n     stakeholders.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 minutes just \nbefore the vote starts to explain this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want \nto make sure we understand the vote was scheduled to begin 3 minutes \nago. As part of the unanimous consent agreement, there was not a time \nallowed for Senator Boxer to speak. I don't have a problem in giving--\n--\n  Mrs. BOXER. Excuse me for interrupting. I assume we have at least a \nminute to talk about our amendment.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I am happy to make sure that is allowed. It wasn't \nincluded in the consent, but I am certainly happy to allow for the \nminute as Senator Boxer has asked.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you. I have a minute. I actually asked for three, \nbut as I understand, I have a minute. Is that where we are?\n  I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you so much. I know what a hard job it is to get \nthis bill moving, and I am trying to be very helpful. I am offering an \namendment I didn't expect to offer because basically my amendment says \nthat we should acknowledge the benefit that parks provide to our local \nand regional communities and their economies for small business and \nenhanced local tourism and how much they contribute to employment and \nprovide opportunities to\n\n[[Page S392]]\n\nour families. Can my colleagues imagine America without Yosemite, \nYellowstone, Grand Canyon, the Statue of Liberty, Natural Bridges in \nUtah, Scottsbluff in Nebraska, Muir Woods in California, Glacier Bay in \nAlaska?\n  These were all protected by Republican and Democratic Presidents, and \nin many cases, by Congress. Why do I offer this? It seems to me we \nshouldn't have to argue about this. It is because my friend, the \nSenator from Nebraska, Mrs. Fischer, has an amendment that I think is \nvery dangerous. I know she modified it, and I appreciate that, but at \nthe end of the day, it is so vague that I think it is going to lead us \nright to the courthouse door.\n  For example, if a President now or in the future, Democratic or \nRepublican, decided in California--because the community really wanted \nit--to declare a national monument as we just had recently, in many \ncases, I would tell you this: Under this Fischer amendment, what would \nhappen is there would have to be under consideration what does this do \nto other monuments, to other parks, to the budget deficit.\n  If someone who did not like this said, I am taking this to court \nbecause the President didn't consider this, you would not have any more \nnational monuments, and you would not have all the beautiful iconic \nthings we have such as the Grand Canyon and Scottsbluff. I think it is \na bad amendment. I know my friend is trying to make a point, but I \nthink we should defeat it and pass the Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to a vote in relation to amendment No. 113, offered by the \nSenator from California, Mrs. Boxer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, our national parks are facing $13 \nbillion in maintenance needs. The entire Federal land of States is \nlooking at $22 billion in needs. We want to keep these resources and \nparks open for our children and grandchildren to marvel at and enjoy.\n  All of us have unique and special areas within our States, but we in \nCongress have the responsibility to care for the natural resources of \nour country.\n  This amendment has been softened so that the limitations are now just \nconsiderations. Let's vote yes on this amendment to take care of the \nresources we have so that future generations can enjoy them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I rise in opposition to this amendment. This amendment \nwould open the courthouse door over disputes of whether to place worthy \nlands under protection because of challenges that there are not enough \nresources or certain issues were not considered ahead of time.\n  Let me give one concrete example. A little over 1 year ago the \nPresident designated the Harriet Tubman Park as a national historic \nmonument. It was a prerequisite to becoming a national park. That could \nhave been challenged in the courts and it could have prevented the \nprotection of that land. That could have been done.\n  What this amendment does--and it was not intended to do that--is add \nadditional bureaucracy to the protection of worthy lands. I urge my \ncolleagues to reject this amendment. I think it will do harm to the \nprotection of necessary lands in our country.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

We can all agree we need to\n\n[[Page S393]]\n\nact to address the potentially devastating impact of climate change. \nThe Energy Information Administration predicts the United States will \ncontinue to rely on fossil fuels for almost 68 percent of our energy \nthrough 2040. That is right, the Department of Energy.\n  My amendment basically says that right now the only baseload fuels we \nhave are coal and nuclear and that is going to expand to natural gas.\n  What we are asking for is we need a Federal commitment from the \nPresident to Congress to invest in the research and development of \nfossil energy so we can use the cleanest and most environmentally \nresponsible way possible and find that technology to do it so we are \nresponsible.\n  My amendment does recognize these facts. I ask for a ``yea'' vote and \nappreciate your support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the Manchin amendment is a side-by-side \nto my amendment, which will follow.\n  The first three provisions are exactly the same: Climate change is \nreal, it is caused by human activity, and it is already causing \ndevastating problems.\n  We agree on that. But what my amendment says, importantly, is that \naccording to the scientific community, it is imperative the United \nStates transform its energy system away from fossil fuel to energy \nefficiency and sustainable energy as quickly as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we had a robust discussion yesterday on \ntwo amendments that dealt with the issue of climate change. I think we \nhad a very clear and resounding vote on the one that had a perfectly \nreasonable statement that climate change is real; climate change is not \na hoax.\n  I also supported the amendment of my colleague from North Dakota on \nthis same topic. I think it was important that we had that debate.\n  What I am hoping we can do now is get beyond the discussion as to \nwhether climate change is real and talk about: What do we do? How do we \nmove forward to those technologies? How do we make a difference with \nreasonable steps such as greater efficiency, a no-regrets energy policy \nthat makes our energy supply even cleaner.\n  I want to move on to that. But I think at this point in time, with \nwhat we have had in front of us, we could have a whole series of \namendments that basically restate the same thing.\n  I would like to move us beyond that conversation, and I look forward \nto that. But at this time I move to table, and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute to \nreply.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is my understanding that a motion to \ntable is not debatable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not debatable. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I am asking for unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is asking for \nunanimous consent.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, the original agreement said that, \nfurther, that all these amendments be limited to 60-vote affirmative \nthreshold adoption, except for Cornyn and Menendez, and that no second-\ndegrees be in order. So the original agreement we entered into allowed \nfor this vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent agreement was for a vote \nin relation to each amendment, and the motion to table is in order.\n\n\n                              Quorum Call\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll, and the following Senators \nentered the Chamber and answered to their names:\n\n                          [Quorum No. 2 Leg.]\n\n                                PRESENT\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Bennet\n     Blumenthal\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Boxer\n     Burr\n     Cantwell\n     Capito\n     Cardin\n     Cassidy\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coons\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Cotton\n     Cruz\n     Daines\n     Donnelly\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Ernst\n     Feinstein\n     Fischer\n     Flake\n     Franken\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heinrich\n     Heitkamp\n     Hirono\n     Hoeven\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     King\n     Kirk\n     Klobuchar\n     Lankford\n     Manchin\n     Markey\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson\n     Perdue\n     Peters\n     Portman\n     Rounds\n     Rubio\n     Sanders\n     Sasse\n     Schumer\n     Scott\n     Shelby\n     Stabenow\n     Sullivan\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Tillis\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n     Warren\n     Whitehouse\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are walking down a very dangerous road \nas a nation when we reject the findings of the vast majority of \nscientists on one of the most important issues facing humanity, which \nis climate change.\n  A vote to table this amendment is a vote to reject science, and that \nis a very bad idea for the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, for the same reasons that I just \nexpressed in the previous amendment that was before us, I would suggest \nthat we move to table this amendment.\n  I will make that motion now to table the Sanders amendment, and I \nwould ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is still 30 seconds remaining for the \nSenator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. This is a vote that our kids and grandchildren who will \nhave to live with the consequences of climate change will remember.\n\n[[Page S394]]\n\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is now 2 minutes of debate prior to a \nvote in relation to amendment No. 71, offered by the Senator from Utah, \nMr. Lee.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I stand to urge my colleagues to support this \namendment. The purpose of this amendment is to expedite the process by \nwhich the Bureau of Land Management processes applications for a permit \nfor drilling on Federal land. We all know that drilling and the \nproduction of oil and natural gas in our country on Federal lands is an \nessential activity for our energy security and therefore for our \nnational security.\n  The fact is that although these applications are supposed to be \nhandled in an expedited manner, they are not. The average right now for \nthem to be processed is about 7\\1/2\\ months. That is too long. We need \na simple up-or-down ruling by the Bureau of Land Management, especially \ngiven the fact that these lands, once they get to this stage, have \nalready been deemed by the Bureau of Land Management as suitable for \noil and gas leasing. I therefore urge each of my colleagues to support \nthis amendment and thereby secure our energy security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, speaking against the Lee amendment, I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to oppose this because it is an amendment \nrelating to oil and gas permits on Federal land. I guess if colleagues \nwant to keep trying to loosen environmental regulations, then maybe \nthey should support this amendment.\n  This amendment would impose new limitations on the Secretary of the \nInterior and their ability to process permits for drilling and provides \na waiver for the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered \nSpecies Act if necessary reviews have not been completed by an \narbitrary deadline, and it waives judicial review of these actions.\n  So I encourage my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wish to remind Members that we are \ntrying to keep a schedule here. We have six more amendments to go in \nthis stack, and we are supposedly at 10-minutes per amendment. We have \nnot been following that. I urge Members to stick close so we can move \nmore expeditiously.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 123, offered by \nthe Senator from Alaska, Ms. Murkowski.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we have the sense of the Senate that \nwould express that all forms of bitumen or synthetic crude should be \nsubject to the 8-cent-per-barrel excise tax associated with the \noilspill liability trust fund. This is important because right now we \nhave a legitimate but unintended loophole on the books, and it is also \na matter of fairness because conventional oil pays into the trust fund. \nWe need to address this, and I commend my colleague Senator Wyden for \nthe effort he has done. But the problem that we have is that as we work \nto enact legislation to update our laws, we have to make sure it is \nconsistent with the Constitution, which requires revenue-raising \nmeasures to originate in the House.\n  If we agree that we want to close this loophole, which we should do, \nwe need to allow for the House to address this. Otherwise, we face a \nblue slip issue, and quite honestly, it would act as a poison pill to \nthe Keystone XL bill. The sense of the Senate expresses to do it \nlegitimately through the Constitution.\n\n[[Page S395]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am glad Senator Murkowski has now agreed \nthat the outlandish tar sands loophole, which rips off taxpayers and \ncommunities, must be closed. The difference between our amendments is \nthat Senator Murkowski's amendment is a nonbinding resolution to close \nthe loophole sometime down the road. My amendment, in contrast, closes \nthe loophole now.\n  The argument Senator Murkowski makes against my amendment is that it \nis a revenue measure that should start in the House. The fact is that \nthere is a House revenue measure at the Senate desk right now that I \nwould be happy to call up and amend as a substitute to my amendment to \nclose the loophole that ends the tar sands double standard harming our \ncommunities and taxpayers. That way we will be acting in a \nconstitutional fashion and the Senate makes clear we want to close the \nloophole today.\n  I will close by saying that until I can propound the unanimous \nconsent request to do just that, I intend to go along with the \nMurkowski amendment. After its consideration, I hope my colleagues will \nvote for my amendment because closing this flagrant tax loophole is too \nimportant to wait.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I \nwould hope people would be respectful of their colleagues and stay \nclose to the floor and vote during the 10 minutes.\n  We have actually reached a milestone here that I think is noteworthy \nfor the Senate. We just cast our 15th rollcall vote on an amendment on \nthis bill, which is more votes--more rollcall votes on amendments than \nthe entire Senate in all of 2014.\n  I particularly want to commend Chairman Murkowski and Senator \nCantwell for their fair and open process that has been engaged in. This \nis the way the Senate ought to work.\n  Now the question I know on everyone's mind is: What do we do next? \nRight? It is Thursday night. We have a current tranche of amendments. \nWe are having a little difficulty getting our friends on the other side \nof the aisle to offer their amendments so they can be considered.\n  In order to consider amendments, they need to be offered. So here is \nwhere we are for the evening: We are going to finish this tranche. \nChairman Murkowski is interested in setting up an additional tranche of \namendments tonight. Once she has been able to set up an additional \ntranche of amendments for tonight, we will be able to announce the way \nforward for later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first, I want to thank the majority leader \nfor the compliment which he has placed to the constructive minority in \nthe Senate. We know that under the rules of the Senate, this procedure \ncould have been stopped at any moment by any Senator. Yet we have \nworked in good faith with the good leadership of Senator Murkowski, \nSenator Cantwell, and Senator Boxer. We want to continue to.\n  We have had a number of amendments considered here. Many of them had \nRepublican responses which we have accommodated. Many of your \namendments had Democratic responses which you have accommodated. I \nthink we have done that in good faith. We have not threatened any \nfilibusters. We have not tried to stop the process, and we do not want \nto. We think we have constructive amendments. We want to bring them \nforward. We would like to have a vote.\n  I agree with the Senator completely, this is a constructive use of \nthe Senate floor and the Senate procedure on a critical issue relative \nto our environment and energy policy in this country.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Illinois. He is entirely \ncorrect. We are open for business. When we finish this tranche, I hope \nSenators on both sides who have additional amendments to be considered \nwill come and offer them.\n  After we get an additional tranche of amendments that are pending, \nthen I think we will be in a better position to announce the way \nforward.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 27\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 27, offered by the \nSenator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it is very significant that more than 70 \nSenators just voted for a nonbinding resolution to close an outlandish \ntax loophole that favors Canadian tar sand producers over American oil \nand American taxpayers. That vote was for a nonbinding resolution. The \nnext amendment that I offer allows the Senate to actually eliminate the \nflagrant loophole now.\n  As for the blue-slip question, this amendment is an amendment that we \nought to pass now and then add to an appropriate House revenue measure. \nThis amendment, colleagues, ends the double standard today. To say to \nyour communities, to your taxpayers, and to your producers that Canada \nshould essentially get a free ride is not right. Let's actually do the \njob now.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, again, let me remind my colleagues that \nwhile we may agree we need to address this legal--but there is a \nloophole in the law. As many of us have just voted, 75 I believe, we \nsay we need to address this oilspill liability trust fund issue.\n  Doing so in the manner that the Senator from Oregon has suggested \ndoes create a blue-slip problem. It would cause this bill to fail. It \nis not constructive to do so. The sense of this Senate that we just \npassed, I think, sends clearly the message that we want to address it, \nbut we need to do it in a constitutional way. I would ask Members to \nvote no.\n\n[[Page S396]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, there is a constitutional point of order \nthat lies against the pending amendment.\n  It was filed and offered by my friend, the ranking member of the \nSenate Finance Committee, the senior Senator from Oregon.\n  A constitutional point of order lies against the amendment, numbered \n27 because it violates article 1, section 7, clause 1 of the \nConstitution, commonly referred to as the origination clause. The \norigination clause states that ``All Bills for raising Revenue shall \noriginate in the House of Representatives. . . . ''\n  In addition, the pending amendment is not germane to the bill we are \ndebating, and is not expected to pass. I reserve the right to raise \nthis constitutional point of order against amendment No. 27 in the \nunlikely event that it passes. I will hold off for now on raising this \npoint of order to spare the Senate an unnecessary vote.\n  However, I want to put everybody in the Senate on notice that, in the \nfuture, I reserve the right to raise this constitutional point of order \nregarding any proposal that violates the origination clause. In the \nSenate, revenue proposals should first be processed in the committee of \njurisdiction in the Senate, which is the Senate Finance Committee.\n  I will vote ``no'' on the pending amendment and urge my colleagues to \ndo the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate in \nrelation to amendment No. 78 offered by the Senator from Alaska, Ms. \nMurkowski, for the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Blunt.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I rise to support this amendment, \ncosponsored by Senator Inhofe, the chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee; by Senator Capito, the new chair of the \nSubcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety.\n  This amendment simply says the United States should not be bound by \ncommitments where we are the only party that has a commitment made in \nthe agreement with China. We agree to reduce emissions by 27 percent \nbetween now and a point in the future; the Chinese agree to increase \nemissions between now and 2030.\n  The amendment also says the President should have these kinds of \nagreements approved by the Senate. It also says the United States \nshould not enter any international agreements that are \ndisproportionately a disadvantage to us.\n  I urge support of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I will speak for the Senator from New \nJersey, although this is a foreign policy question in general.\n  Let me say this: In the next 10 years, 50 percent of the new \nbuildings that are going to be built in the world are going to be built \nin China. They are the most energy-inefficient buildings on the planet. \nSo when we reached an agreement through the President of the United \nStates to work together as a way to reduce energy consumption and \ngreenhouse gases, guess what is going to win. American business, \nAmerican product, and we are selling it to them because we have an \nagreement to work together to be more energy efficient.\n  So I don't want to slow down this President or any President in \ncutting deals to get U.S. products into markets because they agree we \nneed to deal with this issue. Please don't slow down the ability to get \nU.S. product into foreign markets. Oppose the Blunt amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 2 minutes equally divided\n\n[[Page S397]]\n\nprior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 126, offered by the \nSenator from Alaska, Ms. Murkowski, for the Senator from Texas, Mr. \nCornyn.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the next amendment following the Cornyn \namendment seeks to prohibit the use of eminent domain in the building \nof the Keystone XL Pipeline, but eminent domain is actually irrelevant \nto this bill. This is actually designed to confuse things and \nultimately end up being a poison pill. I think it is accurate to say \nthat the distinguished Senator from New Jersey is no fan of the \nKeystone XL Pipeline, so he wants to add this provision to the bill to \nmake it impossible, basically, to implement.\n  The bill doesn't authorize or mandate the use of eminent domain to \ntake any property; it simply approves a cross-border permit. The \ndecision on how the property should be taken should be and will be made \nby the individual States in a process overseen by State courts and \nsubject to the U.S. Constitution. My amendment simply reiterates that \nthe standard in the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution applies.\n  I ask all Senators to vote for the Cornyn amendment and to vote \nagainst the Menendez amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, what I am not a fan of is a foreign \ncompany coming to the United States and taking the property of U.S. \ncitizens. This amendment seems innocuous, but it embraces the seizure \nof private property for private gain to the full extent of the \nConstitution.\n  Ten years ago my dear friend from Texas decried the Kelo decision and \nadvocated for severely restricting the use of eminent domain for \nprivate gain. Now, with this amendment, he endorses it.\n  The Founders of our country and its Constitution never envisioned \nhaving a company from another country come to the United States and use \neminent domain to take the property of U.S. citizens for private \npurposes. That is what we are trying to avoid with the Menendez \namendment.\n  If you vote for the amendment by the Senator from Texas, you in \nessence will continue to allow the opportunity for any foreign company \nto come into the United States and take private property of U.S. \ncitizens for private purposes. That is not what we want to see.\n  Vote no on the Cornyn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This amendment protects private property from unjust \nseizure by foreign corporations using eminent domain proceedings \nagainst the will of those who are not willing sellers.\n  Let me read a letter from the Nebraska landowners to the majority \nleader.\n\n       Dear Senator McConnell, our farms and ranches are \n     definitely at risk of tar sands and benzene spills. We ask, \n     even knowing that you support the Keystone Pipeline, that you \n     vote for Senator Menendez's amendment that makes it clear \n     TransCanada cannot take land from unwilling sellers. We ask \n     you to stand up for our property rights and not permit \n     eminent domain be used for private gain.\n\n  I wish to yield the remainder of my time to Senator Tester.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I support the pipeline. I think it has a \nlot of good benefits, but make no mistake about it, if you do not \nsupport the Menendez amendment--and there are a lot of Aggies on the \nother side of the aisle. If you do not support this amendment, you will \nallow a foreign corporation--a foreign corporation--to come in and use \neminent domain to take the property. We don't want to go down this \nline.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the Senate has spoken on the preceding \namendment and overwhelmingly affirmed the Constitution as the only \nstandard that should apply under these circumstances.\n  The standard being proposed by the Senator from New Jersey is an \nanti-States rights amendment, and it is designed to be a poison pill on \nthis Keystone XL Pipeline, which he obviously does not support and \nwants to use every means to kill.\n  I would ask for a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ.

As the majority leader \nmentioned, we want to figure out what the next tranche--the next \ngrouping of amendments--will be, and then we will be able to figure out \nthe path forward.\n  It is the hope of myself and the ranking member of the committee that \nwe be able to get through a few more votes this evening, at a minimum, \nbut also to set up a more clearly defined path for the coming days \nahead, for tomorrow and Monday.\n  So I ask for the indulgence of Members as we call up a few amendments \nnow to get them pending, and then we will work together to figure out \nwhat those votes will actually look like--which votes we will actually \ntake up this evening.\n  Again, I think the opportunity to get amendments pending on both \nsides is good. It gives everybody an idea of the lay of the land and \ngives them a chance to look at the amendments we will bring up.\n  So at this point in time I wish to call up an amendment. When I have \nconcluded, I will turn it over to the ranking member and an amendment \nwill be called up on the Democratic side, and then we will come back to \nthis side. We will alternate back and forth to get these amendments \npending so Members can know what it is we have in this universe out \nthere.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 67 to Amendment No. 2\n\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment \nand call up Sullivan amendment No. 67.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Ms. Murkowski], for Mr. Sullivan, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 67 to amendment No. 2.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To restrict the authority of the Environmental Protection \n                    Agency to arm agency personnel)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

I turn to my colleague, Senator Cantwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I know our colleagues have been working throughout the \nday on these amendments, and I applaud them for their cooperation. As \nthe Senator from Alaska said, oftentimes these needed side-by-sides--\npeople need to see these. We have various committees that have been \ninvolved in these amendments, so I appreciate the patience of our \ncolleagues.\n  I think going back and forth tonight on getting another set of \namendments pending is a good idea because we have many Members on our \nside who have amendments they are very interested in having votes on. I \nappreciate them being here tonight. So I call on Senator Cardin to \noffer his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 75 to Amendment No. 2\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside to call up amendment No. 75.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Cardin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 75 to amendment No. 2.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide communities that rely on drinking water from a \n source that may be affected by a tar sands spill from the Keystone XL \n pipeline an analysis of the potential risks to public health and the \n          environment from a leak or rupture of the pipeline)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. COMMUNITY RIGHT TO PROTECT LOCAL WATER SUPPLIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) there are 2,537 wells within 1 mile of the proposed \n     Keystone XL pipeline, including 39 public water supply wells \n     and 20 private wells within 100 feet of the pipeline right of \n     way;\n       (2) 254 miles of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline would \n     traverse over the shallow Ogallala Aquifer, the largest \n     underground fresh water source in the United States, \n     underlying 8 States and 2,000,000 people, including 10.5 \n     miles where the groundwater lies at depths between 5 and 10 \n     feet and another 12.4 miles where the water table is at a \n     depth of 10 to 15 feet;\n       (3) on July 26, 2010, a pipeline ruptured near Marshall, \n     Michigan, releasing 843,000 gallons of tar sands diluted \n     bitumen into Talmadge Creek, flowing into the Kalamazoo \n     River;\n       (4) the Talmadge Creek tar sands spill is the costliest \n     inland oil spill cleanup in United States history, and the \n     Kalamazoo River continues to be contaminated from the spill;\n       (5) on March 29, 2013, the first pipeline of the United \n     States to transport Canadian tar sands to the Gulf Coast, the \n     ExxonMobil Pegasus Pipeline, ruptured, spilling 210,000 \n     gallons of tar sands diluted bitumen in Mayflower, Arkansas; \n     and\n       (6) following the Pegasus Pipeline tar sands spill, \n     individuals in the Mayflower community experienced severe \n     headaches, nausea, and respiratory infections.\n       (b) Petition To Protect Local Water Supplies.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 60 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act and prior to construction of the \n     pipeline described in section 2(a), the President, or the \n     designee of the President, shall provide to each municipality \n     or county that relies on drinking water from a source that \n     may be affected by a tar sands spill from the pipeline an \n     analysis of the potential risks to public health and the \n     environment from a leak or rupture of that pipeline.\n       (2) Notification to governors.--The President shall provide \n     a copy of the analysis described in paragraph (1) to the \n     Governor of each State in which an affected municipality or \n     county is located.\n       (3) Effect on construction.--Construction of the pipeline \n     described in section 2(a) may not begin if the Governor of a \n     State with an affected municipality or county submits, not \n     later than 30 days after receiving an analysis under \n     paragraph (2), a petition to the President requesting that \n     the pipeline not be located in the affected municipality or \n     county.\n       (4) Withdrawal.--A Governor may withdraw a petition \n     submitted under paragraph (3) at any time.\n       (5) Right of action.--A property owner with a private water \n     well drilled into any portion of an aquifer that is below the \n     proposed pipeline described in section 2(a) may sue the owner \n     of the pipeline for damages if--\n       (A) the well water of the property owner becomes \n     contaminated as a result of--\n       (i) construction activities associated with the pipeline; \n     or\n       (ii) a rupture in the pipeline; and\n       (B) the property owner demonstrates that the well water was \n     safe prior to construction and operation of the pipeline.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I will be very brief.\n  This is an important amendment, as it deals with the rights of \nproperty owners to clean water. The Ogallala Aquifer is the largest \naquifer in the western part of the United States, and the Keystone \nPipeline would bisect that. At some point the aquifer is only 5 feet \nfrom the surface. Private owners drill wells to get their drinking \nwater, and there is no protection in the event there is a spill. A \nspill is a real possibility. We have seen in prior cases in Michigan \nand Arkansas the impact of spills from this tar sands oil and the \ndamage it can cause.\n  My amendment is pretty straightforward. It allows our Governors to be \nable to challenge the safety of their drinking water. It is a States \nrights issue. It gives the property owners whose wells could be \ncontaminated by this the right of action. I ask my colleagues to \nfavorably consider this amendment.\n\n[[Page S399]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDINGS AND SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (referred \n     to in this section as ``LIHEAP'') is the main Federal program \n     that helps low-income households and senior citizens with \n     their energy bills, providing vital assistance during both \n     the cold winter and hot summer months.\n       (2) Recipients of LIHEAP assistance are among the most \n     vulnerable individuals in the country, with more than 90 \n     percent of LIHEAP households having at least one member who \n     is a child, a senior citizen, or disabled, and 20 percent of \n     LIHEAP households including at least one veteran.\n       (3) The number of households eligible for LIHEAP assistance \n     continues to exceed available funding, with current funding \n     reaching just 20 percent of the eligible population.\n       (4) The average LIHEAP grant covers just a fraction of home \n     energy costs, leaving many low-income families and senior \n     citizens struggling to pay their energy bills and with fewer \n     resources available to meet other essential needs.\n       (5) Access to affordable home energy is a matter of health \n     and safety for many low-income households, children, senior \n     citizens, and veterans.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that LIHEAP should be funded at not less than $4,700,000,000 \n     annually, to ensure that more low-income households and \n     children, senior citizens, individuals with disabilities, and \n     veterans can meet basic home energy needs.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this is a bipartisan amendment, which I am \nproud to sponsor with Senator Collins of Maine. It would express the \nsense of the Senate that we should fund LIHEAP, the Low Income Heating \nAssistance Program, at $4.7 billion. We have seen a significant \ndiminution of the LIHEAP funding over the years.\n  This amendment helps every aspect of the country. It helps low-income \nhouseholds, particularly seniors. It would help immensely families \nthroughout this country. In the winter it is about heating oil in New \nEngland and Alaska and all through the north and central plains. In the \nsummer it is about cooling in the southwest and the southeast. If \nfamilies and households can't get access to these resources, they have \nto make a hard choice between literally paying for their energy or \nsometimes their rent or sometimes their food. This program has been \nlong supported on a bipartisan basis. We should aim for this figure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

and\n       (3) transfer any remaining applicable projects and \n     nonduplicative functions into another green building program \n     within the same agency.\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, in its 2012 annual report on opportunities \nto reduce duplication and achieve savings, the GAO noted that in 2011 \nthere were 94 Federal initiatives to foster green buildings in the non-\nFederal sector. This report highlighted many initiatives that provided \nsimilar types of assistance, grants, technical assistance, tax credits, \nand so forth. This obviously doesn't sound like a recipe for proper \noversight if this is still going on 5 years later.\n  This amendment would help tackle the problem simply by requiring \nagencies to evaluate and eliminate duplicative green building programs \nconsistent with GAO's recommendations.\n  We ask GAO to study these things, and we often don't follow through \nand make sure the agencies follow up on the recommendations. This is \nsimply ensuring that happens.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL.

Mr. President, this is a measure that will allow a \nneeded beam of daylight to be shown on the politics behind this bill we \nare on. As everybody knows, it is a little bit unusual to some that the \nopening measure of the new Republican majority would be a project that \nadvantages a foreign oil company.\n  This measure would require the disclosure of political donations made \nby companies that stand to earn more than $1 million from this project. \nThis is the kind of information the U.S. Supreme Court has clearly said \ncitizens are entitled to know in order to make appropriate decisions, \nand in our democracy we should put our citizens first.\n  I will speak further about this amendment on a later occasion, and I \nyield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I call on the Senator from Delaware to offer his \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 121 to Amendment No. 2\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment to call up my amendment to the Murkowski substitute, \namendment No. 121.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Carper] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 121 to amendment No. 2.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To impose a fee of 8 cents per barrel on oil transported \n                         through the pipeline)\n\n       At the end of section 2, add the following:\n       (f) Fee.--\n       (1) In general.--A fee of 8 cents shall be imposed on each \n     barrel of oil transported through the pipeline referred to in \n     subsection (a).\n       (2) Use of fee revenue.--Revenue from the fee imposed under \n     paragraph (1) shall be deposited in the land and water \n     conservation fund established under section 200302 of title \n     54, United States Code.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President and colleagues, you will recall from our \ndebate earlier this evening concerns raised about the equity of--most \noil that is consumed and transported through this country or into this \ncountry pays a fee. It is an 8-cent-per-barrel fee that goes into the \noilspill liability fund. One source of oil that does not pay that 8-\ncent-per-barrel fee is derived from the oil sands. There has been some \ndiscussion of whether--I think there is a fair amount of agreement that \nthat does not seem right, it doesn't seem equitable, and it is not fair \nto assess an 8-cent-per-barrel fee on all these other sources of oil \nbut not apply that to oil derived from tar sands.\n  What I seek to suggest with my amendment is that an 8-cent-per-barrel \nfee be assessed on the oil derived from tar sands and the revenues \nderived therefrom would be deposited not in the oilspill liability fund \nbut rather in the land and water conservation fund which has been in \nexistence for many years.\n  I believe the balance in the oilspill liability fund is measured in \nthe billions of dollars. The balance in the land and water conservation \nfund is not. The moneys are much smaller, much more modest, and that \nmoney provides funding in all 50 States. Many of us know the need far \noutweighs the money appropriated every year for this program.\n  The land and water conservation fund is also established not just to \nprovide the revenues for national parks--and we are always looking for \nmoneys for national parks. We just expanded our national parks system. \nHow are we going to pay for that? The amendment I hope to offer would \nhelp to address that.\n  The land and water conservation fund was also established to help \nprotect rivers, lakes, and critical habitat for wildlife, areas that \nmay be impacted by the construction of this pipeline or a possible \nspill from this pipeline or from another spill.\n  Again, that is what I am asking. I will be concise. No fee is now \npaid on tar sands oil. I believe it should be the same as that which is \nassessed against other sources of oil.\n  What I would suggest is rather than put the moneys derived from that \n8 cents on the tar sands oil--rather than that money going into the \noilspill liability fund, which is quite robust, to instead deposit that \nin the land and water conservation fund where we could use it in all 50 \nStates for a variety of good purposes. That is the nature of my \namendment. I hope I have the opportunity to offer that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to turn to my colleague \nfrom Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 132 to Amendment No. 2\n\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside to call up amendment No. 132.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Daines] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 132 to amendment No. 2.\n\n  Mr. DAINES. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of Congress regarding the designation of \n                          National Monuments)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL \n                   MONUMENTS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the designation of \n     National Monuments should be subject to--\n       (1) consultation with each unit of local government within \n     the boundaries of which the proposed National Monument is to \n     be located; and\n       (2) the approval by the Governor and legislature of each \n     State within the boundaries of which the proposed National \n     Monument is to be located.\n\n  Mr. DAINES. In Montana we understand our resource use must be done \nresponsibly. We also know that Montanans who live and use the land \nevery day understand how to best protect these resources.\n  Unfortunately, the current administration, as well as past \nadministrations, both Republican and Democratic--their efforts to \nstretch the intent of the Antiquities Act threatens Montanans' ability \nto manage our State's resources. It is a trend we are seeing in other \nStates as well.\n  Too often these unilateral designations ignore the needs of the local \ncommunities, of sportsmen, of farmers and ranchers, small business \nowners who are directly impacted by these new designations.\n  The amendment I am offering simply expresses the sense of Congress \nthat all future national monument designations should be subject to \nconsultation with local governance and the approval of the Governor of \nthat State and the legislature of that State in which the designation \nwould occur.\n  This amendment ensures the people affected most by these designations \nhave a seat at the table and their voices are heard.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I would like to call on the Senator from Massachusetts \nto offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 25 to Amendment No. 2\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment to call up my amendment No. 25.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S403]]\n\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Markey], for himself \n     and Mr. Wyden, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Merkley, Mr. \n     Booker, and Ms. Baldwin, proposes an amendment numbered 25 to \n     amendment No. 2.\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To ensure that products derived from tar sands are treated as \n     crude oil for purposes of the Federal excise tax on petroleum)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. INCLUSION OF OIL DERIVED FROM TAR SANDS AS CRUDE \n                   OIL.\n\n       This Act shall not take effect prior to the date that \n     diluted bitumen and other bituminous mixtures derived from \n     tar sands or oil sands are treated as crude oil for purposes \n     of section 4612(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, \n     which may be established either by an Act of Congress or any \n     regulations, rules, or guidance issued by the Commissioner of \n     the Internal Revenue Service or the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (or the Secretary's delegate).\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. I ask that the amendment be put in order for debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we now have in front of us six \namendments that are pending on the Republican side, six amendments that \nare pending on the other side of the aisle. We indicated we wanted to \ntry to get these up, alternating back and forth. I think we have a \npretty good range in front of us. Recognizing that it is important \nMembers have an opportunity to take a look at the now 12 amendments \nthat are pending, I think it is our hope that we would be able to, as \nthe chairman and the ranking member, sit down and figure out how many \nof these we might be able to move to a vote this evening and dispense \nwith some of them.\n  I think it is pretty clear we will have a difficult time perhaps \nadvancing such a plan with everything tonight. So if we could have a \nlittle bit of time to work through an agreement to present to Members--\nI think right now people are taking a little bit of a break from the \nfloor activity, and that is appreciated, but I want to give them notice \nas to where we are.\n  It is my hope we will be able to come to an agreement relatively \nshortly in terms of how many amendments we might be able to take up and \nvote on this evening, thus giving Members a better chance as to whether \nwe are staying in for the long haul tonight or perhaps just for a \nshorter period, but we need a little bit of time to take a look at \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, we did go back and forth on these \namendments, but I heard Senator McConnell say he wanted Members to \noffer amendments. We have several Members who want to offer amendments. \nI hope there will be a time that those Members will be allowed to get \ntheir amendments pending before this body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from \nWashington stating that. This is by no means saying this is it for the \nnight. I am just saying give the floor managers an opportunity now, \nwith a dozen amendments that we have in front of us, to figure out what \nit is that we have. This would probably be a great time for people to \nspeak on either their amendments or other amendments that they might \nwish to bring pending, but I am not suggesting this is our finite list \nof amendments. This is what we have for this moment in time, having \ngone back and forth. That is all I am suggesting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I have a pending amendment. Does the \nSenator object to my bringing that up? I would like to bring that up; \ncan I do that?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think it was the intention of the \nranking member and myself that we go back and forth. We have done that, \nsix each time now. I don't have other Members on our side who are \neither present, which we have asked them to be, or have asked me to \noffer on their behalf. I am certainly not suggesting to the Senator \nfrom Vermont that he should not be allowed to get his amendment \npending. I am just trying to keep with the agreement we have that we go \nback and forth.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Would it be OK if I brought mine up and the Senator \ncould catch up to it later? I am sure there will be another one.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Through the Chair, I am sure we will have other \namendments. Again, I want to defer to the Senator's ranking member on \nthat as far as whether we bring it pending at this moment in time. It \nmight be possible after we reach our agreement that we have another set \nof back-and-forths to get these pending agreements put forward.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Barrasso). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 73\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, earlier this evening an amendment of mine \nwas made pending to the legislation that we now have before us, \namendment No. 73.\n  I thank my colleagues for allowing that amendment to become pending, \nand I look forward to the opportunity now, while we are determining the \nremainder of the evening's schedule, to describe the nature of \namendment No. 73.\n  I have a copy of the amendment in front of me. It is a short \nparagraph, but it is one that has significant consequences to the \npeople of Kansas. But in addition to the people of Kansas, it has \nsignificant consequence to the people of Colorado, New Mexico, \nOklahoma, and Texas.\n  The story we are talking about is the lesser prairie-chicken. In \nMarch of 2014, the lesser prairie-chicken was listed not as an \nendangered species but a threatened species under the Endangered \nSpecies Act.\n  It is true the numbers of birds declined in 2012 and 2013. The U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service had their explanation for why there was the \ndecline in the population of those birds, both those who live on the \nland but as well a number of wildlife experts--people who are very \ninterested in conservation practices in our State--believe and agree \nthat the primary reason behind the bird's decline in population was the \nhistoric and prolonged drought that our area of the country has \nexperienced in the past several years.\n  There is less habitat for birds generally in our State and across \nthis region of the country, but the reality is that it is because we \nhave had so little rainfall. We have been in a drought in a significant \npart of the Nation, in our part of the country, for a number of years, \nand as a result there is less habitat and a decline in the bird \npopulation. What many believe is that with the return of rainfall, with \nthe return of snow this winter and the moisture it will provide, we \nwill have increasing wildlife habitat for the lesser prairie-chicken \nand a large number of birds and other wildlife in our State and in the \nsurrounding States where this is a significant issue.\n  There are some exceptions that have been written into the \ndesignation, but the reality is that there are huge, ongoing, \nsignificant economic consequences to the listing as a threatened \nspecies of the lesser prairie-chicken in Kansas, Colorado, Oklahoma, \nNew Mexico, and Texas. Front and center of that, of course, are the \nconsequences to agriculture. It is how we earn a significant portion of \nour living in our State. Land values, for example, have dropped as a \nresult of this issue. Oil and gas exploration has been disrupted. Wind \nenergy projects that have been an important component of our State \neconomy and particularly a benefit to the economy of rural Kansas have \nbeen harmed as a result of this listing. These disruptions have driven \ndown county tax revenues that are used for essential services in some \nof the most challenging and difficult parts economically of our State, \nfrom damage to Main Street,\n\n[[Page S404]]\n\nand certainly harmed a portion of Kansas that always struggles to be \neconomically viable.\n  The listing, in my view, was based on an artificially low population \nestimate due to the drought I described. I guess I failed to mention \nthat 1 year ago this was a bird which could be hunted in Kansas. So, \nagain, it was prevalent enough to be able to be pursued by those who \nhunt, but because of the drought the population declined. In fact, \nevery Kansas county that is included in the habitat area was \nexperiencing a D3-Extreme or a D4-Exceptional drought, according to the \nU.S. Drought Monitor, again highlighting that what we need here is \nrainfall and moisture that comes from snow and rain and that listing \nthis as a threatened species doesn't create the moisture necessary to \ncreate the habitat for the return of the population of the bird.\n  What we really have asked for is an opportunity which has been \noffered and suggested by conservation groups in Kansas, by the Kansas \nDepartment of Wildlife and Parks, and by the Kansas Farm Bureau and \nothers to work together to find a solution short of this listing to \nincrease bird population in Kansas. And I assume that is true in the \nother States as well. We are looking for a cooperative effort to \nimprove habitat, and the fact is that the listing as a threatened \nspecies has been so disruptive that we have been unable to get what we \nwould say is a more commonsense, less broad-brush approach to solving \nthis problem in place as compared to the heavy hand of this listing. We \nstand ready, willing, and able to provide that kind of local effort to \nimprove habitat and bird population.\n  This amendment would not mean the lesser prairie-chicken would never \nbe listed again, but it gives Kansans and others the opportunity to go \nback and make certain that efforts at the local level are given a \nchance to work before the very dramatic and devastating implementation \nof this decision to list the bird as threatened.\n  So this is a relatively straightforward and simple amendment that \nwill take the lesser prairie-chicken off the list as a threatened \nspecies, give Kansans and others the opportunity to improve the \nhabitat, reduce the economic damage that is being done in our State and \nthe States that surround us as a result of this listing, and then give \nus the opportunity to again work with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService to find a better solution and one that, I might add, may be \nmore easily found once the rainfalls return to the State of Kansas.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the opportunity to describe this \namendment, and it is certainly my request and I look forward to it \nbeing an amendment that would be considered tonight, later this \nevening.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Remembering Wendell Ford\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I was saddened to learn today of the death \nof Senator Wendell Ford of Kentucky. Wendell Ford was a skilled \npolitical mind and as warm a human being as any U.S. Senator has ever \nbeen.\n  During my first 2 years in the U.S. Senate, Senator Ford was the \nassistant Democratic leader, the same job I have today. I was \nfortunate, able to learn by example from one of the best. And how \nfortunate the people of Kentucky and all Americans were to have had the \nbenefit of Wendell Ford's public service.\n  Senator Ford served in the Senate for nearly a quarter of a century. \nBefore that, he served the Bluegrass State as a State senator, \nGovernor, and lieutenant governor. He defended America in uniform \nduring World War II.\n  Maybe because he had already accomplished so much before he came to \nthe Senate, he never worried about headlines. Instead, he was content \nto work quietly, diligently, effectively--often with colleagues from \nacross the aisle--to solve problems.\n  The last desk Senator Ford occupied in the Senate was once occupied \nby another great Kentucky Senator, ``the great compromiser'' Henry \nClay. Like Henry Clay, Wendell Ford believed that compromise was \nhonorable and necessary in a democracy. But Wendell Ford also \nunderstood that compromise is, in Henry Clay's words, ``negotiated \nhurt.'' So Wendell Ford tried, whenever possible, to work out \ndisagreements between the scenes, away from the cameras, where Senators \ncould bend and still keep their dignity.\n  In 1991 Wendell's quiet bipartisan style convinced a Senator from \nacross the aisle, Mark Hatfield of Oregon, to join him in sponsoring \nthe motor voter bill. Working together, this Democrat and this \nRepublican Senator convinced the entire Senate it was time to pass this \nlandmark bill. To this day the motor voter bill remains the most \nambitious effort Congress has made since the Voting Rights Act of 1965 \nto open up the voting booth to more Americans.\n  Wendell Ford distinguished himself in the Senate as a determined foe \nof government waste and duplication and a champion of campaign finance \nreform.\n  His raspy voice was unmistakable. His good humor and wise counsel \nwere indispensable in some of the most important debates. He will be \nmissed.\n  I know our entire Senate sends their condolences to Senator Ford's \nwife Jean and to all of Senator Ford's family and friends.\n  I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to thank the senior Senator from \nIllinois for what he said about my dear friend Senator Wendell Ford.\n  I was fortunate to come here to the Senate the same year that Senator \nFord did. We were different in age, and I must say, different in \nexperience. He had a lot more experience than I did, and I relied on \nhis experience and his help. We traveled together, and we talked \ntogether so often. He had the unfailing characteristic of the best of \nthe Senators--both Republicans and Democrats. He always kept his word. \nHe was always very honest and direct with you. If he made a commitment, \nyou could go to the bank with it.\n  I remember the night we had a dinner for his retirement. There was a \ndozen of us that came in that year. There were only four left and three \nwere retiring that night--Wendell Ford, John Glen, and Dale Bumpers. It \nwas wonderful to listen to the three of them reminisce about the \nSenate.\n  I said to Wendell Ford at that time: Save me a seat on that lifeboat \nas you are leaving. I thought how lonely it would be without him. \nFortunately, I have a good friend like the senior Senator from Illinois \nto fill the void.\n  But Wendell Ford had probably more knowledge and sense of politics--\nnot just knowledge but sense--of how to work things out, how to get \nliberals and conservatives, Republicans and Democrats together, than \nmost people ever have.\n  He had a raspy voice, but he was good natured, with a sense of humor. \nAnd when I go back through the people I have met, the 300 or more \nSenators I have had the opportunity to serve with, I think of Wendell \nFord as one who epitomizes what a Senator should be.\n  I had talked to him just a few months ago. I will speak more about \nhim later on, but I think the Senator from Illinois has given probably \nas good a description of this wonderful man as any of the rest of us \nmight, and I thank him for that.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                              Quorum Call\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll, and the \nfollowing Senators entered the Chamber and answered to their names:\n\n[[Page S405]]\n\n                          [Quorum No. 3 Leg.]\n\n     Boozman\n     Cantwell\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Durbin\n     Hirono\n     Klobuchar\n     Leahy\n     Markey\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Perdue\n     Sanders\n     Sasse\n     Schumer\n     Tillis\n     Vitter\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

With the addition of Senators who did not \nanswer the quorum call, a quorum is now present.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Can we have order in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senate is not yet in order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My colleagues, here is the situation. Earlier today we \ncast our 15th rollcall vote on this bill. That is more votes than we \nhad on all amendments on the floor--rollcall votes--throughout all of \n2014. We have now voted on 19 rollcall amendments, and here is the \nsituation in which we find ourselves at 10 o'clock on Thursday night. \nThere are 12 amendments pending--6 Democratic amendments and 6 \nRepublican amendments--but our good friends on the other side will not \nagree to vote on their own amendments.\n  So we find ourselves in a unique situation. We have opened up the \nSenate for amendments for both sides. Our colleagues, both Republicans \nand Democrats, have had more rollcall votes on amendments than all of \nlast year combined. Yet our Democratic friends don't even want to agree \nto vote on the amendments they have pending.\n  We are left with only one way to avoid having to invoke cloture on \neach amendment, which would tie up the Senate for weeks, in order to \nprovide our colleagues on the other side an opportunity to vote on the \namendments they said they wanted to vote on. So there is really only \none way to go forward, and so what I am going to do is ask unanimous \nconsent that starting at 10 o'clock the Senate proceed to vote in \nrelation to the following amendments in the order listed: Sullivan No. \n67, Cardin No. 75, Murkowski No. 98, Reed No. 74, Flake No. 103, Leahy \nNo. 30; Cruz No. 15, Whitehouse No. 28, Moran No. 73, Carper No. 121, \nDaines No. 132, and Markey No. 25; further, that all amendments on this \nlist be subject to a 60-vote affirmative threshold for adoption and \nthat no second-degrees be in order to the amendments. I ask consent \nthat there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided between each vote and \nthat all votes after the first in the series be 10-minute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the \nmajority leader came to the floor this evening and commended the Senate \nfor the work we have done. He pointed out the constructive, bipartisan, \ngood-faith efforts that have been made on both sides. Earlier today we \ndisposed of 10 separate amendments, 5 on each side. Those amendments \nwere given to us yesterday. During the last 24 hours there has been \nactive negotiation back and forth on side-by-side amendments. In fact, \nthe Republican Senator from Missouri and the Republican Senator from \nNebraska asked to modify their amendments while they were still \npending. There was a good-faith effort to make these amendments ready \nfor floor consideration, and they were. They were brought before the \nSenate, and they were voted on in an orderly way. We all know that in \nthe rules of the Senate you can stop the train. No one did on this side \nof the aisle. We moved forward in an orderly way.\n  Now at 8 o'clock this evening, 12 more amendments have come forward, \n6 on each side. The majority leader is correct. What we are trying to \ndo, as we did with the previous 10 amendments, is to work through these \nin an orderly fashion, and we propose that we start considering them \ntomorrow morning.\n  Those who are interested in--the staff who are interested, the \nMembers who are interested can work to put these 12 amendments in \norder. We will start working on them as early as the majority leader \nwants to work tomorrow morning and start working through the amendments \nand those others that may be offered. But I would say, if we are going \nto continue in the spirit of good faith, bipartisan cooperation, then \nlet us work together as we have leading up to today to come to the \npoint where we can have a vote on those amendments.\n  There are others that may be offered on both sides. But for these \npending amendments, we are ready to commit to you that we will be here \nfirst thing in the morning, and let's start considering them.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me just say one more time, I think \neverybody understands. What we have here are at least six Democratic \namendments that presumably they understand because they offered them. I \nassume they know what is in them because they wrote them and offered \nthem. Yet they do not want to vote on them.\n  We have been on this bill for a while. We have already had more \nrollcall votes on this bill than the entire Senate had on every bill \nthrough the whole year of 2014. I think it is time that we start moving \nforward.\n  So since there is an objection to setting votes on the pending \namendments, there is really only one way to ensure a vote on these \namendments absent a cloture motion, which I was explaining earlier. If \nwe had to file cloture on each of these amendments, we would be on them \nfor weeks trying to help our friends on the other side get votes on \namendments they offered.\n  So given the fact that they are reluctant to vote on their own \namendments, which presumably they understand, the only way to go \nforward is to table their amendments. So I, therefore, intend to begin \ntabling the pending amendments, ensuring a vote on the proposals they \nhave offered, which presumably they understand, but moving the process \nalong tonight.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. For a question only, without losing the floor.\n\n[[Page S406]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Did the majority leader not notify the entire Senate that \nwe would be working on Fridays?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am not suggesting we are not working on Friday. I am \nsuggesting we are working tonight.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the majority leader, we are prepared to \nstart working in an orderly fashion on Friday, as we did earlier today.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Well, I have not said anything about Friday. Did \nanybody hear me say anything about Friday? We are talking about right \nnow.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 25\n\n  Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 25, offered by the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Markey.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to table the pending amendment \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \n1 minute to speak on my amendment before it is voted upon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                              Quorum Call\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. Durbin, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, now that we have purged the calendar of \nfive of the six Democratic amendments, the majority leader tells us it \nis time to vote.\n  It doesn't strike me that this is in the best interest of what we are \ntrying to achieve. We are going back and forth in a bipartisan, \nconstructive fashion. I would like to ask the majority leader is he \nprepared to be in session tomorrow and to consider Democratic and \nRepublican amendments and work through the list, including the ones he \njust tabled?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Does the Senator from Illinois intend to object to my \nconsent?\n  Mr. DURBIN. What I am asking is to try to amend this so it does have \nsome balance. The majority leader mentioned one Democratic amendment \nand at least five or six Republican amendments to be considered \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We just had votes on Democratic amendments that the \nSenator's Members offered and he didn't want to agree to have a vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Record will reflect the spirited debate on those \namendments when the majority leader wouldn't even give the authors 60 \nseconds to describe what was in the amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Am I correct the Senator from Illinois is going to \nobject?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, \nthe next vote will be Monday, at 5:30 p.m. The assistant Democratic \nleader and I have agreed to announce no more votes tonight.\n  Mr. WICKER.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a great \nKentuckian and a man who has dedicated his entire career to promoting \ncivil rights and helping people. My good friend Ben Richmond, the \nlongtime president and CEO of the Louisville Urban League, recently \nannounced his impending retirement from that position. Mr. Richmond has \nserved as president and CEO of the Louisville Urban League for nearly \n30 years-since 1987.\n  Mr. Richmond is a civil rights champion who has led a venerable civil \nrights institution such as the Louisville Urban League to new heights. \nUnder his tenure, the Louisville Urban League has promoted job training \nand education for many in Louisville's African-American community. His \nbody of work is so outstanding that in 2007 he received from the city \nthe Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Freedom Award, a recognition for a local \nactivist who is dedicated to King's principles and who has promoted \npeace, equality, and justice.\n  Since Mr. Richmond took over the Louisville Urban League, the staff \nhas grown from around 20 to 30 and the annual budget grown from under \n$1 million to around $3.3 million. Mr. Richmond is the driving force \nfor fundraising for the budget.\n  The Louisville Urban League placed more than 200 people in jobs last \nyear with a combined annual income of nearly $5 million. It helped \nabout 1,000 prepare for finding employment through career expos, job \ntraining, referrals, and career counseling. It also has many programs \nto help youth and seniors.\n  The Louisville Urban League is nearly halfway towards realizing their \ngoal of seeing 15,000 local African Americans earn college degrees \nbetween 2012 and 2020. Mr. Richmond oversaw the Louisville Urban \nLeague's move to a new headquarters in 1990. And under Mr. Richmond's \ntenure, the Louisville Urban League was just one of 13 Urban League \naffiliates nationwide to receive a top score in a self-audit required \nby the National Urban League.\n  We are lucky, that after his retirement, Mr. Richmond plans on \nstaying in Louisville. Our city can continue to benefit from his wisdom \nand experience. I want to wish my good friend Mr. Ben Richmond all the \nbest in retirement, and I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating Ben for his successful tenure at the helm of the \nLouisville Urban League. The city of Louisville and the State of \nKentucky have certainly benefitted immeasurably by his many efforts \nover the decades.\n  The Louisville Courier-Journal newspaper recently published an \narticle extolling Mr. Ben Richmond's many accomplishments. I ask \nunanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Courier-Journal, Jan. 21, 2015]\n\n                   Urban League CEO Richmond Retiring\n\n                         (By Sheldon S. Shafer)\n\n       Ben Richmond, a cornerstone of local social activism for \n     more than a quarter century and a major advocate of economic \n     equality, is retiring as president and CEO of the Louisville \n     Urban League.\n       Richmond announced his impending retirement at an Urban \n     League board meeting Tuesday, after serving as head of the \n     civil-rights organization since 1987.\n       Under the leadership of Richmond, a mainstay in the push to \n     improve economic development in western Louisville, the Urban \n     League has long been dedicated to promoting job training and \n     education, primarily for Louisville's poorer citizens.\n       Richmond ``has been one of the anchors for diversity and \n     for stability in not only the African-American community but \n     the overall Louisville community,'' said Raoul Cunningham, \n     Louisville NAACP president. ``I am going to miss Ben, his \n     counsel and his cooperative spirit.''\n       Richmond ``has become known around the country for \n     innovative and groundbreaking approaches to helping residents \n     improve their quality of life,'' said Dan Hall, a University \n     of Louisville vice president and the Urban League board \n     chairman. ``He is intensely passionate about helping \n     individuals find a pathway to success.''\n       Richmond received Louisville Metro's Dr. Martin Luther King \n     Jr. Freedom Award in 2007, an annual recognition given by the \n     city to a local activist dedicated to King's principles and \n     who has promoted peace, equality and justice.\n       Then-Mayor Jerry Abramson said at the time that ``over his \n     decades of leadership, countless lives have been improved \n     through Ben's tireless efforts in workforce development, \n     housing and youth programs.''\n       The national Urban League was founded in 1910, and the \n     Louisville agency in 1921. The local league was set up \n     chiefly to help rural black Southerners who had moved to \n     Louisville after World War I.\n       The Louisville Urban League under Richmond has greatly \n     expanded its reach. It placed about 250 people in jobs last \n     year and\n\n[[Page S409]]\n\n     helped around 1,000 more prepare for finding employment. The \n     league's career-development efforts range from helping job \n     seekers draft resumes to mock job interviews.\n       In recent times the league has sponsored Saturday morning \n     enrichment classes for children. And it has found buyers for \n     dozens of new single-family homes built on vacant or \n     abandoned property under its Project Rebound program in \n     Russell, helping to transform the surrounding neighborhood.\n       League efforts annually include career expos; job training, \n     referrals and career counseling; a variety of services for \n     employers; homeownership training and counseling: a health \n     and wellness program called Get Fit Louisville; a walk to \n     defeat childhood obesity; and a long list of programs to help \n     both youths and seniors in many ways.\n       Benjamin K. Richmond, 71 and single, was born in Durham, \n     N.C., and raised in Jackson, Miss.\n       Richmond came to the Louisville Urban League as president \n     and CEO in 1987, after top jobs with league affiliates in \n     Wisconsin and Michigan. Richmond here replaced the league's \n     longtime leader, the late Art Walters. Walters, who died in \n     2010 at age 91, directed the Louisville Urban League from \n     1970 to 1987.\n       Since Richmond took over, the league's staff has grown from \n     around 20 to 30--also aided by dozens of volunteers--and its \n     annual budget has grown from under $1 million to around $3.3 \n     million this year. The funds have been cobbled together \n     largely by Richmond--from Metro United Way and numerous \n     public and private sources.\n       The current budget, for instance, includes about $340,000 \n     from United Way, less than $100,000 from Metro Government and \n     a $1.2 million federal grant earmarked primarily for programs \n     for seniors.\n       The league has several departments, including the Center \n     for Workforce Development, the Center for Housing and \n     Financial Empowerment and the Center for Youth Development \n     and Education.\n       Richmond said in an interview Monday that he expects to \n     remain on the job until around June 30, or until a \n     replacement is named by the agency's board, after a planned \n     national search. He said he may then stay on under a contract \n     for a while longer.\n       Richmond intends to stay in Louisville, while traveling \n     some to visit relatives in Mississippi and Arizona.\n       But he pledges to remain active, noting that ``there are \n     many opportunities in both the public and private sectors \n     here. I will see what emerges. But I want to have fun.''\n       Among many achievements during his tenure, Richmond cited:\n       Opening the league headquarters in 1990 at 1535 W. \n     Broadway, a 19,000-square-foot office, community meeting \n     site, classroom and job-training facility. The league \n     invested $1.6 million in the headquarters, which was paid off \n     long ago. Richmond said the league headquarters has spurred \n     significant nearby development along Broadway.\n       The economic impact of the league in terms of finding jobs \n     for more than 200 people last year. Their combined annual \n     income should be nearly $5 million.\n       Richmond noted that in recent years the league helped find \n     jobs for dozens of minorities in construction of the KFC Yum! \n     Center, and he said the league was instrumental in getting \n     the PGA of America to establish an urban youth golf program \n     and also hire top staff minorities.\n       That a halfway point has nearly been reached toward a \n     goal--shared with partner organizations such as Simmons \n     College and Jefferson Community and Technical College--to \n     have 15,000 local African-Americans earn college degrees \n     between 2012 and 2020. The minority effort is part of the \n     community's 55,000 Degrees effort.\n       That the league last year received a top score in a self-\n     audit--a review of its staff, policies, finances and \n     procedures--required every three years by the National Urban \n     League. The Louisville agency was just one of 13 affiliates \n     of the national organization to achieve that status, Richmond \n     said.\n       Richmond said he is proud that under his oversight the \n     local league has attained financial stability, adding that he \n     believes his organized is widely respected.\n       Under Richmond, the league has become more diversified. \n     About half of its 36-member board and about half the staff \n     are white. Richmond said he has strived to ``practice what we \n     preach--racial diversity.''\n       Richmond ``has been a tremendous leader,'' said Metro \n     Councilman David Tandy, D-4th District. ``There is still work \n     to do, but he has been at the forefront of the second, or \n     third, wave of the civil-rights movement, focusing on \n     economic opportunity. . . . He has played a pivotal role in \n     the community.''\n       Richmond ``has tried to create opportunities and meet \n     challenges our community has faced,'' said longtime ally Sam \n     Watkins, president of the Louisville Central Community \n     Center, another West End-based, pro-development group.\n       ``He's been a champion for west Louisville and has been \n     proactive in trying to garner desperately needed attention \n     for the area's issues and problems.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/22/senate-section/article/S409-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING WENDELL FORD\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today the United States Senate family lost \none of its Members. Early this morning, our friend and colleague, \nSenator Wendell Ford, passed away at his home in Owensboro, KY.\n  Senator Wendell Ford's service to his State and country spanned seven \ndecades. A veteran of World War II and longtime member of the Kentucky \nArmy National Guard, Wendell Ford's first elected position was that of \nState senator. In 1967 he ran successfully for Lieutenant Governor. \nFour years later he was elected Governor.\n  Following his term as Governor, the people of Kentucky sent him to \nthe U.S. Senate, where he enjoyed a distinguished 24-year career. He \nwas my predecessor as Democratic whip, a position that he held from \n1995 to 1999. When Senator Ford retired, he was the longest serving \nU.S. Senator in Kentucky history, a record that my friend, the majority \nleader, eclipsed in 2009.\n  Senator Wendell Ford loved Kentucky. His loyalty to his home State \nwas never in question. During his time here in the Senate, he \nunabashedly and unapologetically fought for anything that would give \nKentucky families a helping hand. Similarly, anyone or anything that \nthreatened Kentucky and its people was met with Senator Ford's fierce \nopposition.\n  My thoughts today are with his family. I express my condolences to \nhis wife of 71 years, Jean Neel, their children, grandchildren and \ngreat-grandchildren. Senator Wendell Ford will be greatly missed by his \nloved ones, the people of Kentucky and the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/22/senate-section/article/S409-2", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S409-S410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           FIVE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF CITIZENS UNITED DECISION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yesterday marked the 5-year anniversary of \nthe Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election \nCommission. In this sweeping opinion, on a divided 5 to 4 vote, the \nCourt held that the First Amendment permitted corporations to spend \nfreely from their treasuries to influence elections. As a result of \nCitizens United and the series of decisions that followed in its wake, \nwe have witnessed wealthy, well-connected campaign donors and special \ninterests unleash a deluge of cash in an effort to sway Federal, State, \nand local elections across our Nation.\n  Let me be clear: I firmly believe that every voice should be heard in \nour country, and every perspective should have a seat at the Nation's \npolicymaking table. However, Citizens United has led to a system that \nallows a privileged group of deep-pocketed donors and corporations to \ndrown out the voices of ordinary citizens in an effort to buy and \ncontrol every seat at the table.\n  The numbers speak for themselves. During the last Presidential \nelection, outside groups poured more than one billion dollars into \nFederal races, over three times the $338 million that outside groups \nspent in 2008. More than 93 percent of all super PAC donations in 2012 \ncame in contributions of at least $10,000 from 3,318 donors, who make \nup 0.0011 percent of the U.S. population. Of that group, an elite class \nof 159 people each contributed at least $1 million--funding nearly 60 \npercent of all super PAC donations that year.\n  We saw this trend continue during the recent midterm elections. \nOutside groups spent more than $560 million to influence 2014 Federal \nraces--8 times the approximately $70 million spent in 2006, the last \nmidterm election cycle before Citizens United. In 2014, we also saw a \nsignificant increase in political activity by tax-exempt ``dark money'' \ngroups that do not publicly disclose their donors. Citizens United and \nits progeny have created a campaign finance system flush with secret \ncash and sorely lacking in transparency.\n  The impact stretches from Congress to state capitols to city halls \nthroughout the country. As in Federal campaigns, Citizens United has \nled to an explosion of outside spending at the State and local levels, \nwith corporations and wealthy single spenders looking to play \nkingmaker, pouring cash into races for positions ranging from district \nattorney to city commissioner. One of the most startling examples last \nfall occurred in Richmond, CA, a city with a population of 107,000. \nChevron--an energy company with more than $200 billion in annual \nrevenue--spent approximately $3 million through campaign committees \naimed at influencing the mayoral and city council races. That means \nChevron spent at least $33 per voting-age resident in Richmond.\n  While the influx of spending is well documented, I believe that the \nlong-\n\n[[Page S410]]\n\nterm damage to our political process from Citizens United is just \nbeginning to reveal itself. Some scandals have already emerged, and \nthere will doubtlessly be more stories of corruption and corrosive \ninfluence ahead. As a result, the public confidence in our government \nwill continue to erode.\n  I have worked with my colleagues on a number of solutions to address \nthese concerns. Yesterday, several of these proposals were introduced \nin both the Senate and House of Representatives. I strongly support my \ncolleagues in their efforts to improve disclosure and create a more \ntransparent campaign finance system, and I will continue my efforts to \nestablish a public financing system for Congressional elections through \nthe Fair Elections Now Act, which I plan to reintroduce soon.\n  We also must continue to push for a constitutional amendment that \nwould protect and restore the First Amendment by overturning Citizens \nUnited and empowering Congress and State legislatures to set \nreasonable, content neutral limitations on campaign spending. Last \nyear, as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil \nRights, and Human Rights, I was proud to preside over a hearing and a \nvote on Senator Udall's Democracy for All amendment. A majority of the \nSenate voted in favor of the bill, but not enough to defeat a \nRepublican filibuster. We will continue to pursue this amendment and \nwork toward its ultimate ratification.\n  As I said last year, supporting a constitutional amendment to reform \nour campaign finance system was not a decision I came to lightly. There \nis a very high bar for amending the Constitution and that is exactly \nthe way it should be. In fact, Senator Udall's amendment was the only \nconstitutional amendment that the Constitution Subcommittee approved \nduring my time as chairman. But I believe it is necessary to clean up \nour campaign finance system once and for all. Only a constitutional \namendment can fully undo the damage of Citizens United and ensure that \nelections are a contest of the best ideas--not just the ideas of \nmultimillionaires and corporate titans.\n  In the 5 years since Citizens United was decided, we have watched the \ncorrosive influence of special interest money grow. It crosses the \npolitical spectrum, with wealthy donors vying for influence and streams \nof secret cash emerging from both the right and the left. Meanwhile, \neveryday Americans struggle for their voices to be heard amidst the \nendless ads blanketing the airwaves, so often financed by corporate \ninterests.\n  As Justice Rehnquist once noted, corporations are granted the \nadvantages of perpetual life, property ownership, and limited liability \n``to enhance [their] efficiency as an economic entity.'' But he went on \nto say that ``those properties, so beneficial in the economic sphere, \npose special dangers in the political sphere.'' While some First \nAmendment protections have rightfully been extended beyond everyday \nAmericans to corporations, Citizens United went too far. Living, \nbreathing Americans face challenges and have concerns that are very \ndifferent than those faced by corporations--and their resources pale in \ncomparison.\n  The special dangers of corporate influence in elections have never \nbeen more evident. The Supreme Court should fully examine the impact \nand effects of Citizens United and consider its damaging consequences \nas future cases involving campaign finance come before the Court. In \nthe meantime, I will work with my colleagues to continue our \nlegislative efforts to fix America's campaign finance system and \noverturn Citizens United so that elected officials listen to the \neveryday Americans who elected them--not just the wealthy donors and \nspecial interests that bankrolled their success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/22/senate-section/article/S410-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S410-S412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          COMMITTEE ON FINANCE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, the Committee on the Judiciary has \nadopted rules governing its procedures for the 114th Congress. Pursuant \nto rule XXVI, paragraph 2, of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of the committee rules be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE COMMITTEE ON THE \n                       JUDICIARY--114TH CONGRESS\n\n\n                      I. MEETINGS OF THE COMMITTEE\n\n       1. Meetings of the Committee may be called by the Chairman \n     as he may deem necessary on three days' notice of the date, \n     time, place and subject matter of the meeting, or in the \n     alternative with the consent of the Ranking Minority Member, \n     or pursuant to the provision of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate, as amended.\n       2. Unless a different date and time are set by the Chairman \n     pursuant to (1) of this section, Committee meetings shall be \n     held beginning at 10:00 a.m. on Thursdays the Senate is in \n     session, which shall be the regular meeting day for the \n     transaction of business.\n       3. At the request of any member, or by action of the \n     Chairman, a bill, matter, or nomination on the agenda of the \n     Committee may be held over until the next meeting of the \n     Committee or for one week, whichever occurs later.\n\n\n                     II. HEARINGS OF THE COMMITTEE\n\n       1. The Committee shall provide a public announcement of the \n     date, time, place and subject matter of any hearing to be \n     conducted by the Committee or any Subcommittee at least seven \n     calendar days prior to the commencement of that hearing, \n     unless the Chairman with the consent of the Ranking Minority \n     Member determines that good cause exists to begin such \n     hearing at an earlier date. Witnesses shall provide a written \n     statement of their testimony and curriculum vitae to the \n     Committee at least 24 hours preceding the hearings in as many \n     copies as the Chairman of the Committee or Subcommittee \n     prescribes.\n       2. In the event 14 calendar days' notice of a hearing has \n     been made, witnesses appearing before the Committee, \n     including any witness representing a Government agency, must \n     file with the Committee at least 48 hours preceding \n     appearance written statements of their testimony and \n     curriculum vitae in as many copies as the Chairman of the \n     Committee or Subcommittee prescribes.\n       3. In the event a witness fails timely to file the written \n     statement in accordance with this rule, the Chairman may \n     permit the witness to testify, or deny the witness the \n     privilege of testifying before the Committee, or permit the \n     witness to testify in response to questions from Senators \n     without the benefit of giving an opening statement.\n\n\n                              III. QUORUMS\n\n       1. Seven Members of the Committee, actually present, shall \n     constitute a quorum for the purpose of discussing business. \n     Nine Members of the Committee, including at least two Members \n     of the minority, shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of \n     transacting business. No bill, matter, or nomination shall be \n     ordered reported from the Committee, however, unless a \n     majority of the Committee is actually present at the time \n     such action is taken and a majority of those present support \n     the action taken.\n       2. For the purpose of taking down sworn testimony, a quorum \n     of the Committee and each Subcommittee thereof, now or \n     hereafter appointed, shall consist of one Senator.\n\n\n                    IV. BRINGING A MATTER TO A VOTE\n\n       The Chairman shall entertain a non-debatable motion to \n     bring a matter before the Committee to a vote. If there is \n     objection to bring the matter to a vote without further \n     debate, a roll call vote of the Committee shall be taken, and \n     debate shall be terminated if the motion to bring the matter \n     to a vote without further debate passes with eleven votes in \n     the affirmative, one of which must be cast by the minority.\n\n\n                             V. AMENDMENTS\n\n       1. Provided at least seven calendars days' notice of the \n     agenda is given, and the text of the proposed bill or \n     resolution has been made available at least seven calendar \n     days in advance, it shall not be in order for the Committee \n     to consider any amendment in the first degree proposed to any \n     measure under consideration by the Committee unless such \n     amendment has been delivered to the office of the Committee \n     and circulated via e-mail to each of the offices by at least \n     5:00 p.m. the day prior to the scheduled start of the \n     meeting.\n       2. It shall be in order, without prior notice, for a Member \n     to offer a motion to strike a single section of any bill, \n     resolution, or amendment under consideration.\n       3. The time limit imposed on the filing of amendments shall \n     apply to no more than three bills identified by the Chairman \n     and included on the Committee's legislative agenda.\n       4. This section of the rule may be waived by agreement of \n     the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member.\n\n\n                            VI. PROXY VOTING\n\n       When a recorded vote is taken in the Committee on any bill, \n     resolution, amendment, or any other question, a quorum being \n     present, Members who are unable to attend the meeting may \n     submit votes by proxy, in writing or by telephone, or through \n     personal instructions. A proxy must be specific with respect \n     to the matters it addresses.\n\n\n                           VII. SUBCOMMITTEES\n\n       1. Any Member of the Committee may sit with any \n     Subcommittee during its hearings or any other meeting, but \n     shall not have the authority to vote on any matter before the \n     Subcommittee unless a Member of such Subcommittee.\n       2. Subcommittees shall be considered de novo whenever there \n     is a change in the Subcommittee chairmanship and seniority on \n     the particular Subcommittee shall not necessarily apply.\n       3. Except for matters retained at the full Committee, \n     matters shall be referred to the appropriate Subcommittee or \n     Subcommittees by the Chairman, except as agreed by a majority \n     vote of the Committee or by the agreement of the Chairman and \n     the Ranking Minority Member.\n       4. Provided all members of the Subcommittee consent, a bill \n     or other matter may be polled out of the Subcommittee. In \n     order to be polled out of a Subcommittee, a majority of the \n     members of the Subcommittee who vote must vote in favor of \n     reporting the bill or matter to the Committee.\n\n\n                         VIII.

Mr. President, rule XXVI, paragraph 2, of the Standing \nRules of the Senate requires each committee to adopt rules to govern \nthe procedure of the committee and to publish those rules in the \nCongressional Record not later than March 1 of the first year of each \nCongress. Today, the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs adopted Committee Rules of Procedure.\n  Consistent with Standing Rule XXVI, I ask unanimous consent to have a \ncopy of the Rules of Procedure of the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY AND \n                          GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS\n\n\n      PURSUANT TO RULE XXVI, SEC. 2, STANDING RULES OF THE SENATE\n\n      RULE 1. MEETINGS AND MEETING PROCEDURES OTHER THAN HEARINGS\n\n       A. Meeting dates. The Committee shall hold its regular \n     meetings on the first Wednesday of each month, when the \n     Congress is in session, or at such other times as the \n     Chairman shall determine. Additional meetings may be called \n     by the Chairman as he/she deems necessary to expedite \n     Committee business. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 3, Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.)\n       B. Calling special Committee meetings. If at least three \n     Members of the Committee desire the Chairman to call a \n     special meeting, they may file in the offices of the \n     Committee a written request therefor, addressed to the \n     Chairman. Immediately thereafter, the clerk of the Committee \n     shall notify the Chairman of such request. If, within 3 \n     calendar days after the filing of such request, the Chairman \n     fails to call the requested special meeting, which is to be \n     held within 7 calendar days after the filing of such request, \n     a majority of the Committee Members may file in the offices \n     of the Committee their written notice that a special \n     Committee meeting will be held, specifying the date and hour \n     thereof, and the Committee shall meet on that date and hour. \n     Immediately upon the filing of such notice, the Committee \n     chief clerk shall notify all Committee Members that such \n     special meeting will be held and inform them of its date and \n     hour. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 3, Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       C. Meeting notices and agenda. Written notices of Committee \n     meetings, accompanied by an agenda, enumerating the items of \n     business to be considered, shall be sent to all Committee \n     Members at least 5 days in advance of such meetings, \n     excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays in which the \n     Senate is not in session. The written notices required by \n     this Rule may be provided by electronic mail. In the event \n     that unforeseen requirements or Committee business prevent a \n     5-day notice of either the meeting or agenda, the Committee \n     staff shall communicate such notice and agenda, or any \n     revisions to the agenda, as soon as practicable by telephone \n     or otherwise to Members or appropriate staff assistants in \n     their offices.\n       D. Open business meetings. Meetings for the transaction of \n     Committee or Subcommittee business shall be conducted in open \n     session, except that a meeting or series of meetings on the \n     same subject for a period of no more than 14 calendar days \n     may be closed to the public on a motion made and seconded to \n     go into closed session to discuss only whether the matters \n     enumerated in clauses (1) through (6) below would require the \n     meeting to be closed, followed immediately by a record vote \n     in open session by a majority of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee Members when it is determined that the matters \n     to be discussed or the testimony to be taken at such meeting \n     or meetings--\n       (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of foreign relations of the United States;\n       (2) will relate solely to matters of Committee or \n     Subcommittee staff personnel or internal staff management or \n     procedure;\n       (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise expose an individual to public \n     contempt or obloquy or will represent a clearly unwarranted \n     invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n       (4) will disclose the identity of an informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n       (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets \n     of financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n       (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept \n     confidential by Government officers and employees; or\n       (B) the information has been obtained by the Government on \n     a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific Government financial or other \n     benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to \n     prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such \n     person; or\n       (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under other provisions of law or Government regulations. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.) \n     Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever disorder arises \n     during a Committee or Subcommittee meeting that is open to \n     the public, or any demonstration of approval or disapproval \n     is indulged in by any person in attendance at any such \n     meeting, it shall be the duty of the Chairman to enforce \n     order on his or her own initiative and without any point of \n     order being made by a Member of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee; provided, further, that when the Chairman finds \n     it necessary to maintain order, he/she shall have the power \n     to clear the room, and the Committee or Subcommittee may act \n     in closed session for so long as there is doubt of the \n     assurance of order. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(d), Standing Rules of \n     the Senate.)\n       E. Prior notice of first degree amendments. It shall not be \n     in order for the Committee, or a Subcommittee thereof, to \n     consider any amendment in the first degree proposed to any \n     measure under consideration by the Committee or Subcommittee \n     unless a written copy of such amendment has been delivered to \n     each Member of the Committee or Subcommittee, as the case may \n     be, and to the office of the Committee or Subcommittee, by no \n     later than 5:00 p.m. two days before the meeting of the \n     Committee or Subcommittee at which the amendment is to be \n     proposed. The written copy of amendments in the first degree \n     required by this Rule may be provided by electronic mail. \n     This subsection may be waived by a majority of the Members \n     present, or by consent of the Chairman and Ranking Minority \n     Member of the Committee or Subcommittee. This subsection \n     shall apply only when at least 72 hours written notice of a \n     session to mark-up a measure is provided to the Committee or \n     Subcommittee.\n       F. Meeting transcript. The Committee or Subcommittee shall \n     prepare and keep a complete transcript or electronic \n     recording adequate to fully record the proceeding of each \n     meeting whether or not such meeting or any part thereof is \n     closed to the public, unless a majority of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee Members vote to forgo such a record. (Rule XXVI, \n     Sec. 5(e), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n\n\n                            RULE 2. QUORUMS\n\n       A. Reporting measures and matters.

One-third of the \n     membership of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for the \n     transaction of routine business, provided that one Member of \n     the Minority is present. For the purpose of this paragraph, \n     the term ``routine business'' includes the convening of a \n     meeting and the consideration of any business of the \n     Committee other than reporting to the Senate any measures, \n     matters or recommendations. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(1), \n     Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       C. Taking testimony. One Member of the Committee shall \n     constitute a quorum for taking sworn or unsworn testimony. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(2) and 7(c)(2), Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.)\n       D. Subcommittee quorums. Subject to the provisions of \n     sections 7(a)(1) and (2) of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules \n     of the Senate, the Subcommittees of this Committee are \n     authorized to establish their own quorums for the transaction \n     of business and the taking of sworn testimony.\n       E. Proxies prohibited in establishment of quorum. Proxies \n     shall not be considered for the establishment of a quorum.\n\n\n                             RULE 3. VOTING\n\n       A. Quorum required. Subject to the provisions of subsection \n     (E), no vote may be taken by the Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, on any measure or matter unless a \n     quorum, as prescribed in the preceding section, is actually \n     present.\n       B. Reporting measures and matters. No measure, matter or \n     recommendation shall be reported from the Committee unless a \n     majority of the Committee Members are actually present, and \n     the vote of the Committee to report a measure or matter shall \n     require the concurrence of a majority of those Members who \n     are actually present at the time the vote is taken. (Rule \n     XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(1) and (3), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       C. Proxy voting. Proxy voting shall be allowed on all \n     measures and matters before the Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, except that, when the Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, is voting to report a measure or \n     matter, proxy votes shall be allowed solely for the purposes \n     of recording a Member's position on the pending question. \n     Proxy voting shall be allowed only if the absent Committee or \n     Subcommittee Member has been informed of the matter on which \n     he or she is being recorded and has affirmatively requested \n     that he or she be so recorded. All proxies shall be filed \n     with the chief clerk of the Committee or Subcommittee \n     thereof, as the case may be. All proxies shall be in writing \n     and shall contain sufficient reference to the pending matter \n     as is necessary to identify it and to inform the Committee or \n     Subcommittee as to how the Member establishes his or her vote \n     to be recorded thereon. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(3) and 7(c)(1), \n     Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n\n[[Page S414]]\n\n       D. Announcement of vote. (1) Whenever the Committee by roll \n     call vote reports any measure or matter, the report of the \n     Committee upon such a measure or matter shall include a \n     tabulation of the votes cast in favor of and the votes cast \n     in opposition to such measure or matter by each Member of the \n     Committee. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(c), Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.)\n       (2) Whenever the Committee by roll call vote acts upon any \n     measure or amendment thereto, other than reporting a measure \n     or matter, the results thereof shall be announced in the \n     Committee report on that measure unless previously announced \n     by the Committee, and such announcement shall include a \n     tabulation of the votes cast in favor of and the votes cast \n     in opposition to each such measure and amendment thereto by \n     each Member of the Committee who was present at the meeting. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       (3) In any case in which a roll call vote is announced, the \n     tabulation of votes shall state separately the proxy vote \n     recorded in favor of and in opposition to that measure, \n     amendment thereto, or matter. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(b) and (c), \n     Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       E. Polling. (1) The Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, \n     may poll (a) internal Committee or Subcommittee matters \n     including the Committee's or Subcommittee's staff, records \n     and budget; (b) steps in an investigation, including issuance \n     of subpoenas, applications for immunity orders, and requests \n     for documents from agencies; and (c) other Committee or \n     Subcommittee business other than a vote on reporting to the \n     Senate any measures, matters or recommendations or a vote on \n     closing a meeting or hearing to the public.\n       (2) Only the Chairman, or a Committee Member or staff \n     officer designated by him/her, may undertake any poll of the \n     Members of the Committee. If any Member requests, any matter \n     to be polled shall be held for meeting rather than being \n     polled. The chief clerk of the Committee shall keep a record \n     of polls; if a majority of the Members of the Committee \n     determine that the polled matter is in one of the areas \n     enumerated in subsection (D) of Rule 1, the record of the \n     poll shall be confidential. Any Committee Member may move at \n     the Committee meeting following the poll for a vote on the \n     polled decision, such motion and vote to be subject to the \n     provisions of subsection (D) of Rule 1, where applicable.\n       F. Naming postal facilities. The Committee will not \n     consider any legislation that would name a postal facility \n     for a living person with the exception of bills naming \n     facilities after former Presidents and Vice Presidents of the \n     United States, former Members of Congress over 70 years of \n     age, former State or local elected officials over 70 years of \n     age, former judges over 70 years of age, or wounded veterans.\n\n\n             RULE 4. CHAIRMANSHIP OF MEETINGS AND HEARINGS\n\n       The Chairman shall preside at all Committee meetings and \n     hearings except that he or she shall designate a temporary \n     Chairman to act in his or her place if he or she is unable to \n     be present at a scheduled meeting or hearing. If the Chairman \n     (or his or her designee) is absent 10 minutes after the \n     scheduled time set for a meeting or hearing, the Ranking \n     Majority Member present shall preside until the Chairman's \n     arrival. If there is no Member of the Majority present, the \n     Ranking Minority Member present, with the prior approval of \n     the Chairman, may open and conduct the meeting or hearing \n     until such time as a Member of the Majority arrives.\n\n\n                RULE 5. HEARINGS AND HEARING PROCEDURES\n\n       A. Announcement of hearings. The Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, shall make public announcement of the \n     date, time, and subject matter of any hearing to be conducted \n     on any measure or matter at least 1 week in advance of such \n     hearing, unless the Committee, or Subcommittee, determines \n     that there is good cause to begin such hearing at an earlier \n     date. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 4(a), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       B. Open hearings. Each hearing conducted by the Committee, \n     or any Subcommittee thereof, shall be open to the public, \n     except that a hearing or series of hearings on the same \n     subject for a period of no more than 14 calendar days may be \n     closed to the public on a motion made and seconded to go into \n     closed session to discuss only whether the matters enumerated \n     in clauses (1) through (6) below would require the hearing to \n     be closed, followed immediately by a record vote in open \n     session by a majority of the Committee or Subcommittee \n     Members when it is determined that the matters to be \n     discussed or the testimony to be taken at such hearing or \n     hearings--\n       (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of foreign relations of the United States;\n       (2) will relate solely to matters of Committee or \n     Subcommittee staff personnel or internal staff management or \n     procedure;\n       (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise expose an individual to public \n     contempt or obloquy or will represent a clearly unwarranted \n     invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n       (4) will disclose the identity of an informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n       (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets \n     of financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n       (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept \n     confidential by Government officers and employees; or\n       (B) the information has been obtained by the Government on \n     a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific Government financial or other \n     benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to \n     prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such \n     person; or\n       (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under other provisions of law or Government regulations. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever disorder arises \n     during a Committee or Subcommittee meeting that is open to \n     the public, or any demonstration of approval or disapproval \n     is indulged in by any person in attendance at any such \n     meeting, it shall be the duty of the Chairman to enforce \n     order on his or her own initiative and without any point of \n     order being made by a Member of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee; provided, further, that when the Chairman finds \n     it necessary to maintain order, he or she shall have the \n     power to clear the room, and the Committee or Subcommittee \n     may act in closed session for so long as there is doubt of \n     the assurance of order. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(d), Standing Rules \n     of the Senate.)\n       C. Full Committee subpoenas. The Chairman, with the \n     approval of the Ranking Minority Member of the Committee, is \n     authorized to subpoena the attendance of witnesses at a \n     hearing or deposition or the production of memoranda, \n     documents, records, or any other materials. The Chairman may \n     subpoena attendance or production without the approval of the \n     Ranking Minority Member where the Chairman has not received a \n     letter of disapproval signed by the Ranking Minority Member \n     within 72 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal \n     holidays in which the Senate is not in session, of the \n     Ranking Minority Member's receipt of a letter signed by the \n     Chairman providing notice of the Chairman's intent to issue a \n     subpoena, including an identification of all individuals and \n     items sought to be subpoenaed. Delivery and receipt of the \n     signed notice and signed disapproval letters and any \n     additional communications related to the subpoena may be \n     carried out by staff officers of the Chairman and Ranking \n     Minority Member, and may occur through electronic mail. If a \n     subpoena is disapproved by the Ranking Minority Member as \n     provided in this subsection, the subpoena may be authorized \n     by vote of the Members of the Committee. When the Committee \n     or Chairman authorizes subpoenas, subpoenas may be issued \n     upon the signature of the Chairman or any other Member of the \n     Committee designated by the Chairman.\n       D. Witness counsel. Counsel retained by any witness and \n     accompanying such witness shall be permitted to be present \n     during the testimony of such witness at any public or \n     executive hearing or deposition to advise such witness while \n     he or she is testifying, of his or her legal rights; \n     provided, however, that in the case of any witness who is an \n     officer or employee of the Government, or of a corporation or \n     association, the Committee Chairman may rule that \n     representation by counsel from the Government, corporation, \n     or association or by counsel representing other witnesses, \n     creates a conflict of interest, and that the witness may only \n     be represented during interrogation by staff or during \n     testimony before the Committee by personal counsel not from \n     the Government, corporation, or association or by personal \n     counsel not representing other witnesses. This subsection \n     shall not be construed to excuse a witness from testifying in \n     the event his or her counsel is ejected for conducting \n     himself or herself in such manner so as to prevent, impede, \n     disrupt, obstruct or interfere with the orderly \n     administration of the hearings; nor shall this subsection be \n     construed as authorizing counsel to coach the witness or \n     answer for the witness. The failure of any witness to secure \n     counsel shall not excuse such witness from complying with a \n     subpoena or deposition notice.\n       E. Witness transcripts. An accurate electronic or \n     stenographic record shall be kept of the testimony of all \n     witnesses in executive and public hearings. The record of his \n     or her testimony whether in public or executive session shall \n     be made available for inspection by the witness or his or her \n     counsel under Committee supervision; a copy of any testimony \n     given in public session or that part of the testimony given \n     by the witness in executive session and subsequently quoted \n     or made part of the record in a public session shall be \n     provided to any witness at his or her expense if he or she so \n     requests. Upon inspecting his or her transcript, within a \n     time limit set by the chief clerk of the Committee, a witness \n     may request changes in the transcript to correct errors of \n     transcription and grammatical errors; the Chairman or a staff \n     officer designated by him/her shall rule on such requests.\n       F. Impugned persons. Any person whose name is mentioned or \n     is specifically identified, and who believes that evidence \n     presented, or comment made by a Member of the Committee or \n     staff officer, at a public hearing or at a closed hearing \n     concerning which there have been public reports, tends\n\n[[Page S415]]\n\n     to impugn his or her character or adversely affect his or her \n     reputation may:\n       (a) File a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     evidence or comment, which statement shall be considered for \n     placement in the hearing record by the Committee;\n       (b) Request the opportunity to appear personally before the \n     Committee to testify in his or her own behalf, which request \n     shall be considered by the Committee; and\n       (c) Submit questions in writing which he or she requests be \n     used for the cross-examination of other witnesses called by \n     the Committee, which questions shall be considered for use by \n     the Committee.\n       G. Radio, television, and photography. The Committee, or \n     any Subcommittee thereof, may permit the proceedings of \n     hearings which are open to the public to be photographed and \n     broadcast by radio, television or both, subject to such \n     conditions as the Committee, or Subcommittee, may impose. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(c), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       H. Advance statements of witnesses. A witness appearing \n     before the Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, shall \n     provide electronically a written statement of his or her \n     proposed testimony at least 48 hours prior to his or her \n     appearance. This requirement may be waived by the Chairman \n     and the Ranking Minority Member following their \n     determination that there is good cause for failure of \n     compliance. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 4(b), Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.)\n       I. Minority witnesses. In any hearings conducted by the \n     Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, the Minority Members \n     of the Committee or Subcommittee shall be entitled, upon \n     request to the Chairman by a majority of the Minority \n     Members, to call witnesses of their selection during at least \n     1 day of such hearings. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 4(d), Standing Rules \n     of the Senate.)\n       J. Swearing in witnesses. In any hearings conducted by the \n     Committee, the Chairman or his or her designee may swear in \n     each witness prior to their testimony.\n       K. Full Committee depositions. Depositions may be taken \n     prior to or after a hearing as provided in this subsection.\n       (1) Notices for the taking of depositions shall be \n     authorized and issued by the Chairman, with the approval of \n     the Ranking Minority Member of the Committee. The Chairman \n     may initiate depositions without the approval of the Ranking \n     Minority Member where the Chairman has not received a letter \n     of disapproval of the deposition signed by the Ranking \n     Minority Member within 72 hours, excluding Saturdays, \n     Sundays, and legal holidays in which the Senate is not in \n     session, of the Ranking Minority Member's receipt of a letter \n     signed by the Chairman providing notice of the Chairman's \n     intent to issue a deposition notice, including identification \n     of all individuals sought to be deposed. Delivery and receipt \n     of the signed notice and signed disapproval letter and any \n     additional communications related to the deposition may be \n     carried out by staff officers of the Chairman and Ranking \n     Member, and may occur through electronic mail. If a \n     deposition notice is disapproved by the Ranking Minority \n     Member as provided in this subsection, the deposition notice \n     may be authorized by a vote of the Members of the Committee. \n     Committee deposition notices shall specify a time and place \n     for examination, and the name of the Committee Member or \n     Members or staff officer or officers who will take the \n     deposition. Unless otherwise specified, the deposition shall \n     be in private. The Committee shall not initiate procedures \n     leading to criminal or civil enforcement proceedings for a \n     witness' failure to appear or produce unless the deposition \n     notice was accompanied by a Committee subpoena.\n       (2) Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition by counsel \n     to advise them of their legal rights, subject to the \n     provisions of Rule 5D.\n       (3) Oaths at depositions may be administered by an \n     individual authorized by local law to administer oaths. \n     Questions shall be propounded orally by a Committee Member or \n     Members or staff. If a witness objects to a question and \n     refuses to testify, the objection shall be noted for the \n     record and the Committee Member or Members or staff may \n     proceed with the remainder of the deposition.\n       (4) The Committee shall see that the testimony is \n     transcribed or electronically recorded (which may include \n     audio or audio/video recordings). If it is transcribed, the \n     transcript shall be made available for inspection by the \n     witness or his or her counsel under Committee supervision. \n     The witness shall sign a copy of the transcript and may \n     request changes to it, which shall be handled in accordance \n     with the procedure set forth in subsection (E). If the \n     witness fails to sign a copy, the staff shall note that fact \n     on the transcript. The individual administering the oath \n     shall certify on the transcript that the witness was duly \n     sworn in his or her presence, the transcriber shall certify \n     that the transcript is a true record of the testimony, and \n     the transcript shall then be filed with the chief clerk of \n     the Committee. The Chairman or a staff officer designated by \n     him/her may stipulate with the witness to changes in the \n     procedure; deviations from this procedure which do not \n     substantially impair the reliability of the record shall not \n     relieve the witness from his or her obligation to testify \n     truthfully.\n\n\n                 RULE 6. COMMITTEE REPORTING PROCEDURES\n\n       A. Timely filing. When the Committee has ordered a measure \n     or matter reported, following final action, the report \n     thereon shall be filed in the Senate at the earliest \n     practicable time. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 10(b), Standing Rules of \n     the Senate.)\n       B. Supplemental, Minority, and additional views. A Member \n     of the Committee who gives notice of his or her intention to \n     file supplemental, Minority, or additional views at the time \n     of final Committee approval of a measure or matter shall be \n     entitled to not less than 3 calendar days in which to file \n     such views, in writing, with the chief clerk of the \n     Committee. Such views shall then be included in the Committee \n     report and printed in the same volume, as a part thereof, and \n     their inclusion shall be noted on the cover of the report. In \n     the absence of timely notice, the Committee report may be \n     filed and printed immediately without such views. (Rule XXVI, \n     Sec. 10(c), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       C. Notice by Subcommittee Chairmen. The Chairman of each \n     Subcommittee shall notify the Chairman in writing whenever \n     any measure has been ordered reported by such Subcommittee \n     and is ready for consideration by the full Committee.\n       D. Draft reports of Subcommittees. All draft reports \n     prepared by Subcommittees of this Committee on any measure or \n     matter referred to it by the Chairman shall be in the form, \n     style, and arrangement required to conform to the applicable \n     provisions of the Standing Rules of the Senate, and shall be \n     in accordance with the established practices followed by the \n     Committee. Upon completion of such draft reports, copies \n     thereof shall be filed with the chief clerk of the Committee \n     at the earliest practicable time.\n       E. Impact statements in reports. All Committee reports, \n     accompanying a bill or joint resolution of a public character \n     reported by the Committee, shall contain (1) an estimate, \n     made by the Committee, of the costs which would be incurred \n     in carrying out the legislation for the then current fiscal \n     year and for each of the next 5 years thereafter (or for the \n     authorized duration of the proposed legislation, if less than \n     5 years); and (2) a comparison of such cost estimates with \n     any made by a Federal agency; or (3) in lieu of such estimate \n     or comparison, or both, a statement of the reasons for \n     failure by the Committee to comply with these requirements as \n     impracticable, in the event of inability to comply therewith. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 11(a), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       Each such report shall also contain an evaluation, made by \n     the Committee, of the regulatory impact which would be \n     incurred in carrying out the bill or joint resolution. The \n     evaluation shall include (a) an estimate of the numbers of \n     individuals and businesses who would be regulated and a \n     determination of the groups and classes of such individuals \n     and businesses, (b) a determination of the economic impact of \n     such regulation on the individuals, consumers, and businesses \n     affected, (c) a determination of the impact on the personal \n     privacy of the individuals affected, and (d) a determination \n     of the amount of paperwork that will result from the \n     regulations to be promulgated pursuant to the bill or joint \n     resolution, which determination may include, but need not be \n     limited to, estimates of the amount of time and financial \n     costs required of affected parties, showing whether the \n     effects of the bill or joint resolution could be substantial, \n     as well as reasonable estimates of the recordkeeping \n     requirements that may be associated with the bill or joint \n     resolution. Or, in lieu of the forgoing evaluation, the \n     report shall include a statement of the reasons for failure \n     by the Committee to comply with these requirements as \n     impracticable, in the event of inability to comply therewith. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 11(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n\n\n           RULE 7.

Each Subcommittee of \n     this Committee is authorized to establish meeting dates and \n     adopt rules not inconsistent with the rules of the Committee \n     except as provided in Rules 2(D) and 7(E).\n\n[[Page S416]]\n\n       E. Subcommittee subpoenas. Each Subcommittee is authorized \n     to adopt rules concerning subpoenas which need not be \n     consistent with the rules of the Committee; provided, \n     however, that in the event the Subcommittee authorizes the \n     issuance of a subpoena pursuant to its own rules, a written \n     notice of intent to issue the subpoena shall be provided to \n     the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Committee, or \n     staff officers designated by them, by the Subcommittee \n     Chairman or a staff officer designated by him/her immediately \n     upon such authorization, and no subpoena shall be issued for \n     at least 48 hours, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, from \n     delivery to the appropriate offices, unless the Chairman and \n     Ranking Minority Member waive the 48-hour waiting period or \n     unless the Subcommittee Chairman certifies in writing to the \n     Chairman and Ranking Minority Member that, in his or her \n     opinion, it is necessary to issue a subpoena immediately.\n       F. Subcommittee budgets. During the first year of a new \n     Congress, each Subcommittee that requires authorization for \n     the expenditure of funds for the conduct of inquiries and \n     investigations, shall file with the chief clerk of the \n     Committee, by a date and time prescribed by the Chairman, its \n     request for funds for the two (2) 12-month periods beginning \n     on March 1 and extending through and including the last day \n     of February of the 2 following years, which years comprise \n     that Congress. Each such request shall be submitted on the \n     budget form prescribed by the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration, and shall be accompanied by a written \n     justification addressed to the Chairman of the Committee, \n     which shall include (1) a statement of the Subcommittee's \n     area of activities, (2) its accomplishments during the \n     preceding Congress detailed year by year, and (3) a table \n     showing a comparison between (a) the funds authorized for \n     expenditure during the preceding Congress detailed year by \n     year, (b) the funds actually expended during that Congress \n     detailed year by year, (c) the amount requested for each year \n     of the Congress, and (d) the number of professional and \n     clerical staff members and consultants employed by the \n     Subcommittee during the preceding Congress detailed year by \n     year and the number of such personnel requested for each year \n     of the Congress. The Chairman may request additional reports \n     from the Subcommittees regarding their activities and budgets \n     at any time during a Congress. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 9, Standing \n     Rules of the Senate.)\n\n\n             RULE 8. CONFIRMATION STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES\n\n       A. Standards. In considering a nomination, the Committee \n     shall inquire into the nominee's experience, qualifications, \n     suitability, and integrity to serve in the position to which \n     he or she has been nominated. The Committee shall recommend \n     confirmation, upon finding that the nominee has the necessary \n     integrity and is affirmatively qualified by reason of \n     training, education, or experience to carry out the functions \n     of the office to which he or she was nominated.\n       B. Information concerning the Nominee. Each nominee shall \n     submit the following information to the Committee:\n       (1) A detailed biographical resume which contains \n     information relating to education, employment, and \n     achievements;\n       (2) Financial information, in such specificity as the \n     Committee deems necessary, including a list of assets and \n     liabilities of the nominee and tax returns for the 3 years \n     preceding the time of his or her nomination, and copies of \n     other relevant documents requested by the Committee, such as \n     a proposed blind trust agreement, necessary for the \n     Committee's consideration; and,\n       (3) Copies of other relevant documents the Committee may \n     request, such as responses to questions concerning the \n     policies and programs the nominee intends to pursue upon \n     taking office. At the request of the Chairman or the Ranking \n     Minority Member, a nominee shall be required to submit a \n     certified financial statement compiled by an independent \n     auditor. Information received pursuant to this subsection \n     shall be made available for public inspection; provided, \n     however, that tax returns shall, after review by persons \n     designated in subsection (C) of this rule, be placed under \n     seal to ensure confidentiality.\n       C. Procedures for Committee inquiry. The Committee shall \n     conduct an inquiry into the experience, qualifications, \n     suitability, and integrity of nominees, and shall give \n     particular attention to the following matters:\n       (1) A review of the biographical information provided by \n     the nominee, including, but not limited to, any professional \n     activities related to the duties of the office to which he or \n     she is nominated;\n       (2) A review of the financial information provided by the \n     nominee, including tax returns for the 3 years preceding the \n     time of his or her nomination;\n       (3) A review of any actions, taken or proposed by the \n     nominee, to remedy conflicts of interest; and\n       (4) A review of any personal or legal matter which may bear \n     upon the nominee's qualifications for the office to which he \n     or she is nominated. For the purpose of assisting the \n     Committee in the conduct of this inquiry, a Majority \n     investigator or investigators shall be designated by the \n     Chairman and a Minority investigator or investigators shall \n     be designated by the Ranking Minority Member. The Chairman, \n     Ranking Minority Member, other Members of the Committee, and \n     designated investigators shall have access to all \n     investigative reports on nominees prepared by any Federal \n     agency, except that only the Chairman, the Ranking Minority \n     Member, or other Members of the Committee, upon request, \n     shall have access to the report of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation. The Committee may request the assistance of \n     the U.S. Government Accountability Office and any other such \n     expert opinion as may be necessary in conducting its review \n     of information provided by nominees.\n       D. Report on the Nominee. After a review of all information \n     pertinent to the nomination, a confidential report on the \n     nominee shall be made in the case of judicial nominees and \n     may be made in the case of non-judicial nominees by the \n     designated investigators to the Chairman and the Ranking \n     Minority Member and, upon request, to any other Member of the \n     Committee. The report shall summarize the steps taken by the \n     Committee during its investigation of the nominee and the \n     results of the Committee inquiry, including any unresolved \n     matters that have been raised during the course of the \n     inquiry.\n       E. Hearings. The Committee shall conduct a public hearing \n     during which the nominee shall be called to testify under \n     oath on all matters relating to his or her suitability for \n     office, including the policies and programs which he or she \n     will pursue while in that position. No hearing shall be held \n     until at least 72 hours after the following events have \n     occurred: The nominee has responded to prehearing questions \n     submitted by the Committee; and, if applicable, the report \n     described in subsection (D) has been made to the Chairman and \n     Ranking Minority Member, and is available to other Members of \n     the Committee, upon request.\n       F. Action on confirmation. A mark-up on a nomination shall \n     not occur on the same day that the hearing on the nominee is \n     held. In order to assist the Committee in reaching a \n     recommendation on confirmation, the staff may make an oral \n     presentation to the Committee at the mark-up, factually \n     summarizing the nominee's background and the steps taken \n     during the pre-hearing inquiry.\n       G. Application. The procedures contained in subsections \n     (C), (D), (E), and (F) of this rule shall apply to persons \n     nominated by the President to positions requiring their full-\n     time service.

Mr. President, yesterday I introduced the Indian Tribal \nEnergy Development and Self-Determination Act Amendments of 2015.\n  In recent years, the Committee on Indian Affairs has received \nconcerns from Indian tribes and the energy industry that the Federal \nlaws governing the development of tribal energy resources are complex \nand often lead to significant costs, delays and uncertainty for all \nparties. These costs, delays and uncertainties discourage development \nof tribal energy resources and drive investments away from tribal \nlands.\n  According to the National Congress of American Indians, Indian tribes \nhold nearly a quarter of American onshore oil and gas reserves. Yet, \nexisting tribal energy production represents less than 5 percent of the \ncurrent national production. If we can remove the costs and delays of \ndeveloping energy on Indian lands, we could potentially see the \ncountry's energy production, and thus energy independence, increase \nsignificantly.\n  Nearly 10 years ago, Congress passed the Indian Tribal Energy \nDevelopment and Self-Determination Act. This act created a new, \nalternative process for Indian tribes to take control of developing \ntheir energy resources on their own lands without the burdens of \nadministrative review, approval, and oversight.\n  This approach gives Indian tribes the option to enter into tribal \nenergy resource agreements with the Secretary of the Interior. Once an \nIndian tribe enters into this agreement, it has the authority to enter \ninto subsequent leases, business agreements, and rights-of-way \naffecting energy development, without further review and approval by \nthe Secretary--a significant\n\n[[Page S417]]\n\ndeparture from the standard laws, and consequent bureaucracy, \napplicable to tribal contracts.\n  That law was a step in the right direction. However, these agreements \nhave not been utilized to the extent that they could be, primarily \nbecause the implementation of the act has been made more complex than \nit should be.\n  It is past time we make key improvements to the law so that Indian \ntribes can take advantage of these agreements and significantly reduce \nbureaucratic burdens to energy development. Years of consultation and \noutreach to Indian tribes have produced targeted solutions to address \nthe concerns about the process for entering these agreements. The bill \nthat I am introducing today would streamline the process for approving \nthe tribal energy resource agreements and make it more predictable for \nIndian tribes.\n  I would like to highlight some of the key provisions in this bill. \nThis bill includes a number of amendments to improve the review and \napproval process for the tribal energy resource agreements. For \nexample, the bill provides clarity regarding the specific information \nrequired for tribal applications for these agreements.\n  In addition, the bill sets forth specific time frames for Secretarial \ndeterminations on the agreement applications. Moreover, if an \napplication is disapproved, this bill would require the Secretary of \nthe Interior to provide detailed explanations to the Indian tribe and \nsteps for addressing the reasons for disapproval.\n  The bill has various provisions that would improve technical \nassistance and consultation with Indian tribes during their energy \nplanning and development stages. It also includes an amendment to the \nFederal Power Act that would put Indian tribes on a similar footing \nwith States and municipalities for preferences when preliminary permits \nor original licenses for hydroelectric projects are issued.\n  Additionally, this bill would allow Indian tribes and third parties \nto perform appraisals to help expedite the Secretary's approval process \nfor tribal agreements for mineral resource development.\n  My bill does not focus on only traditional resource development, but \nincludes renewal resource development components as well. For example, \nthe bill would create tribal biomass demonstration projects to provide \nIndian tribes with more reliable and potentially long-term supplies of \nwoody biomass materials.\n  This bill is intended to provide Indian tribes with the tools to \ndevelop and use energy more efficiently. In passing this bill, Congress \nwill enhance the ability of Indian tribes to exercise self-\ndetermination over the development of energy resources located on \ntribal lands, thereby improving the lives and economic well-being of \nNative Americans.\n  Before I conclude, I would like to thank Senators Tester, McCain, \nHoeven, Enzi, and Fischer for joining me in cosponsoring this \nbipartisan bill. I urge my colleagues to join me in advancing this bill \nexpeditiously.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/22/senate-section/article/S417-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S417-S418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IT'S TIME TO FIX NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nmy remarks at yesterday's Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee hearing be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 It's Time To Fix No Child Left Behind\n\n       Since this is the first hearing of the committee in this \n     114th Congress, I have some preliminary remarks.\n       This committee touches almost every American.\n       No committee is more ideologically diverse and none is more \n     productive. In the last Congress, 25 bills passed out of this \n     committee became laws.\n       That's because we worked with Chairman Harkin on areas of \n     agreement.\n       I look forward to working in the same way with Ranking \n     Member Murray in this Congress. She is direct, well-\n     respected, she cares about people and is results-oriented.\n       We are going to have an open process, which means we're \n     going to have a full opportunity for discussion and for \n     amendments. Not just in the committee, but on the floor. In \n     the last two congresses, we reported a bill, but it didn't \n     make it to the floor.\n       This congress, we hope to have a bipartisan bill coming out \n     of committee--but even if we don't, the bill will go to the \n     floor and it will have to get 60 votes on the floor, 60 votes \n     to go to conference, 60 votes to get out of conference, and \n     then the president will have his say. We hope to get his \n     signature and get a result.\n       Next, the schedule:\n       Let me start with some unfinished business:\n       Fixing NCLB: This is way overdue, it expired more than 7 \n     years ago. We posted a working draft on the website last \n     week, already feedback is coming in--not just from Congress \n     but from around the country. We have several more weeks of \n     hearings and meetings. We hope to have a bill ready for floor \n     by end of February. The House expects to have its bill on the \n     floor by the end of February.\n       Reauthorizing the Higher Education Act: This is, for me, \n     about deregulating higher education making rules simpler and \n     more effective. Also, finishing the work we did on student \n     loans in the last congress. Our first hearing on the \n     deregulation task force formed by Senators Mikulski, Burr, \n     and Bennet and me is on Tuesday, February 24.\n       As rapidly and responsibly as we can, we want to repair the \n     damage of Obamacare and provide more Americans with health \n     insurance that fits their budgets. Our first hearing is \n     tomorrow on the 30 to 40 hour workweek--the bill introduced \n     by Senators Collins, Donnelly, Murkowski and Manchin. We will \n     report our opinions to the Finance committee.\n       Then, some new business:\n       Let's call it 21st Century Cures--that's what the House \n     calls it, as it finishes its work this spring. The president \n     is also interested. What we're talking about is getting to \n     market more rapidly, while still safe, medicines, treatments \n     and medical devices. There is a lot of interest in this and \n     we'll start staff working groups soon.\n       There will be more in labor, pensions, education, health \n     but those are major priorities and that is how we start.\n       The president has also made major proposals on early \n     childhood education and community college. These are \n     certainly relevant to K-12, but we've always dealt with them \n     separately. It's difficult for me to see how we make these \n     issues part of this reauthorization.\n       Now to today's hearing: Last week Secretary Duncan called \n     for law to be fixed. Almost everyone seems to agree with \n     that--it's more than 7 years overdue.\n       We've been working on it for more than 6 years. When we \n     started, former Rep. George Miller said, Pass a lean bill to \n     fix No Child Left Behind, and we identified a small number of \n     problems.\n       Since then, we've had 24 hearings, and in each of the last \n     two Congresses we've reported bills out of committee.\n       Senators should know issues by now, 20 of 22 were here in \n     the last congress, 16 of 22 were here in the previous \n     congress.\n       One reason it needs to be fixed is that NCLB has become \n     unworkable.\n       Under its original provisions, almost all of America's \n     100,000 public schools would be labeled a ``failing school.''\n       To avoid this unintended result, the U. S. Secretary of \n     Education has granted waivers from the law's provisions to 43 \n     states--including Washington, which has since had its waiver \n     revoked--as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.\n       This has created a second unintended result, at least \n     unintended by Congress, which stated in law that no federal \n     official should ``exercise any direction, supervision or \n     control over curriculum, program or instruction or \n     administration of any educational institution.''\n       Nevertheless, in exchange for the waivers, the Secretary \n     has told states what their academic standards should be, how \n     states should measure the progress of students toward those \n     standards, what constitutes failure for schools and what the \n     consequences of failure are, how to fix low-performing \n     schools, and how to evaluate teachers. The Department has \n     become, in effect, a national school board. Or, as one \n     teacher told me, it has become a national Human Resources \n     Department for 100,000 public schools.\n       At the center of the debate about how to fix No Child Left \n     Behind is what to do about the federal requirement that \n     states annually administer 17 standardized tests with high-\n     stakes consequences. Educators call this an accountability \n     system.\n       Are there too many tests? Are they the right tests? Are the \n     stakes for failing them too high? What should Washington, \n     D.C. have to do with all this?\n       Many states and school districts require schools to \n     administer additional tests.\n       This is called a hearing for a reason. I have come to \n     listen.\n       The Chairman's staff discussion draft I have circulated \n     includes two options on testing:\n       Option 1 gives flexibility to the states to decide what to \n     do on testing.\n       Option 2 maintains current law testing requirements.\n       Both options would continue to require annual reporting of \n     student achievement, disaggregated by subgroups of children.\n       Washington sometimes forgets--but governors never do--that \n     the federal government has limited involvement in elementary \n     and secondary education, contributing only 10 percent of the \n     money that public schools receive.\n       For 30 years the real action has been in the states.\n       I have seen this first hand.\n\n[[Page S418]]\n\n       I was Governor in 1983 when President Reagan's Education \n     Secretary, Terrell Bell, issued a report called: ``A Nation \n     at Risk,'' which said that: ``If an unfriendly foreign power \n     had attempted to impose on America the mediocre educational \n     performance that exists today, we might well have viewed it \n     as an act of war.''\n       The next year Tennessee became the first state to pay \n     teachers more for teaching well.\n       In 1985 and 1986, every Governor spent an entire year \n     focused on improving schools the first time in the history of \n     the National Governors Association that it happened. I was \n     chairman of the association that year and the Governor of \n     Arkansas, Bill Clinton, was the vice chairman.\n       In 1989, the first President Bush held a national meeting \n     of Governors in Charlottesville, Virginia, and established \n     national education goals.\n       Then in 1991-1992, President Bush announced America 2000 to \n     help move the nation voluntarily toward those goals, state by \n     state, community by community. I was the Education Secretary \n     at that time.\n       Since then states have worked together voluntarily to \n     develop academic standards, develop tests, to create their \n     own accountability systems, find fair ways to evaluate \n     teacher performance--and then adopted those that fit their \n     states.\n       I know members of this committee must be tired of hearing \n     me talk until I am blue in the face about a ``national school \n     board.'' I know it is tempting to try to fix classrooms from \n     Washington. I also hear from governors and school \n     superintendents who say that if ``Washington doesn't make us \n     do it, the teachers unions and opponents from the right will \n     make it impossible to have higher standards and better \n     teachers.''\n       And I understand that there can be short term gains from \n     Washington's orders--but my experience is that long term \n     success can't come that way. In fact, today Washington's \n     involvement, in effect mandating Common Core and teacher \n     evaluation, is creating a backlash, making it harder for \n     states to set higher standards and evaluate teaching.\n       As one former Democratic governor told me recently, ``We \n     were doing pretty well until Washington got involved. If they \n     will get out of the way we can get back on track.''\n       So rather than turn blue in the face one more time about \n     the national school board let me conclude with the remarks of \n     Carol Burris, New York's High School principal of the Year. \n     She responded last week to our committee working draft this \n     way:\n       . . . I ask that your committee remember that the American \n     public school system was built on the belief that local \n     communities cherish their children and have the right and \n     responsibility, within sensible limits, to determine how they \n     are schooled.\n       While the federal government has a very special role in \n     ensuring that our students do not experience discrimination \n     based on who they are or what their disability might be, \n     Congress is not a National School Board.\n       Although our locally elected school boards may not be \n     perfect, they represent one of the purest forms of democracy \n     that we have. Bad ideas in the small do damage in the small \n     and are easily corrected. Bad ideas at the federal level \n     result in massive failure and are harder to fix.\n       Please understand that I do not dismiss the need to hold \n     schools accountable. The use and disaggregation of data has \n     been an important tool that I use regularly as a principal to \n     improve my own school. However, the unintended, negative \n     consequences that have arisen from mandated, annual testing \n     and its high stakes uses have proven testing not only to be \n     an ineffective tool, but a destructive one as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/22/senate-section/article/S418-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  TRIBUTE TO BISHOP CHAD W. ZIELINSKI\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. In November, Father Chad Zielinski, the deputy \nwing chaplain at Eielson Air Force Base near Fairbanks, received what \nhe regarded as an odd early morning telephone call. The call came from \nthe Apostolic Nuncio, the Vatican's ambassador to the United States. \nThe Nuncio informed Father Zielinski that he had been selected by Pope \nFrancis to serve as the Catholic bishop of Fairbanks.\n  His immediate reaction: This makes no sense; how can this be? There \nmust be some mistake. But there was no mistake. In December, Bishop \nZielinski was ordained and installed to lead the Diocese of Fairbanks. \nThe Catholic Anchor newspaper reports that Bishop Zielinski is the \nfirst active duty military chaplain in recent history to shepherd a \ndiocese. At age 50 he is also the 11th youngest of the 267 active U.S. \nCatholic bishops.\n  The selection was met with great enthusiasm throughout interior \nAlaska and especially in our military community. Before being called to \nthe priesthood, Bishop Zielinski served on active duty in the Air \nForce. He was ordained a priest for the Catholic Diocese of Gaylord, \nMI, in 1996. But after the events of September 11 he saw a need for \nCatholic chaplains in the military and rejoined the Air Force.\n  His Air Force career was varied. Bishop Zielinski served as Roman \nCatholic cadet chaplain at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs \nand as a chaplain recruiter assigned to the Air Force Recruiting \nService. He also served at Grand Forks Air Force Base in North Dakota \nand at RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk, England.\n  And he served three tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan--his first \nin Baghdad in 2003 and his last in Afghanistan where he served 18 \nforward combat positions, where religious services were punctuated by \nthe sound of live gun fire. On one sad day, the convoy in which he was \ntraveling was hit by a rocket, killing one of the drivers, who also \nhappened to be a parishioner. That day ended with the bishop conducting \na funeral. Needless to say, Bishop Zielinski was regarded as an \nexemplary chaplain and I have no doubt that he will be an exemplary \nbishop.\n  The Diocese of Fairbanks, the most northern and geographically \ndiverse in the United States, covers some 410,000 square miles. It \nholds 46 parishes, most of which are in the Alaska Native villages. I \nam excited about Bishop Zielinski's elevation and I look forward to \nworking closely with him in his new and important role as a leader in \nour faith community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/22/senate-section/article/S418-2", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S418-S419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO FATHER FERNANDO ``FRED'' BUGARIN\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. On January 25, 1975, Father Fred Bugarin was \nordained as a priest in the Archdiocese of Anchorage by Archbishop \nJoseph T. Ryan. This week marks the 40th anniversary of Father Fred's \nordination. On Saturday evening, friends of Father Fred will gather in \nSt. Anthony's parish hall to celebrate his 40 years of faith and \nservice. I join with the Anchorage community in expressing my \nappreciation to Father Fred for his good works.\n  Father Fred was born in the Philippines and migrated to Anchorage \nwith his family in 1963. He was age 14 at the time. He graduated from \nWest High School in 1967 and went on to study humanities and theology \nat the University of Dallas/Holy Trinity Seminary. Following his \nordination, Father Fred was assigned to St. Benedict's parish as an \nassistant pastor. In 1978 he was selected as the first resident pastor \nof Sacred Heart parish in Wasilla and served there until 1981. He was \nsubsequently promoted to direct the permanent diaconate and ministries \nprogram for the archdiocese.\n  Five years later, while on sabbatical, Father Fred set out on a new \ndirection--to reconnect with his roots in the Philippines and enrolled \nat the East Asian Pastoral Institute in Manila where he became immersed \nin East Asian thought and culture. Father Fred signed up for the \nMaryknoll Associate Priests Program and upon completion of the training \nhe was sent off to Mindanao in the southern Philippines. Father Fred \nhad much to learn. He grew up in the northern Philippines and the \nlanguage and culture of the southern Philippines was much different. \nYet he was determined to connect with the people he served no matter \nhow steep the learning curve. It was the right fit--a 5-year contract \nturned into an 8-year experience. What was to have been a short \nsabbatical turned into a life changing event.\n  Upon his return to the United States, the Archdiocese of Anchorage \nassigned Father Fred to Kodiak Island, a diverse community with an \neconomy revolving around the fishing industry. Blue collar workers, \nmainly from the canneries, made up the bulk of the parish. During \nfishing season the population includes Filipinos, Salvadorans, \nMexicans, Vietnamese, Samoans and Laotians among others. Father Fred \nregarded Kodiak as a laboratory for incorporating what he learned \nthrough his work in the Philippines.\n  After 5 years in Kodiak, Father Fred was reassigned to St. Anthony's \nparish where he remains today. He is known throughout Alaska for his \nwork in building inclusive parishes and is active in interreligious \nactivities in Anchorage. Since 2003, Father Fred has been involved with \nAlaska Faith and Action Congregations Together, has taught foundations \nof Christianity at Alaska Pacific University and has facilitated \nfatherhood workshops for the Alaska native community. In 2011, Father \nFred was awarded the doctor of ministry degree from the Pacific School \nof Religion in Berkeley, CA.\n\n[[Page S419]]\n\n  Father Fred has left a very powerful impression on every community he \nhas served. He is an inspiration to his fellow pastors. I am honored to \nrecognize Father Fred for his good works and wish him many long years \nof continued service to his faith and to his community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/22/senate-section/article/S419-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING BOYETT PRINTING & GRAPHICS, INC.\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, the expansion of a small business \ncan refer to the size of the building, customers, as well as inventory, \nbut sometimes expansion can lead a small business toward a much more \nextensive track than its original direction. For this week's Small \nBusiness of the Week, I would like to recognize a Louisiana business \nthat has broadened its scope and impact far beyond the size of its \nstorefront. Boyett Printing & Graphics, Inc. of Shreveport, LA, is \nwell-known for its printing and also offers an immense variety of \nservices and products to the customers of northwest Louisiana.\n  In March 1994, John and Janet Boyett founded their printing business \nright in their home office. Their first official project was to print \nthe church bulletins for the local Broadmoor Baptist Church. Five years \nlater, the Boyetts' flourishing business outgrew their home, and they \nmoved to the heart of Shreveport, hiring seven full-time employees in \nthe process. The Boyetts' commitment to extraordinary service and \nquality products has buoyed their success for over 20 years.\n  These days, Boyett Printing & Graphics, Inc. provides printing on \nitems such as brochures, business cards, newsletters, and stationery. \nPrinting is also available on over 30,000 promotional products, which \nincludes a vast variety of items from apparel to party favors to first \naid kits. Their services, however, go far beyond what their printing \nlabel might suggest. Boyett Printing & Graphics, Inc. supplies creative \ngraphic design services, as well as mailing services, booklet binding, \nletterpress, as well as bindery and finishing services. This broad \narray of operations truly allows this small business to be a ``one stop \nshop.''\n  Another way the Boyetts have set themselves apart is through their \nefforts to have a low impact on the environment. They prioritize \nrecycling, using biodegradable inks and water soluble chemicals, and \npurchasing their paper from decades-old tree farms--even when it is \nmore expensive. That is why their website is innovative and user \nfriendly. Customers can submit an order or request price estimates. \nThey can also sift through helpful ideas, business news, constructive \ntips, printing terms, as well as the latest versions of graphic art \nsoftware. It is no wonder they were awarded an A-plus rating with the \nBetter Business Bureau.\n  Their philosophy is founded on trust, reasonable prices, quality \nwork, and friendliness, and clearly, it works. I am honored to \nrecognize a business that anticipates its customer's needs, works with \nurgency and enthusiasm, and provides necessary services to the \ncommunity with such dedication and convenience. Congratulations to \nBoyett Printing & Graphics, Inc. for being selected as this week's \nSmall Business of the Week, and thank you for all of your service to \nthe northwest region of Louisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/22/senate-section/article/S419-2", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO VINCENT PETRARCA\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I am honored to congratulate Mr. Vincent \nPetrarca of West Warwick, RI, a proud American veteran and beloved \nfamily man, on the occasion of his 90th birthday.\n  Vin enlisted in the U.S. Navy at age 18 and served in the Pacific \nFleet. He was a crewmember of the destroyer USS Newcomb when, in April \n1945, that ship encountered heavy air bombardment from Japanese forces \noff the west coast of Okinawa. Although struck multiple times by \nkamikaze attackers and sustaining heavy casualties, the Newcomb drove \noff or shot down several aircraft. ``Nelson's accolade to his sailors, \n`They fought as one man, and that man a hero,''' wrote historian Samuel \nEliot Morison, ``could well be applied to her crew,'' which earned the \nNavy Unit Commendation.\n  Vin married Jeanne Lesniak, and their union, now in its 62nd year, \nhas been blessed with 7 children, 12 grandchildren, and 4 great \ngrandchildren. Vin remains active, continuing a formidable amateur golf \ncareer. His tournament victories span a half-century, from the 1962 \nWest Warwick Country Club Championship to the 2012 Rhode Island Father/\nDaughter State Championship.\n  On behalf of the State of Rhode Island and the Senate of the United \nStates, I congratulate Vincent Petrarca on 90 remarkable years, and \nwish him health and happiness in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/22/senate-section/article/S419-3", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:26 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 161.

A bill to provide for wildfire suppression operations, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Budget.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Wildfire \nDisaster Funding Act of 2015 with a bipartisan group of my colleagues, \nto ensure that Federal agencies have the resources and funding they \nneed to not only fight the wildfires that erupt yearly in our Nation's \nforests, but to effectively manage forests to prevent future infernos.\n  For decades, our country has experienced tragic and costly wildfire \nseasons. Year after year, communities are displaced, natural treasures \nare destroyed, and the brave men and women who fight these fires risk \ntheir lives, and some don't come home. Due to climate change, drought, \nand overstocked and under-managed forests, the risks from these \ninfernos continues to grow.\n  As the Forest Service needs to direct more and more resources to \nfighting fires, and less to managing the forests, it is transforming \nitself into the ``Fire Service.'' Over the past 20 years, substantial \nspending on Federal wildfire suppression activities has grown. In 2013, \nthe Forest Service devoted 41 percent of its total budget to wildfire \nmanagement, compared to just 13 percent of its total budget in 1991. In \n8 of the past 10 years, the Forest Service has exceeded its budget for \nwildfire suppression, requiring the Agency to conduct what's known as \n``fire borrowing'' to cover wildfire suppression costs. The funds being \nborrowed come from accounts that should be used for hazardous fuels \ntreatment and other forest management activities, and are unfortunately \nrarely, if ever, paid back.\n  This ``fire robbery'' is disruptive, unproductive, and undermines the \ncore mission of the Forest Service, particularly as forest management \nprogram budgets continue to get slashed. Hazardous fuels treatments \nhave been proven to reduce fire risk, yet Federal agencies don't even \nhave the opportunity or the funding to conduct these treatments when \nfires are breaking out and threatening lives and property for months on \nend.\n  Today I am reintroducing the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, to help \nour Nation find a better way to manage our forests, prevent future \nwildfires, and fund wildfire fighting activities, both small and \ncatastrophic. Major wildfire events should be treated as the natural \ndisasters that they are, and should be funded as such. This bill \nestablishes parity for wildfire funding, putting it on equal footing \nwith other natural disasters like floods and hurricanes. Whether it's \nwater, wind, earth, or fire, the earth's natural disasters can all \ncause devastation and should be addressed equally.\n  A Department of the Interior and Department of Agriculture analysis \nshows that 1 percent of wildfires represent 30 percent of agency costs. \nTo ensure that fighting the largest infernos doesn't cripple agency \nbudgets, the bill would fund the largest fire even under disaster \nprograms, leaving funds available for routine wildfire fighting and \nforest management activities. It does this by moving any spending above \n70 percent of the 10-year rolling average for fire suppression outside \nof the agencies' baseline budget and makes these additional costs \neligible to be funded under a separate disaster account. This should \nfree up discretionary funds that can now go toward hazardous fuels \nprojects that will improve the health of our forests and ultimately \nprevent future wildfires.\n  I am pleased to be joined again by Senator Crapo in introducing the \nbill today, as well as Senators Cantwell, Risch, Bennet, Gardner, \nBaldwin, and Daines. I look forward to working with my colleagues \ntoward enactment of the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act in the 114th \nCongress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. HEITKAMP (for herself, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Tester, Ms. \n        Hirono, Mr. Schatz, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Franken, Mr. Hoeven, \n        Mr. Udall, Ms. Klobuchar, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Thune, Ms. Warren, \n        Mr. Heinrich, Mr. Moran, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms. \n        Collins, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Fischer, Ms. Stabenow, Ms. Cantwell, \n        Ms. Baldwin, and Mrs. Shaheen):\n  S. 246. A bill to establish the Alyce Spotted Bear and Walter \nSoboleff Commission on Native Children, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, for those of us who are parents, we \nshould want to make sure all of our children have the same \nopportunities as other children. This starts with a quality education, \na safe and secure home, access to quality health care, and a community \nfree of violence. These are deeply important issues. But too often, \ntalk about protecting our Native children is left out of the \nconversation. Native children are too often considered ``them'' and not \npart of ``us.'' That needs to change--in fact, it must change. \nUnfortunately, for children in our nation's tribal communities, \nopportunities for success are often out of reach. As a result, Native \nchildren are sadly the most at-risk population in the country and face \nserious disparities.\n  The Federal Government has a trust responsibility to provide for the \neducation, health, and safety of Native children. But for far too long, \nwe have failed to live up to this promise. We are failing by not \nkeeping them safe, healthy, or providing them with educational \nopportunities necessary to reach their full potential.\n  Native children have the third highest rate of being abused. They are \noverrepresented in foster care, more than 2.1 times the general \npopulation. Child mortality has increased 15 percent among Native \nchildren, while the rate among all American children has decreased by 9 \npercent since 2000. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among \nNative young adults ages 15 to 24 years old, 2.5 times the national \naverage. The graduation rate for Native high school students hovers \naround 50 percent compared to 75 percent for white students. These \nnumbers are simply staggering arid they are the direct result of \ngrowing up in communities that face significant challenges, high rates \nof poverty, staggering unemployment, child abuse and domestic violence, \ncrime, substance abuse, and few economic opportunities.\n  I have spent a great deal of time on Indian reservations in North \nDakota. I\n\n[[Page S423]]\n\nam humbled to always be welcomed with open arms and treated like \nfamily. The tribes have a cultural sense about the need to defend their \nchildren. But because of the lack of resources, the stories are still \nincredibly jarring. I have seen firsthand the obstacles tribal \ngovernments confront in responding to the needs of Native children. \nExisting program rules and the volume of resources required to access \ncurrent grant opportunities stymie efforts of tribes to tackle the \nunderlying issues impacting our Native children. At the same time, \nfederal agencies lack clear guidance about the direction that should be \ntaken to best address the needs of Native children to fulfill our \nnation's treaty and trust responsibility to tribal nations. It is clear \nthat Native children are suffering as a result.\n  Too many times I have heard stories about Native children in North \nDakota placed in juvenile detention centers for offenses that would \nlikely not result in incarceration, except for the fact that they are \nNative American. I heard a story about a teenage girl in detention \nbecause of substance addiction. She wants to get the health counseling \nshe needs, but hasn't been given enough support, as too often there \naren't enough resources available. She wants to go to school and get to \nthe correct grade level, but is now already two grades behind and is \ncontinuing to fall further back while in detention. Without anyone \nlooking to help, she will likely fall further back. This is just one \nstory. But there are too many like it. Unless we act, we are turning \nour backs on Native children throughout the country.\n  I am determined to work to reverse these trends and end these \nterrible stories. We need to strive for a day when Native children no \nlonger live in third-world conditions; where they don't face the threat \nof abuse on a daily basis; where they receive the good health care and \neducation that help them grow and succeed. I will pledge to work to \ngive these to today's Native children and future generations.\n  To begin this effort, I am proud to introduce the Alyce Spotted Bear \nand Walter Soboleff Commission on Native Children. Since joining the \nSenate, I have talked about the importance of working across the aisle \nto get things done. That's why this is a bipartisan bill, as Senator \nMurkowski from Alaska has joined me in this effort, along with 20 of \nour colleagues. Our bill aims to address the sweeping challenges that \nNative Americans face by creating a Federal Commission on Native \nChildren. It would begin a national conversation about the state of \nAmerican Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian children. It is a \nconversation that is long overdue.\n  The commission will be directed to complete a comprehensive study on \nthe programs, grants, and support available for Native children, both \nat the federal level and on the ground in Native communities. Right \nnow, so many of these details are lacking, which makes it more \ndifficult for the Federal Government to determine what kind of support \nis needed. Then, the 11 member Commission will issue a report on how to \naddress the series of challenges currently facing Native children. It \nis my hope that the recommendations will lead to the development of a \nsustainable system to provide wrap-around services and support our \nNative children, and also reverse the troubling statistics that have \nbecome all too familiar.\n  I believe it is telling that this bill has received a great deal of \nsupport. I want to thank the National Congress of American Indians, the \nNational Indian Health Board, the National Indian Child Welfare \nAssociation, the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, and the \nNational Indian Education Association, which have endorsed the bill, as \nhas the Great Plains Tribal Chairman's Association, and the five tribes \nin my state of North Dakota.\n  Additionally, this Commission is named in part after my dear friend, \nthe late Dr. Alyce Spotted Bear, who passed away in 2013 after a hard \nfought battle with cancer--and Walter Soboleff from the Tlingit tribe \nin Alaska. Alyce was a member of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Ankara Nation \nin North Dakota and served as Chairwoman from November 1982 to March \n1987. She was an inspiration to all who knew her and a great leader--in \nNorth Dakota and throughout the country. She was an educator dedicated \nto enabling Native students to succeed academically and making sure \nNative American cultures thrive. She was a mother, to her children, as \nwell as her students and her community. In recognition of her expertise \nin the field, President Obama appointed her as a member to the National \nAdvisory Council on Indian Education. And at the time of her passing, \nAlyce served as Vice President of Native American Studies and Tribal \nRelations at the Fort Berthold Community College in New Town, North \nDakota. I hope this Commission will be able to live up to the great \nlegacy she left behind, and also help complete some of her work for \nNative children.\n  As Sitting Bull once said ``Let us put our minds together to see what \nwe can build for our children.'' That is exactly what this Commission \nwill do, and I hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this \nimportant effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/22/senate-section/article/S423-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S423-S424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 33--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON \n               HOMELAND SECURITY AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON submitted the following resolution; from the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                               S.

Res. 35\n\n       Whereas on January 27, 1945, the Auschwitz extermination \n     camp in Nazi-occupied Poland was liberated by Allied Forces \n     during World War II after almost 5 years of murder, rape, and \n     torture at the camp;\n       Whereas 1,100,000 innocent civilians were murdered at the \n     Auschwitz extermination camp;\n       Whereas nearly 1,300,000 innocent civilians were deported \n     to Auschwitz from their homes across Eastern and Western \n     Europe, particularly from Hungary, Poland, and France;\n       Whereas 1,000,000 of the civilians who perished at the camp \n     were Jews, along with 100,000 non-Jewish Poles, Roma and \n     Sinti individuals, Soviet prisoners of war, Jehovah's \n     Witnesses, gay men and women, and other ethnic minorities;\n       Whereas these civilians included farmers, tailors, \n     seamstresses, factory hands, accountants, doctors, teachers, \n     small-business owners, clergy, intellectuals, government \n     officials, and political activists;\n       Whereas these civilians were subjected to torture, forced \n     labor, starvation, rape, medical experiments, and being \n     separated from loved ones;\n       Whereas the names of many of these civilians who perished \n     have been lost forever;\n       Whereas the Auschwitz extermination camp symbolizes the \n     extraordinary brutality of the Holocaust;\n       Whereas the people of the United States must never forget \n     the terrible crimes against humanity committed at the \n     Auschwitz extermination camp;\n       Whereas the people of the United States must educate future \n     generations to promote understanding of the dangers of \n     intolerance in order to prevent similar injustices from \n     happening again; and\n       Whereas commemoration of the liberation of the Auschwitz \n     extermination camp will instill in all people of the United \n     States a greater awareness of the Holocaust: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates January 27, 2015, as the 70th anniversary \n     of the liberation of the Auschwitz extermination camp by \n     Allied Forces during World War II;\n       (2) calls on all people of the United States to remember \n     the 1,100,000 innocent victims murdered at the Auschwitz \n     extermination camp as part of the Holocaust;\n       (3) honors the legacy of the survivors of the Holocaust and \n     of the Auschwitz extermination camp; and\n       (4) calls on the people of the United States to continue to \n     work toward tolerance, peace, and justice and to end all \n     genocide and persecution.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to bring \nto my Senate colleagues' attention the most momentous day that will \noccur next week.\n  Next week, on January 27, it will be the 70th anniversary of the \nliberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp--70 years since the \nliberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp. It was a triumph for \nthe allies, but a melancholy day as the world began to see the films \nand photographs coming out of this hellhole.\n  I stand here today to remember and remind us all that, more than any \nother word, Auschwitz is synonymous with evil.\n  As someone who is very proud of her Polish-American heritage, I \nvisited Auschwitz. I wanted to see it when I had the chance to learn \nmore about my own heritage, and I wanted to see what happened there so \nthat I would remember. I rise today so that the world remembers what \nhappened there, and then the heroic effort of the allied forces, joined \ntogether, to be able to save Europe and save Western civilization.\n  I have submitted a resolution honoring those who survive even today, \nand those who were lost, that would remind us that we need to work \nalways for tolerance, peace, and justice, and, always, to end genocide.\n  The harms of Auschwitz are incomprehensible and indescribable. The \nnumbers are grim and even ghoulish. Over 1 million people--men, women, \nand children--lost their lives at Auschwitz. Ninety percent were Jews, \nhundreds of thousands were children, and it was the largest of any of \nthe death camps.\n  Auschwitz was first created as an internment camp for Polish \ndissidents, for hundreds of thousands of Poles who were not Jewish but \nwere murdered alongside the Jews of Auschwitz.\n  In occupied Poland, a Nazi governor named Hans Frank proclaimed that, \n``Poles will become slaves of the Third Reich.''\n  But Auschwitz went far beyond the Poles, because the German \nauthorities brought in people from throughout Europe. Who were the \npeople who came? They were teachers, they were politicians, they were \nprofessors, they were artists--they were even Catholic priests. They \nwere executed or barely survived. These are the stories of heroism that \narise from the horrors.\n  Many Poles risked their lives to save Jews. I am reminded of the \nstory of Irena Sendler, who was a young social worker in Warsaw. She \nsmuggled 200 Jewish children out of the ghetto into a safe house. The \nGestapo arrested her in 1943. They first tortured her and then \ncondemned her to death.\n  Jan Karski, working for the Polish Government, went on to be a leader \nof solidarity in the founding of the new Polish democratic government. \nIn working, he visited the Warsaw ghetto and did much to liberate \npeople.\n  But this is not a story of numbers or statistics or naming of heroes. \nIt is a story I am going to tell about myself.\n  In the late 1970s, as a brandnew Congresswoman, I traveled to Poland. \nI wanted to see my heritage, and I visited the small--really small--\nvillage that my family came from, where my great-grandmother left \nPoland as a 16-year-old girl to come to the United States to meet up \nwith her brother and begin a new life, with little money in her pocket \nbut big dreams in her heart. The story of America is the story of our \nfamily. Landing in Baltimore when women didn't even have the right to \nvote, she came in 1886--exactly 100 years to the year I became a U.S. \nSenator. So I wanted to go back to see where we came from to really \nknow our story even better. But I also wanted to see the dark side of \nthe history of Poland, and I went to Auschwitz.\n  Touring the concentration camp was an experience for me that was \nsearing. Even today I carry it not only in my mind's eye, but I carry \nit in my heart. I could not believe the experience. The Presiding \nOfficer knows me. I am a fairly strong, resilient person. I think we \nhave even shared stories that I was a child abuse worker. I have seen \ntough things. But I wasn't prepared for what I saw that day.\n  As I walked through the gate of Auschwitz, to see the sign--that \ndespicable sign--of welcome there. And then we toured--well, you don't \ntour. It is not a tourist site, it is a memorial. It is sacred ground. \nIt is not a tourist site. But as we walked through, we saw the chambers \nwhere people had died.\n\n[[Page S426]]\n\n  I even went to a particular cell of a Father Kolbe, a Catholic priest \nwho in the death camp gave his life to protect a Jewish member there. \nWhen they were ready to shoot him, Father Kolbe stepped forward to \noffer his life instead. Father Kolbe, in my faith tradition, has been \ncanonized a saint for his heroic effort to show that he was willing to \nmartyr himself for another human being, and in the belief that God was \nthere in what he wanted to do.\n  But as I walked through there--and I saw hard things, tough things, \nwrenching things, repulsive, repugnant things. But then I got to the \npart that really broke my heart. I got to the part about the children. \nPictures of children--little children. Not that any child's age is \nthere. And then I saw the bins--the bins of the children's shoes: bins \npiled up with little shoes size 2, size 3, size 4, lace-up shoes, \nbecause they were the shoes they had in the 1930s and 1940s. And then I \nsaw their suitcases. Then over in another corner I saw the eyeglasses \nthat were taken from them and broken into pieces. Then I saw the \npictures of the mothers.\n  I will tell you, I became unglued. I had to step away. Even today, \nwhen I tell this story, my voice chokes up because it shook my very \nsoul.\n  So as we move into this commemoration--because it is both a \ncelebration and a commemoration--a celebration of the liberation but a \ncommemoration of what went on. I knew when I left Auschwitz--I knew and \nI understood why, first of all, we should never have genocide in the \nworld again.\n  The second thing, and also so crucial to my views, is that there \nalways needed to be a homeland for the Jewish people--why we always \nneed an Israel, why it has to be there, survivable for the ages, and \nfor all who will seek a home there and seek refuge there. This is why I \nworked so hard on these issues in terms of the support for Israel, the \nend of genocide, and also the gratitude for all the people who fought--\nfor the people who fought in the underground, for people who fought in \nthe resistance, for people who tried to participate in the famous \nuprisings; to thank God also for the other fighters--the ones who in \nthe camp gave whatever they could to keep other camp members going; and \nthen, for the allied troops, led by the United States of America--\nthere, where we stood together, we stood and stared evil down; and \nthen, when we opened up the doors of Auschwitz, for freedom and the \nability to come out, though barely alive--that it was indeed an \nhistoric moment.\n  We don't want that history ever to repeat itself, where there has to \nbe a liberation of a death camp.\n  I would also take this opportunity to salute the allies and all the \nAmerican people who made us victorious in World War II.\n  Let's say God bless the United States of America. And let's work \ntogether for a safe and secure Middle East.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/22/senate-section/article/S426-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 36--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON THE \n                               JUDICIARY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY submitted the following resolution; from the Committee \non the Judiciary; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                               S.

Res. 37\n\n       Whereas access to comprehensive reproductive health care is \n     critical to improving the health and well-being of women and \n     their families and is an essential part of their economic \n     security;\n       Whereas access to affordable contraceptives, including \n     emergency contraceptives, and medically accurate information \n     prevents unintended pregnancies, thereby improving the health \n     of women, children, families, and society as a whole;\n       Whereas Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), was decided 42 \n     years ago and clarifies that women have a constitutional \n     right to plan their families and futures;\n       Whereas private reproductive health care decisions should \n     be decided by women and their health care providers;\n       Whereas the requirement under the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148) that all insurance \n     plans cover contraception without cost sharing has\n\n[[Page S427]]\n\n     saved women at least $483,000,000, and more than 30,000,000 \n     women are eligible for this benefit;\n       Whereas research suggests that increasing the rate of \n     contraceptive use may be associated with the decline in teen \n     pregnancy by 50 percent since 1990;\n       Whereas elected officials in many States and Congress have \n     attempted to block or curtail women's access to medical care \n     and information in order to fulfill a political agenda, and \n     they have often succeeded in such attempts;\n       Whereas there have been numerous attempts, both legal and \n     legislative, to allow insurance companies and employers to \n     deny women coverage for all contraceptive methods approved by \n     the Food and Drug Administration, even though the law \n     requires such coverage, and such methods are based on a \n     foundation of scientific evidence;\n       Whereas since the enactment of the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act, States have enacted hundreds of laws \n     restricting access to women's reproductive health care and 24 \n     States have enacted laws that reduce abortion coverage in \n     plans that are offered through the Exchanges established \n     under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; and\n       Whereas 24 States have laws or policies that interfere with \n     women's health care providers in a way that undermines, \n     instead of strengthens, patient safety: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate supports efforts to--\n       (1) ensure that all women have access to the best \n     available, scientifically-based health care and information;\n       (2) ensure that women can make their own private health \n     care decisions with access to comprehensive, unbiased \n     information and confidentiality;\n       (3) ensure that women and families, not their employers, \n     make their own decisions about their health care;\n       (4) prohibit employers or government entities from \n     interfering with or denying reproductive health care services \n     guaranteed by law, including access to contraception without \n     cost;\n       (5) promote preventive health care services and wellness \n     for women;\n       (6) guarantee the constitutionally protected right to safe, \n     legal abortion services;\n       (7) ensure that women have access to health care that \n     fosters safe childbearing, with resources available to reduce \n     maternal and infant morbidity and mortality;\n       (8) ensure that all women have access to comprehensive, \n     affordable insurance coverage that includes pregnancy-related \n     care, such as prenatal care, miscarriage management, family \n     planning services, abortions, labor and delivery services, \n     and postnatal care; and\n       (9) enact legislation that improves and expands women's \n     access to reproductive health care regardless of the State \n     within which they reside.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/22/senate-section/article/S427-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 38--RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF WENDELL H.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING RURAL AMERICA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The founders realized the fundamental importance of \n     property rights when they codified the Takings Clause of the \n     Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, \n     which requires that private property shall not be taken ``for \n     public use, without just compensation''.\n       (2) Rural lands are unique in that they are not \n     traditionally considered high tax revenue-generating \n     properties for State and local governments. In addition, \n     farmland and forest land owners need to have long-term \n     certainty regarding their property rights in order to make \n     the investment decisions to commit land to these uses.\n       (3) Ownership rights in rural land are fundamental building \n     blocks for our Nation's agriculture industry, which continues \n     to be one of the most important economic sectors of our \n     economy.\n       (4) In the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in Kelo v. \n     City of New London, abuse of eminent domain is a threat to \n     the property rights of all private property owners, including \n     rural land owners.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that:\n       (1) The use of eminent domain for the purpose of economic \n     development is a threat to agricultural and other property in \n     rural America and that Congress should protect the property \n     rights of the people of the United States, including those \n     who reside in rural areas.\n       (2) Property rights are central to liberty in this country \n     and to its economy.\n       (3) The use of eminent domain to take farmland and other \n     rural property for economic development threatens liberty, \n     rural economies, and the economy of the United States.\n\n[[Page S431]]\n\n       (4) The taking of farmland and rural property will have a \n     direct impact on existing irrigation and reclamation \n     projects.\n       (5) The use of eminent domain to take rural private \n     property for private commercial uses will force increasing \n     numbers of activities from private property onto this \n     Nation's public lands, including its National forests, \n     National parks, and wildlife refuges, which can overburden \n     the infrastructure of these lands, reducing the enjoyment of \n     such lands by the people of the United States.\n       (6) The people of the United States should not have to fear \n     the taking their homes, farms, or businesses by the \n     government to give to other persons.\n       (7) Governments should not abuse the power of eminent \n     domain to force rural property owners from their land in \n     order to develop rural land into industrial and commercial \n     property.\n       (8) Congress has a duty to protect the property rights of \n     rural Americans in the face of eminent domain abuse.\n\n     SEC. 212. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to encourage, \n     support, and promote the private ownership of property and to \n     ensure that the constitutional and other legal rights of \n     private property owners are protected by the Federal \n     Government.\n\n     SEC. 213. BROAD CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       This title shall be construed in favor of a broad \n     protection of private property rights, to the maximum extent \n     permitted by the terms of this title and the Constitution.\n\n     SEC. 214. LIMITATION ON STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       Nothing in this title may be construed to supersede, limit, \n     or otherwise affect any provision of the Uniform Relocation \n     Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 \n     (42 U.S.C. 4601 et seq.).\n\n     SEC. 215. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that any and all precautions \n     shall be taken by the Federal Government, States, and \n     political subdivisions of States to avoid the unfair or \n     unreasonable taking of property away from survivors of \n     Hurricane Katrina who own, were bequeathed, or assigned such \n     property, for economic development purposes or for the \n     private use of others.\n\n     SEC. 216. DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON MINORITIES.\n\n       If a court determines that a violation of this title has \n     occurred, and that the violation has a disproportionately \n     high impact on the poor or minorities, the Attorney General \n     shall use reasonable efforts to locate and inform former \n     owners and tenants of the violation and any remedies they may \n     have.\n\n     SEC. 217.
