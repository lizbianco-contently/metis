Mr. President, it was heartening to see so many \nDemocrats joining us yesterday in advancing a good Defense \nauthorization bill by a very large bipartisan margin. It now puts the \nSenate on the path to bring the bill to final passage tomorrow. Once \nthat happens, the Senate will have taken a significant step by doing \nright for the men and women who risk everything to protect us. It is \ncertainly good news, but it is not the end of the story either, because \nwhile the Defense authorization bill makes promises to our troops, it \nis the Defense appropriations bill that actually fulfills those \npromises.\n  That is the bill we will consider next. I would expect everyone who \nvotes for the Defense authorization bill would also want to support \nmoving to Defense appropriations because I am sure every Democratic \ncolleague who just voted to make promises to our troops will want to \nhelp us actually fulfill those promises by voting for the Defense \nappropriations bill as well.\n  They might look to the example Democrats just set in the House of \nRepresentatives last week. House Democrats appear to understand just \nhow cynical it would have been to make promises and then not fund them, \nwhich is why we saw dozens join Republicans to pass Defense \nappropriations. House Democrats must have known their constituents \nwouldn't fall for an ``I was for the troops before I was against them'' \nargument. House Democrats also must have seen how heartless it would \nhave been to deny funding for America's heroes as part of some \nridiculous filibuster summer plan to extract more cash for giant \nbureaucracies such as the IRS.\n  I have to think Senate Democrats would see things the same way. \nJudging by what we just saw last week in the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, there is no reason to think otherwise. Democrats and \nRepublicans came together in the Appropriations Committee to pass the \nDefense appropriations bill we are about to consider by a huge margin \nof 27 to 3. Not only did every single Democrat support this bill in \ncommittee, but Democrats had some pretty supportive things to say about \nit too.\n  One Democratic friend called the appropriations bill ``a key \ninvestment in our national security'' that funds ``a number of Hawaii's \ndefense needs.'' Another Democrat noted it would fund a program that is \none of her ``top priorities.'' Here is what another Democrat said of \nthe bill: ``It will directly protect and grow Connecticut's defense \nmanufacturing industry and the hundreds of thousands of jobs it \nsupports across our State.'' He went on to say it will ``implement a \nwell-deserved pay raise for our troops who put their lives on the line \neach and every day.'' He concluded by saying it is a ``victory for \nConnecticut.''\n  A victory for Connecticut--now there is a rousing endorsement of the \nbill we will vote on tomorrow. It is no wonder each of these Democratic \ncolleagues voted to endorse the appropriations bill. It is good news \nfor our troops and their families. It is good news for our country. \nThese Democratic friends must not want to see a ``victory for \nConnecticut'' squashed or one of their ``top priorities'' sacrificed \nfor the sake of some ploy to funnel a few more dollars to Washington's \nbig bureaucracies.\n  They must think this filibuster summer idea their party leaders \nhatched isn't good for America's national security or for job security \nin their own States. They must know you can't take credit for promises \nmade in a defense authorization bill if you then vote against the \nappropriations bill that would fund them.\n  I hope Senators in both parties would join together once more to \nbring the Defense authorization bill over the goal line tomorrow and \nthen begin debate on the inseparable appropriations bill too.\n  If Senators want to amend that appropriations bill or strike a rider, \nthen they should vote with us to get on the legislation so we can \nconsider these amendments or those motions to strike. If Senators want \nto try to increase or reduce the level of funding in\n\n[[Page S4214]]\n\nthat bill, the only way they will have a chance to try doing that is if \nthey vote with us to get on the bill in the first place.\n  So bring us your ideas. Bring them on out. Let's debate them. Whether \nyou have a proposal to boost the helicopter industry in Connecticut or \na plan to repair naval vessels, amphibious and surface ships in places \nsuch as California, Washington, Hawaii, and Virginia, the only way to \nensure ideas like these are considered is by voting to open debate on \nthe appropriations bill, and the only way to ensure they will not be \nheard at all--at all--is by voting to filibuster. That wouldn't be good \nfor anyone.\n  So let's not kill the opportunity to even have those debates because \nhere is what we know: The young men and women of our volunteer force \ndon't need a summer packed full of Democratic filibusters, and they \ncertainly don't need a Democratic shutdown surprise in the fall. All \nthey ask for are the weapons, the training, and the skills they need to \nprevail on the battlefield. We can give it to them. We are almost \nthere.\n  Democrats already joined Republicans to make a promise to the troops, \nand with just a little more good bipartisan work we will see Democrats \njoin with Republicans to fulfill those promises. I have to think they \nwill because failing to do so would mean making empty promises to both \nconstituents and our troops.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/17/senate-section/article/S4214-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my friend the Republican leader throws the \nword ``filibuster'' around. He has a right to do that because he is an \nexpert. He has led in this Senate more filibusters than all previous \nleaders put together. As the Republican leader, he has engineered about \n300 filibusters, stopping basically everything--certainly slowing down \neverything on the President's agenda. It was a plan he was a part of \nand he certainly lived up to that.\n  The 46 Democrats over here are just as patriotic as the 54 \nRepublicans over there. We care about the troops just as much as the \nRepublicans over there, but we also believe that when my friend the \nRepublican leader throws around terms such as ``vast bureaucracy,'' \nthat we want to fund a vast bureaucracy, I don't think we should start \ntalking about bureaucracies. The Pentagon is a pretty good bureaucracy \nin itself. I admire very much the Secretary of Defense. He does the \nbest job he can. Our Secretary of Defense does not agree with the \nRepublicans as to how the troops should be funded.\n  My friend the Republican leader knows the legislation before this \nbody is going to be vetoed by the President. He said so. He put it in \nwriting. The President said that on appropriations bills, if they are \nat the level of sequestration, he will veto those also. So this little \nmagic game I mentioned yesterday that the Republican leader has \nengineered, saying we are going to take care of defense, and with the \nvast bureaucracy, we don't care what happens to them--well, in this \n``vast bureaucracy'' are things such as the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, the Homeland Security Secretariat, which is important \nfor protecting our homeland, making sure airports are safe, making sure \nour borders are protected. That is the vast bureaucracy he is talking \nabout.\n  So we Democrats want to make sure there is equality. We believe in \nfunding defense, and we are going to do everything we can. There has \nbeen no better example of that than the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee dealing with defense, the senior Senator from Illinois. \nSenator Durbin has worked so hard to be fair--fair to Democrats and \nfair to Republicans--and I am confident he will continue to do that.\n  I am also confident he cares about the other agencies we are so \nconcerned about, not only the few I have mentioned. To have a secure \nnation takes more than bombs and bullets. Having a secure nation is \nalso making sure we have a good education system, a good transportation \nsystem, a good program to maintain research for health.\n  The most famous organization in the history of the world for \ninvestigating disease is the National Institutes of Health. We know \nwhat sequestration did to them once, and they are about to do it again, \nif this little magic game the Republican leader is engineering goes on. \nIt will be cut like everybody else. It is not defense.\n  The one fact Senator McConnell fails to mention is the fact that it \nis all borrowed money--$100 billion, approximately--to get what he \nwants done in the Defense bill. It is borrowed money in the so-called \noverseas contingency fund.\n  We are going to do what we think is appropriate for the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/17/senate-section/article/S4214-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4214-S4215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INTERSTATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this month we will celebrate the 50th \nanniversary of the creation of the Eisenhower Interstate Highway \nSystem. The Interstate Highway System was one of the signature \naccomplishments of the entire 20th century. If there was ever a list of \nthe seven wonders of the United States, our Nation's highway system \nwould be on that list.\n  Consider the sheer size and complexity of our transportation system. \nThe Interstate Highway System encompasses 50,000 miles of highways, \nbridges, and tunnels, and that doesn't count the railways. It connects \nEast and West, North and South. A person can drive from Boston directly \nto Seattle, 3,020 miles, or from Laredo, TX, to Duluth, MN, 1,831 \nmiles, all on the Interstate Highway System. The Federal Interstate \nHighway System serves all 50 States and the District of Columbia.\n  The Interstate Highway System is a central nervous system of our \nNation's economy, creating vital corridors for goods and services for \nAmerican commerce. In every community in our Nation, from our largest \ncities and our large metropolitan areas to the small rural communities \nthat have just a few people--and I mean a few people--our interstate \nhighways bear the name of Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower, \nwhose vision of a connected America resulted in the Federal Highway Act \nof 1956.\n\n  How did this good man, Dwight Eisenhower, come up with this idea? \nWell, he was ordered, as a young officer in the Army, to bring a \nmilitary contingent across the United States during World War I. It was \nawful. He never forgot that. There was no Federal highway system. There \nwere barely highways. There were barely roads.\n  With his experience as Allied commander of troops in World War II, he \ncame back from that recognizing how important moving goods and services \nfor the military around Europe was, and how he had tried that in the \nUnited States and it did not work. But he was going to change that. \nThat is what he did. President Eisenhower, a Republican, understood \nthat the interstate highway complex was an investment worth making. He \nrealized the money spent on roads and bridges creates jobs--lots of \njobs. President Eisenhower, with all of his military experience and \nbackground, understood that an interstate system was important to our \nnational security.\n  My friend talks about the security of our troops. Of course they are \nimportant. We so admire these men and women who protect us. But to have \na safe and secure Nation, we also have to have things such as a good \nhighway system.\n  My friend the Republican leader fails to mention that. It is part of \nour national security needs, as evidenced by Dwight Eisenhower. I \nwonder what President Eisenhower would think of today's Republican \nParty and its lack of concern for the Interstate Highway System. I \nbelieve he would be greatly disappointed. Just a few weeks from now, as \nthe month of July comes to a close, funding for the Federal highway \nprogram will be gone. It will expire. But you would not know that \ncongressional Republicans are watching the same movie the American \npeople are watching. Republicans in Congress have refused to work with \nus in making an adequate, long-term investment in our country's surface \ntransportation system.\n  Instead, the Republicans see the Federal highway program and trust \nfund as some sort of a hot potato. Stay away from it. It should never \nbe dealt with\n\n[[Page S4215]]\n\nand only be kicked down the road, leaving millions of jobs behind. Even \nwith the looming deadline, Republicans are showing no haste in forming \na plan to address our Nation's crumbling roads, railroads, bridges, and \ntransit systems.\n  We have one of the most unique makeups in one of our committees that \nthis body has ever seen. We have one of the most liberal Members of the \nSenate, Barbara Boxer, and her counterpart is one of the most \nconservative Members of this body, Jim Inhofe from Oklahoma. They know \nthe importance. These two divergent political spectrums know that we \nhave to do something about the highway system. They are going to put \nout a bill. They are going to authorize it. Then we need to figure out \na way to fund that.\n  Republicans don't seem interested in that. Even with its looming \ndeadline, Republicans are showing no haste in forming a plan or to \ndevelop one for this system that we have to do something about. \nCongressional Republicans see no urgency to schedule hearings, to mark \nup a bill, to take testimony in other ways or to make the highway trust \nfund solvent. With every day that passes, our Federal highway trust \nfund inches closer and closer to insolvency.\n  It is clear we will need to get to that reauthorization of the \nhighway program either this week or next week. But we won't. Look at \nthe schedule. It means we are left with July. Looking at the Senate \ncalendar for July, assuming that the Republican leader will continue to \nkeep the Senate out of session on Fridays, we will have, in reality, 15 \ndays to reauthorize the Federal highway system--15 days. Fifteen \nsession days is precious little time, especially when Republicans don't \nfeel any urgency to solve this problem. Of course, we all know how this \nis going to play out. This is straight out of the Republican's \nplaybook--the manufactured crisis playbook.\n  They have written the book, and they are adding chapters to it every \nweek of this Congress. Republicans will drag their feet until the very \nlast minute, refusing to work with us on a long-term solution to our \nNation's infrastructure woes. Then, when the deadline is imminent, the \nRepublican leader will offer yet another short-term extension to stave \noff another disaster of his own making.\n  This is and should be unacceptable to everyone here. We already have \nhad 33 Republican short-term fixes. We do not need a 34th. But that is \nwhere we are headed. That is too bad. What we do need is a Republican \nParty that sees the value of a robust, long-term investment in our \nNation's highways. We need a Republican Party that sees what President \nEisenhower saw 50 years ago--half a century--that investing in our \ninfrastructure is a shot in the arm to our economy.\n  There are hundreds of thousands of shovel-ready jobs just waiting for \nCongress to act. On the other hand, failing to meet our country's \ninfrastructure needs will be catastrophic. The American Society of \nCivil Engineers predicts that our economy would lose $1 trillion unless \nwe invest in surface transportation--$1 trillion. Let's not forget the \nsafety implications of sitting on our hands. Half of our roads are in \npoor condition. Tens of thousands of bridges across the country are \nstructurally deficient. Railroads are without important, lifesaving \nbraking systems. They need to be refurbished and some parts of them \nreinvented. Doing nothing is not and should not be an option.\n  The Republican leader should change course and abandon his policy of \ngoverning by crisis. We can get started on a long-term, bipartisan \nreauthorization of the Federal highway program today. All we need is \nfor Republican Members of Congress and their leaders to focus on \nAmerican jobs and the traveling American public's safety. They have not \ndone that. This is too bad.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of Senators on the floor.\n  Will the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/17/senate-section/article/S4215-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am truly blessed to represent the people \nof Michigan in the Senate. My State was carved out in one era by the \nice age and again 200 years ago by the Congress. It is comprised of \nmore than just two beautiful peninsulas bordered by four Great Lakes.\n  Since our Nation's founding, Michigan has been at the frontier of \nAmerica, helping to build a stronger and more secure country. The \nNorthwest Ordinance, affirmed by the very first Congress, created the \nmidwestern region from which the Michigan Territory would be born. In \nthe 19th century, pioneers moved to what was then the western frontier \nto settle in Michigan and its neighboring States.\n  The Peters family was among them. My family made the long journey \nfrom New York and settled in Rochester, MI, in the early 1840s. They \nwere among the earliest pioneers to settle in my State. From that time \non, generations of Michiganders pioneered a State devoted to great \npublic education. While the Northwest Ordinance made primary education \na priority and stated that ``schools and the means of education shall \nforever be encouraged'' in the new territory, higher education also had \na place that made our State great very early. Twenty years before the \nfounding of the State of Michigan, the University of Michigan was \nfounded, one of the first public universities in the country. Later, \nMichigan State University would become one of the pioneer land grant \nuniversities. While the two schools may be rivals on the gridiron, they \nhave long complimented each other to the benefit of our State.\n  Today, Michigan is home to 93 universities, colleges, and community \ncolleges. Michigan grew rapidly as migrants from across the country and \nimmigrants from around the world were drawn to our supplies of timber, \nore, arable land, and abundant fresh water. As a new century dawned \nacross America, Michigan continued to grow with the advent of \nindustrialization and mass manufacturing, from mining and forestry at \nthe western tip of the Upper Peninsula to the booming auto factories of \nDetroit. Michigan embodied the growing optimism, opportunity, and \nprosperity that would be America's crowning achievement in the 20th \ncentury.\n  Michigan factories would turn into the great arsenal of democracy, \nbuilding the armadas that would defeat tyranny, win the Second World \nWar, and, in the process, create America's middle class. During World \nWar II, my father, Herb Peters, was a proud solder in Eisenhower's \nArmy, helping free France from Nazi occupation. It was there that he \nwould meet my mother, Madeleine Vignier, a beautiful young French \nwoman. They were married and raised me and my two sisters, Gigi and \nJackie, in a typical middle-class home. A few years ago, with my late \nfather, I joined the Sons of the American Revolution. My forefather, \nWilliam Garrett, was a member of the Virginia militia and served \nalongside General George Washington at Valley Forge.\n  My great-grandfather, Julian Peters, served with the Michigan \ninfantry during the Civil War. I am proud to follow earlier generations \nof patriots who served their country and were prepared to make the \nultimate sacrifice in defense of freedom and liberty. But like millions \nof Americans, I am also the son of an immigrant. America's shores were \nnew to my mother, but they provided an incredible expanse of \nopportunity that people across the globe continue to dream of. My \nmother worked long hours as a nurse's aide and fought for a better \nworkplace for herself and her coworkers, helping to organize her \nworkplace and later serving as a union steward.\n  Michigan's strong labor movement and our manufacturing sector helped \nbuild economic opportunities for millions of Americans. Standing \ntogether to call for fair wages, safer workplaces,\n\n[[Page S4216]]\n\nand better hours, Michigan workers and their families helped build the \nmiddle class and make the American dream a reality for many. I am \nhonored to embody such a uniquely American experience--the descendant \nof an American Revolutionary War soldier and the son of a foreign-born \nnaturalized citizen--and to carry on these rich traditions that \ncontinue to make our Nation proud, diverse, and strong.\n  But while my story is uniquely American, it is not so different from \nnearly 10 million Michiganders of varied backgrounds who have come \ntogether to make our State an extraordinary, special place. Michigan is \nunique in that we are the only State made up of two peninsulas. \nSeparated for thousands of years by waterways carved by retreating \nglaciers, our peninsulas permanently united with Michigan statehood and \nfinally connected with the opening of the Mackinac Bridge almost 60 \nyears ago.\n  The Mackinac Bridge is one of the longest suspension bridges in the \nworld. It remains an engineering marvel to this day and a symbol of how \nMichiganders can come together to accomplish great things. Financed \nwith an innovative public-private bond structure, over 10,000 workers \ncontributed to this 5-mile span, implementing the vision and planning \nof 350 engineers. In our State, it is simply known as ``The Bridge.'' \nIts construction unleashed economic growth for our State, increasing \ntourism in the Upper Peninsula and providing a new avenue for goods to \nbe hauled south while agricultural products and manufactured goods \nflowed north.\n  As Michigan and our Nation transition to a 21st-century economy, we \nwould do well to draw on the engineering know-how, skilled workforce, \nand boldness to invest in transformative infrastructure that made the \nMackinac Bridge possible. Michigan's products move and feed the Nation. \nWe invented the modern automobile, advanced manufacturing, and \nAmerica's middle class.\n  We are the second most agriculturally diverse State in the Nation. \nOur blueberries, apples, cherries, and sugar beets are just a few of \nthe 300 crops we grow and ship across the country and the world. Our \nincredible farmers, growers, and producers use Michigan's unique \nclimate and resources to feed people across our country and around the \nworld.\n  Whether we are talking about our State, our Nation or our successful \nindustries, we cannot rest on our laurels. We are in constant \ncompetition. The coming decades will see rapid growth abroad, but I \nknow our Nation will continue to lead the world with our ability to \ninnovate and efficiently align capital and talent to maximize the \nstrengths of our workforce.\n  Today's small business in Grand Rapids or a start-up in Detroit can \naccess consumers across the world. I know that Michigan will be at the \ncutting edge of this new global economy. Michigan is at the forefront \nof developing the transformative technologies that will remake America \nand help our country sustain its stature and prominence.\n  Southeast Michigan has more engineers per capita than any State in \nthe country, which is one of the reasons Detroit is home to the first \nfield patent office outside of Washington, DC. Our automakers, parts \nsuppliers, and advanced manufacturers are constantly innovating--and \nnot just generations of new goods but also intellectual property. If \nyou can make it, we can find a way to make it faster, lighter, more \nefficient, safer, and more affordable.\n  Incremental innovation meaningfully improves lives, but as a nation \nwe must keep working toward the next big thing. Investments in \neducation and basic scientific research are the downpayment on our \nfuture. It is particularly critical that we continue these investments \nat a time when our country faces so many unique challenges.\n  Growing income inequality is a threat to our middle class, our \neconomy, and our democracy. While globalization is opening new markets \nfor American goods, it is also hollowing out the mid-level jobs that \nare the foundation of the American middle class. Without a strong \nmiddle class we cannot have a strong economy, and without a strong \nmiddle class we simply cannot have a strong democracy.\n  There are many ideas about how to deal with these challenges, but \nhistory has taught us that increased productivity is the No. 1 driver \nof economic progress and, in my view, the key to American greatness. \nEconomic historians tell us that after hundreds of years of zero \neconomic growth, groundbreaking innovations changed the face of \ncommerce.\n  In the mid-1700s came the cotton gin, steam engine, and railroads, \nfollowed by more breakthroughs in the 1800s, electricity, the internal \ncombustion engine, and even indoor plumbing. Before indoor plumbing, a \nrecent study estimated the average housewife spent nearly 150 hours per \nyear walking back and forth to gather 3.5 tons of water for her family \nto cook, clean, and drink. The technology of indoor plumbing alone \nunleashed enormous gains in productivity.\n  Today, we have tablets and smartphones and social media, but if we \nare going to solve the tough challenges facing the middle-class \nfamilies and all those who aspire to be in the middle class, we will \nneed to unleash even more productivity and more innovation. We will \nneed to discover the next big thing, and I don't know what that next \nbig thing will be, but I do know the Federal Government must continue \ninvesting in the seed corn of basic research and development.\n  From the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams at Michigan State to Wayne \nState's bioresearch facility, to the University of Michigan's extensive \njoint projects with NASA, our State's universities are leading the way \nin research.\n  The research being conducted at our universities is also creating \njobs in Michigan as these transformative technologies are \ncommercialized. Students are not just inventing new technologies, they \nare also inventing their own jobs and companies.\n  For example, using technology developed at the University of Michigan \nfor NASA to measure electric fields resulting from dust storms blowing \nacross Mars, a startup spun off of these efforts is now creating jobs \non Earth to help an electric company monitor their utility lines.\n  Innovation is creating new industries in Michigan and is also \nrevolutionizing many of our existing industries. Advanced sensors, \nrobotics, and big data will allow precision agriculture that boosts \nproductivity and conserves natural resources.\n  One industry that has always meant jobs for Michigan is, of course, \nthe automobile industry. We are on the verge of an automotive \ntechnological revolution that will allow vehicles to communicate their \nlocation, speed, and other data electronically with each other and our \ntransportation infrastructure as well.\n  Research by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \nestimates this technology can reduce accidents by 80 percent, save \nfuel, and cut congestion at a time when Americans spend an estimated 5 \nvacation days a year stuck in traffic jams.\n  When more than 30,000 Americans are killed in accidents on our roads \nand highways every year, the advancements of this kind of technology \nwill literally save thousands of lives.\n  This means active crash-avoidance technology that stops accidents \nbefore they happen, and before long, autonomous vehicles that drive \nthemselves. This is truly revolutionary technology packaged with \nhorsepower and torque, my favorite part of the car.\n  But the Federal Government has to do its part to develop and protect \nthis technology. One of my top priorities, as a new member of the \nSenate commerce committee, is to ensure that vehicles have the wireless \nspectrum they need to communicate with each other and to make our roads \nsafer.\n  As manufacturing and technology merge, Michigan is prepared to lead \nthe way. What were once separate industries are now merging into \ncomplements in a battle for the future that America must win.\n  Federal investment in research and development is just that, an \ninvestment that has paid off many times over. Investment in research \nsupports the new technologies and industries of the future, drives job \ncreation, and provides technologies critical to our national security.\n  Necessary Federal investment in infrastructure and innovation is only \npossible if those of us in Congress take\n\n[[Page S4217]]\n\nour job seriously as stewards of taxpayer dollars and look for places \nto avoid unnecessary wasteful spending.\n  We also will not be able to accomplish anything without embracing \npragmatism and bipartisanship. We cannot focus on whether ideas come \nfrom a Republican or from a Democrat. We need to focus only on whether \nthe idea has merit and is good for the country. This is why I have \nspent my first 5 months in office the way I intend to spend the rest of \nmy career in public service, reaching across the aisle to find common \nground and the practical solutions that will make our government work \nbetter, drive innovation and competitiveness, and keep Michigan and \nAmerica safe and strong.\n  I have introduced legislation with Senator Gardner from Colorado to \nincrease oversight of duplicative spending and force Congress to act on \ndeficit reduction.\n  I worked with Senator Ernst from Iowa to introduce legislation to \nextend a tax credit for small businesses that support their activated \nmilitary reservist employees.\n  Senator Lankford of Oklahoma and I worked on a bill that would ensure \nFederal agencies use remanufactured auto parts when maintaining their \nfleets, an idea that will save natural resources and taxpayer dollars \nwhile supporting our country's remanufactured parts industry. Just 2 \ndays ago, this bill unanimously passed the Senate.\n  I worked with Senator Risch from Idaho to move legislation through \nthe small business committee to extend and preserve the Small Business \nAdministration's 7(a) Loan Program, so our Nation's small businesses \ncan access the capital they need to grow and create jobs.\n  Senator Cornyn, Senator Graham, and I introduced legislation to \ncreate a bipartisan commission to examine our Nation's judicial system \nfrom the top to the bottom and to make sure it is working for all \nAmericans.\n  Senator Sullivan and I worked together to introduce a bill to cut \nexcise taxes for small craft distillers, a growth industry in Michigan, \nAlaska, and America.\n  I am also proud to say the legislation I introduced with Senator \nCassidy of Louisiana to provide training for medical professionals to \nidentify victims of human trafficking was also signed into law after it \npassed the Senate as part of a larger effort to combat human \ntrafficking.\n  I was sent to the Senate to represent the people of Michigan, and \nthey want Congress to work together in a bipartisan way to solve the \nchallenges facing our country. We must focus more on what we have in \ncommon and less on our differences. We should work on ideas that are \ngood for our country and good for our States. I have worked to be a \npractical problem solver in my first few months, and it is what I \nintend to do in the years ahead.\n  There is much to be done, and I will work tirelessly for the people \nof Michigan. My weeks in Washington, unfortunately, keep me apart from \nmy wife Colleen and my children, Madeleine, Alana, and Gary, Jr., but \ntheir love and steadfast support is with me each and every day. Colleen \nwas raised by her parents Raul and Kathy Ochoa in Oakland County--like \nme--and together we share a passion for public service. I am so pleased \nColleen and Madeleine are here with me today in the Senate Gallery.\n  On the Senate floor, we are standing on the shoulders of giants. This \nincludes our Nation's Founding Fathers and more recent predecessors. My \nstaff and I recently moved into the Hart Senate Office Building, named \nafter Senator Phil Hart from Michigan, a man rightfully known as the \n``Conscience of the Senate'' and a role model for all of us.\n  I could not be happier that my office will be right around the corner \nfrom my close friend, mentor, colleague, and respected leader in the \nSenate Senator Debbie Stabenow, and I am honored that Debbie has joined \nme on the Senate floor for this speech.\n  Of course, I am deeply honored to succeed Senator Carl Levin, another \none of my mentors and a man who defined what it means to be a public \nservant. The careers of Senators Levin, Hart, Riegle, Griffin, and \nother Michiganders who preceded me provided the foundation on which I \nhope to build our shared future and create the best Michigan possible--\nnot only the kind of Michigan we want to live in but the kind of \nMichigan our children and grandchildren will want to spend their lives \nin, a Michigan that is a magnet for migration and unbridled opportunity \nfor families and small businesses, and a State that will lead the world \nin innovation.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and \nMichiganders across the State to make a better future for all of us a \nreality. Together, we will continue to build a State and a country that \nembody the opportunity, the possibility, and the promise that has made \nour country a shining beacon for so many around the globe.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton).

It was delivered so well, and that is what Michigan is \nall about. We appreciate it very, very much.\n  He has big shoes to fill, those of Carl Levin. We all know what a \ngiant he was in the Senate. From Senator Levin to Senator Stabenow, \nthey have both said: Gary Peters can do it. I am impressed with him \nvery much. He is a team player. He is willing to do the hard lifting. I \nappreciate that very much. He mentioned Senator Levin, of course, whom \nwe all admired so very much. Also, I wish to take a minute to talk \nabout his partner in the Senate today, Debbie Stabenow. As he \nmentioned, she is a part of Senate leadership. She is there because she \ndeserves it. There is no one who works harder than Debbie Stabenow. And \nif there were a work ethic role model for my friend Gary Peters to \nfollow, Debbie Stabenow is the perfect person.\n  So I thank the junior Senator from Michigan for being who he is. We \nhave come to know who he is in 6 months, and we like him very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, I am very deeply appreciative of \nour leader's comments. Thank you very much.\n  I just wish to add my words of pride in the fact that we have such a \nwonderful Senator now coming to the Senate and the fact that he is \nfighting so hard for Michigan and already doing a wonderful job.\n  I am so pleased he is my partner, and it was a wonderful speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I congratulate the junior Senator from \nMichigan for his opening speech in the Senate. My State of Illinois is \nseparated from his State of Michigan by another State and a Great Lake, \nbut we have many things in common.\n  People of Chicago and Illinois, many of them, spend a lot of money in \nthe State of Michigan and particularly in western Michigan. We love the \nSenator's State. It is a beautiful State. Many of us vacation there and \nget to know the people.\n  We have so much in common as midwesterners, looking at the world from \nour vantage point, smack dab in the middle of this country, and \nbringing to the conversation in the Senate many of the values that have \nguided our lives and inspired our families. I listened carefully and \nthought it is amazing that we have such parallel backgrounds--a father \nwho can trace his family roots back to the Revolutionary War and, in \nboth cases, mothers who were immigrants to this country. So being a \nfirst-generation American, I am sure the Senator feels as I do, a \nspecial honor, standing on the floor of the Senate, representing a \nState as great as Michigan--or Illinois.\n  I wish to say my colleague's background in the House of \nRepresentatives prepared him well for this challenge. Although he \nfollows one of the greats in the history of the Senate, Carl Levin, he \nbrings to this job an extraordinary talent and a great partnership with \nSenator Stabenow. Already, the two of them have been in contact with me \nabout Michigan's needs as they relate to our Department of Defense--and\n\n[[Page S4218]]\n\nit is a significant investment which Michigan has made over the years \nin keeping America strong, one we want to continue for many generations \nto come.\n  I am pleased Senator Peter's family was here to be part of this \nofficial opening of his service in the Senate, and I certainly look \nforward to working with him for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/17/senate-section/article/S4218-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SEQUESTRATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this morning the majority leader and the \nRepublican leader Senator McConnell came to the floor to speak to us \nabout the challenge we are going to face, as soon as this week, when it \ncomes to the Department of Defense. This is a department I have paid \nspecial attention to over the last several years during the time I \nchaired the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and now serve as \nranking member or vice chairman of that same subcommittee.\n  First, I salute the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and \nDefense Subcommittee, Thad Cochran of Mississippi. It has been a joy to \nwork with him. He is a professional. He is a kind and gentle man and \nfair in every respect. I told him on the floor yesterday what I have \nsaid publicly in my caucus luncheon, the Democratic caucus luncheon. I \nam fortunate to have a partner in this effort from the Republican side \nwho is so good to work with.\n  But we face a real serious challenge this week, and we have to decide \nas a nation what we are going to do about it. Most people, if you ask \nthem on a final exam what does sequestration mean, they would basically \nthrow up their hands and say: It sounds like something out of \nWashington. It doesn't mean much to me.\n  Sequestration is the penalty we face if we don't hit certain budget \nspending numbers, and that penalty is virtually mindless. Here is what \nit says: We will make across-the-board cuts in spending. Think about \nthat in your own family life. If you were looking at the budget for \nyour family and had some misfortune--a paycheck didn't come in--you \nwould have to gauge priorities. While sitting at the kitchen table, you \nmight say: What do we have to pay this month? Well, we have to pay the \nmortgage or we will be foreclosed upon. We better pay the light bill or \nthey will turn off the electricity. So what can we cut back on? We are \ngoing to spend less at the grocery store.\n  Families make those decisions--many of them--on a weekly or monthly \nbasis. But sequestration says we will cut across the board. We will \ntake a 5-percent cut off the mortgage, off the utility bill, and off \nthe groceries. It doesn't make sense, does it? But we did it. We did it \nfor 2 years, and it was devastating.\n  We cut across the board when it came to medical research, for \ngoodness' sakes. Here we were trying to find cures for cancer and heart \ndisease and diabetes and Alzheimer's, and we said we are going to make \na 5-percent cut across the board. It made no sense whatsoever, nor did \nit make sense for the Department of Defense. They said: How in the \nworld can we prepare for America's defense with across-the-board cuts? \nWe are supposed to be recruiting and training the very best men and \nwomen to serve our Nation. They need to be ready for combat. We have to \nmake them battle-ready so they will win any battle they are sent to and \ncome home safe. We have to decide what equipment to purchase. We have \nto decide how to invest in long-term investments in technology and \nequipment so that we never come in second in any battle. Yet you are \ngoing to give us an across-the-board cut, Congress? Stop it. Stop \nsequestration.\n  That is what this debate is about.\n  What we have now is a proposal from the Republican side of the aisle \nto stop sequestration--across-the-board cuts--in only one Agency: the \nDepartment of Defense. I think that is a good thing, to stop it, but it \ncertainly isn't a balanced approach.\n  We have a lot of other things we do as a government that are \nimportant to the people of this country. We finance the education of \nyoung people who want to go to college. We do it with Pell grants and \nwe do it with government loans. If we make across-the-board cuts there, \nwe will create hardships and lack of opportunity for a lot of young \npeople in America. When it comes to education, sequestration makes no \nsense.\n  When it comes to health care, it certainly makes no sense. We have \nobligations that we have entered into when it comes to our veterans and \ntheir health care. Are we going to make across-the-board cuts when it \ncomes to veterans' health care? God forbid. We promised those men and \nwomen that if they would serve our country, we would stand by them when \nthey came home.\n  Sequestration is a mindless cut when it comes to education and health \ncare and medical research, as I mentioned earlier. So Democrats are \nsaying to Republicans: Here we are on June 17, and our fiscal year ends \non October 1. Let's not wait until the last minute to sit down and work \nout this problem. But what we hear from the other side of the aisle is \nthis: We are not going to do it. We are just going to ignore it.\n  That is the problem in Washington when you don't face challenges \nsquarely, honestly, on a bipartisan basis.\n  So here is what is likely to occur this week. We are going to vote \nfor an authorization bill on the Department of Defense. Some of us will \noppose the way it is being funded, but others will vote for it. Then we \nwill come to the Defense appropriations bill, and I think what you will \nfind is a unified effort on the Democratic side to say to the \nRepublicans: Now is the time to sit down, not just on this \nappropriations bill but all the appropriations bills. Let's come up \nwith an answer and solution to sequestration.\n  I heard the Republican leader say: Well, this is an indication that \nthe Democrats are not committed to the defense of America. I couldn't \ndisagree more because, you see, when we look at those who agree with us \non the need for a different approach to budgeting, they include our \nSecretary of Defense, Ash Carter, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff, General Dempsey. These are the men who have been assigned the \nresponsibility of leading this great military and keeping America safe, \nand they say this budget process which the Republican leader endorses \nis not a good one for the safety of America.\n  So let's do the right thing for the men and women in uniform, for our \ncountry, and for all the agencies of government. Let's sit down and \nsolve this budget challenge now before it reaches the last minute in a \ncrisis. Let's do it in June rather than in September, October, \nNovember, or December. Let's do it calmly, on a bipartisan basis, and \nengage the President as well as our colleagues from both sides of the \naisle in Congress. That is the responsible, bipartisan, honest way to \nface the problem. I hope the Republican leader will join us in that \neffort.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I just want to commend our leader from \nIllinois for bringing up what is so critically important, which is the \nentire budget of the country. It is important that we get it right in \nsupporting the authorization in front of us.\n  I understand the defense of our country is much more than just the \nDepartment of Defense. As a border State in Michigan, border security, \nwhich is not in the Defense appropriations bill, is incredibly \nimportant, as is cyber security, which we are hearing more and more \nabout; the frontline of our men and women, the first responders, police \nofficers, firefighters--who do we think actually answers the call in a \ncommunity when there is some kind of local challenge or a terrorist \nattack; airport security--I could go on and on. These are all things \nthat are not in the appropriations bill for the Department of Defense.\n  Unfortunately, without a bipartisan agreement to continue what was a \nvery positive 2-year agreement put together that has been called the \nRyan-Murray agreement to be able to balance out all the security needs \nas well as the economic security needs of our country--without that, it \nis a mistake to begin the appropriations process one bill at a time.\n  So from my perspective, on behalf of the people of Michigan, whatever \nappropriations bill comes up next, no matter what it is, we should not \nbegin that process until we have a bipartisan agreement, as we had for \nthe last 2\n\n[[Page S4219]]\n\nyears, so that no part of our national security is hurt or the economic \nsecurity for the future of our country. Until we do that--and we can do \nthat; we have done it before--we should not begin the appropriations \nprocess on a piecemeal basis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week, President Obama spoke at a \nmeeting of the Catholic Health Association, and he told the association \nthat his health care law, as he said, ``worked out better than some of \nus anticipated.''\n  Well, I can tell you that the President's health care law has worked \nout much worse--much worse--than the American people expected. It has \nworked out much worse than the President promised it was going to work. \nHard-working families all across the country are suffering under the \nPresident's complicated, confusing, and costly health care law.\n  The new Senator from Michigan just gave his maiden speech this \nmorning, and I welcome him to the Senate. The senior Senator from \nMichigan just spoke on the floor. Last week, she also spoke on the \nfloor and talked about the millions of Americans who need subsidies to \nhelp cover the cost of these outrageously expensive ObamaCare mandates. \nWell, ObamaCare hurts many of the people in her home State of Michigan.\n  This insurance is going to get a lot more expensive for the people of \nMichigan next year. The Obama administration released new numbers \nrecently showing how much more people are going to have to pay for \ntheir ObamaCare plans next year. There is one company in Michigan that \nhas requested a rate increase of 38 percent. There are more than 20,000 \npeople in Michigan who get their ObamaCare insurance from this company \ntoday. These people are looking at the prospect of their insurance \ncosting 38 percent more next year. Other families in Michigan are \nfacing rate hikes of 11 percent or 17 percent or 37 percent, depending \non the specific plan they are in.\n  And it is not just happening in Michigan. In Washington State, one \ncompany says its premiums next year will be 19 percent higher. There \nare more than 7,000 people in Washington State who get their insurance \nfrom that company. Another company says it is raising its rates 9.6 \npercent. People in Washington are facing much higher insurance \npremiums, and they will still have the narrow networks that so many \nAmericans have to deal with because of ObamaCare. When I say ``narrow \nnetwork,'' I mean fewer choices of hospitals, fewer choices of doctors \nto take care of them--limited choices, plus paying more.\n  So how big of a problem is it? Well, the Wall Street Journal had an \narticle about these people the other day. On Friday, June 12, the \nheadline was ``Surprises in Health-Law Bills.'' The article says: \n``Out-of-network charges often aren't flagged before treatment.'' They \ncall it medical bill shock.\n  This is under the President's health care law--medical bill shock; \nsurprises in health-law bills. The article tells the story of Angela \nGiboney from Mill Creek, WA--Washington State. She has insurance \nthrough the State ObamaCare exchange. She has ObamaCare, make no \nmistake about it. When she went to have a mammogram, it turned out the \nplace that did the screening was outside her network, so she got a bill \nfor $932. President Obama promised that people would pay less under the \nhealth care law. Instead, people all across the country are getting \nstuck with surprise bills because of these narrow networks. And in \nspite of that, their premiums are going to jump again next year.\n  Some Democrats say that people shouldn't worry about these dramatic \npremium increases because the average increase--this is what the \nDemocrats say--in some places won't be that high. Well, there is a new \nstudy that looked at the rate requests in eight different States for \nnext year. It says that in those eight States, premiums for the silver \nplan in the ObamaCare exchange will only go up by, on average, 6 \npercent. The study says that in Connecticut, the average silver plan is \nonly going to raise premiums 4 percent. It says if you shop around--if \nyou shop around--you might be able to find a new plan next year that \nwill go up by less than your current plan is going up.\n  So they are saying that across the board they are going up. The \nquestion is, How much are they going up? And if you shop around, you \nmight be able to find a place they are not going up quite as much as \nthey are with your current plan.\n  Is that what President Obama promised the American people? Did he \npromise the American people the rates would only go up 6 percent? No, \nthat is not what he promised. He said rates would go down by $2,500 per \nfamily, per year.\n  Did President Obama say your rates will go up a little less if you \nare willing to change plans every year? No. He said if you like your \ninsurance, you can keep your insurance. That is what the President \nsaid.\n  Did the President promise that maybe your rates won't go up by quite \nas much if you are willing to accept a narrow network of providers? Did \nhe say you should change your doctor every year by switching from plan \nto plan? No, of course not. He said if you like your doctor, you can \nkeep your doctor.\n  I want to make another point about this new study. It is only talking \nabout the average increases across all the plans offered in eight \nStates. Even if the average premium is only going up 6 percent in those \neight States, a lot of people are going to end up paying much more.\n  There are families in Connecticut who may have to pay 16 percent more \nnext year. That is how much more one company in Connecticut wants to \ncharge almost 26,000 people who buy the ObamaCare plans today. Does the \nPresident think these families are happy that the average increase is \nonly 4 percent when they get an increase of 16 percent? Is that what \nthe President means when he says his health care law is working better \nthan he anticipated--and he said it just last week--because there are a \nlot of people in Connecticut who say it is not working and it is \nworking much worse than they anticipated.\n  People have been writing to the State insurance department in \nConnecticut, and they are angry. They are angry with the President and \nalarmed at the ObamaCare price hikes. One person wrote that their \ninsurance company is requesting a rate increase of 14.3 percent in \nConnecticut. For Democrats who say the average may be only 4 percent, \nsome people will be paying over 14 percent more next year. The person \nasks: Does the average worker get a 14-percent salary increase? That is \nnot what the people of Michigan, Washington, Connecticut or anywhere \nelse thought they were going to get when Democrats called the law the \nAffordable Care Act.\n\n  Sometime in the next couple of weeks the Supreme Court is going to \ndecide whether it is legal for President Obama to spend some of the \nbillions of taxpayer dollars that he has been spending on the health \ncare law. Now, the decision could affect more than 6 million Americans. \nRepublicans have been watching this case very closely. We have been \nworking on ideas to protect these people and to protect all Americans \nfrom the damages caused by the President's health care law.\n  If the Court rules against the President, then Republicans will be \nready to sit down with Democrats to improve health care in America. We \nwill take the opportunity to protect the people from ObamaCare's broken \npromises and to provide freedom to the people who are trapped in \nWashington-mandated health care. It will be up to the President and \nDemocrats in Congress whether they want to join us or if they want to \ncontinue to insist that this law is working better than they \nanticipated. I hope they will work with us--work with us--on reforms \nthat the American people need, want, and deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/17/senate-section/article/S4219-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4219-S4220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Wyoming, a physician himself, not just for \nhis good remarks today but for his litany of good\n\n[[Page S4220]]\n\nremarks throughout the debate on the Affordable Care Act.\n  For 6 years he has been an outspoken voice for what is right for the \nAmerican people and what the American people want, which is affordable, \nquality health care. I appreciate his contribution, not just to the \ndebate today but to the debate we have had in the past and the one we \nare about to have in the future. He is right that we must come \ntogether--Republicans and Democrats alike--and make sure that the \nbroken promises of the Affordable Care Act are fixed; that affordable, \naccessible, quality health care is available to the American people; \nthat it is deliverable by private industry and by private and \ncompetitive free enterprise system; and that government mandates that \nforce prices up and quality down go away. So I thank the Senator for \nhis contribution and all the great work he does.\n  He is not quite as old as I am, but he might like the movie I like, \n``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.'' There is a great line in \n``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' where they are sitting in a cave \nafter having robbed a bank. Butch looks over at Sundance and says: \n``Boy, I just love it when a plan comes together.''\n  Well, 6 years later, as we look back on the Affordable Care Act, the \nplan is unravelling. It is costing the American people more. Health \ncare is less accessible. Deductibles are higher. It is time that we fix \nit and that we fix it right.\n  If the King v. Burwell case is decided--as it will be in the next few \nweeks--we have an obligation to keep the first promise the President \ndid not keep. Do you remember? President Obama said: If you like your \ninsurance, you can keep it? If Burwell loses and if King wins and the \nCourt rules that the subsidies are illegal, approximately 9.5 million \nAmericans who have gotten insurance and have it through subsidies \nthrough the Affordable Care Act would be threatened to lose their \ninsurance immediately upon its decision. We can't let that happen. We \nhave to see that we build a bridge from where we are today to a future \nof better health care, more accessible health care, and more affordable \nhealth care.\n  So we must remember as Republicans, who have so often criticized the \nPresident for that remark that if you like your health care you can \nkeep it, to make sure that we don't become an unwitting accomplice in \nthis decision if King wins, by, first and foremost, assuring the 9.5 \nmillion who have coverage that we will work to see that you can keep \nyour coverage and that you have a bridge to a better, more competitive, \nmore affordable health care system. It is important for us to remember \nthat.\n  No. 2, it is important for us to remember that we can't recreate a \nsystem that the President created in terms of paying for the health \ncare. Have you ever thought about how the Affordable Care Act is paid \nfor? It is paid for in the following ways: higher copayments, less \nbenefits, and higher premiums. But even worse, there is a revenue \nsystem that actually punishes free enterprise, an 85-percent medical \nloss-ratio mandate which cut out every private sector insurance \nsalesperson who sold medical plans to the American people, because when \nyou take 85 percent as the maximum loss ratio, then you only have 15 \npercent for administration. There is nothing left to compensate someone \nfor selling the policy.\n  No. 3, when we were short $19 billion, the President decided to \ncreate the HIT tax. What is the HIT tax? It is an arbitrary tax against \nsmall and medium-sized group medical companies, charging them not only \non their premiums, not only on their revenues but on their percentage \nof market share. Where in the world has the government ever decided to \ntake market share as an indicator of how much you pay? It makes no \nsense unless you were trying to find dollars to make sense. And the \nPresident did it. I can go over litany after litany after litany.\n  The medical device tax on orthopedists deals with devices in \neverything that they do. The medical device tax is not a tax on net \nprofit on medical devices. It is a 2.3 percent surcharge on the gross \nrevenues of the device manufacturer.\n  I tell the story about my visit to South Africa 2 years ago. I got a \ncall from our Governor. He said: You are in Johannesburg, South Africa. \nWould you go to the chamber of commerce there and visit with a Georgia \ncompany from Kennesaw, GA, a small medical device manufacturer that is \nselling their products. Just tell them thank you for their business.\n  I said sure. I went by that evening for a reception, found the \ngentleman from Kennesaw, and said: Thank you so much for doing your \nbusiness in Georgia.\n  He said: Oh, I have moved.\n  I said: Oh, I am sorry. The Governor's office called me.\n  He said: Well, I just announced that I am moving this week. They \ndon't know it yet.\n  I said: Where are you moving?\n  He said: Madrid.\n  I said: Madrid, Spain?\n  He said: Yes.\n  I said: Why?\n  He said: Because the medical device tax is making it impossible for \nme to do what I need to do in terms of innovation, in terms of \nmarketing, and in terms of distribution.\n  So it was an ill-conceived act with the best of intentions but the \nworst of results. How bad? It is just like what Senator Barrasso said a \nminute ago.\n  In Georgia, one plan is going up 38 percent--one plan. That is the \nhighest we know of--not 4, not 10, not 17 but 38 percent. There are \n10,796 Georgians who have that plan who now have the alternative of \ngoing to find something else or paying 38 percent more. I don't know \nabout everybody else, but wages aren't growing by 38 percent, and \nopportunity is not growing by 38 percent. But the cost of your health \ncare, which you want to have, goes up 38 percent and you have to find a \nway to pay it. What does that do? It hurts the economy, it hurts \nfamily, and it hurts the American people.\n  So as we look at the results of what is going to happen with King v. \nBurwell, if King is ruled in favor of and the courts throw out the \nsubsidies on the Affordable Care Act, we need, first of all, to do no \nharm. We need to make sure that nobody arbitrarily, immediately loses \nthe insurance that they planned on. We need to keep the promise \nPresident Obama made and never kept. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, we need to get everybody in the same room--Republicans and \nDemocrats alike, providers and beneficiaries alike. Let's build a \nhealth care system for the 21st century for America that rewards the \nbest health care system in the world by allowing it to innovate, by \nencouraging it to compete, and not making arbitrary decisions on cost \nand taxation that drive people out of the marketplace and out of \nbusiness.\n  I am at that age where I care about my health care. I enjoy my health \ncare. I like the policy I have. It costs me a lot more than it did \nbefore the Affordable Care Act. Health insurance is important. But \nthere is a limit to what I can absorb. There is a limit to what the \nAmerican people can absorb, and there is a limit to what government can \ndo to try to fit a square peg in a round hole. I learned in Boy Scouts \nthat doesn't work.\n  The Affordable Care Act is a square peg that for 6 years we have \ntried to fit in a round hole, and it doesn't fit. It is time that we \nrounded that peg, took into consideration the American people, the \ntaxpayers, the patients, and the physicians and did what is right for \nthe American people.\n  Don't break our promises. Let's keep our promises. Let's allow them \nto have the choice of insurance policies that, once they buy them, they \ncan keep and a system that doesn't mandate increases but instead \nencourages competition, quality, and makes sure it is health care the \nAmerican people want, is accessible, affordable, available, and \ndelivered in a competitive, free enterprise market by the private \nsector.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/17/senate-section/article/S4220-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4220-S4222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I wish to speak about several amendments I \nhave submitted to the Defense authorization bill currently before the \nSenate.\n  First, I wish to commend Chairman McCain in his first mission as \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee.\n\n[[Page S4221]]\n\nThe bill before us bears his imprint and that of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, and it addresses the growing challenges facing our \nmilitary.\n  This legislation came out of committee in a bipartisan way and came \nto the floor with the opportunity for every Member of the Senate to \noffer amendments to this bill. It was an open amendment process, \nsomething we have been doing this year that hasn't been done previously \nunder the leadership of the now minority. Unfortunately, that effort \nwas blocked by the minority, and we now are where we are.\n  I have introduced amendments that will hopefully be carried now in a \nmanager's package with the support of Senator McCain and others here. I \njust want to describe what those were.\n  First of all, let me say that despite the efforts of the minority to \nblock our progress on this bill, perhaps one of the most essential \nthings the Senate and the Congress does in any year is to provide for \nthe common defense by passing authorization and appropriations for our \nmilitary so that they have the policy and the authority and the \nresources to be able to conduct their efforts, both defending us here \nat home and dealing with issues overseas.\n  The bill is a lifesaver and a nation defender, and it is not--to \nquote the minority leader--``a waste of time.'' How could anyone come \nto this floor and simply say that discussing, debating, and passing \nlegislation that protects our country and provides support for our \nmilitary is a waste of time? It just defies credulity and has us all \nscratching our heads.\n  Nevertheless, we proceeded, and we go forward because, thankfully, \nunder the majority leadership of Senator McConnell and the leadership \nof Senator McCain as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, we are \nmoving forward with this bill.\n  The personnel, platforms, and programs in this bill could very well \nsave the lives of our military personnel deployed on the frontlines of \nfreedom around the globe, and it is necessary that we go forward. That \nbrings me to the rationale behind the first amendment that I have \nintroduced.\n  Last week, President Obama admitted to the Nation and to the world \nthat he still does not have ``a complete strategy'' to deal with ISIS. \nA year ago this month, the terrorist organization Islamic State \nproclaimed itself as a worldwide caliphate, claiming control of \nterritory in Syria and Iraq. ISIS quickly has become the largest, best \norganized, best financed, and most ambitious terrorist organization in \nhistory--not to mention the most brutal terrorist organization that we \nhave ever seen.\n  The previous Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff described the threat arising from ISIS in apocalyptic terms--as \nwell they should. The unspeakable depravities committed by ISIS are \nenough to evoke images of death's pale horse.\n  ISIS has used sophisticated and successful Internet and media \noutreach tools to attract tens of thousands of radical Islamists to \njoin its fight in Syria, Iraq, and beyond. They have captured and \ncontrol major population centers in Iraq, including Mosul, Fallujah, \nand Ramadi. They have secured their bases of operations in Syria and \nexpanded the territory ISIS controls throughout Syria, threatening to \ndominate any successor state emerging from the Syrian civil war. In the \nmeantime, ISIS has also expanded its influence and secured allegiance \nfrom cooperating terrorist organizations in Yemen, Libya, Nigeria, \nNiger, Chad, and Cameroon.\n  Yet early last year, the President compared ISIS to a junior varsity. \nSome junior varsity--it looks more like something that rises to the \nlevel of a major, major threat to the nations of the world--not just in \nthe Middle East but to the nations of the world. But why call it a \njunior varsity?\n  Then, following the terrorist group's dramatic expansion, later the \nPresident acknowledged the threat but admitted that ``we don't have a \nstrategy yet'' to confront ISIS. Eventually, though, the President did \ncome up with a plan that included two main elements: training moderate \nvolunteers--not American volunteers but Iraqi volunteers--to fight ISIS \nin Syria and training and equipping the Iraqi Defense Forces to fight \nISIS in Iraq.\n  The first part of this plan has produced no fighters after a year of \ntalk and has just begun to train the first cohort of 400 volunteers, \nwhose training is to be complete in another year or so. Even then, they \nwill be equipped to assume only defensive missions in Syria, according \nto the Pentagon. That is the U.S. portion. The Iraqi portion deals with \ntraining that I will be talking about here in just a moment.\n  How could this severely limited strategy be even remotely responsive \nto ISIS, to the means and the threat ISIS poses? How is it that ISIS \nmanages to recruit, transport, train, deploy, and effectively fight \ntens of thousands of radical men and women, while we are spending 2 \nyears finding and training just 400 in our program in Syria?\n  In Iraq, 10 years and billions of dollars spent creating defense \nforces has produced nothing capable of standing up to the ISIS \nfanatics.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said earlier this month \nthat Iraqi forces ``did not have a will to fight'' when confronting a \nvastly inferior--vastly inferior--``Islamic State'' force in this \nparticular battle. They just melted away in Mosul and Ramadi, said the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Those who had spent months, if \nnot years, and spent very significant amounts of money on training \nsimply melted away because they did not have the will to fight.\n\n  The President's intention to train and equip the Iraqi forces to \nconfront the Islamic State has failed to produce an effective fighting \nforce that is adequately led and sufficiently equipped. That is the \nonly conclusion we can come to after months and years and extraordinary \nexpenditures of dollars to try to deal with the ISIS threat.\n  The other major component of the President's strategy is airstrikes. \nAirpower, when used as part of an integrated grand strategy, can play \nan essential role. In this case, there is no integrated larger \nstrategy, and therefore airpower is limited in terms of what it can do.\n  The administration's airstrikes have been much less effective in \ndealing with the ISIS threat than anticipated. They have not halted \nISIS's advances in the region.\n  In the words of retired Air Force General David Deptula, a key \narchitect of the air campaign in Operation Desert Storm:\n\n       Air power has to be applied like a thunderstorm, not a \n     drizzle. In the campaign against the Islamic State, we are \n     averaging 12 strike sorties per day. During Operation Desert \n     Storm in Iraq and Kuwait, the average was 1,241.\n\n  Airpower, when properly utilized in concert with troops to support \nthe effort, can bring battlefield success. However, the Obama \nadministration has failed to provide the proper number of well-trained \nAmerican spotters on the ground in Iraq designating targets. If you do \nnot have forces in position to target the exact target, airpower \nbecomes random and not nearly as effective as it should be. And that \nhas not been authorized by the President as a means of dealing with \nthis issue; therefore, the limits that have been placed on the use of \nairpower have left us in a situation where it is much less effective \nthan it could be.\n  It has now been over a year since ISIS was widely acknowledged as a \nmajor threat to our national security. When asked just last week what \nis and is not working in the fight against ISIS, the President stated \nonce again that we still do not have ``a complete strategy'' to \nconfront ISIS. Instead, he blamed the Pentagon and the Iraqis for not \nfinalizing a plan. Yet the President says we still do not have a \ncomplete strategy to address this threat. How is that possible?\n  As the Wall Street Journal put it in its June 11 editorial, ``The \nfundamental problem with Mr. Obama's strategy is that he is so \ndetermined to show that the U.S. isn't returning to war in Iraq that he \nisn't doing enough to win the war we are fighting.''\n  In the meantime, the White House announced that we would be sending \nanother 450 troops to Iraq to train Sunni tribal fighters. I understand \nthat this really means little more than 50 actual trainers, the rest of \nthis small cohort to provide security for themselves. So we are down to \nabout 50 trainers, and that is the next step in dealing with a threat \nthat far expands the need to do much more.\n\n[[Page S4222]]\n\n  We must insist that President Obama immediately produce a complete, \ndetailed, and realistic plan to confront, degrade, and defeat the \nIslamic State. This plan must include realistic, well-substantiated \nestimates of timeframes, resources required, expected allies, and \nanticipated obstacles. Also, it must include clear definitions of \nmilestones and metrics of success. Most importantly, the plan must \ninclude clear accountability. I have introduced an amendment to the \nDefense authorization bill that will require just that--a serious, \ncredible, complete strategy for addressing the threat posed by ISIS.\n  President Obama has shown a tendency to blame others--the Pentagon or \nallies or Sunnis or the Iraqi Government or Congress--for his own \nfailures of leadership in this effort; therefore, we must demand a \ncoherent, realistic plan so the American people can properly apportion \nthe credit for success or the blame for failure where it belongs.\n  Let me briefly talk about a couple of other amendments I have \nintroduced, and I am hopeful we can include these two amendments in the \nmanagers' package.\n  Amendment No. 1705 addresses the Department of Defense's present \npolicy of not allowing Active-Duty flag and general officers to visit \nour friends in Taiwan. Instead, the DOD relies on retired flag and \ngeneral officers--retired officers to visit Taiwan in what can only be \nseen as appeasing Communist China.\n  It is difficult for military officials in both Taiwan and the United \nStates to discuss contingency responses when Active-Duty U.S. generals \nand flag officers are not able to meet regularly with their Taiwanese \ncounterparts. Without visiting Taiwan, they are not able to familiarize \nthemselves with Taiwan's command centers, terrain, and operational \ncapabilities.\n  Active-Duty U.S. generals and flag officers have to be able to visit \nTaiwan and see its military in action in order to gain a better \nunderstanding of Taiwan's armed forces and the weapons they require for \nself-defense.\n  In the event of an emergency, such as humanitarian assistance or a \ndisaster relief mission, senior officers from Taiwan and the United \nStates will have little, if any, experience working together to save \nthe lives of thousands of Taiwanese citizens and Americans living \nabroad in Taiwan.\n  My amendment would simply state that the Department of Defense should \nundertake a program of senior military officer exchanges with Taiwan. \nNote that this amendment does not require such exchanges. I do not \nbelieve in tying the military's hands in this sort of matter, but I do \nbelieve it is important that the Senate go on record as concerned about \nthe current policy of refusing to allow such exchanges. The armed \nforces of Taiwan are a very valuable partner of the U.S. military. \nThese visits by our generals and admirals will encourage Taiwan to make \nincreased investments in their national defense, especially in light of \nthe belligerent behavior demonstrated by the Chinese.\n  I understand that there is bipartisan agreement on this amendment, \nand I hope and trust that we can include this measure in any upcoming \nmanagers' package.\n  Finally, I have offered amendment No. 1877, which would require the \nSecretary of the Navy to submit to both the House and Senate Armed \nServices Committees a report detailing the potential impacts to the \nindustrial base if the July 2017 start date for the refueling and \ncomplex overhaul of the USS George Washington is delayed by 6 months, 1 \nyear, or 2 years.\n  As we learned last year when the administration briefly considered \npostponing the scheduled overhaul of the USS George Washington, such \ndelays only drive up costs because of the uncertainty they create among \nthe industrial base. I hope to avoid a repeat of that mistake by \nrequiring the Navy to report on the true costs of any delay.\n  I hope the Senate will agree to this amendment.\n  Once again, I thank Senator McCain for his leadership on the Defense \nauthorization bill, and I hope the Senate will act to pass this \ncritically important bill without delay. This is one of the most \nessential bills this Congress takes up each year, and to deter this for \nany political reason simply is not acceptable when our troops' lives \nand safety are at risk. They are there to defend us. They need our \nsupport, and they need it now.\n  I yield floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/17/senate-section/article/S4222-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to tell my colleagues that I \nthink we are winding down here. We have several other issues to \naddress, but I think it is very possible that we could see the end here \nfor final passage of the bill. There are still some issues that need to \nbe resolved, but I am grateful for the progress all of my colleagues \nhave made on both sides of the aisle.\n  I would like to call up and speak briefly on McCain amendment No. \n1482. This amendment would prohibit the Secretary of Defense or the \nSecretary of a military department from funding or conducting medical \nresearch or development projects unless the Secretary determines that \nthe research or project is designed to protect, enhance, or restore the \nhealth and safety of members of the Armed Forces through phases of \ndeployment, combat, medical recovery, and rehabilitation.\n  I will not seek a vote on this amendment, but I will say that it is \nan issue which must be addressed if we are going to spend American tax \ndollars on defending this Nation, the security, and the men and women \nwho are serving.\n  What I am going to show my colleagues is what happens with almost any \nbad deal around here, and that is the incredible increase in \ncongressionally directed spending on medical research which is on the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill--not on the Health and Human \nServices appropriations but on Defense. When we are cutting defense, \nwhen we are experiencing all the bad results of sequestration, we \ncontinue to grow to nearly $1 billion in medical research that has \nnothing to do with defense.\n  I am all for medical research. I am all in. The National Institutes \nof Health is doing great things. I am all for it. But when we take it \nout of defense spending rather than what it should be taken out of, \nwhich is Health\n\n[[Page S4223]]\n\nand Human Services, then I object to that.\n  I am aware of the outcry that has taken place at these various \norganizations which are dedicated to improving the health of Americans, \nand so therefore of course I am not subjecting it to a vote. But it is \noutrageous that this has gone up to nearly $1 billion in spending that \nis taken out of the Department of Defense.\n  My friends, what it is, is the Willie Sutton syndrome. When the \nfamous bank robber Willie Sutton was asked why he robbed banks, he \nsaid, ``Because that's where the money is.''\n  So this medical research, which has nothing to do with defense, comes \nout of the Department of Defense. It is wrong, and it needs to stop, as \nevery scarce dollar that is earmarked for defense must go to the \ndefense of this Nation.\n  I know what the response is going to be: Oh my God, McCain, you want \nto take money away from--fill in the blank. No, I am not asking to take \nmoney from any medical research; I am asking that it be put where it \nbelongs, and that is not in the Department of Defense. It is not about \ndisputing the great value of much of the medical research Congress and \nAmerica's taxpayers make possible. I will match my record on support \nfor medical research with anyone's. Any person who has reached my \nadvanced age likely has some firsthand experience with the miracles of \nmodern medicine and gratitude for all who support it. Much of the \nmedical research for which Congress appropriates money each year helps \nto extend and improve the lives of many Americans. This amendment is \nnot about the value of medical research or whether Congress should \nsupport it.\n  Immediately I will hear the response waiting now: Oh, McCain, you \nwant to cut very beneficial research that helps the lives of Americans. \nNo. No, I do not. I want it appropriated from the appropriate \nappropriations bill, not from defense.\n  This amendment is absolutely about what departments and agencies of \nour government should be funding what kinds of medical research and \nspecifically what the proper role of the Department of Defense is in \nthis work.\n  Over the past 20 years, Congress has added billions of dollars to the \nDepartment of Defense's medical research portfolio for disease research \nthat has nothing to do with defense. Since 1992, Congress has \nappropriated almost $10 billion for medical research in the Department \nof Defense's Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs, and \nonly about $2.4 billion of that $10 billion was for research that could \nbe considered in any way relevant to the military.\n  To be sure, the Department of Defense has a proper and vital role to \nplay in medical research that benefits the unique work of our men and \nwomen in uniform in areas such as prosthetics, traumatic brain injury, \nand spinal cord injury, among others. However, through years of \ncongressionally directed spending, the DOD medical research program has \nbeen used to fund research on breast cancer, prostrate cancer, lung \ncancer, genetic disorders such as muscular dystrophy, and even mad cow \ndisease.\n  In other words, over the last 2 decades, in a time of war and fiscal \nchallenge, even despite sequestration, Congress has appropriated $7.3 \nbillion for medical research that is totally unrelated to the \nmilitary--money that the Department of Defense did not request and our \nmilitary did not need.\n  This graph right behind me shows the explosive growth that has \noccurred in this program since 1992. At that time, in 1992, Congress \nhad funded one research project for breast cancer. Over time, that has \nnow grown to 30 separate medical research projects funded by the \nCongress. Funding has increased by almost 4,000 percent, from $25 \nmillion in 1992 to almost $1 billion last year. I will repeat that for \nthe benefit of my colleagues. Spending on medical research at DOD--\nnearly 75 percent of which has nothing to do with the military--has \ngrown 4,000 percent since 1992. Even the late Senator from Alaska, Ted \nStevens, under whose leadership the original funding for breast cancer \nwas added, reversed course in 2006 because the money would be ``going \nto medical research instead of the needs of the military.''\n  During the floor debate on the annual Defense appropriations bill, \nSenator Stevens had this to say:\n\n       We could not have any more money going out of the Defense \n     bill to take care of medical research when medical research \n     is basically a function of the NIH. . . . It is not our \n     business. I confess, I am the one who made the first mistake \n     years ago. I am the one who suggested that we include some \n     money for breast cancer research. It was languishing at the \n     time. . . . Since that time it has grown to $750 million . . \n     . in the last bill we had, dealing with medical research that \n     had nothing to do with the Department of Defense.\n\n  My friends, when Senator Ted Stevens is saying that a congressionally \ndirected spending program has gotten out of hand, we know there is a \nproblem. Yet, despite the urgings of Senator Stevens in 2006, the \nproblem has only gotten worse since then. Last year alone Congress \nappropriated $971.6 million for medical research programs that the \nDepartment of Defense did not request in its budget. More than $280 \nmillion of that money was appropriated for cancer research in the \ndefense budget while six other Federal agencies spent more than $50 \nbillion on cancer research in fiscal year 2015.\n  I will put that in perspective. For the amount of money that Congress \nappropriated for medical research last year at the Department of \nDefense--again, most of which had nothing to do with the military and \nwhich the Department did not request--we could have bought 12 F-18 \nSuperhornets, 2 littoral combat ships or roughly 1 Army brigade combat \nteam.\n  My friends, in these days of sequestration, that is not acceptable. \nOnce again, I am sure every Member of this body agrees that this \nresearch is vitally important to Americans suffering from these \ndiseases, to the families and friends who care for them, and to all of \nthose who know the pain and grief of losing a loved one. But this \nresearch should not be funded by the Department of Defense. It belongs \nin civilian departments and agencies of our government.\n  Appropriating money in this way only harms our national security by \nreducing the funding available for military-relevant medical research \nthat helps protect service men and women on the battlefield and for \nmilitary capabilities they desperately need to perform their missions. \nFurthermore, this kind of misguided spending only puts decisionmaking \nabout medical research in the hands of lobbyists and politicians \ninstead of medical experts where it belongs.\n  So I say to my colleagues, what I had proposed and will not seek a \nvote on--because the result is very clear--is a commonsense amendment. \nIt focuses the Department's research efforts on medical research that \nwill lead to lifesaving advancements in battlefield medicine and new \ntherapies for recovery and rehabilitation of servicemembers wounded \nboth physically and mentally on the battlefield. It could finally begin \nthe long overdue process of shifting the hundreds of millions of \ndollars of nonmilitary medical research spending out of the Department \nof Defense and into the appropriate civilian departments and agencies \nof our government. That is a change that needs to start now, and I hope \nmy colleagues, especially my friends on the Appropriations Committee, \nwill make that happen.\n  I want to point out again that we started in fiscal year 1992 with \n$25 million. We are now up to nearly $1 trillion, and I am sure that \nthe appropriators have an equal or like amount that they are proposing.\n  I see that my colleague from Illinois is here on the floor, and I \nknow he will defend with vigor, passion, love, and every emotion he has \nwhat we are doing because of those who are suffering from illnesses \nsuch as breast cancer and all of the other terrible things that afflict \nour society. I say to my friends who will come to the floor in a high \ndudgeon over what I am proposing: I am not saying that we should cut \nany of these programs--not a single one. We should probably increase \nthem. But let's put them where they belong, and that is not in the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  While I have the floor, I want to talk about some other issues. \nFormer Secretary of Defense Bob Gates said in an interview over the \nweekend:\n\n       What it feels like to me is really what the President said \n     last week, which was a lack of strategy. Just adding a few \n     hundred troops doing more of the same I think is not likely\n\n[[Page S4224]]\n\n     to make much of a difference. . . . We should have had a \n     strategy a year ago. . . . And we have to be willing, if we \n     think ISIS is truly a threat to the United States and to our \n     interests, we have to be willing to put Americans at risk. \n     That's just a fact of life. . . . [I]f the mission [President \n     Obama] has set for the military is to degrade and destroy \n     ISIS, the rules of engagement that he has imposed on them \n     prevent them from achieving that mission.\n\n  I don't know anyone who is more respected by both sides of the aisle \nand served Presidents of both parties in key administrative positions \nthan Secretary of Defense Bob Gates. Quite often, I and my friend from \nSouth Carolina, Senator Graham, are accused of being biased and \npartisan and attacking the President and his strategies in a partisan \nfashion. I will remind my colleagues that in 2006 Senator Graham and I \ncalled for the resignation of the Secretary of Defense, who was then in \na Republican administration. In 2006, we said: We are losing the war. \nIn 2006, I had a spirited argument with then-General Dempsey--who was \nin charge of training the Iraqis and assured me everything was going \nfine--when I was showing him the facts when things were going to hell \nin a handbasket. So to somehow accuse me, Senator Graham, and others of \nmaking these comments about a feckless and without-foundation foreign \npolicy that is allowing ISIS to succeed does not bear scrutiny.\n  I agree with former Secretary of Defense Bob Gates when he says: \n``What it feels like to me is really what the President said last week, \nwhich was a lack of a strategy.'' There is a lack of a strategy.\n  I want to tell my colleagues that we will be having hearings when we \nget through with this bill, and we will try to figure out what the \nCongress and the American people should know about what is happening in \nthe world, not just in the Middle East.\n  Facts are stubborn things. The fact is we can knock off an ISIS or Al \nQaeda leader, and we can trumpet that as a great victory and thank God \nthat it has happened. But to think that really has a significant, long-\nterm impact on the ability of ISIS, Al Qaeda, and other terrorist \norganizations to not reconstitute and continue their success, with \noccasional setbacks--which they are achieving and spreading that poison \nthroughout the Middle East and the latest being Libya, aided and \nabetted in many cases by the Iranians--is obviously a fact that cannot \nbe denied.\n  For example USA Today reports: ``Death of al-Qaeda leader may benefit \nIslamic State.''\n\n       The U.S. missile strike that killed al-Qaeda's No. 2 leader \n     is another in a string of devastating blows to the terrorist \n     group's old-guard leadership that might inadvertently help a \n     more brutal terror group: the Islamic State, analysts said.\n\n  The Washington Post Editorial Board writes today: ``A dangerous \nmission in Libya requires a firm approach.''\n  The Washington Post editorial board, not known as a rightwing \nperiodical, writes:\n\n       It's good those two militants have been taken off the \n     battlefield, but their elimination will not remedy the \n     growing crises in Libya and Yemen. In that respect, the \n     operations are another example of the limited benefits of \n     President Obama's narrow approach to counterterrorism.\n\n  The New York Times reports today: ``As Vladimir Putin Talks More \nMissiles and Might, Cost Tells Another Story.''\n  Reuters reports today: ``China gives more details on South China Sea \nfacilities.''\n  This is very disturbing. I say to my colleagues and all of us--\nwhether we are members of the Intelligence Committee or members of the \nArmed Services Committee--that we must address this issue of cyber \nsecurity.\n  My friends, we just went through a long back-and-forth debate and \ndiscussion over whether we should restrict the kinds of telephone \ninformation and whether it be shared or not shared and who should store \nit and all of that. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported on \nFriday: ``Hackers Likely Stole Security-Clearance Information During \nBreach of Government Agencies.''\n\n       Hackers who raided the U.S. government's personnel office \n     gained access to secret background investigations conducted \n     on current and former employees, senior administration \n     officials said Friday--an ominous development in the recent \n     threat of federal data, one of the largest in history.\n\n  The Washington Post editorial board writes today: ``A pathetic breach \nof responsibility on cybersecurity.''\n\n       [T]he breach of Office of Personnel Management networks \n     this year . . . represents a failure of stewardship and a \n     serious external threat.\n       After the OPM suffered a cyberintrusion in 2014, its \n     director, Katherine Archuleta, asked Congress in February for \n     $26 million in additional funding for cybersecurity. She said \n     the agency stores more personally identifiable information \n     than almost any other in the government, including banking \n     data for more than 2 million people and background \n     investigations for more than 30 million, among them \n     individuals being considered for military enlistment, federal \n     job appointments and employment by federal contractors. ``It \n     is imperative,'' Ms. Archuleta wrote, that . . . ``threats to \n     identity theft, financial espionage, etc., are real, dynamic \n     and must be averted.'' They were not averted.\n       In April, the new breach was uncovered. Intruders had \n     stolen the names, Social Security numbers, pay history, \n     health records and other data of some 4.2 million current and \n     former federal workers.\n       It seems to us that just slamming doors and building more \n     firewalls may be an insufficient response to an assault of \n     this magnitude. An essential aspect of deterrence is the \n     credible threat of retaliation.\n\n  Why do I quote from that? It is because every time we ask a question \nas to what the policy is, whether it is strictly defensive against a \ncyber attack or whether offensive in order to prevent one, the policy \nhas ``not been determined.''\n\n  I say we have to address this issue. First of all, we have to have an \nadministration policy or that policy somehow may be developed in the \nCongress, which is not the right way to do it, obviously.\n  So I intend to work with Senator Burr, Senator Feinstein, Senator \nReed, and others in holding hearings and figuring out what we need to \ndo because this is a serious threat in many respects that we have faced \nin recent times.\n  Finally, I wish to mention this: ``Former CIA Chief Says Government \nData Breach Could Help China Recruit Spies.''\n  Retired Gen. Michael Hayden, who once led the National Security \nAgency and later the Central Intelligence Agency, said the threat of \nmillions of U.S. Government personnel records could allow China to \nrecruit U.S. officials as spies.\n  The general said:\n\n       This is a tremendously big deal. My deepest emotion is \n     embarrassment.\n\n  He said the personnel records were a ``legitimate foreign \nintelligence target.''\n  He continued:\n\n       To grab the equivalent in the Chinese system, I would not \n     have thought twice. I would not have asked permission . . . \n     This is not ``shame on China.'' This is ``shame on us'' for \n     not protecting that kind of information.\n\n  So I urge my colleagues to understand that this new issue of cyber \nsecurity is an area which the United States of America, in the view of \nmany experts, does not have a significant advantage. It is an area \nwhere, in some respects, we may even be at a disadvantage, if we look \nat the extraordinary events that have taken place in the issue of cyber \nsecurity. The latest information, of course, of 4 million people has to \nget our attention. It has to get the attention of the administration. \nWe need to work together. I stand ready--and I know my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle do as well--to sit down and come up with \nsome policies and then implement those policies into ways of combating \nthis new form of warfare we call cyber.\n  Again, I anticipate the comments of my friend from Illinois who will \nvigorously defend all of the research that is done in medical research. \nI wish to point out, again, that I am not in opposition to one single \ndime of any kind of medical research. I say it is coming out of the \nwrong place. We cannot make a logical argument that this belongs in the \nDepartment of Defense. Some of it does, and I have pointed that out. \nThe majority of it belongs with other agencies.\n  When we are facing sequestration and when we are cutting our national \nsecurity to the bone, according to our military leaders who have said \nthat continued sequestration puts the lives of the men and women who \nare serving in the military in danger, we cannot afford another $1 \nbillion to be spent on medical research. We want the money spent on \nmedical research. We want it spent from the right place.\n  I look forward to addressing the remaining amendments with my \ncolleague and friend from Rhode Island.\n\n[[Page S4225]]\n\nHopefully, we can wrap up the Defense authorization bill sometime very \nsoon. Then we can move on to conference and then bring the bill back \nafter the conference to the floor of the Senate so we can carry out our \nfirst and most urgent responsibility; that is, the security of the \nNation and men and women who defend it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say at the outset that the Senator \nfrom Arizona, although we are of opposite political faith, has been my \nfriend and colleague for a long time--since we first were elected \ntogether in a class in the House of Representatives. Our friendship and \nrelationship has had its peaks and valleys. I hope we are at a peak at \nthis moment. I will concede, before I say a word about his amendment, \nthat I have no question in my mind, nor should anyone, about the \ncommitment of the Senator from Arizona to the men and women who show \nextraordinary courage in battling for the United States of America in \nour military. The Senator's own personal life is a testament to his \ndedication to the U.S. military. I know he has brought that dedication \nto his service as the chairman of the Armed Services Committee and in \nbringing this authorization bill to the floor.\n  Secondly, I don't question his commitment to medical research either. \nAs he said, when we reach a certain stage in life, we may value it more \nbecause we realize our own vulnerabilities and the vulnerabilities of \nthose we love. So what I am about to say is not a reflection of his \ncommitment to the military nor his commitment to basic medical \nresearch, but I do question this amendment, which Senator McCain has \nsaid he will not offer but has filed, and I have been prepared for \nseveral days now to debate.\n  Here is the question: Should we have within the Department of Defense \na medical research capacity? I think yes, and I think for obvious \nreasons--because there are certain challenges to the men and women who \nserve in our military and to their families which relate to their \nmilitary service.\n  Secondly, if we are going to have such a military research program, \nshould politicians and lobbyists, as the Senator said, be able to pick \nthe diseases and pick the research? No, of course not. That is why this \nappropriations bill, which we will consider later this week, and this \nauthorization bill address a situation where this is done by \ncompetitive grant. In other words, if we have researchers at some \nhospital who are researching a medical condition important to our \nmilitary, we have to compete for it. It is not automatic. The decision \nis not made by Senators or Congressmen. It is made by medical \nprofessionals about which research makes a difference. So I think \nmedical research is important to our military. Politicians shouldn't \npick and choose those researchers and those research grants; it ought \nto be done by professionals.\n  Third, this undertaking in the Department of Defense is substantial. \nIt is about $1.8 billion for all of the different medical research. In \nperspective, the funding for the National Institutes of Health is about \n$30 billion. This is relatively small.\n  Dr. Francis Collins heads up the NIH and I went to him and I said: \nDoctor, I am working on this defense medical research bill; I want to \nmake sure we don't waste a penny. I don't want to duplicate anything \nyou are doing at NIH.\n  He said: Trust me, we will not. We coordinate everything we do. What \nthey do is complementary to our work and what we do is complimentary to \ntheir work. We are not wasting a penny.\n  So I think those three things are an important starting point in this \ndebate. Medical research is important to national defense. Politicians \nhave no role in choosing who is going to do the medical research. Also, \nwhatever we do is going to be coordinated with medical research at \nleading agencies such as the National Institutes of Health.\n  There are a lot of items on this list of research that I think very \nfew people would ever quarrel with. Should we have a joint warfighter \nmedical account in research? Should we have orthotics and prosthetics \nresearch for those who have lost a limb in military service? How about \na military burn research unit, wound care research, military dental \nresearch--all of these topics relate to actual service.\n\n  The only specifics which the Senator from Arizona raised, questioning \nwhy the Department of Defense would get involved in research, I would \nlike to address. One item he specified is breast cancer. It is true the \nsecond largest undertaking for breast cancer research in America takes \nplace at the Department of Defense. It started there--and I will be \nhonest--I remember why. It started there because the funding through \nthe National Institutes of Health was not reliable or predictable, and \nthe Department of Defense made a commitment: We will make our \ncommitment to breast cancer research.\n  Is there a reason it would be in the Department of Defense? Even \nthough the Senator from Arizona has raised questions about it, I wish \nto call his attention to the following: In 2013, researchers in the \nDepartment of Defense developed a vaccine that promises to protect \nwomen against a recurrence of breast cancer. Breast cancer is a disease \ndiagnosed in female troops at a rate 20 percent to 40 percent higher \nthan the civilian population. I am a liberal arts lawyer, so I don't \nknow why. Can I figure out why more women in our military are diagnosed \nwith breast cancer than women in our civilian population? I don't know \nthe answer to that, but I want to know the answer to that. I want to \nknow if there is something--anything--environmental or otherwise that \nour troops, and particularly women in the military, are exposed to that \nmakes them more likely to come down with a diagnosis of breast cancer. \nIs that a legitimate question at the Department of Defense? It is \nobvious it is.\n  How good are these researchers if we put several billion dollars into \nbreast cancer research in the Department of Defense? The researchers \nrecently completed a 10-year study of this vaccine known as E75, tested \non more than 100 female soldiers recovering from breast cancer and they \nhad a similar test group of civilian women. The research is happening \nwithin the Cancer Vaccine Development Program, an Army research network \nstudying vaccines' potential to fight breast, ovarian, uterine, and \nprostate cancers.\n  Researchers indicated that in trials, the vaccine cut the risk in \nhalf that a woman's breast cancer will return--in half. Is it worth it? \nIs it worth it for us, through the Department of Defense, to put money \ninto breast cancer research when female troops have a rate of breast \ncancer diagnosis 20 to 40 percent higher, when these researchers are \nfinding a vaccine which in trials is cutting the recurrence of breast \ncancer in half compared to other populations? It seems very obvious to \nme.\n  This is not the first time the defense researchers in breast cancer \nhave done extraordinary things. In 1993, defense researchers developed \nHerceptin, now FDA approved, and one of the most widely used drugs to \nfight breast cancer--developed at the Department of Defense. Do we want \nto take the research decisions away from the researchers?\n  The amendment which the Senator from Arizona offers would give the \nSecretary of Defense the last word as to whether we do this research. \nNow, I have known Secretaries of Defense, and they are talented \nindividuals, but when it comes to making medical decisions about \nmedical research, I don't think any of them are qualified to do that. \nLet's leave it in the hands of the professionals, not in the hands of \npoliticians, not in the hands of political appointees, and not in the \nhands of bureaucrats.\n  Let me also say this: When we look at the list of diseases that are \nstudied at the Department of Defense, some of them may sound odd. Lou \nGehrig's disease--ALS--why would we include that on a list for \nDepartment of Defense research? Let me explain. Men and women who have \nserved in the U.S. military are 60 percent more likely than civilians \nto develop Lou Gehrig's disease--men and women who serve in the \nmilitary. Gulf war veterans are twice as likely as the general \npopulation to develop Lou Gehrig's disease. Should we invest money for \nmedical research in the Department of Defense for Lou Gehrig's disease? \nAnd then should we ask the basic question, Why? Why would it be more \nlikely that one\n\n[[Page S4226]]\n\nwould develop Lou Gehrig's disease if one served in the U.S. military \nor if one was in the Gulf war? Those are legitimate medical questions \nthat relate to our military. For the Senator to offer an amendment to \ntake out any of that type of research, I think that is the wrong thing \nto do.\n  We don't have to speak about traumatic brain injury. Everybody knows \nwhat has happened. We have seen the returning veterans--roadside \nbombs--what they have gone through. Between 48,000 and 169,000--\n169,000--military servicemembers who have served and are serving in \nIraq and in Afghanistan have developed post-traumatic epilepsy--head \ninjuries. Post-traumatic epilepsy is a form of epilepsy resulting from \ntraumatic brain injury. I put a provision in here for competitive \ngrants on epilepsy and seizures for this reason: $7.5 million--we have \n169,000 who are dealing with these traumatic brain injuries and dealing \nwith seizures and epilepsy afterward. Is this a legitimate area of \nDepartment of Defense medical research? Absolutely. We cannot ignore \nthe reality of what our troops have gone through and what they need \nwhen they come home. To cut out this research would be a mistake.\n  Let me also say, in 2013 alone, 100,000 servicemembers sought \ntreatment for seizures at our veterans hospitals. It is a serious, \nserious problem.\n  I could go through every single element I have here of medical \nresearch at the Department of Defense. I hope the examples I have given \nillustrate that men and women who serve our country face medical \nchallenges which the ordinary civilian population may not face. I think \nwe have a special obligation to them to engage in the research that can \nmake their lives whole again and give them a chance to come back from \nour military and have a happy and full life, which we promised them. We \nsaid: If you will hold up your hand and give an oath to America that \nyou will risk your life for our country, we will stand by you when you \ncome home, and that includes more than a GI bill to go to school. It is \nmore than a place to live. It is even more than basic medical care. It \ninvolves medical research.\n\n  The final point I wish to make is this. This Senator will never \napologize for trying to come up with more money for medical research. \nNever. Once every 67 seconds in America someone is diagnosed with \nAlzheimer's in America. When my staff told me that, I said you have to \nbe wrong. They are not. It is once every 67 seconds. We spent $200 \nbillion in Medicare and Medicaid on Alzheimer's patients last year, not \nto mention the devastating costs to individual families who have \nsomeone they love suffering from this disease.\n  We don't have an Alzheimer's provision. Well, we have a small \nAlzheimer's provision in this particular medical research bill. Am I \ngoing to stand here to apologize for putting $12 million in Alzheimer's \nresearch? I will tell you, if we could delay the onset of Alzheimer's \nby 1 month, by 2 months, by 6 months, God willing, if we could find a \ncure, we would more than pay for this medical research over and over \nand over again. We would spare people from the pain and suffering they \ngo through with this disease and spare their families as well. When it \ncomes to medical research, I will never stand and apologize for putting \nmoney into medical research. Every one of us has someone we love in our \nfamily facing a terrible, threatening, scary diagnosis and praying to \nGod that there has been some area of research that may find a cure or a \nsurgery. That is what this is about.\n  I am glad the Senator has withdrawn his amendment. I repeat what I \nsaid at the outset. I will never ever question his commitment to our \nmembers in uniform and our veterans, nor will I question his commitment \nto medical research, but I will be sending him information that I think \ndemonstrates what we are doing here has a direct impact on military \nfamilies and military veterans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthree pages of organizations that support my effort to stop this \namendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Groups Opposing the McCain Amendment To Prohibit Certain Types of \n                    Medical Research Programs at DOD\n\n                            (June 16, 2015)\n\n\n                Individual Letters/Grassroots activation\n\n       The Arc;

I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I, too, would like to speak on this \nNational Defense Authorization Act and observe that we just, I think, \nhad a very important exchange between the distinguished chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee and the Senator from Illinois. They disagree \non an amendment that will actually not be voted\n\n[[Page S4227]]\n\non, but I was struck by the remarks of the Senator from Illinois and \nwould observe to my colleagues that he has made a compelling case in \nfavor of the bill, which I appreciate, and in favor of the proposition \nthat the President of the United States should, in fact, sign this \nbill. So I appreciate my colleague from Illinois pointing that out, and \nI hope people at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, and in the Oval \nOffice even, are listening to this stirring defense of the legislation \nfrom the Senator from Illinois.\n  We are indeed moving in the right direction on this bill. I came to \nthe floor last week to talk about the importance of this act. I \nreminded my colleagues at the time that this has always been a \nbipartisan matter. For some 53 years, this Senate, with people who have \ncome long before me, has supported this particular bill on a bipartisan \nbasis, and that is as it should be.\n  I also disagreed strongly in my remarks last week with the remarks of \nthe distinguished minority leader, the Senator from Nevada, who said \nthat taking up this bill was a waste of time because the President had \nstated his intention to veto the bill. I made the point at that time \nthat the success of our Nation's premier Defense bill can never be a \nwaste of time. Taking care of the troops, taking care of the men and \nwomen who have stepped forward as volunteers, can never be considered a \nwaste of time. I really think that more and more of our colleagues are \ncoming around to that conclusion.\n  We have made so much progress in the weeks we have been dealing with \nthis. I would remind my colleagues that we started off in the Armed \nServices Committee with a complete partisan divide. It was troubling at \nthe time, but we have recovered from that. When we began consideration \nof this bill in the Senate Armed Services Committee, we were told that \nevery Republican would vote aye and every Democrat would vote no. That \nwas definitely a concern to those who obviously know that this has to \nbe bipartisan, that national security has to be something that has the \nsupport from both sides of the aisle.\n  As we worked through the process, as the distinguished ranking member \nthe Senator from Rhode Island worked with the chairman of the committee \nSenator McCain, we gained more and more support for this legislation in \ncommittee. At the end of the day, only four Members of the entire \ncommittee voted no. So the vote was 22 in favor and only 4 opposed in \nthe committee--again, moving in the right direction.\n  We got to the floor last week, and we heard the statement that this \nis a waste of time. I think we are moving away from that. Indeed, \nyesterday we voted on cloture on the bill. I have in my hand a very \nencouraging vote tally of 83 Senators in favor of this bill on this \nmotion for cloture. There were 83 in favor and only 15 opposed.\n  At the beginning of my brief remarks, I would just say it is \nencouraging to me that both at the committee level and also on the \nSenate floor, we are getting to where the Senate has always been on \nthis bipartisan issue, and we certainly need to. We need to authorize \nthe best tools available for our troops, the best training available \nfor our troops, and our veterans, as the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois just pointed out, are in need of the support this bill gives \nthem. In addition, our veterans are ready for much needed reforms to \nimprove retirement and to improve military benefits.\n  Of course, we live in a very unstable and insecure world. We need \nthis bill to meet the threats that are out there. We wish they weren't \nthere. I wish things were better in Iraq. I wish our hard-fought gains \nhad not been tossed away by our precipitous withdrawal, but, in fact, \nthe situation has worsened in Iraq, and we need this bill to protect \nour interests there. We face old Cold War tensions with the reasserting \nof an aggressive Russia, in the form of President Vladimir Putin, \nincreasingly intent on restoring the Soviet Empire. We face other \nrealities: cyber terrorism, the nuclear ambitions of Iran, which we \nheard so much about recently, and we need to reaffirm that the United \nStates has a capable and strong U.S. defense.\n  Let me for a brief few moments come home to my home State of \nMississippi and say why people in my State feel so strongly about this. \nOf course, we have military bases from north to south in Mississippi. \nOur own Mississippians, as in all of our States, have stepped forward \nand are volunteering and serving capably. We also manufacture so many \nthings in my State of Mississippi that are important for national \nsecurity. We make unmanned aerial vehicles in Mississippi. Some of the \nfinest ships in the world are made on the gulf coast of Mississippi. \nHelicopters, radars, and other electronic war technology, all of these \nare manufactured in my home State. So for people in Mississippi, I \nthink the talk of this bill--these weeks on the floor--being a waste of \ntime does not ring true.\n  A few examples: In my hometown of Tupelo, MS, this bill recognizes \nthe importance of the Army's Apache helicopters and the Tupelo Army \nAviation Support Facility. At Columbus Air Force Base, where over 2,000 \npersonnel serve, this bill and the Defense appropriations bill, which \nthe Senator from Maryland may speak about in a few moments--these \npieces of legislation allow our student pilots to have adequate \ntraining and adequate flying training hours.\n\n  In Starkville, MS, the authorization and appropriations bills are \nintegral to completing the Army Reserve Center for equipping and \ntraining military personnel. Along the gulf coast, these Defense \nbills--the authorization and the appropriations bills--would support a \nnew Army National Guard aviation depot at the Gulfport-Biloxi Airport, \nas well as the continued mission of over 11,000 Americans who work at \nKeesler Air Force Base. I am proud of these, and I am proud of what \nthey do for our overall national defense of the United States.\n  Mississippi is just one of many States to take part in this. Simply \nput, the future of our defense should not be put in jeopardy because of \ndisagreements about unrealistic domestic funding issues. We can get to \nthose issues, but defending the United States of America is something \nonly the Federal Government can do. We can't devolve national defense \ndown to the States. We have to do it in this building, in this body, on \nthis floor of the Senate. Besides, it is well worth saying and \nreminding my colleagues that this bill gives the President every penny \nhe has requested for national defense. It meets the $612 billion \nrequested by President Obama in his budget. So it really should not be \npartisan at all.\n  I will go back to what the Senator from Illinois said. He made a \nstirring defense of this legislation, I think one that should be \nlistened to by the President of the United States. He should listen to \nthe fact that we had an 83-to-15 vote on cloture, and we had a 22-to-4 \nvote in the Appropriations Committee.\n  We have had a few partisan flareups along the course of this \nlegislation, but I think as we get to the end of the day, I am more and \nmore encouraged about the prospect of this bill. I think we can pass it \ntomorrow with an overwhelming vote, which shows we are voting for it \nnot as Republicans, not as Democrats but as Americans, because we want \nto defend the vital national interests of the United States of America.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, standing here listening to the debate and discussion \nby colleagues on both sides of the aisle really makes the point that \nmany of us are saying. We need a new budget agreement. We have people--\nI think we all agree on both sides of the aisle that we need to defend \nAmerica. There is no doubt about that. In order to do that, we need to \nlook at national security both in its funding for the Department of \nDefense, but we also need to be looking at what are the components to \nnational security. Many of the key agencies that are not in the \nDepartment of Defense are also important to the national security.\n  Yet, at the same time, we have defense with this budget gimmick, and \nthat is what it is. It is a budget gimmick to avoid the caps we have on \nspending on both defense and discretionary spending. What this bill is, \nis a gimmick to have the money through something called OCO, which was \nmeant to be a specific expense for overseas contingency funds. It was \nmeant\n\n[[Page S4228]]\n\nto deal with specific wars. Now it has been plussed-up by several \nmillions and millions of dollars to avoid the budget caps.\n  This isn't a budget debate here. I will be saying more about it on \nthe floor. But I just want to say to my colleagues, think about \nnational security. Yes, we do need a strong national defense and we do \nneed to support our troops and we do need to support our military \nfamilies. We do need to support our troops. We do need to support our \nmilitary families. That is what I am going to be elaborating on in a \nminute. But we also have to look at the other aspects.\n\n  First of all, you need a State Department. Part of national security \nis diplomacy. You need a State Department.\n  Second, in the State Department, you need Embassy security. If you \ndon't want another Benghazi, you must put money in the Federal budget \nto make sure we have Embassy security. You have to fund the State \nDepartment. That is in discretionary funding.\n  You do not like the cyber attacks? We are going to have meetings, and \nwe are going to hold hearings, and--hoorah--all of the things we should \nhave been doing 3 to 5 years ago but were stopped on this Senate floor \nbecause of concerns of the chamber of commerce that we would \noverregulate.\n  We have a Department of Homeland Security. It needs to be funded. It \nis in discretionary spending.\n  You want to have a cyber security workforce? Yes. They need to be \ntrained at our great colleges and universities. We need a Department of \nEducation with the Pell Grants and so on to be able to help our people \nget the jobs for the 21st century so they can do the type of work we \nare talking about we need them to do here.\n  I could go through other agencies.\n  I am not here to stand up for government agencies. I am here to stand \nup for America. I am here to say: Yes, we do need national security. We \nneed to fund the Department of Defense, but we need to fund those other \nagencies and programs that are integral to national security. That is \nwhy I think we need a new budget agreement along the lines of Ryan-\nMurray, and we need to end the sequester.\n  I hope--and I call upon leadership on both sides of the aisle but \nparticularly on the other side of the aisle: Let's get to it now, \nsooner rather than later.\n  I am the vice chair of the Appropriations Committee and am working \nvery closely with my esteemed colleague, the senior Senator from \nMississippi, on trying to bring bills to the floor, but we simply have \nto come up with a new agreement.\n  So we will go through a lot of parliamentary motions and commotion, \nbut I am not so sure we are going to get the locomotion we need to look \nout for America. We cannot let our military be hollowed out. We cannot \nlet our country be hollowed out. We need to really move ahead with this \nnew agreement, and a perfect example is why I come to the floor.\n  All through this debate, I have heard that the most important tool to \na strong military is the military themselves, the military and their \nfamilies. Consistent through all, from both sides of the aisle, is that \nwe must look out for our troops. Well, I could not agree with that \nmore. Yet, what is it that we know in this bill, tucked away, is really \nan erosion of one of the key earned benefits our military and their \nfamilies and the retirees have--commissaries. Commissaries.\n  Commissaries have been around since the 19th century. They have been \naround since 1826. Military families have been able to shop at networks \nof stores that provide modestly priced goods--primarily groceries--to \nmilitary families and to retirees. There are 246 of them, many in our \nown country, many overseas, many in our country where they are only \nplace our military can go. There are those in some other countries \nwhere they are not even looked upon and welcomed in some of these \ncountries, even though we are there.\n  So what is in this bill? Two things: One, let's privatize the \ncommissaries; the other is, let's cut their budget by $322 million.\n  I am for saving money by eliminating Pentagon waste, but I will tell \nyou that no money is wasted at a commissary. In fact, just the opposite \nhappens. The commissaries are the most popular earned benefit the \nmilitary has.\n  Also, this is not Senator Barb talking; this is coming from the \nmilitary themselves. If you listen to the National Military and \nVeterans Alliance, they say this: Commissary and exchanges are a vital \npart of pay and compensation. The military community greatly value \nthese benefits. The proposed cuts would dismantle the commissary \nbenefit relied upon by shortening hours and raising prices.\n  When we look at commissaries, we know that people shop there, they \nsave money, and at the same time they are also a major source of \nemployment.\n  What I want to do is work with my colleague, the Senator from \nOklahoma, a member of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Jim Inhofe. \nIt is his amendment. We want to prevent the commissary privatization \npilot program. I also have an additional amendment. I would like to \nrestore the $322 million in cuts to commissaries. We have an offset to \nbe able to pay for it as well. The benefits of the commissaries are \nsignificant. That is why I want these two amendments to be offered. \nThey feed our troops, they help military families stretch their \nbudgets, and they provide jobs to military spouses and to military \nchildren old enough to work and military retirees.\n  The military families tell me they get significant savings--sometimes \nas much as 30 percent--on their bill. For a family of four, that could \nbe $4,500 per year. As I said, 60 percent of the commissary workers are \nspouses or retirees at these commissaries.\n  DOD says we want commissaries to be more self-sustaining. They have \nproposed cuts of more than $1 billion through 2020. They are talking \nabout, in fiscal year 2016, cutting $322 million. Next year, they want \nto cut $1 billion. And they also want to look at how to privatize.\n  Joining with my colleague from Oklahoma, the distinguished senior \nSenator, Jim Inhofe--he has legislation to deal with the privatization. \nIn this bill that is pending, they implement this commissary pilot \nplan. Well, we have heard that before. I think it is a plane without a \npilot. But we do not even know if it is a good option. It was made up \nby Pentagon bean counters, Pentagon bean slicers who were told: Find \nsavings. So they went after the commissaries.\n  Well, the Senator from Oklahoma and I want to require the DOD and GAO \nto study the impact of privatization before a plan can be implemented. \nIn other words, before you privatize, why don't you study the impact? \nThe Senator from Oklahoma is proposing that this study be due in \nSeptember so that we would be able to act appropriately in our \nappropriations. I support him in his amendment.\n  I also am looking for support in the cuts to commissaries. Right now, \nproposed in both the authorization and then they tried it in our \nappropriations bill, is a cut in the appropriations by $322 \nmillion. This means hours would be cut, so instead of operating 7 days \na week, they would be open 5. It would raise prices in many instances \nby as much as 25 percent. In far-flung places such as Hawaii or Alaska, \nprices could even go up by as much as 50 percent because of the formula \nbeing used.\n\n  This is just not right. Of all of the places that we could save \nmoney, let's not go after commissaries. Let's not go after \ncommissaries. They help military families and retirees stretch their \nbudgets. For many of our young military, particularly the enlisted, the \ncommissary is the place where they learn how to stretch their dollar. \nAt the same time, it provides employment to military spouses, in some \ninstances military children, and also to retirees.\n  What is the problem here? We cannot get votes on our amendments. We \ncannot get a vote on the privatization issue proposed by the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, and I cannot get a vote on my amendment to restore the \n$322 million.\n  I know the leadership is now meeting on how to wrap up this bill. \nWell, I don't want to wrap up this bill. I think that what we need to \ndo is to be able to vote on these two amendments.\n  We have had all kinds of amendments. We had one on the sage-grouse. I \nknow the sage-grouse is a protected species. As an appropriator, I had \nto deal with this as a rider on the appropriations bills. So I am not \nagainst the\n\n[[Page S4229]]\n\nsage-grouse. I am not against talking about the sage-grouse. But why, \nwith all of the problems facing America, do we need a sage-grouse \namendment on defense when I cannot get a vote on protecting \ncommissaries, protecting an earned benefit of our military, helping \nthem stretch their dollar, and making sure some of them have a chance \nto work on a military base? Why can't I get an amendment? Why can't the \ndistinguished Senator from Oklahoma get a vote on his amendment that \nwould call for a halt to the privatization pilot until we get a study \nfrom GAO on impact? So you can stand up for the sage-grouse, but I will \ntell you that I am standing up for military families.\n  I urge the leadership at the highest level and the leadership moving \nthis authorization to give Inhofe-Mikulski privatization of \ncommissaries a vote and give me a chance to offer my amendment. Let the \nSenate decide. Let's not have me stopped and stymied because of \nparliamentary procedure.\n  You might say--and to everybody listening--well, Barbara, you are \npretty outspoken. You are not shy. Why can't you offer your amendment?\n  Under the rules of the body we are now operating under, I have to get \nconsent. That means all 99 other Senators should not object to me \noffering an amendment. Well, I am stuck. So what I need is for the \nleadership to give me the consent to at least have my amendment \ndiscussed and debated in the light of day. I want to hear their \njustification why they have to go after commissaries. Let's stand \nunited. Let's get a new budget agreement. Let me offer our amendment.\n  We should not be fighting with each other over these things. Instead \nof going after commissaries, let's go after the bad guys in the world \nand let's do it in a united way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                    3rd Anniversary of DACA Program\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise today to mark the third anniversary \nof the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, which was this \nweek. Since 2012, the program the President implemented, which has been \nknown as DACA, has offered temporary relief from deportation to \nimmigrants who arrived in the United States as young children. It has \nhelped almost 665,000 young people since June of 2012, including more \nthan 10,000 in Virginia. The DACA Program announced by the President \nhas allowed young people to contribute to our communities, live without \nconstant fear of deportation, keep families together, and provide \neconomic and educational opportunities for these young recipients.\n  I want to thank President Obama and the administration because DACA \nhas provided relief to thousands of youngsters who seek only to pursue \nopportunity, provide for their families, and contribute to the only \nplace they have ever known as home--the United States.\n  Immigrants are not the only ones who benefit. DACA enforces the \nuniversal reputation of this country that we are proud of, that we \nvalue our immigrant heritage and we embrace and celebrate their \ncontributions to American history, industry, and culture. This is a \nvalue which is something we feel very deeply in Virginia. We feel it \nmore every day.\n  When I was born in 1958, 1 out of 100 Virginians had been born in \nanother country. Today, in 2015, one out of nine Virginians was born in \nanother country. That period coincides with the moving of the Virginia \neconomy from bottom quarter per capita income to top quarter. \nImmigration and the contributions of immigrants to our State have been \ntremendously positive.\n  More than 10,000 youngsters in Virginia have benefited by DACA. We \nare 13th among all States. Let me just tell you two quick stories.\n  Hareth Andrade exemplifies what DACA recipients, if given the \nopportunity, can give back to their communities. Hareth arrived in the \nUnited States from Bolivia, brought by adults. She arrived without her \nparents. She excelled in school. She attended Washington-Lee High \nSchool right here in Arlington. She took advanced placement and \ninternational baccalaureate classes.\n  During a campus visit as she graduated, she learned for the first \ntime that her undocumented status would be a barrier to earning a \ncollege education. But instead of giving up on her dream, she organized \nwith other students to form DREAMers of Virginia, an organization that \nhas led efforts to provide students access to instate tuition and \ncollege admission for kids just like her.\n  After the President announced the DACA Program in June of 2012, \nHareth became a recipient, and she has since transferred from community \ncollege to Trinity Washington University, where she expects to graduate \nwith a degree in international affairs next year.\n  Another student, Jung Bin Cho, also has seen doors open to him \nbecause of DACA, doors to educational opportunities such as the fine \ninstitution of Virginia Tech, where he now attends. Cho arrived in the \nUnited States with his parents from South Korea when he was 7 years \nold. He attended elementary school and graduated high school in \nSpringfield, VA, where he played on the defensive line for the football \nteam.\n  His dream--a lot of Virginians have this dream--was attending \nVirginia Tech, and he gained admission to the school. But at the same \ntime he first realized that his undocumented status eliminated him from \ninstate tuition or any financial aid. Because he couldn't afford it, he \nattended community college and worked two jobs to support himself. But \nfollowing DACA and the decision last year to grant instate tuition to \nyoung Virginians--a decision for which I applaud our Governor and \ngeneral assembly--Cho reapplied to Virginia Tech, won admission, and he \nnow is able to attend Virginia Tech, where he will pursue a degree in \nbusiness and hopefully participate in this great expansion of the \nVirginia economy that so many of our immigrants have been proud to \nlead.\n  For young people such as Hareth and Cho, DACA makes sense. Both came \nhere as young children. They didn't come here on their open volition; \nthey were brought here. They only know Virginia as home, and they seek \nto study, work, and build a life in this country. As proud Virginians, \nthey want to return the opportunities afforded to them by using their \ntalents to improve their communities and making it a better place for \neverybody.\n  In addition to the humanitarian aspect, as you heard, these talented \nstudents are the kinds of people who accelerate our economy. DACA is \ngood for our economy, too. So I strongly support its continuation, but \nI also wish to encourage my colleagues--and I think we all agree, \nDemocrat, Republican, Independent--we all agree this program is best \nnot by Executive order but by legislation.\n  We are now almost exactly 2 years from the date when the Senate \npassed comprehensive immigration reform on this floor in June of 2013. \nFor 2 years, after a strong bipartisan effort, we have waited for \naction--any action--by the House, not just taking up our bill but doing \ntheir own bill and then, in a conference, finding a compromise, which \nwe can do.\n  It is time that the House act. It is time that the Senate and the \nHouse sit down together and do comprehensive immigration reform. We can \ngive DREAMers and millions of other families who continue to live in \nthe shadows an earned pathway to citizenship. It is time to pass that \nreform. It is in the best traditions of our Nation and in the best \nvalue traditions of my Commonwealth that we do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The majority whip.\n\n\n                       Defense Appropriations Act\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, after the Senate concludes its work on the \nDefense authorization bill tomorrow--a very important part of our \nresponsibility--we will then move to consider the Defense \nAppropriations Act. This actually is the legislation that will pay the \nbills for the Department of Defense and make sure our men and women in \nuniform get the resources they need in order to do their job, not to \nmention their pay, which is why it is so disturbing to see the \nleadership of our minority in the Senate announce in the papers here in \nWashington that they are going to begin what they call a filibuster \nsummer. In other words, they are going to use the power they have as \nthe minority to block important funding bills, beginning with the bill \nthat pays for our national security, in what can only be called a cheap \npolitical stunt.\n\n[[Page S4230]]\n\n  Why they have decided to do that on this important Defense \nappropriations bill is, frankly, beyond me. I think I understand what \ntheir general point is, which is they don't think the Federal \nGovernment spends enough money, and so they want to spend more money, \nand they have no concern whatsoever for the fact that under this \nadministration, we have raised the national debt by trillions of \ndollars, making sure that my generation will not end up having to pay \nthat money back, but the next generation will unless we meet our \nresponsibilities.\n  So for them to pull this kind of political stunt and say ``You know \nwhat, we are not spending enough money, we are not incurring enough \ndebt, and so we are going to force a filibuster on the Defense \nappropriations bill'' in order to extort more spending, more debt, more \nirresponsibility--the bill our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle are pledging to filibuster is not controversial in itself because \nit would, as I said, provide for our military and would help our troops \nmaintain their status as the greatest military in the world. It also \nincludes simple initiatives that make a lot of sense and serve our \ntroops well, such as giving the men and women who wear the uniform a \nmodest pay raise. Yet the Democratic leader still plans to block this \nlegislation and stymie this Chamber's efforts to fund our troops.\n  We saw a little glimpse of this last week when Senate Democrats, with \nthe exception of seven, blocked us moving an amendment to deal with \ncyber security. We saw that their timing could not have been worse \nbecause, of course, then it was announced that millions of records at \nthe Office of Personnel Management had been hacked by the Chinese \nGovernment and some of the most sensitive security clearance background \nrecords were now in their hands--a dramatic act of counterintelligence \nand espionage.\n  Then, when we offered an amendment to the Defense authorization bill \nthat would deal with cyber security, would allow more information \nsharing, would allow lawsuit protection for those who shared \ninformation in order to protect the privacy and the information of \nAmerican citizens, it was blocked by all but seven Democrats on the \nother side.\n\n  So while I have been by and large encouraged by this new Congress and \nwhat we have been able to accomplish together in a bipartisan way, I \nthink there are some very troubling signs on the horizon, starting with \nthis ill-considered idea of filibuster summer, throwing a temper \ntantrum until you can get more money that we don't have to spend on \nyour pet projects. But I think their decision to hold Defense \nappropriations bill hostage is just inexcusable. This is the essential \nfunding for our military, for national security.\n  I should point out, as my colleagues across the aisle use this bill \nas leverage to spend more taxpayer dollars on things like the IRS, not \nlong ago they vocally opposed the obstructionist tactics they are now \nemploying. Here are the words of the Democratic leader, Senator Harry \nReid, in 2013. He said: ``It's time to get back to setting fiscal \npolicy through the regular order . . . rather than through hostage \ntaking.'' I agreed with his comments then, and I wish he would act \nconsistently with those words today.\n  The American people aren't served well by these kinds of manufactured \ncrises and threats to cut off funding for our troops. And that is why \nthe new Republican Senate, under Majority Leader McConnell, has \nprioritized and restored the kind of regular order that Senator Reid \ntalked about in 2013. Finally, the Congress and the Senate are actually \ngetting back to work on a bipartisan basis.\n  As I have said, we have had some signs of progress. I know Majority \nLeader McConnell likes to quote Woody Hayes from Ohio State when he \ntalks about the nature of the progress we have made. He said: ``Three \nyards and a cloud of dust.'' I like to think of it more as a baseball \nanalogy of singles and an occasional double. But you get the basic \npoint. We are actually beginning to make some progress, and that is why \nI find so troubling these signs of filibuster summer and this \nannouncement by our Democratic friends.\n  We have done our best after this last election, after the American \npeople entrusted us with the majority of the House and the Senate, to \ndeliver on our promises. We have held more rollcall votes on amendments \nin the past 5 months than the minority leader, as the Democratic \nleader, allowed in the entire year when they were under control--more \nrollcall votes on amendments in the last 5 months than Democrats \nallowed in an entire year when they were in control.\n  The truth is that our Democratic colleagues, I think, like it better, \ntoo, because not only was the minority--Republicans--shut out when \nSenator Reid was majority leader, he shut out Members of his own party, \nthe majority party. Now, how you explain that back home, I am not too \nclear.\n  But it is not only Senator Reid who has made this commitment to \nrestoring regular order and eschewing this idea of hostage taking, \nwhich now they are talking about doing.\n  Here are the comments of one other member of their Senate leadership, \nthe Senator from Washington, Ms. Murray. In 2013, she said the American \npeople had no patience for ``politicians holding the economy and the \nFederal Government hostage to extract concessions or score political \npoints.''\n  I agree with her, and I agreed with Senator Reid in 2013, but these \nare the exact same Democratic leaders who are now today threatening the \nsame sort of hostage taking they condemned in 2013.\n  Well, I like to point out that the legislation we are considering, \nthe Defense appropriations bill, is not a partisan bill. In fact, it \nwas voted out of committee last week by a vote of 27 to 3. This is not \na partisan bill, so why they should decide to hold this hostage is \nbeyond me.\n  All but three Democrats supported the defense spending measure in \ncommittee last week. But, unfortunately--and defying logic--some \nDemocrats have publicly admitted to supporting the text of the bill \nwhile vowing to do everything they could to keep it from advancing on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  Just one example is the junior Senator from Connecticut, who hailed \nthe bill's passage--this is the Defense appropriations bill in \ncommittee--through the committee as a ``victory for Connecticut''--I am \nsure there was a press release to go along with that back home--only to \ngo on and say he would go along with the ill-fated strategy to vote no \nto actually block the bill from being considered on the floor.\n  The American people are very smart, and they can identify hypocrisy \nwhen they see it. When a Senator says, ``I am going to vote for the \nbill in committee, but I am going to vote against it on the floor \nbecause that is what my leadership tells me I have to do in order to \nextract more spending and impose more debt on the American people in \nfuture generations,'' the American people get it once it is pointed out \nto them.\n  So this is all about gamesmanship. This is not about responsible \nlegislating, and it is not why the American people sent us here.\n  I can only hope, being the optimist that I am, that our colleagues on \nthe other side will reconsider this stated strategy of filibuster \nsummer. What a mistake that is. What an unsustainable position when \nthey have to go home over the Fourth of July and tell the veterans, \ntell the Active-Duty military in their State: Yes, I voted to kill the \nbill that would pay your salary and provide you the tools you need in \norder to succeed in your commitment to keeping America safe.\n  I just don't know how you sustain that position.\n  So I would encourage our colleagues from across the aisle to remember \nthat filibuster summer is a bad idea and that it is not good for the \nAmerican people. It irresponsibly signals to our troops that some \nMembers of the Senate are not fully behind them.\n  So let's continue to working productively. We have done it on hard \npieces of legislation, most recently on the trade legislation we passed \nout of the Senate with a strong bipartisan vote. Let's continue to work \ntogether productively in a way that serves the American people and not \nresort to the sort of political maneuvers that I don't think reflect \nwell on us and on the Senate as an institution but, more fundamentally, \nundermine the men and women who wear the uniform of the U.S. military.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S4231]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Third Anniversary of DACA Program\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to acknowledge the third \nanniversary of the Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals--the DACA \nProgram--as many of my colleagues have over the past few days.\n  The DACA Program was created because our government faced an \nimpractical mandate to deport hundreds of thousands of undocumented \nchildren who pose no risk to society. Congress, thus far, has been \nunable to solve the problem. Despite the very good bipartisan efforts \nthat occurred in this body back in 2013, we have been unable to pass \nany meaningful immigration reform. Why? Well, a group from the far \nright in the House of Representatives oppose immigration reform at all \ncosts and have sort of tied Speaker Boehner into knots so he can't \nbring anything to the floor.\n  So 3 years ago, with no choice, President Obama moved forward on his \nown to shield children who were brought to this country through no \nfault of their own. They were brought by their parents when they were \nvery young, most of them; children who have lived here for many years \nand know no other country as their own, children who are in our school \nsystem and dreaming of getting a college degree in America.\n  The President created DACA, a temporary program modeled on the DREAM \nAct, which is a vital component of comprehensive immigration reform. As \nI said, we couldn't get immigration reform, unfortunately. That would \nhave been the best way to go, and I am still hopeful that will happen \nat some point in time. But doing what the President did was the humane \nand practical thing to do because the House couldn't do anything. What \nchoice was there? Leave these kids here through no fault of their own \nin total limbo? That was not the right thing to do. So we hope this is \na policy Congress will implement into law at some point, but right now, \nof course, as I mentioned, the House is hog-tied.\n  In the 3 short years since its inception, the DACA Program has \ndeferred deportations for over one-half million young DREAMers. In New \nYork, nearly 34,000 have been approved for DACA. Of those 34,000, there \nis a girl named Kirssy Martinez from New York City. Kirssy came to our \ncountry from the Dominican Republic in 2002, and she attended high \nschool in New York City.\n  After graduating, Kirssy lived in the shadows, working small jobs \nhere and there as a waitress, a babysitter, whatever she could do to \nmake ends meet. She was a good student coming out of high school. She \neven had a few scholarship offers but couldn't attend college because \nshe didn't have a green card and, moreover, she didn't have the means \nto afford a college education.\n  In 2012, Kirssy was one of the first to sign up for DACA. With her \nnew temporary legal status, she was able to enroll in Bronx Community \nCollege. She got loans to pay for her first semester. She had to drop \nout once the loans ran out. She scraped together more funding from \nTheDream.US scholarship that provides tuition assistance to DREAMers at \nCUNY schools.\n  Now Kirssy is 26 years old. I met her at her graduation at Bronx \nCommunity College. She was covaledictorian of her class with a perfect \n4.0 average.\n  These are the kinds of kids we are talking about. They want to be \nAmericans. They want to get out of the shadows. They want to live \nproductive, full lives. They do not want a handout. They want to be \nable to be on their own. That is what Kirssy did. I met her, and I was \nso proud of her.\n  Kirssy has realized a DREAMers dream because of both her hard work \nand the President's DACA Program, which helped bring her out of the \nshadows. There are many more in New York and around the country just \nlike her.\n  The sad truth is that instead of harnessing the potential and the \ncontributions these young people could make, instead of welcoming them \nas full-fledged members of our society, the Republican majority in the \nHouse of Representatives voted to repeal the DACA Program. With these \nvotes, House Republicans have made it clear they want to deport these \nDREAMers.\n  Many of the DREAMers have a sibling who may have been born in the \nUnited States and is a citizen of the United States or a parent who may \nhave a green card. House Republicans have no qualms about tearing these \nfamilies apart. They have no qualms what it could cost us as a nation \nto lose these young people.\n  If you look at the workforce in America, it is different than Europe \nin that we do have enough young people who want to work to help support \nthose who are in retirement or on disability--but not if our House \nRepublicans have their way.\n  In my home State of New York, DREAMers like Kirssy are doing amazing \nthings. They are studying medicine, they are working at startup tech \ncompanies and more. If Republicans in the House have their way, these \ntalented people would be putting their skills to use to compete against \nus rather than working to make America stronger.\n  Like the millions who came here before them--like the ancestors of \nour Presiding Officer and my ancestors--they came here because they \nwant to be Americans, not because they want to get a benefit, not \nbecause they want to be a leach on society. They want to be a full-\nfledged, productive member of society. Somehow these folks in the \nHouse--and I don't even know if they know who these kids are--want to \nstop that from happening.\n  As we recognize this anniversary, we should remember the real human \nstories behind the DACA Program and think how our Nation could be made \nbetter by sensible immigration reform now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             National Alzheimer's and Brain Awareness Month\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to ask my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing June as National Alzheimer's and Brain Awareness Month. \nEvery 67 seconds someone in our country develops Alzheimer's disease. \nIt is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. Yet it is \nthe only disease in the top 10 that cannot yet be prevented, cured or \nslowed.\n  Of the 5.3 million Americans with Alzheimer's disease, 5.1 million \nare 65 and older, accounting for 96 percent of the diagnosed \npopulation. By 2050, the number of people 65 and older with Alzheimer's \ndisease may nearly triple from 5.1 million to an estimated 13.8 million \nAmericans. The disease will take the lives of an estimated 700,000 \nseniors in the United States this year, and that number is rapidly \nrising.\n  While deaths from other major causes have decreased in this country, \ndeaths from Alzheimer's disease have increased significantly. Between \n2000 and 2013, deaths attributed to Alzheimer's disease increased 71 \npercent, while deaths attributed to heart disease, the No. 1 cause of \ndeath in the United States, decreased by 14 percent.\n  This devastating disease is also one of our country's most expensive \ndiseases. Nearly one in every five Medicare dollars is spent on people \nwith Alzheimer's and other dementias. Unless something is done, by 2050 \nit will be $1 out of every $3. We cannot afford to overlook Alzheimer's \ndisease. Both the human cost and the cost to our health care system are \nsimply too great. We must invest more in research to develop treatments \nto prevent or delay the progression of Alzheimer's disease and \nultimately to find a cure.\n  Of all the statistics and data regarding Alzheimer's disease, perhaps \nthe most upsetting is the immense gap between the amount we spend on \nAlzheimer's research and the cost of caring for those with Alzheimer's \ndisease.\n  In 2014, the total cost of Alzheimer's was $214 billion, including \n$150 billion to Medicare and Medicaid. During that same year, the \nNational Institutes of Health invested only one-quarter of 1 percent of \nthat amount--$566 million--in Alzheimer's research. This year, cancer \nresearch will be allocated an estimated $5.4 billion in Federal funds \nand heart disease will get $1.2 billion,\n\n[[Page S4232]]\n\nwhile Alzheimer's and other dementias will receive a fraction of that, \nat $586 million. Simply put, it is imperative we provide NIH with \nrobust and sustained funding, which will allow it to support \nAlzheimer's research that is so desperately needed.\n  Let me make it clear. I strongly support the research dollars going \ninto cancer and would like to see more funds put into it. I strongly \nsupport the amount of funds we are putting into heart disease and would \nlike to see more funds put in. I know there is bipartisan support in \nthis Congress to increase the pie that NIH has--the funds NIH has--\nbecause we understand it advances the humanitarian need in our country \nto find the answers to cures for diseases but also creates good jobs. \nWe need to dramatically increase the amount of resources that we make \navailable for Alzheimer's research.\n  We must also support innovative, evidence-based models to address the \nneeds of those currently living with Alzheimer's disease and their \nfamily caregivers. I am proud to tell you about the Maximizing \nIndependence at Home--or MIND at Home Program--developed at Johns \nHopkins in my home State of Maryland.\n  In the MIND at Home Program, an interdisciplinary team provides home-\nbased assessments, care coordination and support to individuals with \nAlzheimer's disease and other dementias, allowing them to remain in \ntheir homes longer, improving their quality of life, and supporting \ntheir family caregivers.\n  During an 18-month pilot project, the MIND at Home Program helped \nparticipants stay safely in their homes for an average of 9\\1/2\\ months \nlonger than would have been otherwise possible, while also improving \ntheir quality of life.\n  We have an opportunity to improve the lives of millions of Americans \nsuffering from Alzheimer's, and the lives of their family members, by \nbuilding on the success of programs such as MIND at Home. This June, in \nhonor of National Alzheimer's and Brain Awareness Month, let us pledge \nto provide robust, sustained funding for NIH, so it can support much \nneeded research on this devastating disease, and let us pledge to \nsupport innovative programs such as MIND at Home to improve the quality \nof life of those currently living with Alzheimer's and their family \ncaregivers.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, today is my 103rd time coming to the \nfloor to ask my colleagues to wake up to the urgent problem of climate \nchange.\n  Pretty much everyone is telling us climate change is a problem. First \nof all, there are the scientists, virtually every major scientific \nsociety and agency. Then there are our military and national security \nleaders, leading American companies, doctors, and faith leaders who are \nall telling us this is a problem and asking us to wake up.\n  The American people understand climate change is real. Nearly 80 \npercent think that doing nothing to reduce future warming will cause a \nvery serious or somewhat serious problem for the United States. Two-\nthirds of Americans, including half of Republicans, favor government \naction to reduce global warming, and two-thirds, including half of \nRepublicans, would be more likely to vote for a candidate who campaigns \non fighting climate change.\n  I have visited with voters in early primary States, with people in \nIowa, in New Hampshire, and in South Carolina--business owners, \nteachers, community leaders, and elected officials. There will be no \navoiding this issue in the 2016 election.\n\n  So we might expect Republican Presidential hopefuls to present to the \nvoters their plans for climate action. We might expect the Republican \ncandidates to address this problem in an honest and straightforward \nmanner. But we would be wrong.\n  Republican Presidential candidates who venerate our military turn \ndeaf when that military warns of climate change's national security \ndangers. Republican Presidential candidates who are conspicuously \nreligious ignore Pope Francis and other religious leaders when they \nwarn of the fundamental indecency of not addressing climate change. \nRepublican Presidential candidates who seek to represent our corporate \nelite ignore those corporations' own business case for addressing \nclimate change. And Republican candidates who root boisterously for \ntheir home State university sport teams ignore the climate change \nwarnings of scientists and researchers at those very same universities. \nThe Republican Presidential primary is a festival of climate denial, \nwith candidates competing to tie themselves in knots to avoid \nacknowledging carbon pollution.\n  A few even subscribe to the big hoax theory. One candidate wrote in \nhis book that climate science is based on ``doctored data'' and that \n``it's all one contrived phony mess that is falling apart under its own \nweight.'' Another even claims to know who is behind the hoax. He said: \n``The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in \norder to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive.'' Wow, he got to the \nbottom of that. ``This very expensive global warming''--I will delete \nthe word since this is the Senate floor--``has got to stop. Our planet \nis freezing,'' the same candidate wrote last winter.\n  Then there is the ``who knows'' caucus. One Republican hopeful seems \nto think we don't really know one way or the other. ``We may be \nwarming, we may be cooling,'' he says. Another has said that people who \nare concerned about climate change ``don't like to look at the actual \nfacts and data.'' Now there is a really perverse piece of rhetoric, \nbecause what do the actual facts and data show? The data show that the \namount of carbon in the Earth's atmosphere has risen dramatically, \nsince the onset of the industrial revolution just over a century ago, \nto the highest levels mankind has ever experienced and the highest \nlevels Earth has experienced in at least 800,000 years. It is a fact of \nbasic science that carbon dioxide traps heat and alters the climate. \nThat has been known since the days of President Abraham Lincoln. The \ndata match and show decades of increase in global temperature. The \nscientists we pay to know these things say that warming of the climate \nis ``unequivocal.'' The ocean is warming. Sea levels are rising. Ocean \nwater is growing more acidic. We measure all of that. It is not theory. \nThose are the facts.\n  At least two candidates, by the way, have compared those who accept \nthe established science of climate change to people who believe the \nEarth is flat. That is particularly rich when we consider that NASA \nscientists are among the strongest and most articulate proponents of \nthe science of climate change. Do we really think that NASA scientists \nbelieve the world is flat? Do we think the scientists who launched a \nrover through space, landed it safely on the surface of Mars, and are \nnow driving it around are confused about the circular nature of the \nEarth?\n  Then there is the ``always changing'' crowd. One Republican \nPresidential hopeful says:\n\n       [T]he climate is changing. I don't think the science is \n     clear on what percentage is manmade. . . . And for the people \n     to say the science is decided on this is just really \n     arrogant.\n\n  Actually, it is just really factual.\n  ``[T]here's never been a moment where the climate is not changing,'' \nanother candidate observed. ``The question is: What percent of that is \n. . . due to human activity?''\n  Well, the links of climate change to human activity are something \nthat scientists have studied extraordinarily closely. According to the \nleading scientific body on climate change, the best estimate is that \npretty much all of the recent rise was due to human activity. The lead \nscientific organization says greenhouse gas emissions, along with human \nactivity, ``are extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of the \nobserved warming since the mid-20th century.'' And, by the way, \n``extremely likely'' is defined in that document as 95 to 100 percent \ncertainty.\n  So this gaggle of Republican Presidential hopefuls is willing to take \nthe ``worse than 1 in 20'' bet that human activity is not the dominant \ncause of recent climate change. Or, as another Republican candidate put \nit, ``the conclusions you make from that are not conclusive''--whatever \nthat means.\n\n[[Page S4233]]\n\n  Then, of course, there is this: ``I'm not a scientist.'' At least \nthree of the declared Republican candidates have used that line. \nImagine if Congress answered other policy questions that way. What is \nyour position on abortion? Oh, I am not a gynecologist. What should we \ndo about health care? Oh, I am not a medical doctor.\n  We are not expected to be experts. We are expected to listen to the \nexperts and to make conscientious, informed, and prudent decisions--\nand, oh, are we failing that test.\n  There are even Republican candidates for President who in this \nAmerican century would abdicate American leadership on the climate \ncrisis. ``Is there anything the United States can do about it?'' one of \nthe Republican candidates asked. ``Clearly, no''--reducing greenhouse \ngas emissions ``will have zero impact,'' he said, on climate change. \nAnother candidate said: ``A single nation acting alone can make no \ndifference at all.'' I would love to hear Winston Churchill and \nFranklin Roosevelt conversing about whether America can make a \ndifference.\n  Last week the senior Senator from Oklahoma, whose skepticism about \nclimate change is well documented, was the keynote speaker at the \nclimate denial conference of a creepy outfit called the Heartland \nInstitute. Here is what he told them--and by the way, when I say \n``creepy,'' they are the group that put up a billboard comparing \nclimate scientists to the Unabomber--pretty responsible stuff. ``If you \nlook at the Republican candidates,'' he assured the attendees at that \nforum, ``they're all denying this stuff, with the exception of Lindsey \nGraham. . . . They're all with the people in this room''--quite a room \nto want to be with.\n  I am glad that our colleague from South Carolina, Senator Graham, has \ncalled for reducing carbon pollution with smart probusiness policies. \nHe has lit a path for other Republican colleagues to follow, and he is \nnot the only one on this path. Prominent conservative thinkers and \nformer administration officials from Nixon, Reagan, and both Bush \nadministrations have voiced support for putting a fee on carbon \nemissions. Prominent conservatives and libertarians think that we can \nput a price on carbon, relieve taxes on profits and work, and come out \neconomically for the better. Even setting aside the environmental and \nclimate benefit, just economically, that is a win.\n  So I offered a carbon fee bill last week with our colleague Senator \nSchatz, what one conservative called an ``olive limb''--doing better \nthan just an olive branch--to conservatives who are ready to address \nthis problem.\n  So Lindsey Graham has articulated one path. There is a different, \ndarker path. It is the path of obedience to fossil fuel interests. The \nfossil fuel companies, their super PAC allies, and their front groups \nswing a heavy financial club, and they want to herd Republican \ncandidates down the darker path. Americans for Prosperity, part of the \nKoch brothers-backed political machine, plans on spending $900 million \nin the 2016 election cycle--$900 million. Its president, Tim Phillips, \nthreatened publicly that any Republican candidate in the 2016 \nPresidential campaign who supported climate action ``would be at a \nsevere disadvantage in the Republican nomination process.'' Gee, what \nmight candidates conclude from that? And that is just one part of the \nfossil fuel political machine.\n  So I ask myself: Why are there all of those preposterous statements \nby the Republican Presidential candidates? The only conclusion I can \nreach is to signal that very obedience. We are now at the stage in the \nRepublican Presidential primary where candidates caper and grovel \nbefore the fossil fuel industry's political machine, hoping they will \nbe the chosen beneficiaries of fossil fuel election spending. Remember \nthat there is $900 million from just one group. It looks like that \nearns the industry a lot of groveling and capering.\n  Eventually, the Republican Party is going to have to find its true \nvoice on climate change. It can't continue indefinitely as the \npolitical arm of the fossil fuel industry in an environment in which 80 \npercent of Americans want climate action and a majority of young \nRepublicans think that climate denial is ignorant, out of touch or \ncrazy, according to the words they selected in the poll. Ultimately, \nthe Republican Party is going to have to find its true voice. Until \nthen, America is presented the unseemly spectacle of Republican \nPresidential candidates fighting to have the best position on climate \nchange that money can buy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Nuclear Agreement With Iran\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I come to the floor again to speak about \nIran as we count down to the deadline for an agreement about Iran's \nillusiveness when it comes to the military dimensions of their program \nand how they respond to that in any agreement. The truth, as it has \nalways been, is illusive, and it remains so.\n  Yesterday, Secretary of State Kerry said--in response to a question \nabout whether Iran's atomic work by the Iranian military would have to \nbe resolved before sanctions would be lifted--that we are not fixated \non Iran specifically accounting for what they did at one point or \nanother. What we are concerned about is going forward.\n  Given Iran's history of deception, I am very concerned about what \nthey did ``at one point or another.''\n  In an Iran task force memo on verification, it says that ``until Iran \nprovides a full accounting of its past and present possible military \ndimension activities, the international community cannot have \nconfidence that it knows either how far Iran is along the path to \nnuclear weapons or that Iran's nuclear weapons activities have \neffectively ceased.''\n  David Albright--who has appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee and whom I called many times when I was the chairman and \nstill do--is the founder of the Institute for Science and International \nSecurity. Mr. Albright said the Secretary's remarks were ``very \nworrisome.'' He said that they reflect what he sees as the \nadministration's long practice of offering concessions to Iran. He \nsaid: ``Whenever confronted with Iranian intransigence. . . . It's \ngoing to be hard for a lot of people to support this deal if they give \nin on past military dimensions.''\n  He also said:\n\n       Addressing the International Atomic Energy Administration's \n     concerns about the military dimensions of Iran's nuclear \n     programs is fundamental to any long-term agreement. . . . An \n     agreement that sidesteps the military issues would risk being \n     unverifiable. Moreover, the world would not be so concerned \n     if Iran had never conducted weaponization activities aimed at \n     building a nuclear weapon.\n\n  Speaking of the possible military dimensions of Iran's program, the \nformer Deputy Director General of the International Atomic Energy \nAdministration, Olli Heinonen, said:\n\n       Without addressing those questions . . . the IAEA \n     Secretariat will not be able to come to a conclusion that all \n     nuclear material in Iran is in peaceful use, which is \n     essential in building confidence of the international \n     community over Iran's nuclear program. A comprehensive deal--\n     that would include uranium enrichment--can only be reached if \n     uncertainties over Iran's military nuclear capability are \n     credibly addressed. . . . That should be an unambiguous \n     condition to achieving a final accord that is meaningful in \n     safeguards terms.\n\n  Now, this is the former Deputy Director General of the International \nAtomic Energy Administration, whom we hear overwhelmingly under the \nproposed agreements saying this is the entity that will be responsible \nfor the verification of any potential agreement.\n  Well, his experience says that without understanding the \nweaponization elements of Iran's program, you can't fully be able to do \nthat. He also warned that outsiders really can have no idea where and \nhow fast the mullahs could build a nuclear weapon unless they know what \nIranian engineers have done in the past.\n  As to Secretary Kerry's assertion yesterday that we know what their \nprogram was--and he said it, as I read it, almost as unequivocal that \nwe know what their program was. Well, I get\n\n[[Page S4234]]\n\nconcerned when I read the former Director of the CIA, Gen. Michael \nHayden, who has said not addressing the possible military dimensions \n``creates an increased burden on verification if I don't have high \nconfidence in where the Iranians actually are, not such as fissile \nmaterial development, but in their weaponization program. . . . we do \nhave intelligence estimates, but they remain estimates.''\n  They remain estimates.\n\n       [F]or a country that says ``that's not our objective,'' \n     they refuse to come clean on their past. . . . How can we \n     know their intent, how can we know their capacity for \n     breakout or sneak out, without high confidence in where it is \n     they are right now?\n\n  He also said in reference to Secretary Kerry's remarks:\n\n       I'd like to see the DNI or any intelligence office repeat \n     that word for me. They won't. What he is saying is that we \n     don't care how far they've gotten with weaponization. We're \n     betting the farm on our ability to limit the production of \n     fissile material. He's pretending we have perfect knowledge \n     about something that was an incredibly tough intelligence \n     target while I was director and I see nothing that has made \n     it any easier.\n\n  This is the former Director of the CIA, supposedly where we have all \nof this knowledge. This is his expression of what we have or don't \nhave. Clearly, basically what he is saying is we have estimates, but \nthey are just that, estimates.\n  I am very concerned when the Secretary of State says that we are \nprepared to ease sanctions on Iran without fully understanding how far \nIran progressed on its secret nuclear weapons program. It has been a \nfundamental question from the very beginning of these negotiations. It \nwas made very clear in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee and other venues where Members asked about would Iran have to \ncome clean on its possible dimensions of its militarization of its \nweapons program and would that have to be upfront. That was always an \nunderstanding, almost like a red line. Now that seems to be erased.\n  It has been a fundamental question to which we need--not just want--a \nfull and verifiable answer. This is not just about Iran making some \nadmission. That is beyond. I think the world has acted the way it has \nacted with the sanctions from the U.N. Security Council and elsewhere \nbecause it knows Iran was pursuing weaponization of its nuclear \nprogram. It is just that we don't know how far they got in that \nprocess, and how far they got in that process is important to know as \nwe are determining the other elements of any agreement, particularly \nwith breakout. That has been the case as long as I have been working to \nprevent Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons state.\n  Now, the Secretary of State says we are prepared to ease economic \nsanctions without a full and comprehensive answer to that question. He \nsays Iran's past suspected nuclear activities need to be ``addressed.'' \nThat is all, simply addressed--not specifically answered but only \naddressed. According to the New York Times article that I read, he made \nit clear that sanctions could be lifted--they could be lifted--before \ndefinitively resolving concerns of the International Atomic Energy \nAgency about Iran's past nuclear research and the extent of the \nmilitary dimensions of that research.\n  That is simply unacceptable, in my view, and it should be \nunacceptable to everyone in this Chamber.\n  You know, the New York Times article goes on to say:\n\n       Those favoring full disclosure of what diplomats have \n     delicately called the ``possible military dimensions'' of \n     Iranian nuclear research say that the West will never know \n     how long it would take Iran to manufacture a weapon--if it \n     ever developed or obtained bomb-grade uranium or plutonium--\n     unless there is a full picture of its success in suspected \n     experiments to design the detonation systems for a weapon and \n     learn how to shrink it to fit atop a missile.\n\n  That is exactly what I believe, and I came to the floor recently and \nhad a map that described where the possible reach of Iran's present \nmissile technology exists, and it is most of the gulf, into parts of \nEastern Europe, Turkey, Egypt, and of course our ally, the State of \nIsrael. So its reach today, under missile capacity--and something they \ncontinue to perfect--is incredibly significant.\n  For a decade since obtaining data from an Iranian scientist from a \nlaptop that was spirited out of the country, the CIA and Israel have \ndevoted enormous energy to understanding the scope and success of the \nprogram.\n\n       Failing to require disclosure, they argue, would also \n     undercut the atomic agency--a quiet signal to other countries \n     that they, too, could be given a pass.\n\n  That is quoted from the Times article. Those are exactly my \ncontinuing concerns, and I think they are concerns of a very large \nuniverse of people who have been following these developments. I need \nto know the answer to those questions before I can support any lifting \nof sanctions against Iran that I have fought for, authored, and that \nthis Senate has unanimously supported.\n  So I am going to conclude, but I will be back to point out the \nunfolding problems with dealing with the mullahs in Tehran and what it \nmeans to the national security of the United States and to our allies \nin the Middle East and to the stability of the region and to what I am \nincreasingly concerned is the moving of goal posts that move \nincreasingly in the direction of Iran.\n  I remember when we started off this conversation--these \nnegotiations--Iraq's plutonium reactor, we were told they will \ndismantle it or we will destroy it. Well, this agreement allows Iraq to \ncontinue--reconfigured somewhat, but it can be reconfigured back. The \nPresident himself has said there was no need for Fordow, built deeply \nunder a mountain, an enrichment facility.\n  Now, if you want a peaceful nuclear civilian program, you don't go \ndeep into a mountain to ultimately do enrichment, but that is what the \nIranians did. The President himself said that was an unnecessary \nfacility. We were told it was going to be closed. Well, it is going to \nstay open--reconfigured to produce less uranium and supposedly with \nsafeguards, but it is going to stay open. The point is, with regard to \nthe weaponization elements, Iran has for a decade--a decade--worked \nagainst the U.N. Security Council resolution that said it had to come \nclean on this question. So for a decade they haven't done it.\n  When you have the leverage, why wouldn't you seek to achieve it now, \nso you know and can calculate the rest of your agreement? That, too, \nseems to be lost in the shifting sands of these negotiations. This is \nof deep concern to me, and I can only hope we will end up at a better \ndeal than that which is being unfolded as we speak.\n  Every time I listen to another element of what I thought was a \ncritical element of any deal, that critical element seems to be oddly \nmoving in the direction of what Iran wants it to be and not what we in \nthe international community should want to see. That is my concern, and \nI will continue to come to the floor to report on it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, the facts are undeniable. Climate change \nis real. It is caused by humans. It is happening now and it is \nsolvable.\n  One solution to climate change is putting a fair price on carbon \npollution. Last week, Senator Whitehouse and I introduced a bill, S. \n1548, to do just that and to return all of the revenue to American \nfamilies and businesses.\n  I thank Senator Whitehouse for his leadership on this bill, but we \nwant a Republican dance partner. We want conservative leadership on \nthis great challenge of our time.\n  Climate change increases the severity and frequency of storms and \nnatural disasters. This is not only a humanitarian problem but also an \neconomic issue. A heat wave in Texas in 2011, for example, caused $5 \nbillion in livestock and crop losses. Climate change makes events like \nthis 20 times more likely to occur today than in the\n\n[[Page S4235]]\n\n1960s. Climate change's impact on the economy is particularly damaging \nbecause it creates so much uncertainty.\n  There is a role for the government here. The administration is doing \neverything it can to reduce carbon pollution within the statutory \nconstraints of the Clean Air Act, but it will not get us to the \nreductions we need. Congress needs to step in and legislate to get the \nreductions we need to make sure we are protecting low-income and \nworking families and growing our economy.\n  Regulations like the Clean Power Plan and market mechanisms such as a \nprice on carbon are not mutually exclusive; in fact, they work \ntogether. They are mutually reinforcing. If powerplants reduce \nemissions under the Clean Power Plan, they will pay less in carbon \nfees. Market mechanisms for reducing pollution work.\n  In the 1990s, President George H.W. Bush used cap and trade to reduce \nemissions from sulfur dioxide in order to combat acid rain. The program \nwas successful in slashing emissions, which not only meant healthier \nlakes and waterways but healthier communities. The health benefits for \nhumans linked to lower sulfur dioxide emissions were estimated at $50 \nbillion annually by 2010.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Yes, I will be pleased to yield to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator, and I welcome his remarks. We are in \na space in the Senate where there are some people who still say climate \nchange isn't happening, even though, as the Senator and I know, 98, 99 \npercent of the scientists in this country say it is obvious.\n  I am also so pleased my friend is here today because he is talking \nabout cap and trade, and that leads us into my question. I will ask two \nquestions.\n  One question I have for the Senator from Hawaii is how he feels about \nthe Pope and the encyclical, where the Pope is basically stating it the \nway it is, and it needs to be heard by everyone. I wonder how my friend \nresponded to that. Also, I wanted to make sure my friend knew in \nCalifornia we have a cap-and-trade program, and I thought it was so \ngood that you reminded people that this was a creation by a Republican \nPresident dealing with acid rain and it was so successful and the \npublic health benefits so outweighed the costs.\n  So I wanted to make sure my friend was aware we had this cap-and-\ntrade system in California that is working well. We balanced our budget \nin large part because of this, and businesses like it. They liked the \ncertainty of it. Also, will the Senator respond to the issue of the \nPope entering into this debate.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I thank the Senator from California.\n  Through the Chair, I will answer the first question.\n  First, when it comes to the Pope's encyclical, it seems to me that he \nis displaying the moral leadership that is going to be necessary in all \nsectors--in the private sector, in the public sector, among Democrats, \nRepublicans, Independents. People across the planet are starting to \nunderstand the magnitude of the climate challenge.\n  One of the reasons I have been coming to the floor so frequently is \nnot to lambaste the other party, but rather to encourage that there be \nconservative leadership in this space. There is certainly progressive \nleadership in this space. There is increasingly corporate leadership. \nThere is leadership in the Department of Defense, in the scientific \ncommunity. But what we really need is for conservatives to step up and \nto acknowledge the reality of this problem and propose their own set of \nsolutions.\n  They may disagree with a carbon fee or a cap-and-trade program or the \nPresident's Clean Power Plan. But let's have that debate out in the \nopen. Come down and beat up on our bill or beat up on the President's \nproposal. That is fine. But we need to have this great debate in this \ngreat Chamber because this is one of the greatest challenges of our \ntime.\n  To the Senator's second question, talking a little bit about how cap \nand trade has worked in California but also how market-based mechanisms \nhave worked all over North America and across the planet, the Senator \nis right. There is a cap-and-trade program in California, and the \neconomy has continued to improve. The State's fiscal situation has \ncontinued to improve.\n  We have the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative. We have tripled clean \nenergy in a very short period of time, all while unemployment has gone \ndown. In 2008, British Columbia became the first and only jurisdiction \nin North America with an economy-wide price on carbon emissions. Seven \nyears later, evidence shows that even going it alone, British Columbia \nwas able to reduce petroleum consumption more than the rest of Canada \nand without any negative impact on growth.\n  So the Senator from California is right. We can do this and grow our \neconomy. But we are going to need bipartisan leadership. Market \nmechanisms are one of the most straightforward solutions to climate \nchange. They have growing support across the ideological spectrum. The \ncarbon fee in our bill is predictable. It can start right away. There \nis no new government program to administer or to run and no need for \ncomplex financial transactions or trading.\n  It is simple and relatively easy to administer, and it gets the \nreductions that we need: an estimated 40 percent of greenhouse gas \nemissions by the year 2030. The bill, importantly, is revenue neutral. \nThe original carbon fee legislation poured back the new revenue into a \nbunch of goodies that I liked in terms of dealing with the challenge of \nclimate change. But we understand that if we are going to get \nRepublican support, this needs to be revenue neutral or close to it, \nand we need to use the revenue to ameliorate the challenges that are \ngoing to occur as we transition into a clean energy economy.\n  It also lowers corporate tax rates, which will make our Tax Code more \ncompetitive with other countries. But reducing carbon emissions and \ngrowing our economy ought to go hand in hand. This bill lays out a \nclear framework for how to accomplish that. Climate change demands \nleadership from both progressives and conservatives. A price on carbon \nis a market-based solution that can appeal to people of multiple \nideologies but share a common goal of solving one of the great \nchallenges of our time.\n  In the tradition of Margaret Thatcher and Barry Goldwater, we need \nconservatives to embrace their own market-based solutions to our \nclimate challenge. There is nothing conservative about ignoring the \ncollective knowledge of the scientific establishment. There is nothing \nconservative about ignoring the warnings from our Department of \nDefense. There is nothing conservative about shirking our \nresponsibility for global leadership. There is nothing conservative \nabout conducting a dangerous experiment on the only planet that we \nhave.\n  So we have no desire for this to continue to be an issue where only \none party is on the floor talking about it. Let's have the argument \nabout what the right solution set ought to be. But let's have it out in \nthe open, and let's have it together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                             EPA Water Rule\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, the EPA recently released its final water \nrule, claiming much greater power for the administration to oversee the \nland use decisions of homeowners, small businesses, and family farms \nthroughout our country. This mandate is full of problems, and the \nAmerican people are being sold a false bill of goods.\n  Just look at the potential impact to my home State of Arkansas. As \nyou can see, the entire State will come under this jurisdiction. The \nred on this map, compiled by Agriculture's Waters of the United States \nMapping Initiative, highlights the extent to which this EPA rule would \nimpact Arkansas. As you can see, the Obama administration wants to give \nbureaucrats in Washington control of almost all of the water in \nArkansas. They are deceiving the American people in order to justify \nthis power grab. First, they imply that unless Washington is in \ncontrol, water is simply not protected.\n  This is not true. Clean water protection involves our local \ncommunities. Private land owners, conservation districts, States, and \nlocal communities protect non-Federal waters all of the time. Second, \nthe Agency claims this rule is designed to protect drinking water.\n\n[[Page S4236]]\n\n  Again, this is an attempt to scare the American people. It is \ndishonest.\n  We all want to protect our water resources, and clean drinking water \nis certainly a priority. I support the Safe Drinking Water Act. For \nmore than 40 years the Safe Drinking Water Act has encouraged Federal-\nState cooperation in improving safe drinking water. That work has made \ntremendous progress, which we can all be proud of. This law has been \nstrongly supported by both Republicans and Democrats. It has been \nreauthorized and extended by Republican-controlled Congresses, and it \nwill continue to improve safe drinking water whether or not this \nFederal power grab continues.\n  This administration says one thing about safe drinking water, and \nthen it does another. For example, in 2013 and 2014, the Obama \nadministration cut funding for the Safe Drinking Water Grant Program. \nThis program, which is a Federal-State partnership, does far more to \nprotect safe drinking water than anything in the EPA's new power grab.\n  Third, we hear rhetoric about rivers catching on fire and toxic \npollution. Once again, this is an attempt to scare the American people. \nMajor rivers will continue to receive Federal and State protection just \nas they have for decades. Isolated non-navigable waters will continue \nto be protected by State and local efforts as they are now. Let's not \nforget that farmers and landowners care about clean water.\n  Northeast Arkansas farmer Joe Christian told the Jonesboro Sun after \nthe EPA finalized the rule: I am not going to do something detrimental \nto the land I work and live on.\n  There is no greater environmentalist than a farmer. For the past \nyear, Arkansas farmers and ranchers have shared with me their concerns \nover this EPA overreach. I want to share some of the comments that I \nrecently received. Fred in Trumann wrote:\n\n       Like every other person in America, I favor clean water. \n     However, there appears to be a grab for power or control \n     related to water. I fail to see how a low spot in a field or \n     yard or ditch that I create on my own land should be \n     included. We are being over-regulated by Washington--please \n     continue to limit intrusion into our lives where none is \n     needed.\n\n  Rodney in Lonsdale sent me an email saying:\n\n       The EPA doesn't need to be monitoring my pond and streams, \n     telling me what to do or how to use them. This is an \n     overreach.\n\n  These frustrations are the result of an agency that often abuses its \nauthority, creating unnecessary and costly mandates. It is not just \nArkansans. Across the country, people are sounding the alarm on this \npower grab.\n  ``Extreme'' and ``unlawful'' are two words the American Farm Bureau \nused to describe the rule. An analysis of the finalized rule by the \norganization determined that the ambiguity of the rule will give the \nAgency ``broad discretion to identify waters and to limit the scope of \nmost of the exclusions.'' The good news is that we have a bipartisan \nagreement that this EPA rule is a problem.\n  After EPA finalized this rule, the Wall Street Journal published an \neditorial calling this rule by EPA an ``amphibious attack'' and urged \nCongress to overturn the rule and force ``Members to show whose side \nthey're on--the average landowners or the Washington water police.''\n  That is why I joined the Senate's efforts to protect property owners \nand keep Washington's hands off of private lands. The Federal Water \nQuality Protection Act safeguards Americans from this overreach. It \nsends EPA back to the drawing board to craft a proposal that encourages \ntrue cooperation. It will keep the hands of Washington's politicians \nout of the decisions that have been made in the States and local \ncommunities for generations.\n  Under this modest, bipartisan legislation, the EPA will be able to \nprotect Federal waters without expanding its power. I appreciate \nSenator Barrasso, the bill's author, for his continued leadership in \nholding EPA accountable. Last week, my colleagues and I who serve on \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee moved this legislation \nforward. This is a step in the right direction to protecting the rights \nof landowners while protecting our Nation's waters.\n  I look forward to supporting this commonsense legislation on the \nSenate floor and encouraging my colleagues to do the same. Congress \nmust build on the progress that we have made toward better water \nquality. We can do this best by protecting the role of States, local \ncommunities, and private citizens to be a part of the process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                     Transition to Independence Act\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a bill I will be \nintroducing, the Transition to Independence Act.\n  The bill is a Medicaid demonstration program that will give \nincentives to States to achieve more integrated employment for people \nwith disabilities.\n  The Federal Government funds a hodge podge of programs that provide \nsupports for people with disabilities.\n  However, the largest of all programs providing supports for people \nwith disabilities, the Medicaid program, could do much more to drive \nbetter outcomes.\n  The Medicaid program provides critical supports for people with \ndisabilities including primary health care and home and community-based \ncare.\n  This bill is unique in that it uses the resources of the Medicaid \nprogram to drive better outcomes for people with disabilities.\n  Our public policy encourages people with disabilities to participate \nin society, to live in the community and to have integrated employment.\n  But what does the government do to encourage that outcome?\n  What does government do to insure that all people with disabilities \nhave the opportunity to achieve their maximum participation?\n  I would argue, not enough.\n  The program that is the largest funder of supports for people with \ndisabilities is Medicaid.\n  Unfortunately, Medicaid funding to States is in no way tied to \nproducing better outcomes.\n  Now I know we cannot just snap our fingers and make it so.\n  The Federal Government cannot just order the States to do better.\n  The Federal Government needs to provide States the right incentives \nto achieve better outcomes.\n  That is the goal of the Transition to Independence Act.\n  This bill creates a 5-year, 10-State Medicaid demonstration program.\n  States participating in the demonstration program will receive \nMedicaid bonus payments for meeting achievement targets for individual \nintegrated employment.\n  Simply stated, as States move people with disabilities to integrated \nsettings, they get more money.\n  States can also achieve additional funding for agreeing to give up \nnew congregate placements.\n  States can achieve additional funding for ending vocation \nrehabilitation for congregate settings.\n  States can achieve additional funding for taking actions that will \ngrow the workforce serving people with disabilities.\n  Finally, States can achieve additional funding for taking steps to \nimprove interagency collaboration.\n  Too much of disability policy occurs in isolated silos where people \nin charge of policy don't talk to each other.\n  There is health services, long-term supports, housing, education and \nworkforce training, and transportation available to people with \ndisabilities all run by people who aren't working together to maximize \nthe outcome for the individual.\n  Now it is legitimate to ask: why can't States take these policy steps \ntoday?\n  They can take some actions of course.\n  But they have a significant financial incentive not to take these \nactions.\n  It will take a significant investment of resources for a State to \nachieve better outcomes for people with disabilities.\n  If a State wants to improve outcomes, it needs to invest in providing \nthe supports necessary to help people with disabilities participate \nmore fully in the community.\n  In the end, moving people with disabilities from more expensive \ncongregate settings to more self-sufficient, integrated settings is \nbetter for the individual and ultimately better for the taxpayer \nbecause it will require less intensive, less expensive supports.\n  But under Medicaid, when a State makes that investment, it has to \ngive\n\n[[Page S4237]]\n\nhalf or more of the savings achieved back to the Federal Government.\n  Again, that is a serious disincentive for the States.\n  Basically, the bonuses I am proposing in this bill allow the States \nto keep the savings they achieve.\n  It is my intention that this bill be essentially budget neutral to \nthe Federal taxpayer while giving States a real incentive to achieve \nbetter outcomes.\n  We can build better supports for people with disabilities.\n  The term often used is a ``lifespan benefit.''\n  I believe that creation of a lifespan benefit, where people with \ndisabilities receive coordinated, multidisciplinary support to achieve \nthe maximum functional outcomes possible begins with the Medicaid \nprogram.\n  It is my intention to prove that through this demonstration bill.\n  I have talked to scores of people with disabilities and their \nfamilies and they want to work a real job that pays a fair wage.\n  Agencies that provide these services are committed to helping them \nfind real jobs.\n  It is time to change Medicaid incentives to encourage and reward \nthat.\n  Last week, a constituent of mine from Dubuque, Rose Carroll, visited \nmy office with the Autistic Self Advocacy Network.\n  Rose is currently in college working on a degree in math.\n  All Rose wants is to know that she will have the supports available \nto her when she needs them so that she can do all she can to \nparticipate in her community.\n  That is exactly what this bill intends to do.\n  It will demonstrate that States, when given the right incentives, \nwill do all they can to make sure Rose has those supports.\n  Back home, my friend Chris Sparks is the Executive Director of \nExceptional Persons Incorporated in Waterloo, IA.\n  Chris and his staff go out into the community every day to provide \ndirect support services for people with disabilities.\n  These workers provide a necessary service in order to assist people \nwith significant intellectual and developmental disabilities to have \njobs in their community.\n  But it is a struggle every day for Chris to find workers, to train \nthem and retain them.\n  This bill will provide States the incentives to grow the workforce to \nmake it easier for people like Chris Sparks to go out and provide \nservices that allow individuals with disabilities to achieve \nindependence.\n  The bill I introduce today has the support of the American \nAssociation of People with Disabilities, the American Association on \nHealth and Disability, Autism Speaks, the Autistic Self Advocacy \nNetwork, the Muscular Dystrophy Association, the National Adult Day \nServices Association, the National Association of State Directors of \nDevelopmental Disabilities Services, the National Association of States \nUnited for Aging and Disabilities, and the National Down Syndrome \nCongress.\n  The bill also has the support of the American Network of Community \nOptions and Resources including Iowa members: Christian Opportunity \nCenter, Hope Haven, Opportunity Village, Hills & Dales, New Hope \nVillage, and Exceptional Persons Incorporated.\n  In their advisory role to Congress, the National Council on \nDisability provided technical assistance on the bill.\n  This is an opportunity for us to say that outcomes matter, for us to \nfurther a conversation about setting the goal of maximum participation \nand using all our tools to meet it.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues and others to move this \nlegislation forward in the months to come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, are we in the parliamentary procedure to \nproceed to speak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                  Papal Encyclical on the Environment\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, tomorrow, Pope Francis will release a \npapal encyclical on the environment. It is basically a letter to all \nCatholics about high-priority issues, and he has chosen the \nenvironment.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S4237, June 17, 2015, in the middle column, the \nfollowing language appears: The PRESIDING OFFICER. Mr. President, \ntomorrow, . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: Mr. NELSON. Mr. \nPresident, tomorrow, . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Some might think the Pope is straying outside of his expertise by \ndiscussing environmental issues and climate change as the expected \nencyclical is revealed, but the Pope actually has more of a scientific \nbackground than many Members of Congress because the Pope was trained \nas a chemist before he entered seminary. And, as we have seen over the \ncourse of his first 2 years as head of the Catholic Church, Pope \nFrancis is particularly committed to addressing issues that affect the \npoor.\n  According to recent news reports, the Pope's encyclical will \nemphasize the moral imperative that we as a global community face in \naddressing climate change. He calls every person across all faiths to \ncome together to address the global deterioration of our common home. \nThis stewardship case is a shared common truth for all people--the \nfaith community and all.\n  Many of us have spoken on this floor about climate change and the \nresulting sea level rise. The President has spoken about it numerous \ntimes recently, and he visited the Florida Everglades in my State \nrecently and made a similar case for the urgent need to take action on \nclimate change and sea level rise.\n  Taking care of treasured places such as the Everglades isn't just \nabout conservation, it is about survival.\n  Millions of people in South Florida depend on the Everglades as the \nsource, as that water flows south from upper central Florida and \nrecharges the aquifers. It is a vital source of drinking water. It is a \nvital source no one can live without. But drinking water wells in South \nFlorida are already being compromised by saltwater intrusion through \nthe porous limestone foundation of our State.\n  We had a hearing of our commerce committee in Miami Beach, which is \nground zero. A NASA scientist testified that over the last 40 years, \nmeasurements--not forecasts, not projections; measurements--over the \nlast 40 years, the sea level has risen 8 inches in South Florida.\n  What happens when that rises--and, of course, that starts to inundate \nthe porous limestone, which holds the freshwater, which supports the \nfoundation of the peninsula of Florida. You can't do as the Dutch have \ndone--build a dike around it--because the water will seep right \nunderneath your dike into the porous limestone.\n  So we need to take a hard look at what can be done--and do it soon--\nto get ready for the impacts of climate change in the future, to stop \npumping carbon dioxide, which is the main greenhouse gas, into the \natmosphere.\n  There are a lot of good ideas out there that could protect \ncommunities from climate change, and there are a lot of good ideas out \nthere that could help folks pay their bills. For example, my colleague \nfrom Rhode Island, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, has proposed a plan to \nplace a carbon fee or a dollar fee per ton of carbon emissions and then \nuse that money to lower everybody's tax rate, both corporate and \nindividual. Let it be revenue neutral. It is a fee on carbon, and the \nmarketplace will then kick in, making it less desirable to put those \ngreenhouse gases into the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide.\n  In the last Congress, Senator Boxer proposed a similar idea of \nsetting a carbon pollution fee. Her bill would have directed that new \nrevenue toward helping communities adopt climate resiliency measures as \nwell as providing a monthly rebate to U.S. households.\n  Well, maybe we don't have the magic formula yet, but we ought to be \nable to agree that lowering tax rates for businesses and individuals \nwould be a good thing. But if you are going to do that, you have to \nhave the revenue to pay for it. In other words, you have to have the \nrevenue to replace the revenue that is there now if you lower the tax \nrates.\n\n  If you set a price on carbon emissions, it could generate anywhere \nfrom $1 trillion to $2 trillion over a decade. That revenue can put \nmoney back into the pockets of hard-working people by virtue of \nlowering their tax rates.\n  Some people might think this is a political issue that Big Business \nis unanimously opposed to. When I first heard it, that is what I \nthought would be the case. But, lo and behold, that is not the case. On \nJune 1, six major oil and gas companies, including Shell, signed a \njoint letter to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\n\n[[Page S4238]]\n\nChange in support of establishing a carbon pricing system. What these \ngiant corporations understand is that something must be done to reduce \ncarbon emissions, and if they do not pursue a carbon fee or something \nlike it, they are going to face what they do not want to face, which is \nEPA regulation and lawsuits and additional public scrutiny over their \ncontribution to pollution.\n  In their letter, these CEOs write: ``As major companies from the oil \nand gas sector, we recognize both the importance of climate challenge \nand the importance of energy to human life and well-being.''\n  If these corporate giants can acknowledge the seriousness and urgency \nof climate change, then it just doesn't make sense that we can't get \nover this political hangup about a fee--call it a tax--on carbon and \naddress it here in the Senate.\n  Many of my colleagues are concerned and frustrated, especially if \nthey live in a State like mine where the sea level is rising. The mayor \nof Miami Beach cut a TV campaign advertisement in a kayak at seasonal \nhigh tide on Alton Road in Miami Beach. Is it any wonder we feel like \nthe canary in the coal mine? So we are sounding the alarm and echoing \nthe warning of scientists, echoing the warning of faith leaders--now \nthe Pope is going to speak tomorrow in his encyclical--and we are \nechoing the warnings of Americans who are already experiencing real \nconsequences of what is happening with the climate. The State of \nFlorida is the literal canary in the coal mine. The State of Florida is \nground zero for all of this that is happening.\n  This year is going to mark 10 years since Hurricane Katrina, and just \nlast month experts at CBO estimated that with climate change, hurricane \ndamage will skyrocket over the next 60 years. Why? Because as the Earth \nheats up--when the Sun rays reflect off the Earth and reflect back into \nspace, if the greenhouse gases are there, they act as a shield, and \nthat traps the heat. Where does 90 percent of the heat go? It goes into \nthe world's oceans. The hotter the water, the more fuel for a more \nferocious hurricane. Floods, droughts, heat waves, sea level rise, \nwildfires, melting sea ice--these are costly and deadly consequences.\n  Regardless of what it takes--the science, the economics, the \ncorporate executives, the moral imperative, and the Pope--we must call \nattention to the problem. Let's not suffer the same fate as other \ncanaries in the coal mines. I encourage all of our colleagues to look \nat this issue anew. Look at it with an eye toward confronting the \nchallenge and being good stewards of Earth's bounty that we are all \nblessed to have.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to speak a few moments as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Congratulating the Golden State Warriors\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I have had three chances to say \ncongratulations to the San Francisco Giants when they won the World \nSeries over the last 5 years, and I didn't do it. Last night, the \nGolden State Warriors won the NBA Finals, and I want to remedy the \nerror of my ways and come and offer the heartiest congratulations to a \ntruly great basketball team.\n  This team had a remarkable season. Their regular season of 67 and 15 \nwas the sixth best in the history of the NBA, and they went 16 and 5 in \nthe playoffs. But their dominance wasn't built on brute force; it was \nbuilt on finesse, strategy, and teamwork.\n  Steph Curry was a real superstar, offering flashes of brilliance all \nseason. I had the occasion to meet him and have a picture taken with \nhim, and as I stood against this tall American and put my arm around \nhis waist, I realized how slender he was. I subsequently learned they \nare trying to get him to eat 6,000 calories a day--I guess to meet \nLeBron James. It was quite a matchup, and I was delighted to be able to \nwatch these games. After a scary fall in game 4 against the Rockets, \nSteph came back in game 5 to lead the Warriors in scoring, boosting \nthem into the finals.\n  Last year, when I met them at a Warriors' practice, I saw a little \nbit about the team. And one player I hadn't met was a gentleman by the \nname of Andre Iguodala, who really came alive against the Cavaliers in \nthe finals. After playing off the bench the first three games, he \nstarted the final three and was the defensive spark the Warriors \nneeded.\n  Now, no one can stop LeBron James, and as I watched the series, I \nreally marveled at this man because he was a very intelligent player. \nOnce he charged toward that basket, there were very few who could stop \nhim. It was an amazing performance.\n  All season long, Klay Thompson was an offensive dynamo, stepping up \nwhen the team needed him most. And of course Draymond Green, Harrison \nBarnes, and others.\n  And what a season for a brand new rookie coach Steve Kerr. He spent \nhis whole life in basketball but has only a handful of months as coach \nunder his belt. He took an undersized team with little playoff \nexperience all the way. It was a dream come true.\n  I would also like to congratulate the Warriors owners, Joe Lacob and \nPeter Guber, as well as the team's president, Rick Weltz. I have had \nthe privilege of meeting these three people. Oakland can be very proud \nof them. They are building a new arena in San Francisco, so the whole \nBay Area will have an opportunity to participate in this team's glory. \nThese gentlemen bought the team 4 years ago. And in that short time, \nthey have guided what was a moribund franchise into the best team in \nthe league. So they rightly should be thanked for their accomplishment.\n  Finally, to my colleague, the distinguished Senator from Ohio, Rob \nPortman, I offer my condolences, and I look forward to collecting on \nour wager, which Mr. President, is some Ohio beer. I trust it is going \nto be good beer, and I look forward to drinking it and hopefully being \nable to tell him that there will be another time, and his team can only \nbut rise in glory as well.\n  Finally, to the Warriors, I look forward to continued greatness, both \nin Oakland and across the bay in San Francisco. Their first title since \n1975 really brought the city of Oakland together and made them proud. I \nsay to them, thank you for some wonderful memories.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the remarks of the Senator from Virginia, I be recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak about \nthe changing nature of our economy. I come to talk about a part of our \neconomy that I don't think most folks in this Chamber understand. It \ngoes by many names. It is called the sharing economy, the on-demand \neconomy, the gig economy, the 1099 economy. There is a lot of \ndiscussion, actually, in some circles about exactly what to call this \nchanging nature of our economy, but there is no dispute that it \nrepresents a new dynamic and growing part of our American economy.\n  It used to be that when you were introduced to someone, one of the \nfirst questions asked was, Where do you work? Today, particularly for \nthe 80-plus million millennials who make up the largest age cohort in \nour society, the more appropriate question to ask is, What are you \nworking on? That is because the American workforce is increasingly made \nup of freelancers, independent contractors, and the self-employed. Yet \nWashington mostly has remained on the sidelines as our economy, the \nworkforce, and the workplace have undergone what may be the most \ndramatic transformation literally in decades.\n\n[[Page S4239]]\n\n  By my count, as folks announced yesterday, almost 25 people are \nrunning for President in 2016. Frankly, I find it remarkable that none \nof them in either party are even talking about these fundamental \nchanges in how, when, and where Americans are currently working \nbecause, whether by economic necessity or by choice, one-third or more \nof the American workers now find themselves piecing together two, \nthree, or more on-demand opportunities to make a living. As I said \nearlier, it is called the sharing economy, the on-demand economy, or \nthe gig economy. It includes, as I mentioned earlier as well, a lot of \nyoung and--at least they think so--invincible millennials, 80 million-\nstrong, who began entering the workforce in the year 2000 and \nafterward.\n  The good news about this generation is it is the best educated, the \nmost diverse and tolerant, the most technologically adept, and the most \ncomfortable with disruptive change of any generation America has seen. \nAnd that is good. Most millennials grew up in the glow of a computer \nmonitor. Since childhood, most have maintained an online identity and \nnetwork in real time with friends. Members of this generation can, if \nthey choose, graduate from a college or university without ever \nstepping foot on its campus. Armed with a tablet or smart phone, they \ncan successfully work for an employer without ever sitting at a desk \nfrom 9 to 5. But it is not just the millennials who are pushing the \nenvelope in how, when, and where people work. It also includes many \nmiddle-aged professionals, unexpectedly downsized at midcareer. It \nincludes baby boomers--folks from my generation and a number of my \ncollege classmates--who have been hit with a premature end to what they \nthought before the recession was a solid career. Frankly, it also \nincludes a lot of folks for whom working multiple jobs at the same time \nis nothing new. They call it survival, and it hasn't gotten any easier. \nYet, here in Washington, too few policymakers are thinking creatively \nabout ways to provide more Americans with more footholds into this new \nworld of on-demand or freelance work.\n  In addition, today we have a whole set of new online platforms, \ncompanies that didn't even exist 5 years ago, such as Airbnb, Uber, \nTaskRabbit, and Etsy. Think about Airbnb alone--it already has more \nrooms available than Marriott. These platforms match supply and demand \nfor things people never even thought about monetizing before--a room, a \nride, a specific skill, even the whole notion of free time. But many of \nthe business models in this on-demand economy are built upon the \npremise that workers are independent contractors, not employees. This \nmeans that employers can end the relationship at any time. Much of the \nwork is project-based. Contracts and clients can dry up, and it is \ntougher to create new ones without an office to go to. It also means \nemployers do not have to pay costs or contribute to health insurance or \nretirement. They also particularly don't pay a share of unemployment or \nworkers' compensation.\n  The whole notion of the social safety net and social contract between \nthe employer and the worker has totally changed. If we think back to my \nparents' generation 40 years ago--I think about my father. He didn't \nmake a lot of money but knew that he would get benefits, that when he \nretired, he would get a pension. That changed in my generation, the \nbaby boomers. You didn't work for the same place. You moved around to a \nfew different jobs. We moved into what I would call the 401(k) \ngeneration, defined benefits. We moved to defined contribution.\n  The fact is, today these on-demand workers, even if they are doing \nrelatively well, exist on a high wire with no social safety net beneath \nthem. That may work for many of them when times are going well--until \nthe day they aren't. That is why ultimately, when things go wrong for \nthis new gig economy, workers without any safety net, without any \nunemployment, without any workmen's comp, could fall and ultimately end \nup on the taxpayers' dime.\n  That is why Washington needs to catch up and start asking some tough \npolicy questions--but also with the recognition that with the growth in \nthis part of the economy, Washington can't impose a solution.\n  First, the biggest challenge may be this fundamental change in the \nemployer-employee relationship. Are there other options for providing a \nsafety net of basic benefits for workers who are not connected to a \ntraditional full-time employer? Who should administer it? Should it be \nopt-in or opt-out? We could look to the health care exchanges as a \npublic-private model now--in many cases--that they largely appear to be \nworking. Could we think about an unemployment or workmen's comp \nexchange that workers and employers could work with?\n  We might borrow the idea of the hour bank used by the traditional \ntrade unions for 60 years. A carpenter would move from one contractor \nto another, committing a little bit of resources, the employer \ncommitting resources, but it was administered by a trusted third party.\n  Other countries--primarily in the EU--are experimenting with worker-\nadministered pools. Freelancers put in a certain amount of income based \non the income they would need to replace if they got sick or injured, \nand they collect it if they are sidelined for more than a month.\n  Part of a solution might even be consumer-driven. What if customers \ncould designate a portion of their payments to Uber or Airbnb into a \ndesignated fund that helps support workers--a social insurance fund? \nThere may be other public-private models out there, and they deserve a \nlook, too.\n  Second, this is too important to leave to the courts. While \nlitigation is underway about whether on-demand workers are independent \ncontractors or employees, we cannot and must not leave this to the \ncourts alone. We learned just today of a ruling from California labor \nregulators--a ruling that is expected to be challenged. California \nlabor regulators have determined that Uber drivers are to be considered \nemployees and not independent contractors. This ruling demonstrates yet \nagain why Federal policymakers need to reexamine the whole notion of \n20th-century definitions and employment classifications when we are \nthinking about a 21st-century workforce.\n  As I mentioned, as many as one-third of American workers are \nparticipating in some aspect of this on-demand economy. We have a \nresponsibility to provide clarity and predictability instead of \nallowing inconsistency as these issues are litigated on a case-by-case, \nState-by-State basis.\n  Third, the Federal Government needs to become much more nimble. \nFrankly, folks on both sides of the aisle would acknowledge that the \nFederal Government operates at less than dial-up speed. We need better \ndata about how many people are a part of the gig and sharing economies.\n  At the request of Senators Murray and Gillibrand, the GAO reported \nlast month that the Department of Labor has not been tasked with a \ndeep-dive on workforce data in more than 10 years. Better data would \ntell us a lot about who is working in this sharing economy and what \ncharacteristics they share. Better data would result in better policy.\n  As Federal policymakers, we also need to recommit to extending \nbroadband to underserved and unserved regions. You can't be linked in \nif you don't have a link.\n  In addition, we should streamline the hodgepodge of Federal programs \nwe have set up to support innovators and entrepreneurs. These programs \nare scattered across dozens of Federal agencies, and they exist in a \nbudgetary cycle of feast or famine.\n  We cannot ignore the opportunity costs of this generation's combined \n$1.2 trillion in student debt. It is limiting options, opportunities, \nand economic mobility for an entire generation.\n  Finally, this millennial generation is beginning to fuel a tremendous \nshift in one of the most traditional anchors of America's economy, and \nwe need to, quite honestly, recognize and respond to it. Younger \nAmericans are making it clear that in many cases they prefer sharing \nand renting over ownership.\n  I was talking to Brad Chesky, the CEO of Airbnb, the other day. As I \nmentioned, Airbnb already provides more rooms than Marriott, and this \nis a company that didn't even exist 5 years ago. The CEO offered this \ncomparison: His parents' generation--my generation--defined the idea of \nsuccess\n\n[[Page S4240]]\n\nin America as owning a nice house, having two cars, putting your kids \nthrough college, and maybe, just maybe, if you did well, getting a \nlittle house at the beach or on the lake. But he says the hallmarks of \nsuccess for this millennial generation are much more different. Younger \npeople want control of their data and online reputations. They don't \nnecessarily aspire to own things such as cars or houses; they want to \ncollect cool experiences, which they can best document and share \nonline.\n  I ask all my colleagues, the next time you are at a townhall, ask \nyour audience: Would you rather have a home mortgage deduction or a \ndirect credit against your student debt? It doesn't matter what the age \ngroup is, 90 percent overall will say: Give me that credit on my \nstudent debt rather than on a home mortgage deduction.\n  Think about this. As policymakers, this generational move away from \nownership and toward sharing and renting could have huge impacts for \nevery level of government. That is because we currently use our Tax \nCode to reward ownership of everything from homes, to vehicles, to \nfactories. Property taxes are how State and local governments pay for \npublic schools, public health, and public safety. If we have an economy \nincreasingly built on sharing and renting and not ownership, that could \nhave tremendous ramifications.\n  I mentioned that 5 years ago no one had even heard of Airbnb or Uber. \nAnd while we don't know what the disruptive technology of tomorrow \nmight look like, we know developments such as driverless cars, same-day \ndrone deliveries, and 3-D printing are right around the corner. Some \nversion is here to stay. As policymakers, we need to ask the right \nquestions, discuss the appropriate rules of the road, and know when we \nneed to get out of the way. Instead of trying to make this new economy \nlook like the old, Washington should encourage more of this innovation, \nand we need to work to create more opportunities and more upward \neconomic mobility for everybody.\n  I, for one, look forward to continuing this discussion today and in \nthe weeks to come.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1911, as Modified\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, \nnotwithstanding the filing deadline in rule XXII, it be in order for me \nto offer a modification to the pending Hatch amendment No. 1911 with \nthe text that is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I will \nnot object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am aware that the Senator from Oklahoma feels very \nstrongly about this amendment. We discussed it and voted on it in the \ncommittee. At that time, I told the Senator from Oklahoma--who is my \nfriend, for many years--that I would do what I could to see that he got \na vote before the entire Senate. I am in disagreement with his \namendment, but I want to respect his right to offer it. So--and I \nappreciate less than you know his tenacity--Mr. President, I will not \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To study the impact of commissary privatization prior to \ninitiating a pilot program and to require a report on the Department of \n    Defense definition of and policy regarding software sustainment)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___.

Mr. President, there is one last comment I wish to make. \nThis is something that doesn't happen on the Senate floor. But the \nSenator from Arizona is indeed a very good friend. We disagree on this \namendment. We will have a chance to have a vote on it. But the fact \nthat he did make a commitment that I would have the vote is very \nmeaningful to me, and he did keep his word, and I thank him very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Nuclear Agreement with Iran\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to inform the body that I had a \nvery good conversation with Secretary Kerry just a few minutes ago. \nMany of you may have been following the news. There was a statement \nattributed to Secretary Kerry that the possible military dimension of \nthe Iranian nuclear program was no longer a priority in terms of \nreconciling what they have been doing in a military fashion with their \nnuclear program. Some of the words were to the effect that there will \nbe no mea culpa required.\n  I just got off the phone with him, and he indicated to me that \npossible military dimensions of the program in terms of the Iranian \npast behavior are very much on the table and essential to any \nagreement.\n  April 8, 2015, here is what Secretary Kerry said. When asked in April \nif Iran must disclose past military-related nuclear activities as part \nof an agreement, Secretary Kerry said: They have to do it. It will be \ndone. If there is going to be a deal, it will be done.\n  Secretary Kerry reaffirmed to me that statement. I appreciate his \ncalling me. I want the body to understand that a good deal with Iran \nwould be a blessing. A bad deal would be a nightmare. The IAEA has not \nhad access to the sites they need in terms of evaluating the possible \nmilitary dimensions of the Iranian program and have not been allowed to \ngo to Parchin, where we suspect that high explosive detonation was \nbeing tested as part of their nuclear weapons ambition.\n  There are three things that the IAEA wants to look at before it can \npass judgment over how far the Iranian nuclear program has gone down \nthe military road. I can't imagine any deal that does not fully and \ncompletely answer every question about possible military dimensions of \nthe Iranian nuclear program, because if you don't understand what they \nhave done in the past, you don't know where you are in terms of going \nforward, and you can't have a meaningful inspection regime until you \nunderstand what they try to do in terms of our military dimension.\n  I really do appreciate Secretary Kerry calling me. The one thing we \nlearned about the Iranians and their nuclear program is that they \ncannot be trusted. They have lied, and they have cheated at every turn. \nThere can be no wiggle room when it comes to the Iranians and a nuclear \ndeal. Anytime, anywhere inspections are absolutely a must. \nUnderstanding their possible military dimensions is an absolute \ningredient along with others.\n  I am glad to have received this phone call from Secretary Kerry. But \nall of us need to be aware of whom we are dealing with when it comes to \nthe Iranians and get every i dotted and every t crossed before you \nwould even entertain a deal with the Iranians.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Absolutely.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is it my understanding from the Senator's statement that \nSecretary Kerry is now saying that was not an accurate quote of his----\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That it was not urgent that the previous activities \nconcerning the development of nuclear weapons would be absolutely \nrequired?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes. He indicated that the statement that was attributed \nto him was taken out of context, and he reaffirmed to me on the phone \nthat possible military dimensions are an essential part of the deal, as \nhe indicated on April 8, 2015. I think he is issuing a statement or his \noffice is right now. I think it is important for the body to understand \nthat Secretary Kerry wants to clear up the record. I applaud him for \nthat.\n  I hope we can get a deal we all can live with. But at the end of the \nday, you have to remember who we are dealing with in terms of the \nIranians. They have lied. They have cheated. When it comes to the \nmilitary dimensions of their program, it is essential we know every \ndetail before we can move forward with confidence.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I ask additionally this: Did the Senator from South \nCarolina have an opportunity to ask Secretary Kerry about the latest \ninformation concerning Iranians who are now supplying weapons to the \nTaliban--the same Taliban that has killed many hundreds of Americans \nand wounded thousands of others? In other words, did you have a chance \nto ask the Secretary why we are pursuing this agreement while the \nIranians' latest activity is supplying arms to the Taliban to kill \nAmericans; the support of the Shiite militias in Iraq; the support of \nthe Houthis in other countries, including Yemen; the support of the \nIranians for Hezbollah in Lebanon, which in Syria is killing off the \nFree Syrian Army forces that we are supporting; and the continued \ndevelopment by Iran of a nuclear warhead and the vehicle with which to \ndeliver it? I wonder if the Senator from South Carolina had the chance \nto ask the Secretary of State about those events and situations that \nexist in the Middle East today.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. No, I did not. We talked specifically about his \nstatements. But I understand the concern of the Senator from Arizona \nabout the idea of doing an agreement with the Iranians that would give \nthem money to fund what I think has been a very destructive war \nmachine.\n  From my point of view, we need to look at the Iranian behavior \nholistically and understand the consequences of flooding this \nadministration with cash--the Iranian administration with cash--given \nthe fact that what they are doing today is using whatever resources \nthey have under sanctions to destabilize the Mideast. I doubt if any \nadditional funds, if sanctions were relieved, would go to build\n\n[[Page S4242]]\n\nhospitals or roads. I think they would go into the activity you just \ndescribed. But this conversation was limited to the statement \nattributed to him yesterday. I think all of us should be very attuned \nto what is going on with these negotiations, as it is the most \nimportant decision any administration will make probably in modern \nhistory. The consequences of a bad deal are enormous. You could start a \nnuclear arms race in the Mideast. At the end of the day, the behavior \nof the Iranians, apart from their nuclear ambitions, is at best \ndisturbing and should be, in my view, part of any negotiating package.\n  But we are where we are, and I am glad to hear from the Secretary \nhimself that possible military dimensions have to be fully explored and \nunderstood before you move forward with an agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding Rule XXII, the time until 4 p.m. today be equally \ndivided between the managers or their designees; that at 4 p.m. all \npost-cloture time be expired; further, that if cloture is invoked on \nH.R. 1735, that the time count as if it was invoked at 10 p.m. tonight \nand that the mandatory quorum call with respect to this cloture motion \nbe waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nspeak for 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Tree Street Youth\n\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, today I come to the Senate floor with some \ngood news from my home State of Maine. World Refugee Day is this \nSaturday, and I would like to highlight an organization that sprung up \nspontaneously in one of our Maine cities that is really making a \ndifference in the lives of young people, particularly young refugees \nfrom Somalia, Sudan, and other African countries, helping them to \nexpand their own horizons.\n  As the roots of our refugee and immigrant population continue to grow \nstronger in Maine and in the process strengthen our communities, a \ngroup called Tree Street Youth is helping to nurture that growth one \nstudent at a time. I have visited the Tree Street Youth, and it is an \namazing program.\n  Maine's history, like the rest of America, is inexorably linked to \nimmigration. With the exception of our native tribes, we are all from \nsomewhere else originally. It began with European immigrants from \nEngland, Scotland, and Ireland. People with French heritage came down \nfrom Canada, and Swedes settled in northern Aroostook County in Maine. \nAfrican Americans were brought here against their will, but they became \npart of the stock of this country. For years, immigrants in Maine found \nwork in mills, farms, and fields, and now their descendants are our \nleaders--business leaders, political leaders, our neighbors, our \nfriends, and our family.\n  Just as previous waves of immigrants have come to Maine in search of \na better life for themselves and their children, newer immigrants--\nincluding refugees, asylees, and asylum seekers from Somalia, South \nSudan, and several central African countries--are making new homes in \nMaine and making Maine more diverse, more dynamic, and a better place \nin the process.\n  I think it is important to point out that these refugees are people \nwe have, in effect, invited to come to this country because the \nconditions in their former countries were so unstable or because they \nfeared persecution. These people are not illegal immigrants. They are \npeople, and they are not illegal aliens. They are people here under a \nlegal process. They are looking for a new start, and they are willing \nto work hard, as we learned in Maine. But anyone who finds themselves \nin an entirely new and unfamiliar situation--in a situation where they \nmay not be familiar with the language--can always use some help and \nsupport, and groups such as the Tree Street Youth in Lewiston are so \nimportant and can have such a huge impact because they smooth the \ntransition and help promote cooperation and understanding within the \ncommunity and particularly the transition of young people.\n\n  This remarkable organization was founded in 2011 by two former Bates \nCollege students located in the city of Lewiston--Julia Sleeper and Kim \nSullivan. They recognized the need for such a group--for such a \nfacility. Tree Street Youth is dedicated to supporting young people in \nthe Lewiston-Auburn area through academics, the arts, and athletics. \nThe organization, which originally grew out of a simple after-school \nhomework help program, now provides local youth with a safe space to \npromote healthy physical, social, emotional, and academic development.\n  Through its flourishing arts, college prep, and job-training \nprograms, Tree Street is not only giving young people the tools, \nsupport, and confidence they need to succeed, but it is also helping to \nbring all students from all backgrounds in the city of Lewiston \ntogether.\n  Tree Street Youth has proven to be a tremendous resource in Lewiston \nand Auburn, particularly for young people from immigrant families. The \nsupport services and sense of community that is provided there empowers \nthese young people to be independent and productive members of society. \nWhile integrating into the community can be difficult for recent \nimmigrants, refugees, and their families, the Tree Street experience \nhelps to connect young people to their peers and to the community as a \nwhole. This is a two-way street of understanding that helps bring our \ncommunities together.\n  For example, Tree Street Youth had an annual banquet this past May, \nand it was, I am told, a fun and emotional event and a showcase that \nallowed the Tree Street students to share some of their talents with \nthe Lewiston-Auburn community. I am told that after students gave a \nvariety of inspiring poetry readings, dance, and other performances \nabout their experiences, it was hard to find a dry eye in the house. \nThat really speaks to the life-changing power that this organization \nhas brought to our community.\n  Just as Tree Street Youth improves young lives, these young people \ncan in turn improve Maine and America. We need motivated, talented, and \ncreative people from all backgrounds if we are going to keep pace with \nthe rest of the world. We need students like Muna Muhammad, whom I met \nhere just a few weeks ago when she represented Maine in the Senate \nYouth Leadership Program. Muna, whose family is from Somalia, is the \npresident of her class at Lewiston High School, serves as a student \nrepresentative on the Lewiston school committee, is involved in her \nschool's speech, mock trial, and civil rights teams, and has a long \nlist of other accomplishments. They highlight her remarkable leadership \nqualities, which radiate when you meet her.\n  This is what America is all about. It is about families from around \nthe world finding a new start, bringing with them new perspectives, new \nideas, and new hope for the future. It is the mainspring of the \nAmerican experience. It is about a melting pot of peoples, cultures, \nand ideas that create a tapestry that is much stronger than any single \nthread.\n  Welcoming new people and cultures hasn't always been easy, and it is \nnot easy. Sometimes our differences are more immediately apparent than \nour similarities, but over the years, immigrants and refugees have \nproven to be an irreplaceable part--the essential part--of who America \nis.\n  This wonderful organization started spontaneously in one of our great \ncities of Maine. Tree Street Youth has proven that support and \ncommunity engagement can help ease that transition and\n\n[[Page S4243]]\n\ncreate a brighter future for those students, for Maine, and for our \nentire country. That is good news for Maine and good news for the \nUnited States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               PORTS Act\n\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the PORTS Act, \nlegislation I have introduced to protect the American economy from \ncrippling labor disputes at our seaports. Somebody asked why a Senator \nfrom Colorado was interested in legislation dealing with the work \nstoppage or slowdown that occurred on our ports on the west coast. \nWell, I will tell you why.\n  I was contacted by numerous businesses and people that had their \nentire furniture lines taken out of their furniture stores. I talked to \nranchers who had to face threats of a $1 billion ag export market. I \ntalked to onion growers who watched as their domestic commodity prices \ncrashed due to the port slowdown. I watched as stories were written in \nnewspapers about apple growers in Washington unable to export apples so \nthey dumped apples just to rot in the fields in Washington State.\n  Trade through U.S. seaports is critical. We have been spending weeks \non this floor and the floor of the House talking about the Trans-\nPacific Partnership and talking about the importance of trade promotion \nauthority, and none of that is possible without an active, successful \nport system in this country.\n  According to the American Association of Port Authorities, U.S. ports \nsupport 23 million jobs, and the value of related economic activity \naccounts for 26 percent of our national gross domestic product.\n  Contract negotiations and related labor disputes at our ports clog up \nthese vital arteries and lead to delays, higher costs, and lost \nbusiness for industries throughout our country. Strikes, lockouts, and \nslowdowns may have been business as usual for labor unions in the past, \nbut an increasingly global economy means that the collateral damage \ndone to American workers and businesses has increased exponentially.\n  The U.S. economy recently endured a 9-month labor dispute that \naffected all 29 of our west coast ports. The resulting logistical \nnightmare caused delays, higher costs, and lost businesses for \nindustries in Colorado and throughout the United States. Ships full of \ncargo were anchored off our coast waiting for longshoremen to do their \njob on unloading international goods and loading American-made products \nfor shipment to markets across the world. In Los Angeles and Long Beach \nalone, dozens of container ships sat anchored and idle.\n  After 9 months and huge financial costs to our national economy, the \nparties reached an agreement in February to allow cargo to begin moving \nnormally through the west coast ports again. Four months later, we are \nfinally seeing that congestion beginning to ease, but it has taken this \nlong.\n  Many economists, including the Federal Reserve Board of Governors \ncited the labor dispute as a primary cause of the 0.7-percent decline \nin GDP in the first quarter of 2015. That means 29 west coast ports \nwere primarily responsible for a 0.7-percent decline in GDP.\n  Agricultural exports, including apples, hay, and Christmas trees lost \nexport opportunities to overseas customers because they couldn't get \nproducts to market. Meat and poultry companies lost sales and faced \nport charges in excess of $30 million per week. Retail shipments were \ndelayed from reaching store shelves, and some stores resorted to \nexpensive air freight to stock goods. Manufacturers waiting on \nshipments had to shut down production lines and risked losing contracts \nwith foreign customers.\n  Colorado supplies Asia with over $500 million in beef products \nthrough the west coast ports, which accounts for about 23 percent of \nColorado's total exports and 57 percent of Colorado's international \nexports. These and other meat and poultry exporters saw many of their \nproducts spoil as shipments were turned away at the port gates.\n  Grain, machine parts, coal, fishing supplies, furniture, fresh \nproduce, and pliable metals are all products of Colorado, and all were \ndamaged by the labor dispute.\n  Our exporters' relationships with Asian customers disintegrated as \ntheir orders were caught in the bottleneck. And storefronts lost \ncustomers because products took months to reach show floors.\n  When Congress enacted Taft-Hartley nearly 70 years ago, Congress \ndecided the health and reputation of the greatest economy in the world \nshould not be used as leverage in labor contract negotiations.\n  The opening statement of the act explains that Congress intended to \nminimize ``industrial strife which interferes with the normal flow of \ncommerce.'' That means current law had provided a remedy, but \nunfortunately the administration did not use it.\n  Under that very provision of Taft-Hartley, when a labor dispute \nthreatens the national economy, the President is empowered to use the \nFederal courts to seek an injunction to end labor practices causing \nwidespread disruptions. With 70 years of case law backing it up, this \nis a tried-and-true process that ensures that the self-interests and \ngreed of a few does not impact the livelihoods of the many.\n  Yet, when the west coast ports dispute threatened businesses and \nentire industries in States across the country, the President refused \nto act. For months, the Federal Executive decided not to exercise his \nauthority under Taft-Hartley, depriving the country of critical dispute \nresolution powers.\n  Legislation I have introduced, known as the PORTS Act, prevents this \nkind of economic disruption. It would discourage disruptions at U.S. \nports by strengthening and expanding the well-known Taft-Hartley \nprocess.\n  As we saw recently, the President of the United States may not be \nwilling to adequately protect the economic rights and interests of \nAmerican citizens. The PORTS Act would solve this by granting State \nGovernors Taft-Hartley powers currently reserved for the President.\n  A Governor from any State would have the opportunity to form a board \nof inquiry and start the Taft-Hartley process whenever a port labor \ndispute is causing economic harm. Once the board reports back, any \nGovernor can petition Federal courts to enjoin slowdowns, strikes or \nlockouts at ports in their State.\n  The act would also explicitly include slowdowns as a trigger for \nTaft-Hartley powers, preventing the President or Governors from using \nlegal ambiguity to excuse an action. As a result, this legislation \nwould give a stronger voice to local leaders by allowing those who are \nmost affected by disruptions--local community leaders, business, \nemployees, and consumers--to apply pressure on their Governors rather \nthan trying to mobilize a national campaign to convince the President \nto act.\n  In just 5 years, the labor contracts at both the east coast and the \nwest coast ports will expire, possibly leading to labor disputes on \nboth ends of the country. When the health of the national economy is \nthreatened, the Federal Government has a duty to act, but it is clear \nthe current Taft-Hartley powers depend too heavily on who controls the \nPresidency.\n  It is critical that we have the necessary tools in place to prevent \nanother debilitating crisis. So I urge my fellow colleagues to join me \nin supporting this important legislation. Countless retail \norganizations, individual businesses, and people across this country \nrecognize the need to avoid in 5 years simultaneous slowdowns or \nshutdowns on the east and west coasts--what we just went through.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        King v. Burwell Decision\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, people across the country are eagerly \nanticipating the Supreme Court's decision in\n\n[[Page S4244]]\n\nKing v. Burwell and for good reason. This case will likely determine \nonce and for all whether the Obama administration violated its own law \nwhen it opted to issue health insurance tax subsidies to those who \npurchased insurance on federally run exchanges.\n  Many have argued that this decision by the Supreme Court will \ndetermine the fate of the so-called Affordable Care Act. While that \nargument may be a little dramatic, it isn't far off.\n  I have my own views on how the Court should rule in this case. \nIndeed, I have made it abundantly clear that in my view, the statute \nunambiguously limits the availability of premium tax subsidies to \ninsurance plans purchased on State-run exchanges. I have also stated \nnumerous times my belief that the Obama administration overstepped its \nauthority and broke its own law when it offered subsidies to patients \non exchanges established by the Federal Government.\n  However, as we all await the outcome of the case, we need to be clear \non one point. Regardless of how the Court rules in King v. Burwell, \nObamaCare will continue to inflict harm on patients and taxpayers until \nit is repealed and replaced with sensible, patient-centered reform.\n  Last week, President Obama reiterated that he had no alternative plan \nin place in the event that the Supreme Court rules against the \nadministration in this case. On top of that, he flippantly stated that \n``Congress could fix this whole thing with a one-sentence provision.''\n  Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  The problems with ObamaCare are so fundamental and convoluted that \nthe idea that the entire law could be fixed in one sentence borders on \nlaughable.\n  The President and his allies in Congress have gotten pretty good at \ncherry-picking favorable data points in order to claim that ObamaCare \nis working, but the overall numbers do not lie. Earlier this month, the \nadministration announced proposed rate hikes of 10 percent or more for \nhealth insurance plans that enroll more than 6 million people in 41 \nStates. This is just the latest premium hike patients and consumers \nhave seen under ObamaCare, despite the fact that the authors of the \nlaw--including the President himself--promised it would bring costs \ndown.\n  The failure to reduce costs isn't the only broken promise we have \nseen with ObamaCare. Millions of Americans have lost their insurance \nplans and their doctors due to the overly burdensome mandates embedded \nin the law. Many of these same people were forced to navigate a failed \nWeb site that jeopardized their private information. Others were forced \nto purchase plans that included coverage they didn't need or want.\n  As a result of this misguided law, many hard-working taxpayers \nreceived incorrect tax documents relating to their premium subsidies, \nfollowed by a surprise tax bill. Just yesterday, the Department of \nHealth and Human Services Office of the Inspector General issued a \nreport noting that the administration did not have systems in place to \nensure that ObamaCare credits that went out last year were accurate. \nThis vulnerability may be leading to untold billions in fraud, waste, \nand abuse.\n  I could go on. The problems and hardships associated with ObamaCare \nhave been well documented, and none of them can be solved with a one-\nsentence bill.\n  Millions of Americans have already suffered under ObamaCare, and if \nover the next few weeks the Supreme Court confirms that the \nadministration broke the law by offering subsidies on Federal \nexchanges, millions more will face the negative consequences of this \npoorly drafted statute. In fact, a study published today by Avalere \nshows that these consumers could face annual premium contribution \nincreases of $3,300 in 2015.\n  Fortunately, Republicans in Congress have a transition plan to \nprotect these patients. Indeed, there is a wide consensus that should \nthe Court rule against the government in King v. Burwell, we need to \nact to protect Americans from further suffering at the hands of \nObamaCare's broken promises.\n  Toward that end, I support a transition plan that provides temporary \nfinancial assistance to those who would lose subsidies as a result of \nthe Court's decision, to help them to keep their insurance if they want \nit.\n  At the same time, the transition plan should peel back ObamaCare's \nburdensome mandates, give individuals more flexibility to purchase \ncoverage that meets their needs, and give States the ability to develop \npolicies to better serve their citizens.\n  This temporary transition should build a bridge that gets us away \nfrom ObamaCare and puts us on a path toward lasting, patient-centered \nreform. Of course, this ultimate goal will have to wait until a new \nadministration is in place--one that is actually willing to work with \nCongress to address the actual needs of patients and taxpayers.\n  Despite the claims of uninformed critics, Republicans in Congress \nhave been working for months to ensure that a transition plan will be \nready when the Court delivers its ruling. And, make no mistake, we will \ndo our best to be ready.\n  At the same time, Republicans in both Chambers have worked together \nto put forward substantive and workable alternatives that would \npermanently replace the President's health care law with reforms that \nincrease patient choice and reduce the role of the Federal Government \nin health care.\n  I am a coauthor of one such plan called the Patient CARE Act. I, \nalong with Chairman Alexander and Congressman Upton in the House, \nreleased the latest version of this plan earlier this year. The plan \nhas gotten high marks from a number of analysts and publications.\n  So while it is a common refrain by supporters of ObamaCare that chaos \nwill ensue if the Court rules against the government in King v. \nBurwell, the facts tell a much different story. Republicans in Congress \nwill be ready to respond quickly and decisively to any possible \noutcome.\n  Now, let's be clear. None of us knows how the Court is going to rule \nin this case. I have heard analyses and predictions that vary across \nthe board. But no matter how this particular case turns out, we know \nfor certain that ObamaCare has been a dismal failure for American \npatients and hard-working taxpayers. This entire case is yet another \nreminder of how, more than 5 years after it was signed, this bill \ncontinues to cause problems. No matter how the Court rules in King v. \nBurwell, we need to chart a different course on health care for the \nAmerican people.\n  Let's face it. One reason we would set up a timeframe in case the \nSupreme Court rules against Secretary Burwell and the administration is \nthat we need to set up a timeline where we can work on these matters \nand hopefully bring a national consensus to bear. Only so will we be \nable to resolve the problems that will be found--that are there--if we \ndon't do what is right. So it is going to take some time. That is why \nwe suggest that there should be time leading well into the next \nadministration to be able to work on this to accomplish these matters \nand, during that time, make sure nobody is hurt because of the decision \nof King v. Burwell should it go against the government.\n  This is one of the great problems of our time, and there is no simple \nanswer, but we know we can't continue under the current law of \nObamaCare as it is written. If we do, we are just going to continue to \ngo down a sinkhole of expenditures, debts, doctors leaving their \nprofession, and an inability to provide the health care that so \nglowingly was spoken of by this administration.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am glad to withhold.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, let me say the senior Senator from Utah is \ndoing a yeoman's job of exposing some of the fraudulent things we have \nbeen involved in for ObamaCare over this period of time, and I applaud \nhim for that.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1911, as Further Modified\n\n  Earlier today, I made a motion that was incomplete, and I wish to \ncorrect it, having to do with a drafting error.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Hatch amendment No. \n1911 be further modified to address a drafting error.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey).

Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, shortly we will have a vote. I would like \nto say a few words about the legislation before we do. How much time is \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. About 13 minutes remains.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my colleagues, this Defense Authorization Act is \na reform bill. I repeat: It is a reform bill--a reform bill that will \nenable our military to rise to the challenges of a more dangerous world \nboth today and in the future. It tackles acquisition reform, military \nretirement reform, personnel reform, headquarters and management \nreform.\n  We identified $10 billion of excess and unnecessary spending from the \nPresident's budget request. We are reinvesting it in military \ncapabilities for our warfighters and reforms that can yield long-term \nsavings for the Department of Defense. We did all of this while \nupholding our commitments to our servicemembers, retirees, and their \nfamilies.\n  On acquisition reform, we put the services back into the acquisition \nprocess, created new mechanisms to ensure accountability for results, \nstreamlined regulation, and opened up the defense acquisition process \nto our Nation's innovators.\n  On military reform, we modernized and improved our military \nretirement system. Today, 83 percent of servicemembers leave the \nservice with no retirement assets or benefits. Under this new plan, 75 \npercent of servicemembers would get benefits. This reform, over time, \nis estimated to save $15 billion per year in the outyears.\n  On management reform, we ensure that the Department of Defense and \nthe military services are using precious defense dollars to fulfill \ntheir missions and defend the Nation, not expand their bloated staffs. \nTargeted reductions in headquarters and administrative staff in this \nlegislation--which is a\n\n[[Page S4246]]\n\n7.5-percent mandated reduction per year, up to a 30-percent reduction \nin the size of headquarters and administrative staff--will generate \n$1.7 billion in savings just for fiscal year 2016.\n  With these savings and billions more identified throughout the bill, \nwe accelerated shipbuilding, added an upgraded fighter aircraft, \ninvested in key modernization priorities across the services, and met \nour commanders' most urgent needs. As adversaries threaten our military \ntechnological advantage, the bill looks to the future and invests in \nnew breakthrough technologies, including directed energy and unmanned \ncombat aircraft.\n  The legislation is a reflection of the growing threats we face in the \nworld. The legislation authorizes nearly $3.8 billion in support for \nAfghan security forces as they continue to defend their country in the \ngains of the last decade against our common enemies. The legislation \nauthorizes the provision of defensive lethal assistance to Ukraine to \nhelp it build combat capability and defend its sovereign territory. It \nsupports the efforts by Lebanon and Jordan to secure their borders \nagainst ISIL. It creates a new initiative to help Southeast Asian \nnations build maritime domain awareness capabilities to address growing \nsovereignty challenges in the South China Sea.\n  This is an ambitious piece of legislation, but in the times we live \nin, that is exactly what we need.\n  Henry Kissinger told our committee earlier this year that our Nation \nfaces the most diverse and complex array of crises since the end of \nWorld War II. Rising to these challenges requires bold reform to our \nnational defense. This legislation represents a strong first step in \nthat direction.\n  As I said, this is a reform bill. This is an authorizing bill. This \nbrings about much needed reforms. I cannot go to the people of Arizona \nand justify defense spending when there is a $2.4 billion cost overrun \non an aircraft carrier, when there are a number of weapons systems \nwhich billions of dollars have been invested in and which have never \nbecome reality. That system has to be reformed. That is what this bill \ndoes.\n  We have to reform our military retirement system. We allow people, \nafter just 2 years of service, to contribute to their own retirement. \nToday, they have to wait 20 years in order to do that.\n  We upgrade fighter aircraft.\n  We tell the defense industry that they cannot have those cost \noverruns. If there are cost overruns, the service chiefs have to \npersonally sign that they know of, are aware of, and are taking action \nto prevent further cost overruns.\n  So there is a lot in this legislation. It is an authorizing \nlegislation. That is why it disturbs me a great deal to hear my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle saying they want to vote \nagainst it because of OCO. That is not sufficient reason in these \ntimes. If they want to fight against OCO, the place to do it--the \noverseas contingency operation money which brings up authorizing \nspending to the same level that the President has requested--if they \nwant to do that, then let's have that fight in another arena. But let's \nnot take away from the men and women who are serving in this military \nthe equipment and the training and the leadership that is demanded in \nthe world as it is today--in the words of Henry Kissinger, more diverse \nand complex array of crises since the end of World War II.\n  So I urge all of my colleagues to restate their commitment to the \ndefense of this Nation by voting in favor of this legislation and \ncloture prior to that. I urge my colleagues--all of them--to understand \nthat we can fight about this funding situation, the need to repeal \nsequestration--sequestration is destroying our military's capability to \ndefend this Nation. Every uniformed service leader who appeared before \nthe Armed Services Committee said that with sequestration, we are \nputting the lives of the men and women in uniform at greater risk. We \nshould not do that. We ask young men and women to volunteer for the \nmilitary, and yet we here in Congress won't take action to keep them \nfrom being placed in greater danger. That is an abrogation of our \nresponsibility. This bill does not fix all that, but it certainly is a \nmajor step in the right direction.\n  Almost all of this legislation was done on a bipartisan basis. There \nwere literally--there were some small disagreements, but overall the \ncommittee together.\n  Now, at the behest of their leadership and perhaps the President of \nthe United States, they are so torqued up about OCO that they may vote \nagainst this legislation's passage, and that, my friends, is an \nabrogation of their responsibility to the men and women who are serving \nthis country. If they choose to vote against this legislation on the \ngrounds that they are opposed to the funding mechanism used to do so, \nthen they have their priorities upside down, and I intend to tell the \nAmerican people about it because I believe that we are not serving the \nmen and women who are serving this country to the best of their ability \nand not receiving the support they need and deserve from the Senate of \nthe United States of America.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1911, as Further Modified\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am speaking on an amendment that the \nSenate will be voting on shortly, the Inhofe-Mikulski amendment. \nReally, the amendment was led by the distinguished Senator from \nOklahoma, Mr. Inhofe. This is really about commissaries.\n  We are here ready to vote on the Department of Defense authorization. \nWe want to stand up for our troops. One of the most important things we \ncan do is to stand up for their families.\n  Senator Inhofe and I are deeply concerned that DOD has the misguided \nviewpoint that shrinking or eliminating or privatizing the commissaries \nwill save money for the U.S. Department of Defense. We do not even know \nwhat the impact of that will be. Senator Inhofe, with my encouragement \nand support, wants to have an amendment that would actually look at the \nimpact of privatization and a private program to do so. So I want my \nside of the aisle to know we stand shoulder to shoulder on this. The \nSenator from Oklahoma has done an outstanding job as always in standing \nup for the troops and their very important benefits.\n  I note that he is on the floor. I ask that when the rollcall is \ncalled, we support the Inhofe-Mikulski amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for a couple of minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first, I wish to say to the Senator from \nMaryland how much I appreciate the fact that we are reaching across the \naisle and doing something that is right for the kids who are out there \nrisking their lives for us.\n  I make it a habit to go to the areas of combat with regularity, as do \nother members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and I always get \na chance to really talk with and get to know them. You learn a lot more \nby talking to the kids in the mess hall there than you do by going to \nthe committee hearings here in the United States.\n  One of the things they have a real love for, as I am sure the Senator \nfrom Maryland suggested to you, is the commissary. In some areas that \nare remote, there is no competition. There aren't any Walmarts around; \nthere is just a commissary. And there is almost a fraternal belief and \nfeeling, as people go around--particularly, the spouses will meet \nthere. They will do their shopping there. It is something that is very \nserious to them.\n  There is language in this bill that says that they will take an \nexperiment in some five different areas that have large commissaries, \ngo ahead and privatize those, and then after that takes place, do an \nassessment as to whether they should be privatized.\n  This amendment is very simple. It merely says: Let's do the \nassessment first. Why go ahead and close these commissaries if we find \nthat is something that we should not, in fact, do?\n  We have so many interests. First of all, we have--as I am sure the \nSenator\n\n[[Page S4247]]\n\nfrom Maryland mentioned--we have some 25 cosponsors already. This is \nwithout real effort. We also have some 41 organizations supporting this \nbill.\n  I see that the time is up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all postcloture time \nhas expired.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield to the Chair.\n\n\n            Vote on Amendment No. 1911, as Further Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to Hatch amendment \nNo. 1911, as further modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1911), as further modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 1456\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and \nnays be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to McCain amendment No. 1456.\n  The amendment (No. 1456) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder to make a point of order against all the pending nongermane \namendments en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n Amendments Nos. 1564, as Modified; 1825; 1559, as Modified; 1543, as \n                        Modified; 1645; and 1486\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the following \namendments are not germane: amendments Nos. 1564, 1825, 1559, 1543, \n1645, and 1486.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained, and the \namendments fall.\n\n\n                 Vote on Amendment No. 1463, as Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on agreeing to \namendment No. 1463, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 1463), as amended, was agreed to.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on H.R. 1735, an \n     act to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2016 for \n     military activities of the Department of Defense, for \n     military construction, and for defense activities of the \n     Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel \n     strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes.\n         Mitch McConnell, John McCain, Richard C.

Mr. President, I rise this evening in support of more than \n1,700 high school students who happen to be in our Nation's capital, in \nfact, this week. They are part of the Electric Cooperative Youth Tour. \nDuring this year's tour, students will participate in leadership \ntraining and gain firsthand insight into the legislative process.\n  Those electric cooperatives that sponsor these kids coming to \nWashington, DC, from my State, yours, and every other State across the \ncountry, are more than just poles and wires. They are about people and \ncommunities. Recognizing that youth are the future of those communities \nis what the rural electric cooperative program is all about--sending 51 \nstudents to Washington, DC, for 51 straight years, so future leaders \ncan have a front-row seat to American Government.\n  What would rural communities look like without power? That is pretty \ndifficult to imagine. Think about the power of electric cooperatives. \nSure, our local electric co-ops keep the lights on, but, as I say, they \ndo much more than that. Co-ops are not-for-profits and owned by their \nmembers. They recognize the need to invest in future generations. Co-\nops give back to the communities they serve, and the Youth Tour is \nproof of that.\n\n  Each year, I enjoy taking time to visit with Kansans who are part of \nthe Youth Tour because they are among the most energetic, engaging, and \nrespectful young men and women I see throughout the year in Washington, \nDC. It is always valuable for us to have folks from our home States \ncome and visit us, but it is especially pleasing to have these young \nmen and women visit us. In my view, it is a program that has figured \nout how to find the best and brightest and those with the greatest \ninterest and find a way for them to come to Washington, DC, and see our \nNation's Capitol and hopefully inspire them to continue their interest \nin government and politics throughout their lives.\n  Youth Tour alumni have gone on to become university presidents, \nFortune 500 CEOs, Members of Congress, and built lifelong friendships. \nIn fact, just last week I had Jacob Helm in my office. He is from \nNorcatur, KS, a small town along the Colorado-Nebraska part of our \nState. Jacob is an individual I nominated to attend the United States \nAir Force Academy in Colorado Springs, and he just graduated. He is now \nengaged to a fellow Youth Tour alumna, Michelle Peschel of Axtell, KS, \nwhich is on the other side of the State--Nebraska more than the \nMissouri part of our State. Both Jacob and Michelle grew up in \ncommunities of fewer than 500 people, and I am proud to see them giving \nback to their State and their country. They became engaged as a result \nof meeting each other on a Youth Tour back when they were in high \nschool and will soon be married.\n\n[[Page S4248]]\n\n  My own interest in public service stemmed from a summer internship \nfrom my Congressman when I was in college, and I am hopeful that visits \nlike these that the rural electric cooperatives provide for these young \nmen and women--these visits to Washington, DC--will inspire these young \npeople to get involved and work to improve their hometowns, our State, \nand our Nation.\n  Each of these 1,700 Youth Tour students should be commended for being \nin Washington, DC, this week, just as our co-ops should be commended \nfor realizing the need to invest in our future leaders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/17/senate-section/article/S4248-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RECOGNIZING LIEUTENANT GENERAL NOEL T. ``TOM'' JONES\n\n  Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, in a few short weeks an inspirational \nmilitary leader will retire after serving his country proudly for over \n35 years. Today I recognize and commend Air Force Lt. Gen. Noel T. \n``Tom'' Jones for his exceptional leadership and service over those 35 \nyears, most recently as the vice commander of U.S. Air Forces in \nEurope, Ramstein Air Base, Germany.\n  Born to Margaret and Lem Jones, General Jones was no stranger to \nmilitary service. His father was an F-4 fighter pilot in the U.S. Air \nForce and retired after 23 years as a lieutenant colonel. His older \nbrother, Lem Jones, Jr., served in the U.S. Army and retired as a \nmajor. The second oldest son, Ron Jones, served as an enlisted member \nin the U.S. Air Force for 6 years. Finally, General Jones' younger \nbrother, James ``Rev'' Jones, recently retired as a major general after \na distinguished career as an Air Force fighter pilot as well. In fact, \nat one point in time, all four Jones boys were serving in the military \nat the same time. All told, General Jones moved around to nine \ndifferent States or countries before even entering college.\n  With a calling to serve and fly like his father, General Jones was \ncommissioned in 1980 following graduation from the U.S. Air Force \nAcademy with a bachelor of science degree in political science. He \ncompleted undergraduate pilot training in 1981 and began a long career \nflying the F-16 Fighting Falcon under the call sign ``Honez.'' During \nhis career, he served as an instructor pilot and operations officer as \nwell as holding numerous operational command positions.\n  An outstanding leader throughout his distinguished career, General \nJones' service has spanned the country with assignments in 12 States \nand across the world with tours at Torrejon Air Base, Spain, Kunsan Air \nBase, South Korea, Baghdad, Iraq, and Ramstein Air Base, Germany. He \nhas commanded a fighter squadron, operations group, and a fighter wing. \nAdditionally, General Jones commanded the 332nd Expeditionary Wing at \nAhmed Al Jaber Air Base, Kuwait, during Operation Iraqi Freedom and \nserved for a year in Iraq as the director of strategic plans and \nassessment for U.S. Forces-Iraq.\n  General Jones has also held staff assignments at North American \nAerospace Defense Command, Air Combat Command, and the National \nSecurity Agency. Prior to his current assignment, he was the director, \noperational capability requirements, deputy chief of staff for \noperations, plans and requirements, Headquarters U.S. Air Force, \nWashington, DC. In his current capacity, General Jones serves as the \nvice commander, U.S. Air Forces in Europe, the air component to U.S. \nEuropean Command and U.S. Africa Command. The major command is \nresponsible for providing full-spectrum warfighting capabilities to the \ncombatant commanders throughout the entire area of responsibility, \nwhich encompasses 104 countries in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle \nEast, the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, and possesses more than a quarter \nof the world's population and more than a quarter of the world's gross \ndomestic product.\n  General Jones is a command pilot with more than 3,500 flying hours, \nincluding combat sorties over Iraq in operations Southern Watch, Desert \nFox and Iraqi Freedom. His military decorations include the Air Force \nDistinguished Service Medal, Defense Superior Service Medal with oak \nleaf cluster, Legion of Merit with two oak leaf clusters, and Bronze \nStar Medal, among many others.\n  Mr. President, Lt. Gen. Tom ``Honez'' Jones epitomizes the Air Force \ncore values of integrity, service, and excellence, and has dedicated \nhis life to serving our Nation. I am proud to say he plans to retire \nwith the rest of the extended Jones Family in Coushatta, LA. Today I \njoin my colleagues in honoring his admirable service to our Nation and \nall the airmen, sailors, soldiers, marines, and civilians, who have \nserved alongside him. We offer our heartfelt appreciation to Tom, his \nwife Debbie, and their children, Tommy and Danielle, and a hearty \ncongratulation on his retirement from the U.S. Air Force.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/17/senate-section/article/S4248-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING KATHY MERCHANT\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN.

Prior to joining GCF, Ms. \nMerchant was director of the Pew Charitable Trusts' Neighborhood \nPreservation Initiative and a partner in the consulting firm Holt, \nWexler & Merchant.\n  Recognized as a national leader in her field, Ms. Merchant serves on \nthe board of the Boston-based Center for Effective Philanthropy and in \n2012 joined the national board of the New York-based Local Initiatives \nSupport Corporation.\n  Ms. Merchant has served on a number of nonprofit boards, including \nthe National Center for Arts and Technology, Cincinnati USA Chamber, \nCouncil on Foundations, Community Foundations of America/GivingNet, \nOhio Grantmakers Forum, and the SC Ministry Foundation.\n  An advocate for the underserved, Ms. Merchant chaired the Strive \nPartnership's cradle-to-career initiative in Cincinnati--2009 to 2013--\nwhere she continues to serve as a member of the executive committee and \nas an advisor to the national Strive Network.\n  Ms. Merchant has earned many professional awards, including the YWCA \nCareer Woman of Achievement, 2005; Ohio Philanthropy, 2006; Girl Scouts \nWoman of Distinction, 2009; Council on Foundations' Distinguished \nGrantmaker, 2011; Kentucky Commonwealth, 2012; WE Celebrate Woman of \nthe Year--Nonprofit, 2012; and the Cincinnati Public Relations Society \nof America's Blacksmiths CEO Communicator of the Year, 2013.

Mr. President, today I rise to recognize Bosma \nEnterprises on the 100th anniversary of its founding. I commend Bosma \nfor remaining steadfast in its mission to decrease the unemployment \nrate among those who are blind or visually impaired.\n  Since its founding, Bosma Enterprises has provided employment \nopportunities and rehabilitation to visually impaired Hoosiers \nthroughout our State. Originally a public institution created by the \nIndiana State Legislature in 1915, the Board of Industrial Aid for the \nBlind was renamed after Charles E. Bosma, an advocate for the blind and \nvisually impaired citizens of Indiana. Indiana State Representative and \nSpeaker of the Indiana House Brian C. Bosma has served as a founding \ndirector since 1988 when the organization was granted not-for-profit \nstatus. Since then, Bosma has grown tremendously. A little more than 15 \nyears ago, Bosma secured a major contract allowing it to package and \ndistribute gloves to hospitals under the jurisdiction of the Department \nof Veterans Affairs. Bosma then expanded their contract with the \nDepartment of Veteran Affairs and began to package and distribute \nsurgical gloves, creating even more jobs.\n  Bosma Enterprises has grown into a business with more than 200 \nemployees,\n\n[[Page S4249]]\n\n85 of whom are blind or visually impaired, making this the largest \nemployer of individuals with visual disabilities in the State of \nIndiana. Bosma relocated to the northwest side of Indianapolis 10 years \nago, where it doubled in size with increased production, training \nrooms, and rehabilitation services. Recently, Bosma added a second \nlocation for production, warehousing, and office space. As the only \nservice of its kind and magnitude in the State, Bosma Enterprises \ncontinues to make a difference in the daily lives of visually disabled \nHoosiers.\n  Today, I commend the efforts of Bosma Enterprises as it prepares for \nits future, and the futures of the visually impaired Hoosiers it seeks \nto help. Innovation and diversification have allowed Bosma to grow, \nprovide services to more and more people, and create jobs throughout \nIndiana. It stands as a shining example of the hard work and service of \nHoosiers. I wish Bosma Enterprises continued success towards its noble \nvision: a future in which the blind and visually impaired will have \nequal opportunities in every aspect of their lives.\n  On behalf of the citizens of Indiana, I would like to congratulate \nBosma Enterprises on 100 years of success. This organization embodies \nthe Hoosier spirit and improves the lives of visually impaired Hoosiers \nacross the State. Bosma has a proven track record of being an advocate \nand reliable employer for our visually impaired Hoosiers. We are proud \nthat Bosma calls Indiana home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/17/senate-section/article/S4249-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO GENE PETERSON\n\n Mr. DAINES.

Over this past weekend, Mr. Peterson was inducted into the \nMontana Broadcasters Hall of Fame for contributing more than 50 years \nof service to the broadcasting industry in our State.\n  A graduate of the Brown Institute in Minneapolis, MN, Mr. Peterson \nmoved with his wife and two daughters to Missoula in 1962, where he \nbegan working at a modest radio station that he then transformed into a \nthriving radio group of five stations.\n  Mr. Peterson has also undertaken a great deal of public service, for \nwhich he has been honored in many ways. He has served the city of \nMissoula as president of the Missoula Chamber of Commerce, president of \nthe Montana Broadcasters Association, Grizzly Scholarship Association, \nSt. Patrick Hospital Advisory Board, YMCA, and the University of \nMontana President's Advisory Board. Among his awards for his careers in \nboth broadcasting and public service are Businessman of the Year, the \nHugh O'Brien Lifetime Achievement, and Sportsman of the Year.\n  Mr. Peterson has made a difference in his years of community service \nand contributions to our State's economy.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize the \nMinnesota Orchestra and its music director, Osmo Vanska, for the \nensemble's recent visit to Cuba--the first major American orchestra to \ndo so since President Obama announced efforts to normalize our Nation's \nrelationship with Cuba. The Minnesota Orchestra last visited Cuba in \n1930, when it was known as the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra.\n  For more than a century, the Minnesota Orchestra has demonstrated a \ndeep commitment to innovation and diversity, and this visit is just the \nlatest example. During its whirlwind visit, the orchestra won the \nhearts and minds of music lovers across the island nation. The \nperformances were met with applause and acclaim, and they illustrated \nthe importance of strengthening the cultural bonds between our \ncountries and our people. In Cuba, there is a real eagerness for the \nperson-to-person contact that has been blocked for decades. This trip \nsignified real steps towards forming those crucial relationships--\nproving that music is a language that reaches beyond cultural, \npolitical, and geographical barriers to unite us all. I commend the \nMinnesota Orchestra for its willingness and initiative to take part in \nthis historic cultural moment.\n  Since its inception in 1903, the Minnesota Orchestra has promoted new \nideas, new connections, and new music. Under Mr. Vanska's leadership, \nthis orchestra has risen in the ranks to become one of the top \nsymphonic ensembles in America, and I am proud that it calls Minnesota \nhome. The orchestra has become a visionary leader in the world of \nsymphonic and classical music, stretching beyond what other ensembles \nimagine is possible, in order to achieve excellence in its field.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me as I commend the Minnesota \nOrchestra, its Musical Director Osmo Vanska and all of the talented \nmusicians and dedicated staff on this historic tour of Cuba, and for \nmore than a century of performing and producing beautiful music enjoyed \nnot just in Minnesota but around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/17/senate-section/article/S4249-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:36 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2596.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. FLAKE (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 1592. A bill to clarify the description of certain Federal land \nunder the Northern Arizona Land Exchange and Verde River Basin \nPartnership Act of 2005 to include additional land in the Kaibab \nNational Forest; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor legislation \nintroduced by my colleague, Senator Jeff Flake, that would fix a \nmapping error involving the transfer of Forest Service land to Young \nLife's Lost Canyon Camp in northern Arizona.\n  The bill, S. 1592, would amend the Northern Arizona Land Exchange and \nVerde River Basin Partnership Act of 2005, P.L. 109-110, to clarify \nthat Congress intended that Young Life could purchase at fair market \nvalue a full 237.5 acres of national forest land in the Kaibab National \nForest as Congress intended. The Forest Service says there is an error \nin the Forest Service map referenced in the 2005 Act that has omitted \nabout 25 acres from the land conveyance. This error appears to be \npreventing the Forest Service and Young Life from finalizing the \ntransfer. Each year, nearly 5,000 young campers spend their summer at \nthe Lost Canyon Camp, and this land conveyance is needed to expand the \ncamp and create a buffer zone around the camp. I urge my colleagues to \npass this clarifying legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Heller):\n  S. 1595. A bill to describe the authority under which Federal \nentities may use mobile aerial-view devices to surveil, protect \nindividual and collective privacy against warrantless governmental \nintrusion through the use of mobile aerial-view devices, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nfurther protect American's privacy, while providing clear guidance for \nFederal law enforcement for information collection using the newest \ntechnologies. I\n\n[[Page S4252]]\n\nam sure my colleagues recall recent reports, from just a few weeks ago, \ndetailing the FBI's use of secret planes to spy on people in dozens of \ncities without a warrant. These reports troubled both my colleagues and \nme, and left unclear exactly when the government thinks it is okay to \nsurveil people from the air. As I have stressed many times before, the \nAmerican public deserves to know the laws that the government relies on \nto surveil people, and the limits of those laws. And that's what this \nbill sets out to do.\n  Now, drafting legislation in an area where technology is advancing \nrapidly and so many policy issues intersect, is a very difficult task. \nBut I am confident that the Protecting Individuals From Mass Aerial \nSurveillance Act of 2015 reflects feedback from several stakeholders, \nexperts and civil liberties groups, and provides the government the \ntools it needs to keep us safe without sacrificing our civil liberties.\n  This bill would generally prohibit federal aerial surveillance \nwithout a warrant, but with several exceptions. It would allow the \ngovernment to aerially surveil to protect people from disasters, \nterrorist attacks, entry of illegal substances at national borders, and \nother emergency situations. In addition, it would allow for government \nagencies to survey wildlife and conduct research by use of aerial \nvehicles, in order to ensure that habitats are preserved and \nenvironmental risks are assessed properly.\n  This bill also would prohibit the government from identifying people \nthat happen to appear in aerial surveillance, unless it has probable \ncause to believe those people have committed specific crimes. All \ninformation gathered in violation of the bill would be barred admission \nas evidence in any court of law, and the bill would also prohibit \nprivate operators of aerial vehicles from being proxies for unlawful \ngovernment surveillance.\n  I want to stress that we cannot stand to wait much longer to pass \nsensible limits on a type of surveillance whose technical capabilities \nare advancing rapidly. With the proliferation of drones in US airspace, \nand the numbers expected to increase by the thousands in the following \nfew years, there is a real concern that the law has not been keeping up \nwith technical advancements. And drones are not the only concern--use \nof planes and helicopters equipped with modern surveillance equipment \nmake the technological landscape an incredibly dynamic one. That's why \nthis bill today would remain technology neutral and apply to both \nmanned and unmanned aerial vehicles.\n  To my fellow colleagues, I strongly believe that this bill strikes \nthe proper balance between allowing for aerial surveillance and \nprotecting individual privacy. I am glad to have received help and \nfeedback from the Center for Democracy and Technology, SOAR Oregon--a \nleading voice in Oregon's UAV industry, the Small UAV Coalition, the \nElectronic Frontier Foundation, the ACLU, and other experts. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in supporting this bill and offering their \nfeedback. At this time, I would like to ask that this statement be \nentered into the Record.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 1599. A bill to provide anti-retaliation protections for antitrust \nwhistleblowers; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am joining again with Senator \nGrassley in introducing the Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act, \nlegislation that will provide protections to employees who come forward \nand disclose to law enforcement agencies pricefixing and other criminal \nantitrust behavior that harms consumers. This bill includes changes \nthat we made in the Judiciary Committee last Congress, which enabled it \nto pass the Senate unanimously. Senator Grassley and I have long worked \ntogether on protecting whistleblowers, and this legislation continues \nthose efforts.\n  Whistleblowers are often instrumental in alerting the public, \nCongress, and law enforcement agencies to wrongdoing in a variety of \nareas. These individuals take risks in stepping forward and deserve to \nbe protected from retaliation. Congress should encourage employees with \ninformation about criminal antitrust activity to report this \ninformation. The Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act does exactly \nthat by offering meaningful protection to those who blow the whistle on \nillegal behavior such as pricefixing.\n  This legislation is modeled on whistleblower protections that Senator \nGrassley and I authored as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The \nprotections are narrowly tailored and do not provide whistleblowers \nwith an economic incentive to bring forth false claims. Last Congress, \nwe made modest changes to the bill in the Judiciary Committee to \nimprove the definition of a covered individual and clarify that \nprotections only apply to employees reporting criminal violations. The \nprotections in this bill build on recommendations from key stakeholders \nin a 2011 Government Accountability Office report to Congress.\n  The antitrust laws offer critical protections for consumers that \npromote free enterprise. By extending whistleblower protections to this \narea of the law, this bipartisan bill will help to ensure that criminal \nantitrust violations do not go unreported. This bill passed the Senate \nunanimously last Congress. I urge the Senate to pass it again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/17/senate-section/article/S4252-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4252-S4253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 203--DESIGNATING JUNE 20, 2015, AS ``AMERICAN EAGLE \n DAY'' AND CELEBRATING THE RECOVERY AND RESTORATION OF THE BALD EAGLE, \n                THE NATIONAL SYMBOL OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Cochran, Mrs. Feinstein, \nMr. Corker, and Mr. Sessions) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

and\n       (16) the United States Postal Service;\n       Whereas the bald eagle is an inspiring symbol of--\n       (1) the spirit of freedom; and\n       (2) the sovereignty of the United States;\n       Whereas the image and symbolism of the bald eagle has \n     played a significant role in art, music, literature, \n     architecture, commerce, education, and culture in the United \n     States, and on United States stamps, currency, and coinage;\n       Whereas the bald eagle was once endangered and facing \n     possible extinction in the lower 48 States, but has made a \n     gradual and encouraging comeback to the lands, waterways, and \n     skies of the United States;\n       Whereas the dramatic recovery of the national bird of the \n     United States is an endangered species success story and an \n     inspirational example to other wildlife, environmental, and \n     natural resource conservation efforts worldwide;\n       Whereas, in 1940, noting that the species was ``threatened \n     with extinction'', Congress passed the Bald Eagle Protection \n     Act (16 U.S.C. 668 et seq.), which prohibited killing,\n\n[[Page S4253]]\n\n     selling, or possessing the species, and a 1962 amendment \n     expanded protection to the golden eagle, thereby establishing \n     the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act;\n       Whereas, by 1963, there were only an estimated 417 nesting \n     pairs of bald eagles remaining in the lower 48 States, with \n     loss of habitat, poaching, and the use of pesticides and \n     other environmental contaminants contributing to the near \n     demise of the national bird of the United States;\n       Whereas the bald eagle was officially declared an \n     endangered species in 1967 under the Endangered Species \n     Preservation Act of 1966 (Public Law 89-669; 80 Stat. 926) in \n     all areas of the United States south of the 40th parallel due \n     to the dramatic decline in the population of the bald eagle \n     in the lower 48 States;\n       Whereas the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) \n     was signed into law in 1973, and, in 1978, the bald eagle was \n     listed as ``endangered'' throughout the lower 48 states, \n     except in Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington, and \n     Wisconsin, where it was designated as ``threatened'';\n       Whereas, in July 1995, the United States Fish and Wildlife \n     Service announced that bald eagles in the lower 48 States had \n     recovered to the point where populations of bald eagles \n     previously considered ``endangered'' were now considered \n     ``threatened'';\n       Whereas bald eagles residing in the lower 48 States \n     rebounded to about 11,000 pairs by 2007;\n       Whereas the United States Department of Interior and the \n     United States Fish and Wildlife Service removed the bald \n     eagle from Endangered Species Act protection on June 28, \n     2007, but the species continues to be protected under the \n     Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act of 1940 (16 U.S.C. 668 \n     et seq.), the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 (16 U.S.C. \n     703 et seq.), and the Lacey Act of 1900 and the amendments \n     thereto (16 U.S.C. 3371 et seq.);\n       Whereas the trained, educational bald eagle ``Challenger'' \n     of the American Eagle Foundation in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, \n     was invited by the United States Department of the Interior \n     to perform a free-flight demonstration during the official \n     bald eagle delisting ceremony held at the Jefferson Memorial \n     in Washington, DC;\n       Whereas experts and population growth charts estimate that \n     the bald eagle population could reach 15,000 pairs by 2015, \n     even though a physical count has not been conducted by State \n     and Federal wildlife agencies since 2007;\n       Whereas caring and concerned agencies, corporations, \n     organizations, and people of the United States representing \n     the Federal, State, and private sectors passionately and \n     resourcefully banded together, determined to save and protect \n     the national bird of the United States;\n       Whereas the recovery of the bald eagle population in the \n     United States was largely accomplished due to dedicated and \n     vigilant efforts of Federal and State wildlife agencies and \n     non-profit organizations, such as the American Eagle \n     Foundation, through public education, captive breeding and \n     release programs, hacking and release programs, and the \n     translocation of bald eagles from places in the United States \n     with dense bald eagle populations to suitable locations in \n     the lower 48 States which had suffered a decrease in bald \n     eagle populations;\n       Whereas various non-profit organizations, such as the \n     Southeastern Raptor Center at Auburn University in the State \n     of Alabama, contribute to the continuing recovery of the bald \n     eagle through rehabilitation and educational efforts;\n       Whereas the bald eagle might have been lost permanently if \n     not for dedicated conservation efforts, and strict protection \n     laws like the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the Bald and \n     Golden Eagle Protection Act of 1940, the Migratory Bird \n     Treaty Act of 1918, and the Lacey Act; and\n       Whereas the sustained recovery of the bald eagle population \n     will require the continuation of recovery, management, \n     education, and public awareness programs to ensure that the \n     population numbers and habitat of the bald eagle will remain \n     healthy and secure for generations to come: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 20, 2015, as ``American Eagle Day'';\n       (2) applauds the issuance of bald eagle commemorative coins \n     by the Secretary of the Treasury as a way to generate \n     critical funds for the protection of the bald eagle; and\n       (3) encourages--\n       (A) educational entities, organizations, businesses, \n     conservation groups, and government agencies with a shared \n     interest in conserving endangered species to collaborate and \n     develop educational tools for use in the public schools of \n     the United States; and\n       (B) the people of the United States to observe American \n     Eagle Day with appropriate ceremonies and other activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/17/senate-section/article/S4253-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2058.
