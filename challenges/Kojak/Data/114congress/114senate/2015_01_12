Mr. President, last week the House of Representatives \nvoted on a bipartisan basis to pass a Keystone jobs and infrastructure \nbill. Meanwhile, the Senate energy committee got the process moving in \nthis Chamber as it debated and approved a bipartisan Keystone measure \nas well. The committee consideration allows Senators from both parties \nto offer amendments and make their voices heard. It is the kind of \nserious legislating many Senators have been waiting a long time to see. \nIt is the latest example of Congress getting back to work under a new \nRepublican majority.\n  Later this afternoon we will consider a cloture motion that will \nallow us to proceed to a similarly open debate here on the Senate \nfloor. I know Senators from both sides are hungry for a real Senate \ndebate. I know they want to offer amendments. I know they are anxious \nto finally have their voices and the voices of the people they \nrepresent heard here on the Senate floor. I expect the cloture motion \nto pass on a bipartisan basis.\n  Of course, we originally hoped to start this process last Thursday. \nWe wanted to spend Friday working on this bipartisan jobs bill, but the \nSenate lost that opportunity when some colleagues across the aisle \nobjected to beginning the debate.\n  Now, moving forward, what I would urge is for our Democratic friends \nto work with us as the new Republican majority continues to bring more \nopenness to the Senate. The changes we are making are ones that many \nDemocrats have indicated they want to see as well. The reforms we are \nimplementing will give a real voice to constituents represented by \nDemocratic Senators. We need to work together to ensure positive change \ntakes hold. I am hopeful that will happen.\n  Here is one consequence of that delay I mentioned. The Nebraska \nSupreme Court has since eliminated what has to be the last conceivable \npretext to veto the Keystone jobs bill, so we will be starting the \nSenate's debate at a time when the rationale for building this pipeline \nhas almost never been more obvious.\n  I know the American people would welcome a change in posture from the \nPresident. I know supporters in both parties are determined to get a \nbipartisan jobs and infrastructure bill to his desk as soon as \npossible. We will take the next step in the process at 5:30 p.m. today, \nand then we will have an open floor debate on jobs, the middle class,\n\n[[Page S134]]\n\ninfrastructure, and energy. At the end of this process, we will send a \nbipartisan jobs bill to the President. We will fulfill our pledge to \nstop protecting him from good ideas. It may force the President to \nfinally make a difficult choice between jobs and the middle class \nversus the demands of powerful special interests, but President Obama \nnow has every reason to sign the bipartisan jobs and infrastructure \nbill we will pass.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/12/senate-section/article/S134-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, later today Members of the Senate family \nwill have two opportunities to express our solidarity with the people \nof France in their hour of grief and to reaffirm our commitment to the \nprinciples of freedom and tolerance--values that have bound our nations \ntogether since the creation of the United States and the French \nRepublic.\n  In a short while the Senate will consider a resolution condemning the \nseries of terrorist attacks that have shaken France, starting with the \nattack on the offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and \nending with a siege Friday at a kosher supermarket in Paris. Our \nresolution expresses our condolences to the families of the victims and \nour solidarity with the people of France. It also expresses our deep \ncommitment to the universal right of freedom of expression--a freedom \nfor which the writers and artists of Charlie Hebdo gave their lives. I \nam honored to lead this resolution, along with Senators Murphy of \nConnecticut and Johnson of Wisconsin.\n  Later this afternoon Senators and their staffs will have an \nopportunity to sign a condolence book expressing their sympathy and \nsolidarity to the people of France. The book will be outside the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee room on the first floor of the Capitol. In \nmemory of the victims, we will welcome the French Ambassador to the \nUnited States, Ambassador Gerard Araud, in the committee room at 4:15 \np.m.\n  If the terrorists who attacked Charlie Hebdo and the kosher \nsupermarket in Paris meant to frighten and divide freedom-loving people \nin France and around the world, they have failed utterly. Yesterday 4 \nmillion people marched in demonstrations in cities across the nation of \nFrance. A million and a half people marched in Paris alone. Authorities \nsaid it was the largest gathering in Paris since the end of World War \nII and the largest demonstration in the history of the nation of \nFrance. They marched to declare their solidarity with the victims of \nthe Charlie Hebdo massacre and the supermarket murders and to \ndemonstrate their unity. The marchers included Christians, Muslims, \nJews, and many other religious faiths and nonbelievers. President \nFrancois Hollande led the March. He was joined by European and African \nleaders, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian \nAuthority President Mahmoud Abbas, America's Ambassador to France, and \nour Assistant Secretary of State.\n  Marches were also held in other cities around the globe yesterday, \nfrom Washington to the West Bank. Tens of thousands of people showed \ntheir solidarity with the victims of these terrorist attacks in France.\n  In Chicago hundreds of people turned out in the cold yesterday to \nrally at Daley Plaza under American and French flags. One of the \norganizers of the Chicago rally was a young woman named Eve Zuckerman \nwho holds joint U.S. and French citizenship and has lived in Chicago \nfor about 4 years. She said the spasm of violence that has shaken \nFrance is not simply an attack on France. In her words, ``What it \nreally means is that anyone who is for freedom and for tolerance is \nalso under attack.''\n  In our own country in the days after 9/11, our grief was made \nbearable by the countless acts of courage, kindness, and solidarity we \nwitnessed amidst the carnage, and so it is within France today.\n  One story that has touched many in France and around the world \nconcerns a young man who worked at the kosher supermarket in Paris that \nwas attacked on Friday. The young man risked his life to hide seven \nJewish customers in the freezer in the supermarket's basement. He then \nrisked his life again to slip out of the basement and tell the police \nthere were people hidden downstairs. This young man described the \nlayout of the supermarket and the location of the hostages--crucial \ndetails that enabled the police to save so many lives and end the \nstandoff. This young man has been hailed as a hero by the citizens of \nFrance and by Israeli President Netanyahu. One more thing about this \nyoung French hero--he is a Muslim immigrant, born in Mali.\n  Martin Luther King told us: We are bound together in a single garment \nof destiny. The millions of people in France and around the world who \nmarched yesterday and freedom-loving people throughout the world \nunderstand this. Together in our unity and resolve, we will overcome \nthis latest assault on our shared values.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/12/senate-section/article/S134-3", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S134-S136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, over the weekend, as I mentioned, as \nmillions of people were marching on the streets of France and around \nthe world to demonstrate the world's unity in the aftermath of the \nhorrible terrorist attack in France, the President announced that he \nwill convene a summit at the White House next month to discuss what can \nbe done further to stop the threat of violent extremism.\n  This is a time when we should all be focusing on what we can do to \nstop the threat of terrorism in our country as well as the rest of the \nworld, so it is truly surprising, to say the least, that the House of \nRepresentatives will vote on a bill this week that threatens to shut \ndown the Department of Homeland Security. That is our government agency \nthat is responsible for protecting Americans from terrorism. What in \nthe world would lead the House of Representatives to threaten to shut \ndown this agency? We should not even be debating the Department of \nHomeland Security at this moment in history.\n  Every other government agency--every single one of them--has already \nbeen funded through the end of this fiscal year, September 30, and that \nis normal when we fund the government. But the Republicans in the House \nand Senate insisted weeks ago that the Department of Homeland Security \nonly be funded through the end of February. Why did they demand that \nthis critical agency that is responsible for keeping us safe across \nAmerica not be funded in the normal manner? Why did they put America at \nrisk with this type of funding? Well, because they wanted an \nopportunity early in the year--early in the legislative session--to \ntake a stand against President Obama's immigration policies. They feel \nso strongly about this, they are willing to put the Department of \nHomeland Security's budget at risk.\n  So this week the House Republicans are preparing to pass legislation \nthat would defund President Obama's immigration policies, including the \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, known as DACA. What is \nthat program? It puts on hold the deportations of immigrant students \nand children who grew up in this country and allows these young people \nto live and work legally in America on a temporary basis. That is what \nDACA is. These young people are well known to me and to most. They are \nknown as DREAMers.\n  It was 13 years ago that I introduced the DREAM Act. For 13 years I \nhave been trying to pass a bill into law which says that the sins of \nthe parents should not be visited on the children.\n  These young people who are affected by DACA and the DREAM Act--many \nof them were brought to the United States as infants and toddlers. They \nhad no voice in this family decision to come here. They did not know, \ncould not know, that one of their parents was undocumented. They grew \nup in America. They went to school in America. They participated in \nAmerica. They went to the neighborhood churches and mosques and \ntemples. They were the ones who were standing in their classroom every \nsingle day of their lives stopping for a solemn moment to\n\n[[Page S135]]\n\npledge allegiance to the American flag--the only flag they have ever \nknown. But the fact is, they were brought here as babies and children, \nand they were undocumented. They grew up in America. They identified \nthis country as home. They envisioned this dream of living here. Yet \nthey did not have a legal status.\n  The DREAM Act said we would give these young people a chance. If they \nhad a clean criminal record, if they would finish high school, if they \nwould go on to college or even enlist in our military, we would allow \nthem to move to legal status--give these DREAMers a chance.\n  Time and again, we called this legislation. Sadly, it never passed \nthe House and the Senate at the same time. Then President Obama decided \n2 years ago that he would use his Executive authority to protect these \nyoung people from being deported. We estimate there are about 2 million \nof them across the United States. He said to them: If you will come \nforward, pay your fee, go through a background check--if you are \nprepared to do that and register with the government, we will spare you \nfrom deportation. That is what the DACA program is. Mr. President, \n600,000 did. Mr. President, 600,000 came up with the money.\n  I can recall in the city of Chicago when we had the sign up--the very \nfirst sign up for this DACA Executive order. It was amazing. We did not \nknow if 200 people would show up or 400 or even 1,000. Well, the night \nbefore--at midnight, the night before we started signing them up--the \nfirst day they could sign up for DACA, the families started gathering, \nstanding outside at Navy Pier in downtown Chicago. They stood there all \nnight waiting for a chance to sign up for this program. Many of them \nwere parents accompanying their children. The parents themselves were \nnot going to get any direct benefit from this, but they wanted their \nkids to be spared the fear of deportation. They wanted to give their \nkids a chance. In the end, thousands came through the door--so many we \ncould not even handle the volume with our volunteer attorneys and many \nothers who were helping.\n  But it was a clear indication that these families wanted their \nchildren to have a chance--a chance to earn their way into legal status \nin America. That is the DACA----\n  (Disturbance in the Visitors' Galleries.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend until the Sergeant at \nArms has restored order in the galleries.\n  The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the young people I have described are \nknown as DREAMers. They were brought to the United States as children. \nThey grew up in this country, and they have overcome great obstacles to \ncontinue to live here. They are the future doctors, engineers, \nteachers, and soldiers who will make America stronger.\n  Now, in the last 2 years, as I mentioned, more than 600,000 DREAMers \nhave received DACA--this Executive order by President Obama which \nallows them to stay as long as they are registered, pay their fee, and \nnot be deported.\n  What has happened to these young people now that they have their \nchance, they have gone to school? I met 10 of them who are now at \nLoyola's school of medicine. They are extraordinary students. They were \nthe best of the best. They did not have a chance because they did not \nhave that document that gave them an opportunity to enroll. Well, they \nare going to school now, and they have pledged to continue to serve \nthis country as doctors, given that chance, in some of the poorest \ncommunities in my State and our Nation.\n  In past speeches I have given on this floor--over 50 of them--I have \nhighlighted the contributions that many DACA recipients already make to \nour country. They are working as engineers, small business owners, and \npublic school teachers. The Center for American Progress and the \nPartnership for a New American Economy has found that giving legal \nstatus to DREAMers will add $329 billion to our economy and create 1.4 \nmillion new jobs by 2030.\n  How can this be possible that 600,000 have that kind of impact? These \nare not ordinary young people or ordinary young graduates. These are \nextraordinary young people who want to be part of this Nation of \nimmigrants.\n  But the Republicans in the House of Representatives want to end DACA. \nThey want to put an end to this program. They argue it was \nunconstitutional for the President to say he would suspend deportation \nfor these young people. They want these young people to be deported, \nremoved from this country, sent back to countries where many of them \ncan never recall living, going to countries where they literally cannot \nspeak the language. That is the House Republican position. They feel so \nstrongly about deporting these young people, they are willing to hold \nthe Homeland Security funding bill hostage to force the Democrats to \nagree.\n  Well, let me be clear. Democrats will not be swayed by this kind of \nblackmail. We will insist the Department of Homeland Security be funded \nand that the President have the authority that every President has had \nto establish his own immigration policies within the limits of \nExecutive authority.\n  It is the height of unfairness. First congressional Republicans \nobstructed immigration reform legislation. Now they want to obstruct \nthe very agency responsible for homeland security.\n  It was more than a year and a half ago--the date was June 27, 2013--\non the floor of this Senate, we passed comprehensive immigration reform \nwith a strong bipartisan vote of 68 to 32. This bill--which I joined \nseven other colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, working on it--\nstrengthened our border to a level even greater than today, cracked \ndown on illegal immigration, protected American workers in a fair and \nhumane manner, and addressed the challenges facing 11 million \nundocumented workers currently living in our country.\n  But for the last year and a half, the House of Representatives, led \nby Speaker Boehner, has refused to allow a vote on the Senate's \nimmigration reform bill. Not once would they allow this bill to come to \nthe floor of the House for a vote. If Speaker Boehner had brought the \nbill to the floor, it would have passed with a strong bipartisan vote. \nHe knew it and he was determined not to ever let that happen. It was \nonly after the Speaker had demonstrated clearly to the President, to \nthe Senate, and to the American people that he would not even \nparticipate in the debate on immigration reform that President Obama \nissued his second order.\n  I have been involved in a lot of efforts to pass bipartisan \nimmigration reform legislation. It is so frustrating for us to have \nfinally passed a bill in the Senate--Democrats and Republicans; \nsupported by the AFL-CIO, representing organized labor; supported by \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, representing business; supported by \nvirtually every major faith in this country--and then to see it ignored \nand stopped in the House of Representatives.\n  So President Obama, after the election, announced that, having given \nthe Republicans in the House a chance to legislate, he would use his \npowers to try to fix our broken immigration system, to put on temporary \nhold the deportations of individuals who are the parents of U.S. \ncitizens or legal permanent residents, who have lived in our country \nfor years, and who pose no threat to America's safety.\n  This is clearly not amnesty, because at the end of the day, what the \nPresident has given is only a temporary reprieve to these people to \nstay and work in America--so long as they register and pay their fee, \nso long as they submit themselves regularly to criminal background \nchecks, and so long as they pay their fair share of taxes. This \ndeferred action status does not give them permanent status or \ncitizenship. It is not amnesty by any definition.\n  The President's Executive action will make America safer, bringing \nmillions of immigrants out of the shadows to register with the \ngovernment and to go through background checks. It will also help our \neconomy and American workers. You see, these undocumented workers, \nworking off the books, are many times paid much less than minimum wage, \nif they are paid at all, and they are competing with American workers. \nOnce they are brought out of the shadows under the President's recent \nExecutive order, they will need to\n\n[[Page S136]]\n\nbe paid the ongoing wages, the minimum wage of America. By bringing \nthese workers into the legal workforce, it will eliminate the unfair \ncompetition of the underground economy. And all of these workers will \nbe paying their taxes, which will increase tax revenues by billions of \ndollars each year.\n  The President's Executive action is also smart and realistic when it \ncomes to enforcing our immigration laws. It is not humanly possible to \ndeport all of the undocumented immigrants in this country. So every \nadministration has had to set priorities on those who will be deported \nand those who will not. The government should not waste its limited \nresources to deport immigrants who have lived and worked here for \nyears, who have children who are citizens or lawful permanent \nresidents, and who do not pose any threat to America's future. Instead, \nthe administration has made it a top priority to deport those who have \ncommitted serious crimes or are a threat to safety.\n  Now, Executive action on deportation is clearly lawful. Every single \nPresident--Democrat and Republican--every one of them since President \nDwight David Eisenhower has used his Executive authority to improve our \nimmigration system. This argument that it is somehow unconstitutional \njust does not bear basic scrutiny. The Supreme Court has repeatedly \naffirmed that the Federal Government has broad authority to decide whom \nto deport. President Obama is acting well within his legal authority \nwhen he establishes policies about whom will be deported by this \nadministration.\n  The American people have elected us to solve problems. Because the \nHouse Republican leadership has failed to reform our immigration \nsystem, the President had no choice but to use his authority under the \nlaw to improve our economy and security and keep families together and \nat least do a small part toward solving America's broken immigration \nsystem problems.\n  However you feel about the President's immigration policies, it is \nhypocritical and counterproductive--it is just wrong--to take out your \nfrustration by putting at risk critical homeland security funding.\n  I hope the House Republicans will somehow or another overcome this \nfit of pique that has led us to this moment and realize their first \nobligation is to this great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/12/senate-section/article/S136-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRATULATING GOVERNOR BRUCE RAUNER\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I was unable to attend the inauguration of \nthe new Governor of Illinois today. Bruce Rauner was elected November 4 \nto serve as the 42nd Governor of the State of Illinois.

I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Priorities of Senate Special Committee on Aging\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it has been my privilege to serve on the \nSenate Special Committee on Aging since my very first days in the \nSenate, and I am honored to have been elected to chair this committee \nfor the 114th Congress. I wish to welcome the Presiding Officer, \nSenator Cotton of Arkansas, to the committee. He will be a new member \non our committee, and I believe he will enjoy his service as much as I \nhave.\n  My service on the aging committee is particularly appropriate since \nMaine is the oldest State in the Nation by median age. Many people \nwould guess that Florida would have that distinction, but, in fact, it \nis the great State of Maine.\n  Throughout its history, the aging committee has spurred Congress to \naction on issues that are important to older Americans through its \nhearings, its investigations, and its reports. This is the first time a \nMaine Senator has chaired the committee since the 1990s, when my \npredecessor, mentor, and friend, Senator Bill Cohen, served as \nchairman.\n  I wish to share with my colleagues today my priorities for the \ncommittee as we begin this new Congress. I have three major priorities \nfor the committee's work: first, retirement security; second, \ninvestments in biomedical research targeting diseases that \ndisproportionately affect older Americans, such as Alzheimer's and \ndiabetes; and, third, protecting seniors against financial exploitation \nand scams.\n  I am increasingly concerned that our seniors will not have adequate \nsavings and other financial resources during their retirement years. \nThe committee will, therefore, focus on retirement security and, in \nparticular, on the need to encourage more savings and better financial \nplanning. According to the nonpartisan Center for Retirement Research \nat Boston College, there currently is an estimated $6.6 trillion gap \nbetween the savings Americans have today and what they should have in \norder to maintain their standard of living during retirement.\n  Nationally, one in four Americans has no source of income beyond \nSocial Security. In the State of Maine, the number is one in three. \nSocial Security provides an absolutely vital safety net. However, with \nan average benefit of just $16,000 a year, it certainly is not enough \nto finance a comfortable retirement for many Americans.\n  According to a Gallup survey published in 2012, more than half of all \nAmericans are worried they will not be able to maintain their standard \nof living in retirement. That is up sharply from 34 percent two decades \nago, and the Boston College analysis demonstrates that their concern is \nwarranted.\n  There are many reasons for the decline in retirement security facing \nAmerican seniors, including the demise of many defined benefit pension \nplans in the private sector; the severity of the recent financial \ncrisis, which wiped out much of the net worth of many\n\n[[Page S137]]\n\nseniors, at least temporarily; rising health care costs; the need for \nlong-term care; and, most of all, the simple fact that Americans are \nliving far longer than we used to. Many Americans reaching retirement \nage also have more debt than retirees of previous generations.\n  I remember when my parents paid off the mortgage on their home and \nhad a mortgage-burning party. Well, today, people who are the age my \nparents were when they paid off their house are taking on new debt and \nnew mortgages. We found in the aging committee that there are seniors \nwho are still paying off their student loans or the student loans of \ntheir children. These are all issues I look forward to the committee \nexploring in depth in this new Congress.\n  Another priority will be highlighting the importance of biomedical \nresearch on diseases such as Alzheimer's and diabetes, which take such \na devastating toll on older Americans and their families. Investments \nin biomedical research not only improve the health and longevity of \nAmericans but also provide benefits to our economy and to the Federal \nbudget.\n  For example, nearly one out of three Medicare dollars is spent \ntreating people living with diabetes. According to multiple economic \nanalyses, there is roughly a 2-to-1 return on investment in Federal \nsupport for biomedical research. This investment at the National \nInstitutes of Health and at research centers across the country spur \njob creation and are critical to America's competitiveness in the \nglobal research environment.\n  As the Senate cochair of the Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer's \nDisease, I am particularly committed to helping to spur breakthroughs \nin Alzheimer's disease, which has had such a devastating impact on 5.2 \nmillion Americans and their families. In addition to the suffering it \ncauses, Alzheimer's costs the United States an astonishing $214 billion \na year. That includes $150 billion in costs to the Medicare and \nMedicaid programs. These costs will only skyrocket as the baby boom \ngeneration ages.\n\n  Fortunately, there is promising research that holds hope for \nAlzheimer's patients and their families. The research community is \npoised to make important advances through clinical trials and \ninvestigating new therapeutic targets. But adequate funding is critical \nto advance this research and to achieve these breakthroughs.\n  At a time when the United States is spending more than $200 billion a \nyear for Alzheimer's patients, we are spending less than three-tenths \nof 1 percent of that amount--about $600 million a year--on research. \nSurely, we can do more for Alzheimer's, given its tremendous human and \neconomic price.\n  The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease has as its primary \ngoal the prevention and effective treatment of Alzheimer's by the year \n2025. To meet that goal, the chairman of the Federal Alzheimer's \nAdvisory Council says that we need to devote $2 billion a year to \nAlzheimer's research. Well, think about that. That is only 1 percent--\nin fact, it is less than 1 percent--of what we as a society are \nspending to care for people with Alzheimer's. That investment will lead \nto better treatments and ultimately to a means of prevention or even a \ncure for this awful and expensive disease.\n  The aging committee will also continue its focus on scams that target \nour seniors, such as the Jamaican lottery phone scam we exposed in the \nlast Congress. This nefarious scheme, which is estimated to have cost \nAmericans as much as $300 million a year, particularly targeted seniors \nin the Northeast. Some seniors in my State lost tens of thousands of \ndollars to the scam which involved a con artist calling a victim to \ntell him or her that they had won the Jamaican lottery but needed to \npay fees to process the winnings. I don't need to tell my colleagues \nthat these seniors had won nothing of the sort. But this was a very \nsophisticated scheme.\n  In addition to educating seniors to help them avoid becoming victims \nof such scams, the hearing resulted in the Jamaican Government passing \nnew laws targeting the scammers and prompted Federal law enforcement to \nmake several arrests. The aging committee will also continue its fraud \nhotline to help protect seniors from these kinds of scams and financial \nexploitation, and the phone number for that fraud hotline, which is \ntoll-free, is 1-855-303-9470.\n  In addition to these three major priorities, it is my hope our \ncommittee in the second year will also take a close look--really \nscrutinize--Federal programs designed to help our seniors, such as \nthose authorized by the Older Americans Act. We want to make sure these \nprograms are as effective and efficient as possible and that their \nbenefits reach those seniors as intended. So we will be performing that \noversight function and sharing our findings with the committee of \njurisdiction--the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee--on \nwhich I am also privileged to serve.\n  The Senate Special Committee on Aging has a long history and \ntradition of bipartisanship, and my work on this committee during the \npast Congress was particularly rewarding because of the strong \npartnership I forged with the committee chairman, the senior Senator \nfrom Florida, Bill Nelson. I look forward to continuing that bipartisan \ntradition with my good friend and close colleague, Senator Claire \nMcCaskill of Missouri, who will be serving as the committee's ranking \nmember in the 114th Congress.\n  Finally, I encourage the Presiding Officer and all of the other \nmembers of the committee not only to be active participants in the \ncommittee but also to share with us their thoughts on issues that we \nshould pursue.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor, and seeing no one \nseeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, I rise today in opposition to S. 1, \nwhich will circumvent the administration's official review process for \nprojects crossing international borders and approve construction of the \nKeystone XL Pipeline, a pipeline dedicated to increasing production of \nsome of the dirtiest, most polluting, and most dangerous crude oil in \nthe world.\n  Supporters of this pipeline in Congress have been relentless. Over \nthe last 2 Congresses they have held 44 votes in the House and Senate \nintended to approve Keystone. On Tuesday, the very first bill the new \nRepublican majority introduced, traditionally reserved for a party's \nhighest legislative priority, was Keystone. Think about this. Here we \nstand in what people still call the world's greatest deliberative body, \nand the first bill we are taking up is not infrastructure generally, \nnot national energy policy, not even national laws as they relate to \nour pipeline infrastructure. No, we are legislating about a specific \npipeline which will move oil from Canada through the United States to \nbe primarily exported from our southern border.\n  I understand there are people of good will and good faith, including \nthe Presiding Officer, who are on both sides of this issue. But it is \nhard to imagine why this should be the first piece of legislation we \ntake up in this Congress. We have yet to seriously consider or to \nclarify our policy with respect to the Islamic State. Income inequality \nis gutting the middle class. Our national infrastructure needs a jolt \nof investment. Our immigration policy is a failure and a mess. I do not \nunderstand why this would be S. 1.\n  Supporters of this bill have stood up three main arguments in favor \nof Keystone and expanding drilling of tar sands oil reserves in Canada. \nOne, they say it will increase energy security; two, they think it will \nlower oil and gas prices; third, they say it is a jobs bill.\n  Let's examine these claims, because however tenuous they were, they \nhave been undermined further by facts over the last couple of years.\n  First, the United States has never during the modern age of global \nenergy trade been more energy secure. We import far less oil from \nunstable regimes and unfriendly countries than we have in decades. We \nare continuing to build massive amounts of ever cheaper homegrown clean \nenergy such as wind\n\n[[Page S138]]\n\nand solar, even as we use our energy more efficiently.\n  The United States will add nearly 10 gigawatts of wind and solar \ncapacity in the next year. Not including hydro, the United States has \nover 85,000 megawatts of renewable energy capacity and continues to \nbuild on that number year over year. The prices for solar have dropped \n80 percent since 2008 and prices for wind power, which are already \ncompetitive with fossil fuels, have dropped 30 percent since 2008.\n  These trends are creating jobs right here at home. For example, the \nwind industry has over 500 manufacturing facilities across 44 States \nthat are responsible for making wind turbines with over 66 percent \ndomestic content.\n  Second, the recent collapse of crude oil and gasoline prices \ndemonstrates two things. In my home State of Hawaii, energy prices \nremain far too high. But on the mainland, oil and gas prices are \ncurrently very low. The idea that Keystone would make a significant \ndifference was never based in reality, but now it is just obvious. We \nhave low prices and the project has not even started.\n  Gasoline is now $2.21 a gallon. Crude oil prices have slipped below \n$50 a barrel. The last time gasoline prices were this low was in the \naftermath of the financial crisis. As a practical matter, it is not \nclear to me, and it is certainly not clear to most energy experts, how \nmoving oil from Canada through the United States and exporting refined \ncrude from the Gulf of Mexico would significantly reduce energy prices \nfor us in the United States.\n  Finally, this is called a jobs bill by some. This is many things. It \nis anti-clean air; it is anti-clean water; it is anti-public health. It \nis a regulatory earmark. But it is not a jobs bill. It is not deserving \nof being the No. 1 priority of the 114th Congress.\n  We have heard estimates ranging as high as 42,000 indirect or induced \njobs during the construction phase. We know, and everyone seems to \nagree, that Keystone will employ approximately 35 full-time employees \nwhen construction is finished. That is not 3,500 employees. That is not \n35,000 employees. That is the 35 full-time employees when construction \nis completed.\n  If we want to do a real jobs bill worthy of the Senate, we should do \na real jobs bill. An infrastructure bank, a highway bill, Shaheen-\nPortman--all would create orders of magnitude more jobs than this.\n  The American economy added 353,000 jobs in November alone, which made \n2014 the strongest year for job growth since 1999. If we pass a highway \nbill, we get millions of jobs. If we pass an infrastructure bank, we \nwill get hundreds of thousands of jobs. If we pass the bipartisan \nShaheen-Portman energy efficiency bill, we will also get hundreds of \nthousands of jobs. Look, even one new job is a good thing. But if we \nwant to do a jobs bill, let's do a jobs bill.\n\n  There is plenty of room for us to work together on infrastructure, on \nenergy efficiency, and create hundreds of thousands and even millions \nof jobs. But this is an energy bill. It moves us in the wrong \ndirection. There are colleagues, with whom I agree, who are arguing \nagainst this legislation primarily saying they want to allow the \nadministration's process to play out and that we should not supersede \nthe State Department review. I agree.\n  It is fair to say this is unprecedented, even a little strange, for \nthe Congress to legislate the specifics of a particular infrastructure \nproject. But I want to be clear. This is not a process argument for me. \nI oppose Keystone because it is a bad idea. Whether it is done through \nthe regular order or in an expedited fashion, whether it is done \nthrough the administrative process or the legislative process, I oppose \nany action, whether through legislation, litigation, or administrative \naction, that will enable the extraction of Canadian tar sands oil.\n  My reasons are very simple--climate change and math. Climate change, \nbecause it is the greatest and most urgent challenge to the health of \nour families, to the economy, and to our way of life. I want to \npreserve the American way of life, not endanger it. Math, because we \nhave crunched the numbers and we know we simply cannot afford to burn \nthe oil from tar sands and put its pollution into the air.\n  It is simple. We have a budget. Just as every family in this country \nmust stick to its budget and live within its means, we have to do the \nsame as a planet when it comes to carbon pollution. A new study \npublished last week in the scientific journal Nature makes this clear. \nThe authors asked the question: If we want to stay within our carbon \nbudget and limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius, which is the limit 167 \ncountries agree we must meet to avoid catastrophic effects of climate \nchange, how much more coal, gas, and oil can we burn?\n  The study finds that in order to meet this goal, the majority of the \nworld's known reserves of fossil fuel must stay in the ground between \nnow and 2050. This includes one-third of the world's current oil \nreserves and 80 percent of current coal reserves. It also finds, and \nthis is critical, that:\n\n       Any increase in unconventional oil production--\n\n  Which includes Canadian tar sands.\n\n     --is incommensurate with efforts to limit average global \n     warming to 2 degrees Celsius.\n\n  As we learn more about climate change amidst a clean energy \nrevolution, we find that moving toward clean energy, taking control of \nour future, is good for business. Our economy will do better. It will \ngrow faster and it will be more resilient if we embrace the \ntechnologies and solutions at our fingertips and end our reliance on \nfossil fuel. We have a chance to embrace the future here. Our future is \nnot tar sands oil. Our future is wind and solar and geothermal and \nenergy efficiency. Our future is not in adding carbon pollution. Our \nfuture is in innovating our way out of this problem. Throughout our \nhistory, America always leads when we are needed the most. That is what \nwe have to do, not in the direction of more carbon pollution but toward \na clean energy economy.\n  A report by New Climate Economy, a group chaired by former Mexican \nPresident Felipe Calderon, and including Bank of America chairman Chad \nHolliday, among others, marshals quantitative evidence to show that \naction on climate change is a requirement for future global economic \ngrowth. In other words, those who warn about the EPA regulation or \nprices on carbon killing jobs have it exactly backward. The truth is \nthat in order to avoid major disruptions to our economy, we have to \nreduce carbon pollution and work with other countries such as Canada to \nensure that they do the same.\n  I am looking forward to the open amendment process on this bill that \nthe majority leader has promised. It will be an opportunity for the \nAmerican public to see where Members of the Senate stand on the facts \nof climate change. Anyone who looks at the facts and does the math \nought to oppose this bill and oppose construction of the Keystone XL \nPipeline. For me and for many Americans, a vote against this bill is a \nvote to preserve and protect the air we breathe and the water we drink. \nIt is a vote to ensure that we continue to reduce carbon pollution and \nfight climate change. It is a vote to leave our children a healthy \nworld.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose cloture on the motion to proceed.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Entry-Exit Visa System\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, the attacks on the people of France \ndemonstrate in the most chilling terms the threats posed to Western \nnations by those who are imbued with Islamic terrorism. While there are \nmany factors that play into the spread of this jihadist ideology in the \nWest, it is time for an honest and plain admission that our open \nimmigration policies are ineffective and have failed to meet the \nminimum standards that are set by existing law in the United States.\n  This is something I have been dealing with for quite a number of \nyears--a decade really. We have laws that would improve dramatically \nour ability to identify and block terrorists from entering and staying \nin the country, but they are not funded and they are not\n\n[[Page S139]]\n\ncarried out and it is unacceptable, as I will point out.\n  Dozens of terrorists and terror plotters have been admitted to the \nUnited States on visas or are relying on broader networks to simply \nenter into our country, taking advantage of lax immigration policies. \nFor instance, the 9/11 attackers all came here on visas. A visa is a \ndocument that allows an individual to come for a limited period of time \nand then return to their home country. This visa system is essential in \na modern world, but it needs to be managed and carried out in an \neffective way.\n  The Boston bombers came as asylees, people seeking asylum, while \ntheir mosque was linked to foreign nationals tied to ISIS and foreign \nterrorists.\n  The individual behind the attempted Christmas bombing in Oregon was a \nrefugee. We have a class of individuals we accept each year who claim \nto be refugees from foreign countries. This one was from Somalia.\n  The recently foiled plot to bomb a courthouse and school in \nConnecticut was attempted by a Moroccan national who had a revoked \nstudent visa. Many individuals have visas to be students in the United \nStates. We are not managing that well at all. This one had a revoked \nstudent visa. It was revoked because of information that came to the \nattention of officials, but no one made an effort or successfully \nattempted in any real way to find the individual so he might be \ndeported.\n  Al Qaeda operatives who were apprehended in Kentucky were on visas \nfrom Iraq.\n  These are only some of the examples that are out there. These \nindividuals use lax visa policies, flawed asylum policies, flawed \nrefugee policies, and flawed border protection policies. In addition, \nwe are not organized in a way that works effectively. In addition to \nthat, the President of the United States has directed his ICE officers, \nhis Citizenship and Immigration Services officers, and his Border \nPatrol officers, who are the key individuals in this system, to conduct \ntheir business in a way that guarantees failure. That is just the fact.\n  The 9/11 Commission--we all remember that great Commission after the \nterrible attack on 9/11--zeroed in on our lax immigration policies. \nAmong other things, the Commission demanded implementation of a \nbiometric entry-exit visa system. What does that mean? That means a \nbiometric system where people are identified effectively through \nfingerprints or some other identifier.\n  I have been through this for years. Back when President Bush was \nPresident and we worked with Homeland Security, Governor Ridge was the \nSecretary of Homeland Security. I think at the end he was finally \nconvinced, and I worked on him very hard. But he volunteered, the last \nday in office, to use a fingerprint biometric system. It should have \nalready been done by the time President Bush left office, but it \nwasn't, and it hasn't been done yet. We need a system that works.\n  By the way, police officers have in their cars all over America \ncomputer-type screens where they can stop someone on the road, they can \nask them to put their hand on the screen, and it reads their \nfingerprints. It checks the National Crime Information Center to find \nout whether the person is wanted for murder in New York. He might have \ncaught him in Texas. It lets the officer know whether there are \nwarrants out for these individuals. This is the way the system works in \nour country, and we need to use it with regard to people who come here \non visas.\n  It is an outrage that this hasn't been done, completed fully, and \nmade operational years ago. It is an outrage. It is in the law of the \nUnited States. Congress has funded money for this project and it has \nnot yet been done. It will cost us in the future, as the 9/11 \nCommission has so warned. The 9/11 Commission demanded this system, and \nit is designed to track those entering and departing the United States \non visas.\n  By the way, almost half of the people, at least 40-plus percent now \nof individuals unlawfully in America entered on a visa. In other words, \nthey didn't come across the border unlawfully. They came lawfully--\nperhaps using false documents, but they got a visa. They came to the \nUnited States maybe lawfully, but they just did not return to their \nhome country when the visa expired.\n  My colleagues have to know no one is checking. We have no idea \nwhether they left the country or stayed in the country. We do not have \nan operable exit visa system. This is so bizarre because it is not \nexpensive. It can be implemented rapidly. It will work and give us \nvaluable information that we must have if we are serious about this \nprocess, and we must be serious about the process.\n  The individuals in France--I mentioned the ones in the United \nStates--left the country, went through Yemen, apparently, were trained \nin some sort of terrorist camp, and came back and executed their \nviolent acts in France. So we have to do a better job of this, and we \ncan do it.\n  President Obama's administration has refused to implement the entry-\nexit system as required by law. We have talked about this publicly and \ndebated it for years. Just last year the co-chairs of the 9/11 \nCommission, in an evaluation of how well the recommendations they made \nback after 9/11 have been carried out--a 10-year review of how their \nreport had been received and how much of it had been accomplished--\nissued this written statement.\n\n       Without exit-tracking, our government does not know when a \n     foreign visitor admitted to the United States on a temporary \n     basis has overstayed his or her admission.\n\n  Here is the language. We put it on a chart because it is important \nthat we understand this.\n\n       Without exit-tracking, our government does not know when a \n     foreign visitor admitted to the United States on a temporary \n     basis has overstayed his or her admission. Had this system \n     been in place before 9/11, we would have had a better chance \n     of detecting the plotters before they struck. . . . There is \n     no excuse for the fact that 13 years after 9/11 we do not \n     have this much capability in place.\n\n  Amen. That is exactly correct. That is from ``Reflections on the \nTenth Anniversary of the 9/11 Commission Report,'' Thomas H. Kean and \nLee H. Hamilton, in 2014.\n  In fact, the original report said this:\n\n       The Department of Homeland Security, properly supported by \n     the Congress, should complete, as quickly as possible, a \n     biometric entry-exit screening system.\n\n  That was the report from 2004. It is a very important report. They \nwent to great length to help this Nation figure out what is the \nresponsible thing to do to protect ourselves better from those \nattackers on 9/11, many of whom were visa overstayers. They didn't come \nacross the border unlawfully; they came across on a lawful visa. Some \nof them I think had false documentation to get that visa, but they came \non a visa, for the most part lawfully, and did not go home as they were \nrequired to go home. They overstayed their visa. Nobody knew they had \noverstayed. Nobody made an inquiry about it.\n  The ``Tenth Anniversary Report Card: The Status of the 9/11 \nCommission Recommendations,'' by Thomas H. Kean and Lee H. Hamilton, \n2011, said this:\n\n       Full deployment of the biometric exit component of US-VISIT \n     should be a high priority. Such a capability would have \n     assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in August \n     and September 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 \n     hijackers that were in the U.S. on expired visas.\n\n  This would have helped. Indeed, of course, those of us who have some \nexperience in law enforcement know that when you get to one or two of \nthe guys, the whole scheme may get disrupted, and we can penetrate the \norganization and break it up and stop crime from occurring. To me, it \nis mind boggling, as the commission leaders have told us, that we \nhaven't completed this.\n  I am told there are forces that don't like the exit visa system. They \nthink it might slow things down a little bit. First, this is not \ncorrect. When you come into the country, you are clocked in and you are \nbiometrically fingerprinted. What would you have to do when you leave? \nGo to the airport, go in a certain line, go through, show your ticket, \nshow your passport, put your hand on a biometric screener, you are \nread, and you are approved to leave. It is not going to take any \nmassive amounts of time. One excuse after the other has slowed this \ndown, and it is not acceptable. We have to do better.\n  In fact, the administration has suspended enforcement of the visa \nsystem almost entirely. We have to understand, colleagues: If we don't \nhave even an exit visa system where we know\n\n[[Page S140]]\n\nwho left the country, how do we know who overstayed and who stayed in \nthe country? Unless somebody overstays their visa and they are caught \nfor speeding and the police officer identified that, I will ask \ncolleagues, what happens? Under the policy of this President of the \nUnited States, directed to the lowest officers in America, nothing \nhappens. If the individual does not commit a serious felony, they will \nnot be processed for deportation, even though they have come to the \ncountry on a promise to leave on a certain date and flatly refused to \ndo so.\n  This is not acceptable. If we don't have a system that has integrity, \nthen everybody gets the message pretty soon: Just get a visa, come to \nAmerica, you never have to leave. If you don't get a felony charge \nagainst you, you are never going to be deported.\n  This is the policy of this government at this very moment. It is hard \nfor anybody to believe, but that is the truth. We have approximately 5 \nmillion visa overstays in the United States. But as the National ICE--\nImmigration Customs Enforcement--officers Council president Chris Crane \nhas explained:\n\n       ICE agents are now prohibited from arresting illegal aliens \n     solely on charges of illegal entry or visa overstay.\n\n  What a dramatic statement that is. And not only visa overstays, they \nare prohibited from arresting and removing people who came across the \nborder illegally. That is what he means by illegal entry or visa \noverstays.\n  This of course removes a cornerstone of integrity in any law system. \nIf we can't look people in the eye and say: We give you a visa, you \nhave a 6-month visa, but at 6 months you have to return to your home \ncountry, and mean it, and say: Eventually you will be apprehended and \ndeported if you don't--then the system has no integrity. That is where \nwe are today.\n  Unsurprisingly, ABC News reported that the Obama administration had \nlost track of 6,000 foreign students who had overstayed their visas and \nwere of ``heightened concern.''\n  In other words, these 6,000 had some special concern in their \nbackground that made us worry about them, whether it was drugs or \nterrorism or whatever. Of course they have lost sight of them. They are \nnot attempting to find them.\n  So the head of the union representing U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services officers, one of the three major components of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security dealing with immigration, Mr. Ken \nPalinkas, was explicit in his warning to us. It is remarkable what Mr. \nCrane has said and now what Mr. Palinkas has said:\n\n       There is no doubt that there are already many individuals \n     in the United States, on visas--expired or active--who are \n     being targeted for radicalization or who already subscribe to \n     radicalized views. Many millions come legally to the U.S. \n     through our wide open immigration policy every year--whether \n     as temporary visitors, lifetime immigrants, refugees, asylum-\n     seekers, foreign students, or recipients of our ``visa waiver \n     program'' which allows people to come and go freely. Yet our \n     government cannot effectively track these foreign visitors \n     and immigrants.\n\n  This is the man whose officers do this job. They are the ones who \napprove the visas and manage this system.\n  He went on to warn that the President's so-called Executive amnesty \nwould make the situation radically worse, saying:\n\n       I write today to warn the general public that this \n     situation is about to get exponentially worse--and more \n     dangerous. . . . Express your concern to your Senators and \n     Congressmen before it is too late.\n\n  It is a national security imperative to stop this Executive amnesty. \nIt sends exactly the wrong message. What it says is that if you can get \ninto America--through the border, by boat, by plane, on a visa--any way \nyou get into this country and pass the border, you are not going to be \nasked to leave unless you commit some felony--some serious felony, for \nthat matter. Many felonies don't qualify. And we have over 100,000 \npeople who have committed serious felonies who have been released into \nAmerica. We don't know where they are, and they are not going to be \ndeported.\n  We have to restore immigration enforcement, establish better controls \nand screening on immigration from high-risk regions of the world. We \nreally should give more attention to that. It is perfectly legitimate.\n  The visa system, the immigration system of the United States, should \nserve who? It should serve the interests of the American people. \nSomebody doesn't have a constitutional right to come to America. The \ndecision is whether America feels like it is in its interests. We have \nalways accepted a large number of people. In fact, we have the largest \nimmigration numbers of any nation in the world. We admit 1 million a \nyear lawfully. When they come from high-risk areas of the world, \nterrorist states, we should indeed give more scrutiny to those \napplicants.\n  Census data shows that legal immigration to the United States from \nthe Middle East is one of the largest and fastest growing categories of \nnew admittances. For the national security of the United States, it is \nimperative that Congress block Executive amnesty and restore essential \nenforcement, basic bread-and-butter law enforcement. Anyone who claims \nto be concerned about our national security should be resolutely \nfocused on this task. There is so much that can be done with relatively \nlittle difficulty if we have the leadership and will to get it done.\n  It would be unthinkable for the President to veto the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill in order to continue this illegal and \ndangerous amnesty scheme during a time of growing threats abroad.\n  Again, let me say that this: the entry-exit visa system is an \nunappreciated, important part of American immigration law. It is \ncritical to the national security of the United States, as the 9/11 \nCommission has so stated on more than one occasion. We can do this. Why \nis it not being done? What forces, what special interests, are \ninterceding between the people of the United States, the national \ninterests, and their special interests that block this kind of system?\n  We can make it work. It is not that hard. We need a biometric system, \nand that system should be founded on the fingerprint. It took us a \nnumber of years, but I think the government has finally concluded it \nmust be the fingerprint for a lot of reasons, one of which is if \nsomebody got a visa to the United States and they committed a murder, \nan armed robbery, a terrorist act, a major fraud, and a warrant was \nissued for their arrest--if you don't clock it in at the airport, who \nknows when they are leaving? So this would pick it up and would pick up \nany warrants that might be outstanding for those individuals anywhere \nin the United States that are put in the NCIC, National Crime \nInformation Center.\n  That is the way the system should work. It is long overdue. In the \ncourse of the discussions we will have in the weeks and months to come \nabout the necessity of fixing a broken immigration system, the entry-\nexit visa system has to be implemented. It is long overdue. We can make \nit happen. It is not that expensive. It is relatively inexpensive, \nactually, and it will make us much safer in the process.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, here we are at the beginning of a new \nyear and a new Congress, and I think we all feel a responsibility to do \nwhat the American people voted for in the November 2014 election, which \nis to come together in this body and in this Congress and work together \nto find sensible solutions to the very real problems facing Americans.\n\n[[Page S141]]\n\n  It is no secret that the last 6 years have been pretty tough for a \nlot of people who are out of work or doing part-time work; kids \ngraduating from high school, graduating from college, graduating from \ncommunity schools, 2-year schools; going back and getting new training \nand still unable to find meaningful jobs; finding jobs that are part \ntime, two or three of those together; parents trying to save money, pay \nthe mortgage, save money to send the kids to postgraduate school. It \nhas not been easy. So we have come to a point where we have legislation \nin a new session of Congress, with commitments on a bipartisan basis to \nstand together, to work together, to try to find solutions, to get \npeople back to work and get our economy moving again. Now we come to \nthe very first issue up for discussion and debate and hopefully passage \nin this new Congress--the Keystone Pipeline.\n  This is an issue that has been going on for 6 years. The President \nhas been obstinate in his obstruction in letting this go forward, in \nmaking a decision. Yet here we are, finally, with an opportunity to not \nonly pass legislation which has passed the House of Representatives, \nagain, just last week with very significant bipartisan support--but now \nin the Senate to take up this legislation and to move it forward \ntonight with this vote, to start the process to allow amendments, to \nallow debate, and to move forward and hopefully enjoy bipartisan \nsupport with over 60 votes and then move it to final passage and then \nsend it to the President for, hopefully, signing.\n  This project is the largest, ready-to-build infrastructure project in \nthe United States. It supports tens of thousands of jobs. The estimate \nhas been well over 42,000. It invests billions of dollars in the \nAmerican economy. It increases revenue to States and local governments, \nall without spending one dime of taxpayer money. This is a private \nsector initiative that can be of great benefit to our country. It can \nprovide meaningful jobs and has many benefits for us in the future.\n  It is supported by Democrats, by Republicans, and by a number of \nlabor unions. For instance, the Indiana State Building and Construction \nTrade Council, which represents 75,000 working Hoosiers in my State, \nreached out to me recently and asked me to support construction of the \nKeystone Pipeline, calling it ``an important job creation and energy \nsecurity issue.'' They are right on the mark. They know I have been a \nlongtime supporter of this effort, but they wanted to put it in \nwriting. I am not sure it was necessary, and they weren't weighing this \non the basis of Republican or Democrat, liberal or conservative; they \nwere saying that this is good for us and we hope all of our Senators \ncan support it. We hope it passes. This is an initiative that puts our \npeople to work. Other labor unions, including the North America's \nBuilding Trade Unions and the Laborers' International Union of North \nAmerica support this project.\n  I mentioned the President, for 6 years, has come up with more feeble \nexcuses in terms of why he believes this should not go forward. The \nlast excuse was: We are in a process here and the process has to go \nforward. That process was waiting, apparently, on the Nebraska Supreme \nCourt approval of the pipeline route through Nebraska, and that was his \nexcuse for why he would have to veto it. I am sure my colleagues now \nhave the word that the Nebraska Supreme Court has upheld State approval \nof the Keystone Pipeline. In fact, the President's own State \nDepartment, in response to numerous calls for environmental studies--\nall of which were used as an excuse for not going forward--the \nPresident's own State Department has repeatedly approved this, saying \nit will not have a negative environmental imprint.\n  So what could possibly be the reason the President remains \nintransigent on this particular issue, because every other box has been \nchecked? We have to come down to the inevitable conclusion that it is \nall political, that an extreme environmental wing of the President's \nown party is simply putting untold pressure on him to not go forward \nwith anything having to do with fossil fuels or providing energy \nsecurity for America from our own resources. After all, a significant \nportion comes from Montana and North Dakota--and the last time I \nchecked they are in the United States--and from our friendly neighbor \nto the north, Canada. If this doesn't go through, we will keep \nimporting large quantities of oil from the Middle East. We know what \ncomplications there are in terms of securing that oil and how much \nvolatility occurs there based on what is happening today in the Middle \nEast.\n  So getting this product from our Northern States of North Dakota and \nMontana and getting this product from our friend to the north, Canada, \nsimply makes a great deal of sense in terms of our energy security, our \nenergy supplies, and lessening our reliance on the volatility that \ncomes from getting oil from other sources.\n  To conclude, let me just make it clear what it is we are trying to \ndo. This will help the United States diversify its energy supply. It \nwill offset our dependence on Middle East oil. It will support tens of \nthousands of American jobs in construction. It will invest billions of \ndollars in the American economy. It will increase revenue to State and \nlocal governments. It will not harm our environment, as numerous \nstudies have indicated--all these benefits without spending a dime of \ntaxpayer money.\n  So after 6 years of delay, procrastination, and evermore feeble \nexcuses, it is time for the President to make a decision. Soon he will \nhave an opportunity to use that pen he so famously talked about not to \nsign a veto or to declare a veto but to sign a bill approving the \nKeystone Pipeline into law.\n  I strongly support construction of this pipeline and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his request?\n  Mr. COATS. I certainly will. I didn't see my colleague. I am happy to \ndo so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I am happy I was here for the comments of \nmy colleague from Indiana on the Keystone Pipeline and, similar to the \nSenator from Indiana, I am also happy to finally have this debate. The \ncomments he made are very sincere and passionately believed. I accept \nthat. I only challenge one aspect of the comments, which is the \nsuggestion that opposition of Keystone is feeble or only for political \nreasons.\n  I am a pro-energy Senator. The first bill I introduced in the 114th \nCongress was a bill I am cosponsoring with Senator Barrasso of Wyoming \nto expedite American exports of liquid natural gas, but I am an \nopponent of Keystone on environmental and economic grounds, and I wish \nto spend a few minutes describing why.\n  To begin with, it can probably be summed up in a question: Why \nembrace dirty energy when America is in the midst of a clean energy \nrevolution? That is a primary reason I oppose Keystone. The United \nStates, thank goodness, is on a clean energy roll. Not only are we on a \nclean energy roll, we are on an energy production roll that is helping \nour economy, helping our trade deficit, and hurting some of our most \nsignificant global adversaries, notably Russia and Iran.\n  We have embraced over the last few years a set of conservation and \nefficiency investments, probably most notably the increased CAFE \nstandards that have saved energy use in the vehicle sector as well as \nhelped the American auto industry significantly rebound. Our natural \ngas revolution, of which I am a strong supporter, has enabled American \nindustry and consumers to get lower priced energy, and it has enabled \nus to lessen our dependence on dirtier fuels in the production of \nelectric power and other aspects of our power usage. Wind and solar and \nother noncarbon energy developments have rocketed ahead. Nearly one-\nthird of the energy that has been added to the American electricity \ngrid since 2005 has been in the wind and solar area. We are one of the \nfew nations in the world that in the period from 2005 to 2012 actually \nsaw a reduction in our carbon emissions.\n  We are on a clean energy roll. We are innovating for the world and we \nare selling technologies to the rest of the world and that is good for \nour economy as well as good for the environment.\n  We are also asserting American energy leadership not just in the \nadvances in clean energy but also in the significant advances in \nAmerican energy production. I think we should feel\n\n[[Page S142]]\n\ngood about the fact that we are a country that has gone from being one \nof the greatest net importers of energy in the world to now a country \nthat is going to be one of the greatest energy producers in the world, \nand in many energy areas we are now a net exporter. So emissions are \ngoing down. Production and exports are going up.\n  The other thing that is great for Americans is that prices are going \ndown. A barrel of oil right now is in the $50-a-barrel range, which is \nputting about $1,000 a year back into the pockets of an American \nfamily. It is helping American businesses, and it is imposing, as I \nmentioned earlier, some significant harm upon two of our most \npersistent global adversaries--Iran and Russia--that rely on energy \nexports to drive their economy.\n  This energy revolution--higher production, greater economic \nefficiency, greater cleanliness--has all been happening without the \nKeystone Pipeline. It has all been happening without the United States \nembracing tar sands oil. We are going in the right direction now. I \noppose the Keystone Pipeline because accelerating the use of tar sands \noil turns us around. Instead of going in the right direction to more \nproduction, more national security and greater emissions control, the \nKeystone Pipeline accelerates tar sands oil and takes us in the wrong \ndirection. Simply put, tar sands oil and the exploitation of that \nresource is a bad bet for the environment and, I believe, a bad bet for \nthe economy.\n\n  Last month, December 2014, a magazine I really like that normally has \na lot of articles about the outdoors, Outside magazine, ran a lengthy \narticle on the area of Canada in Alberta where tar sands are mined. The \narticle is called ``The High Cost of Oil.''\n  To anyone who is interested in this debate--pro, con or undecided--go \nonline to Outside magazine, December 2014, ``The High Cost of Oil,'' \nand read what the mining of tar sands oil does to this part of Canada \nand to this planet.\n  Tar sands oil is not like conventional gas or petroleum. Tar sands \noil, the mining and refining and production of it, produces about 15 to \n20 percent more greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy than \nconventional petroleum. Natural gas produces dramatically less \nCO2 than conventional petroleum, but tar sands oil produces \ndramatically more. If you care about the emissions of CO2--\nand I think we should all care about the emissions of CO2 \nbecause I accept the science that says CO2 emissions cause \nsignificant climate effects--if you care about CO2 \nemissions, then tar sands oil is absolutely the worst thing that can be \ndone.\n  Over the 2 years now that I have been in the Senate, I have had a lot \nof folks come to me and talk to me about Keystone. They never say a \nword about greenhouse gas or CO2 emissions--not a word. \nSenator Coats didn't say a word in his comments about CO2 or \ngreenhouse gas emissions. I ask individuals, when they come and talk to \nme about Keystone: What do you think about CO2 emissions? \nWhat do you think about the fact that tar sands oil is significantly \nmore carbon dense than normal petroleum? The response I find myself \ngetting is: I don't know; I am not a scientist. In fact, I heard that \nfrom an energy CEO who employs tons of scientists in his organizations: \nI don't know; I am not a scientist.\n  The scientific consensus I believe is very clear. We have to do what \nwe can--not drastically and dramatically but in an incremental way--\nevery day to bring down our CO2 emissions. I believe we need \nto do that in smart ways. Yet, from an emissions standpoint, tar sands \noil goes exactly in the wrong direction. It is not just CO2 \nemissions. Tar sands oil also involves the mining of it. I would \nencourage you to read this article. It involves scraping up vast \nacreages of an arboreal forest in Alberta to get to the tar sands \nunderneath. So far, an area about the size of the State of Rhode Island \nhas been completely despoiled to look like a moonscape to get to tar \nsands, and this will significantly accelerate the more tar sands are \nbuilt.\n  In the area of Alberta where the mining and refining is taking place, \nthere has been a dramatic increase in respiratory illness and other \nillnesses associated either with airborne emissions or with the \ncontamination of the area's water supply.\n  Probably one of the most powerful things about the article is not the \nlengthy analysis, not the words, it is the pictures. The pictures in \nthat article are staggering. When you see what has to be done to these \narboreal forests to mine tar sands oil, you come back to this question: \nWhy would we embrace a dirtier technology when America is on a clean-\nenergy revolution that is driving down prices, driving up production, \nand also driving down emissions.\n  Tar sands oil takes us in the wrong direction. It is not so much \nabout the pipeline. We rely on pipelines in this country, but it is \nabout the acceleration of the development of a resource that, frankly, \njust doesn't need to be developed.\n\n  I will conclude and say this. Some say--and I made this argument--\nwell, look, it is going to be mined anyway and refined anyway. If the \npipeline doesn't go through the United States, it will go westward or \neastward through Canada or another direction. I am not completely sure \nthat is correct. The article in Outside discusses the fact that \nCanadians, who know this better than anybody because they live in the \nneighborhood, are fighting against pipelines being built in Canada. \nThere is also the matter with oil now at a significantly lower price \nthan it has been. Even the economics of this tar sands oil, which is \npretty expensive because of what you have to do to refine it, may not \nmake any sense. But even if we set those arguments aside and somebody \nsays to me, why shouldn't the United States just give the big green \nlight to tar sands oil because somebody is going to get it, the reason \nI think we shouldn't is the United States is showing the world right \nnow what it means to be an energy leader.\n  With increased production, lower emissions, lower prices through \ninnovation--through American innovation--we are showing the world what \nit means to be an energy leader. We are a leader because we have \nembraced a simple effort.\n  I am not an engineer, but as I look at what happened in innovation in \nthe last decade, the ethic we have embraced is: Let's do it cleaner \ntomorrow than today. That is pretty simple. Let's do it cleaner \ntomorrow than today--not dramatically cleaner. It doesn't have to turn \nday and night from today to tomorrow. Let's just get a little bit \ncleaner tomorrow than today.\n  That is what we have been doing as a Nation. It has been increasing \nsupply. It has been driving down demand. It has been driving down \nprices. It has been helping us control emissions. That is what we \nshould keep doing. I am a pro-energy Senator, but I am a deep skeptic \nabout the use of tar sands oil. For that reason, I am glad we are going \nto have the debate. I think we should finally be at it. But I am going \nto oppose the Keystone Pipeline because tar sands oil is going \nbackwards and not forwards. We are showing the world what it means to \ngo forward, and that is the direction we should continue to go.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so \nordered\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, we are going to be voting shortly on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 1, the Keystone XL Pipeline. I am here to urge \nmy colleagues to vote no on that motion to proceed. We had a couple of \nchances to come to the Senate floor already today and last week and \ntalk about the important issue of energy development in the United \nStates and how we move our country forward with job creation and energy \ndevelopment. The President--we got to hear his remarks and certainly we \nrespect people's points of view that this issue is an issue we have had \na lot of time to discuss.\n  Mr. President, the issue is whether the American public and people in \naffected States have had a lot of time to talk about this issue and \nwhether they have had a transparent process to talk about this issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article that\n\n[[Page S143]]\n\nwas in USA TODAY whose headline is ``Permit problems plague Keystone XL \npipeline's S.D. leg.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From USA Today, Jan. 7, 2015]\n\n         Permit Problems Plague Keystone XL Pipeline's S.D. Leg\n\n                          (By John Hultjhult)\n\n       The South Dakota Public Utilities Commission on Tuesday \n     voted down a move by tribal and environmental groups to force \n     a reboot to the Keystone XL pipeline's state-level permitting \n     process. (http://www\n.argusleader.com/story/news/2015/01/06/sd-permit-keystone-xl-\nstill-question/21359367/)\n       PUC commissioners said there are clear questions about \n     whether South Dakota's stretch of the massive and \n     controversial project is still due the construction permit it \n     earned in 2010, given a series of changes to its original \n     scope.\n       The 2014 version of the pipeline would be able to carry \n     crude from North Dakota, for example, along with the \n     anticipated crude extracted from tar sands in Alberta, \n     Canada.\n       Even so, commissioners ruled that forcing pipeline owner \n     TransCanada to start over without being offered a chance to \n     explain how it could make those changes while meeting its old \n     obligations would be a denial of due process.\n       ``We need to go through the process to find out,'' \n     Commissioner Chris Nelson said.\n       TransCanada asked for re-certification of its 2010 \n     construction permit in September. The company had to ask for \n     re-certification because four years had passed since the \n     permit was granted.\n       The pipeline stalled as President Obama chose Tuesday to \n     delay the issuance of a federal permit indefinitely, a move \n     that has frustrated supporters, who say the project will add \n     jobs and boost energy security. If completed, the Keystone XL \n     pipeline would release more than 800,000 barrels of oil a \n     day.\n       The GOP-controlled Senate is expected to take up the issue \n     this week.\n       In a new application for the 313 miles of pipeline planned \n     for South Dakota, the company notes 30 changes to the \n     original project, including the addition of North Dakota oil, \n     minor route changes, alterations to construction plans and \n     costs.\n       The Yankton Sioux Tribe filed a motion to dismiss the \n     company's application based on those changes, saying the re-\n     certification process is meant for projects that have been \n     delayed, not those that have altered dramatically in scope.\n       The permit was issued with a set of 50 conditions, which \n     were based on the project as approved four years ago.\n       Thomasina Real Bird, a lawyer for the Yankton Sioux Tribe, \n     told commissioners that the changes to the pipeline are \n     simply too significant to allow the company to apply for re-\n     certification.\n       The company isn't just asking to re-certify a stalled \n     project, she said.\n       ``They're going a step beyond, and that step is not allowed \n     by law,'' Real Bird said.\n       Several others spoke in support of the Yankton Sioux \n     Tribe's motion to dismiss, including Kimberly Craven of the \n     Indigenous Environmental Network.\n       ``I would urge the commission to start over,'' Craven said. \n     ``It's a new permit, a new ballgame.''\n       Bill Taylor, a lawyer for TransCanada, told commissioners \n     that re-certification is meant to determine whether delayed \n     projects still fall within the scope of an old permit. \n     Dropping a re-certification request because a project changes \n     renders the re-certification process pointless.\n       Keystone XL has changed, but Taylor said the company is \n     prepared to prove that it still meets each of the 50 \n     conditions attached to its 2010 approval. The pipeline is \n     still a pipeline, the product is the same, and the end result \n     is more energy security for the U.S., Taylor said.\n       ``The current iteration of the project can and will meeting \n     the conditions upon which the permit is issued,'' Taylor \n     said.\n       The PUC voted 3-0 to deny the motions to dismiss the \n     application brought by the Yankton Sioux Tribe and joined by \n     others. The hearing on the merits of the re-certification is \n     planned for May.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. This is an article that just recently appeared in the \npaper about how South Dakota is bringing up objections to the pipeline, \nand they want to do due process with their public utility commission to \nmake sure this project meets the criteria of environmental and safety \nconcerns and security concerns that State wants to see met.\n  The reason this is still an issue in South Dakota is because part of \nthe pipeline will go through South Dakota. There have been many changes \nsince the original proposal was put forth, and people in South Dakota \nwant to know exactly what these changes are and exactly how they will \ngo through the process. In fact, one Native American tribe \nrepresentative who was objecting said:\n\n       The company is not just asking to recertify its old \n     project. They are going a step beyond that that is not \n     allowed by law.\n\n  So there are people who want them to go through the normal process \nbecause siting of a pipeline of this nature is of great concern to \nlocal residents, to property owners.\n  I find it interesting that in the debate on this issue, we on this \nside of the aisle are the ones who are advocating and standing up for \nproperty owners to make sure there is not a taking of their property \nwithout a transparent process and input for that process because that \nis exactly what transpired here when the company, with the help of the \nState of Nebraska, did not continue to proceed through their public \nservice commission, their public utility commission, and instead tried \nto pass a law saying that the environmental review and security issues \nand oversight could be done by the Governor.\n  Now, my colleagues who are Governors know that when you are Governor, \nyou do not have the most transparent process. It is not as if citizens \nare going to come to hearings in the Governor's office. It is not as \nthough all of that is there for review. Certainly those citizens do not \nhave the ability to object and make sure they are getting the right \ncompensation for their property and make sure issues of safety and \nsecurity are addressed.\n  So that is why some private property owners sued. Because the \nlegislature and the Governor did not have the right to act; the law \ntaking the power away from the utility commission and giving it to the \nGovernor was unconstitutional. The separation of powers is divided \nbetween the Governor and their public service commission. It is the job \nof those UTCs--utilities and transportation commissions around the \ncountry--to protect the interests of the public in the siting of these \nfacilities. That this authority was now moved up through the \nlegislature to the Governor to decide all of that was clearly something \nthat was not constitutional. I find it very interesting that four of \nthe seven supreme court justices said, in fact, yes, that law passed by \nthe legislature was not constitutional.\n  So my question is, What is the hurry? Now that this issue, based on \nstanding and the other justices not deciding, has the process to move \nforward, Congress feels some sort of urgency to be a siting commission \nand site a pipeline that has, No. 1, failed to go through the public \nprocess in the State of Nebraska; No. 2, has a public process now being \nquestioned in the State of South Dakota, raising concern and urgency \nthat those issues of the public be addressed; and No. 3, goes over what \nthe President of the United States has said he wants to follow as a due \nprocess and make sure all the issues are brought to the table.\n  I will remind my colleagues that if everybody here had their way, the \nPresident would have approved the original Keystone XL pipeline route. \nCongress thought they should stick their hands in the middle of this \nsiting and land use issue and put in legislative language on a passed \nbill by the Congress saying the President, if it was a national \nsecurity interest, must decide and site the Keystone Pipeline. Thank \nGod those at the State Department and the White House decided that was \nnot such a smart idea because that current pipeline went through a \nmajor aquifer that served eight States and posed a great deal of \nconcern to landowners, farmers, residents, and various individuals \nabout that particular proposal.\n  So if this body would have had its way before--those who support this \npipeline--they would have pressured the President to approve what is \nnow a defunct, horrible idea of what was proposed by TransCanada. So \nnow I ask my colleagues, are you sure all of the issues have been \naddressed here at the local level? Because clearly there are people in \nNebraska and people in South Dakota who do not think so.\n  Last I checked, our job is not to site pipelines; our job is to move \nour country forward on an energy strategy that will produce jobs, \ndiversify our resources, and make the United States a leader in energy.\n  I know my colleagues feel as if we will get a chance to address a lot \nof issues if we do move forward in a debate, and I am sure there will \nbe many on many sides. I question whether we shouldn't be spending our \ntime focusing on a bipartisan energy bill with lots of support on a \nwhole myriad of\n\n[[Page S144]]\n\nothers issues we need to work on, as we did in 2007, to make sure we \nare helping in the transformation of energy policy moving forward that \nwill produce a lot more jobs.\n  This particular proposal, as many of my colleagues have pointed out, \nwhile there are some immediate construction jobs, the long-term jobs \nare very few compared to many of the other things we have been doing.\n  I would also like to point out that since Keystone has undertaken \nmore development in the United States, that part of that development in \nthe United States has also come into question lately. The security of \nthe welding on the pipeline that has been done in the southern part of \nthat pipeline has come into question, even to the point where I think \nthe State Department has said to the company: We are going to have a \nthird-party validator approve whether you are actually meeting the \nstandards we would like to see in the development of this pipeline in \nthe United States.\n\n  But there are many issues here about safety and security, as my \ncolleagues can point out who have brought up these issues before. My \ncolleague from Michigan suffered one of the most devastating oilspills \nin her area. That was a tar sands oilspill. My colleague from Michigan, \nSenator Stabenow, has actually flown over that oilspill and cited that \nit took 4 years and $1.2 billion to clean it up and that the tar sands \nsunk to the bottom of the river and the river had to be dredged.\n  So this is something my colleagues may not quite understand, that the \ntar sands, even according to the Commandant of the Coast Guard--we do \nnot really have a solution for its cleanup when it spills in water. \nThat is why I want to make sure that tar sands pay into the oilspill \nliability trust fund, as any other oil source does, so that we can make \nsure we are planning for the future and for getting help and response \nfor any of these oilspills that could occur in the future.\n  But needless to say Michigan and the Kalamazoo spill taught our \nNation how dangerous this oilspill process could be. So why are we \nprematurely trying to cut off the debate on this issue at the local \ngovernment level and say that we in Congress know better than these \nutility and transportation commissions and their transparent siting \nprocess for the American public? Why do we somehow know better that \nthis is where a pipeline should go and how the process should work?\n  So I hope my colleagues will stop and think more about how \nTransCanada proposal. I know some of my colleagues like to talk about \nbeing a good neighbor, and I like to say, you know, we in the Pacific \nNorthwest consider British Columbia a very big friend and neighbor. \nThere are many times that people talk about two provinces and five \nStates working together as an organization on economic issues. So that \nstructure has been in place for many years in the Pacific Northwest. \nBut the people of British Columbia have not been a big supporter of tar \nsands oil expansion. Something like 60 percent of the public of British \nColumbia opposes having a tar sands pipeline cross their province. \nTransCanada knows they are not going to be successful in getting this \noil from Alberta across British Columbia out to the Pacific because the \npeople of British Columbia do not want it. So, of course, why not come \nto the United States? Why not ask them if they want a pipeline going \nthrough the middle of their country?\n  British Columbia Premier Christy Clark laid out five principles that \nought to have been met in order to site a pipeline of tar sands. Those \nconditions have not been met, and the province is officially opposed to \nthe pipeline. So there was a lot of opposition and concern there.\n  I will note for my colleagues that when a public UTC--a utility \ncommission or public service commission--when they evaluate a project, \nthey have to look at the environmental impact, and that is water \nsupply, wildlife, vegetation, plants, and they have to look at the \neconomic and social impact. They need to look at alternative routes, \nthe impact to future development near the pipeline, and the views of \ncities and counties. Again, I will note that I think all of those are a \npart of having a transparent process instead of a political process on \nsiting.\n  So I am not for moving forward on what I consider special interest \nlegislation, Congress siting for a special interest--this TransCanada \ncompany--a project that even people in Canada have raised suspicion \nabout.\n  I hope that we will allow the President to still do due process on \nsuch an important issue of environmental concern and that we will not \nstart setting a standard that if you want to short-circuit the eminent \ndomain and protection rights of individuals, we will just bypass all of \nthat at the local level and somehow go to Congress and they will get \nthat done for you. I think that is a very bad message.\n  I hope my colleagues will turn down this legislation, I hope that we \ncan move on to other energy issues that will help our country diversify \nand move forward in the future.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to again talk about the Keystone XL \nPipeline approval bill. We will be voting on cloture on the motion to \nproceed in about 15 minutes or so.\n  I believe we have a bipartisan majority. We have 60 sponsors of the \nlegislation, and we will have some others join us in voting to proceed \non the bill.\n  That is important, not just because this is bipartisan legislation, \nimportant energy legislation for our country but, as I have said \nbefore, this is an opportunity for all the Members of this body--\nRepublican and Democrat--to come forward with their amendments in an \nopen amendment process and really have an energy debate.\n  Let's talk about the energy future of this country and let's bring \nforward amendments to this legislation that can be good amendments and \nhelp us build the right kind of energy plan for our country.\n  What I would point out about this Keystone Pipeline approval bill is \nthat as we work to build an energy plan for this country, as we work to \nproduce more energy so we are truly energy secure--a lot of people call \nit energy independence--but the way I define it is energy security for \nour country where we produce more energy than we consume, so we control \nour destiny. If we produce more energy than we consume, then we control \nour destiny when it comes to energy. But to do that, we would not only \nhave to produce that energy, we have to have the infrastructure to move \nit safely, cost effectively, and efficiently from where it is produced \nto where it is consumed.\n  We have this incredible opportunity with Canada to have North \nAmerican energy security. We are working with our closest friend and \nally in the world. We together produce more energy than we consume, and \nwe have the infrastructure in place to move it from where it is \nproduced to where it is consumed in our country. Now we control our own \ndestiny.\n  When it comes to OPEC or when it comes to Russia or when it comes to \nChina, when it comes to geopolitical events that affect the price of \nenergy, we are in a strong situation. Look at what is going on in \nWestern Europe right now. Look at what is going on in Ukraine. They are \nin a tremendously difficult situation because they are dependent on \nRussia for their energy, for their natural gas, at a time when Vladimir \nPutin is undertaking very aggressive action in Europe. He is invading \nUkraine. He has taken Crimea. He continues his aggressive efforts. And \nat the same time the European Union is trying to support Ukraine, \nUkraine is fighting with Russia. This is a situation where Ukraine is \ndepending upon Russia for its energy.\n  Does America really want to be in that kind of a situation in the \nfuture when we have real problems in the Middle East, when we have real \nproblems with fundamentalists, Islamic jihadists conducting terror on \nour people and other freedom-loving people around the world? Do we want \nto be in a situation where we continue to depend upon the Middle East \nfor our oil?\n  Well, the answer to that is no. The American people resoundingly \nanswer that question--no.\n\n[[Page S145]]\n\n  Also, the American people well know that the reason gas prices at the \npump today are lower is not because OPEC just decided to give us a \nChristmas present. They know the reason energy prices are low in this \ncountry, that when they pull up to the pump they are saving money, is \nbecause we are producing so much more energy in this country and we are \ngetting more energy from Canada.\n  Unless OPEC cuts back their production, more supply drives prices \ndown. So it is not only about low prices now, it is about making sure \nwe are able to control our energy destiny in the future. We have to \ntake a long-term view. It is working.\n  Of the 18 million barrels of oil a day this country consumes, we now \nproduce 11 million barrels in this country. We are up to 11 million \nbarrels that we produce in this country of the total we consume, so we \nare still importing about 7 million barrels a day.\n  Canada is now up to 3 million of those 7 million barrels, so we are \ndown to only importing about 4 million barrels a day, but if we keep \nworking at this, we can continue to produce more in this country. \nCanada's production is continuing to grow. And if we build the \ninfrastructure, we can make sure that we control that energy--North \nAmerican energy security.\n  That means not only now do our consumers and small businesses and our \nwhole Nation benefit from lower energy prices, lower gas prices at the \npump, but we have that ability to make sure we control our destiny and \nthat we benefit in the future.\n  Let's not repeat the mistakes of the past where we return to this \ndependency on OPEC down the road because we haven't built the \ninfrastructure, we haven't worked with Canada, and we haven't brought \nour domestic industry to North America so that we truly are energy \nsecure. If we don't build the necessary infrastructure, if we block the \nnecessary infrastructure, we can't build that energy plan for the \nfuture.\n  I have heard my counterparts, some of the critics, say: Well, it is \nnot up to us to issue a building permit for infrastructure.\n  Really? So you mean it is the President's job and it is Congress's \njob to block critical energy that will get us to energy security? Our \njob is to block it? Our job is to prevent the very infrastructure we \nneed to build energy security for this country, to block the private \ninvestment, the $8 billion that private companies want to spend to \nbuild this infrastructure, to create jobs, to produce more energy in \nNorth America, and to help make this country's energy security? The \nPresident's job and this body's job is to block the ability of our \ncountry and Canada to build this necessary infrastructure? Well, I \ndon't think so.\n  If you want to put it in terms of: Oh, well, we are not supposed to \nissue a building permit--really? So our job is to prevent the building \nof critical infrastructure even when it does not cost one single \npenny--not one penny--of government money?\n  This is almost $8 billion of private investment that will generate \nhundreds of millions of dollars of revenue--State, local, and Federal. \nEvery State on the route has approved it.\n  There is an idea somehow we are jumping the gun after 6 years? Let's \nsee, it has been in process for 6 years. Every State on the route has \napproved it. We are not spending any Federal money. We are saying our \njob as a Congress and the President is to block that kind of \ninvestment, block that kind of job creation, block that kind of energy \ndevelopment, and block our ability to get to energy security for this \ncountry.\n  Then there is this argument: Oh, well, it is TransCanada. It is one \ncompany. It is only one company, so it really doesn't matter.\n  Really? Well, if you were a company--a Canadian company or a U.S. \ncompany--and you were about to build infrastructure so that we could \ncontinue to produce more energy in this country, would you do it? If, \nin spite of the process that the Federal Government has to approve this \nproject, where all of the requirements have been met--not once, but \nover and over again--and Congress and the President continue to block \nyour ability to build that infrastructure, are you going to jump up and \nspend billions of dollars and do it? I doubt it.\n  And isn't that really what this is all about? That is what it is \nabout, isn't it? It is for the folks, for the extreme environmental \ngroups that don't want the development of fossil fuels--they are going \nto block it. This is sending the message and making sure they shut her \ndown here. That has to be music to OPEC's ears. I have to believe that \nOPEC is going: Boy, that is great; they are not going to build the \ninfrastructure in their country to produce the energy.\n  That is going to keep OPEC in business.\n  There is another country that I think will be very pleased, really \nexcited, if this project gets blocked, and that is China. China is so \nanxious to get this oil, they are trying to buy that production in \nCanada. Because, make no mistake, if the energy doesn't come to the \nUnited States, it is going somewhere else, and it is most likely going \nto China.\n  So when we get back in that situation down the road when oil prices \nmove back up, energy demand goes back up, and we have prevented our \nindustry from growing--and Canada is sending all the oil to China, and \nwe have to go back hat in hand to OPEC, Venezuela, and all of these \ncountries, remember----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I ask unanimous consent to continue for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Reserving the right to object. Is the vote scheduled \nfor 4 minutes from now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, the vote is scheduled for 5:30 p.m.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I am happy if the Senator speaks until the time of the \nvote, but I think we should keep to the vote schedule.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. What time is the vote scheduled?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote is scheduled at 5:30 p.m. That would \nleave the Senator 2 minutes.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I note the presence of the chairman of the Energy \nCommittee. I defer to her for some time if she wishes to speak before \nthe vote. That would be my question, whether we could get maybe a \ncouple of minutes for that purpose. I can certainly wrap up in a couple \nof minutes.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I defer to my colleague, the sponsor of \nthis legislation, Senator Hoeven from North Dakota, to conclude his \nremarks within the remaining time so that we can begin our vote at 5:30 \np.m. We appreciate his leadership on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I will wrap up on this note.\n  Let's not get back into the same predicament we have gotten ourselves \ninto before. Let's build this vital energy infrastructure so we can \ndevelop energy security for our country, together with Canada.\n  The other point I want to make is on the environmental point: No \nsignificant environmental impact. That is the finding of the Obama \nadministration's environmental impact statement done by the State \nDepartment. That is their own report: No significant environmental \nimpact.\n  I look forward to having more discussion on the environmental aspects \nas well.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, first, I congratulate my colleagues \nSenator Hoeven and Senator Manchin, the cosponsors of this legislation. \nI also commend the energy committee chair, Senator Murkowski. This is \nimportant legislation. It is long overdue that we take this up, but it \nis encouraging that we finally are doing that. So I commend them for \nthat.\n  Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Could Senators \nplease take their conversations out of the Chamber. The Senate will be \nin order.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  A couple of things about the Keystone Pipeline, and then I wish to \ntalk about an amendment I am going to be offering.\n  First, I think one of the encouraging things about approving this \npipeline is the benefits for the environment. The fact is we will be \nmoving oil on a pipeline which is a cleaner, safer way to do it than \nany available alternative. That is good news.\n  It is good news that it is going to create jobs across our country. \nThe State Department has estimated 42,000 jobs in the development of \nthis pipeline. That is terrific news for everyone who is going to get a \nchance to benefit from that work.\n  Clearly it is going to reduce our dependence on non-North American \noil, which can only be good from a geopolitical point of view as well \nas an economic point of view. Of course, the fact is this legislation \nhas bipartisan support and has for a long time. It received 31 \nDemocratic votes in the House, 14 Democratic votes in the Senate, as \nwell as every Republican Senator the last time it was brought up. It is \nstrongly supported by the labor community because they recognize the \nbenefits of the jobs it will create, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important legislation.\n\n  I also would like to take a moment to thank Leader McConnell for \ndoing exactly what he said he would do and what many of us said we \nneeded to do in this Chamber, which is to reopen this body--reopen it \nand have debate and put legislation on the floor and open it for \namendment. Let's have a discussion. Let's change policy in this country \nin ways that will be constructive. We are beginning this process now as \nwe said we would, and I think that is terrific and I intend to take \nadvantage of the opportunity.\n  I have several amendments I am going to file and I intend to bring up \nwith respect to this legislation. One is going to be an amendment that \nwill encourage a transition of our Federal Government's vehicle fleet \nfrom the current practice of burning gasoline mostly, and I encourage \nthe adoption of natural gas as an alternative fuel because natural gas \nis cleaner, it is domestic, it is actually cheaper. Without any \ngovernment subsidy or taxpayer help, natural gas is a cheaper source of \nfuel.\n  We have a staggering quantity. The United States is the world's No. 1 \nproducer of natural gas. We have 2.2 quadrillion cubic feet of natural \ngas. That is too big a number for me to wrap my brain around, but let's \nput it this way: That is the gas we know of, and it is enough to last \nthe next 85 years, based on any plausible projection of our use. It is \na staggering amount.\n  I have another amendment that also has bipartisan support. I thank \nSenator Feinstein, Senators Flake and Manchin for supporting the effort \nto repeal the corn ethanol mandate in our fuel. This is a very bad \npolicy that we have had for far too long. It is time to end this \nmandate that we grow corn and use it to burn in our gas tanks. It is a \npractice that is bad for the environment. It raises the cost of filling \nour tanks. It raises the cost of food because so much of our corn \nproduction goes into this, and it is not good for our engines. There is \nno good reason to continue this, and I look forward to having the \ndebate that will enable us to repeal the corn ethanol mandate.\n  But the amendment I wish to talk about is another bipartisan \namendment. I thank Senator Casey for being the Democratic cosponsor for \nthis amendment, and I thank Senator Hatch for joining me. This is an \namendment that will preserve an important, environmentally beneficial \nsource of alternative energy that we have especially in Pennsylvania \nand West Virginia, and it is under threat by two new rules that have \nbeen proposed by the EPA.\n  Let me give a little bit of background as to why we have gotten to \nthis place. In Pennsylvania and West Virginia we have been mining coal \nfor well over a century, and for many of the decades, especially in the \nearly years of our coal development, we took the high-energy density \ncoal and our coal miners sold it to the steel industry where it was \nused in the manufacturing process of making steel, and the low-energy \ncoal was left in piles--huge piles--actually mountains. It is often \nreferred to as waste coal.\n  The first photograph illustrates one of these waste coal piles. It is \nin Nanty Glo in Cambria County, PA. It is one of many piles or, as I \nsay, mountains throughout Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The \nPennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection estimates that \nthere are 2 billion tons of waste coal such as this covering 180,000 \nacres in Pennsylvania alone. Think about that. It is a massive scale \nbecause of over a century of legacy of coal mining. Some of these piles \nare literally in people's backyards.\n\n[[Page S147]]\n\n  Here we can see the people who live literally within a stone's \nthrow--if you have a reasonably good arm--within a stone's throw you \ncan reach this pile. That is also Nanty Glo in Cambria County. There \nare people who live within a couple of hundred feet.\n  What is the problem with these mountains? The problem with these \nmountains of coal is it rains on them, and when it rains the runoff is \nhorrendous. It looks like this. It looks like this in every one of \nthese mountains of waste coal everywhere that one exists, every time it \nrains. In 2003 in an op-ed entitled ``The Benefits of Waste Coal,'' \nformer Democratic Governor of Pennsylvania Ed Rendell's Department of \nEnvironmental Protection secretary, whose name is Kathleen McGinty, \nwrote: ``For years these piles sat abandoned, generating iron, \nmanganese and aluminum pollution that discharged as runoff into \nPennsylvania's waterways.''\n  That is exactly what happens when these piles just sit here.\n  In 2011 the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection \nreport states:\n\n       Coal refuse piles that are not removed (i.e. burned for \n     fuel) generally create severe acid mine drainage, with pH in \n     the 2.5 range . . .\n\n  A pH that high, by the way, is somewhere between the intensity of \nstomach acid and hydrochloric acid. That kind of acidic chemical \nrunning into our waters is enormously damaging.\n  Slide No. 4 is another depiction of exactly what happens when \nrainwater runs through these piles and finds its way into the streams, \nrivers, ponds, and lakes of Pennsylvania. It pollutes hundreds of miles \nof rivers and streams.\n  In 2007 former Democratic Governor of Pennsylvania, Ed Rendell said:\n\n       These piles are domestic energy sources that have \n     significant value when put into production in CFB \n     cogeneration plants. When left on the ground, waste coal \n     presents a grave environmental threat. Runoff from these \n     piles contributes to the ``abandoned mine drainage'' that is \n     the second leading water pollution problem in the \n     Commonwealth, literally killing all life in some 2,000 stream \n     miles in Pennsylvania.\n\n  But that is not all. Photo No. 5 shows something else that happens \nwith these piles. They catch fire. They spontaneously combust. It could \nbe from lightning, carelessness, and sometimes it is unknown, but they \ncatch fire. This particular photo is from Fell Township in Lackawanna \nCounty, PA.\n  The pile caught fire in December of 2013. It burned for over a year. \nIt is very hard to put these fires out. It burned out of control with, \nobviously, no ability to do anything about the pollutants that are \nbeing released by the combustion because it is completely uncontrolled.\n  We think the fire went out in January, but authorities are still not \ncertain that it may not be smoldering somewhere below the surface. By \nthe way, this mountain is 600 feet from residential housing. What is \nthe effect of this kind of combustion on the residents in that area?\n  How much of this will burn? Maybe some people think this is just a \nfreak incident. Not really, the Pennsylvania Department of \nEnvironmental Protection estimates that 6.6 million tons of waste coal \nburns each year--unintended, uncontrolled, but it is burning--and in \nthe process it emits 9 million tons of carbon dioxide and many tons of \nother uncontrolled air pollution.\n  What about cleaning all of this up? The costs would be absolutely \nstaggering. Again, former Pennsylvania Department of Environmental \nProtection Secretary McGinty estimated that it costs between $20,000 \nand $40,000 to reclaim just one acre of waste coal. We have hundreds of \nthousands of acres of waste coal.\n  The Pennsylvania General Assembly has estimated it would cost \napproximately $15 billion to remediate Pennsylvania's abandoned mine \nset. That is the bad news.\n  The good news is the market has figured out a solution to address \nthis matter. The free market has developed a way to systematically \neliminate these mountains of waste coal, and for decades we have had \npowerplants designed specifically for the purpose of burning this coal \nand doing so in a controlled and regulated fashion. They have removed \n210 million tons of waste coal and used it to produce electricity.\n  They have remediated over 8,000 acres. They have generated 1.769 \ngigawatts of electricity, which is enough to power 1.3 million homes, \nand in the process the generation of electricity from this waste coal \nhas directly resulted in creating 1,200 jobs.\n  In the past, the EPA has always acknowledged the benefits of \nsystematically eliminating these mountains of waste coal and doing so \nby generating electricity. In fact, I will quote a report from the EPA \nin 2011 that says this: ``Because of the unique environmental benefits \nthat coal refuse-fired EGUs provide, these units warrant special \nconsideration.''\n  The problem I am here to address is that there are two new rules \npassed by the EPA that would bring an end to the systemic elimination \nof these mountains because these rules are prohibitive. It is not \npossible for the waste coal powerplants to comply with these rules, so \nthey would all be shut down and we would be left with these piles \nindefinitely, which would mar our landscape and pollute our water and \nair.\n  The two specific rules that would do this--the cross-State air \npollution rule is very likely to have the effect of imposing absolutely \nunattainable goals on waste coal powerplants, and the utility MACT rule \nestablishes new and very stringent emission controls and a whole new \ngeneration of very stringent regulations that this industry cannot \nmeet.\n  If these rules go into effect--and they are scheduled to go into \neffect later this year--then waste coal and electric generation ends, \nand these plants close. As a result, we lose the electric power they \nhave been generating, the 1,200 jobs they sustain, and the low-cost \nenergy that is reliable and domestic. We will end up with a more \nserious air pollution problem when the spontaneous combustion \ncontinues, and we will have an ongoing problem with water and air \npollution as the nearby streams and water table will be polluted.\n  That is why Senator Casey, Senator Hatch, and I have joined together \nto offer an amendment to this legislation that will exempt the waste \ncoal powerplants from the most onerous and prohibitive aspects of these \nnew rules.\n  With respect to utility MACT, we would retain all of the regulatory \nlimits on mercury, chromium, nickel, and other heavy metals, but it \nwould exempt the waste coal plants from the cross-State air pollution \nrules, and it would allow these plants to continue remediating these \nwaste coal sites.\n  I wish to stress that it is important to point out that all of the \nexisting regulations that have long been in effect will remain in \neffect. What we are talking about are the two new rules that would be \nguaranteed to shut down the industry. Those two rules would not go into \neffect with respect to the waste coal electric generation.\n  The fact is if our amendment is adopted and becomes law, we will be \nhelping our environment by continuing to systematically eliminate these \nblights. I want more success stories like the one in this photograph.\n  This photo was taken in Nesquehoning in Carbon County, PA. The first \nphoto shows what the ground looked like when the waste coal was piled \nup. The second photo shows what happens after it has been consumed and \nthe land has been restored. This happened precisely because there is a \nnearby waste coal powerplant that was able to take this coal, generate \nelectricity for us to use, and restore the land to a much safer, much \nmore environmentally friendly, and much more attractive environment.\n  We need to keep these plants operating. It is about improving our \nenvironment, it is about keeping people working, it is about the low-\ncost, reliable electricity that we have from it, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/12/senate-section/article/S147-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S147-S148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MISSOURI'S EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me today in \nhonoring the 150th anniversary of the State of Missouri's Emancipation \nProclamation which ended slavery in the State of Missouri. This \nproclamation of freedom was imperative for democracy and progress in \nour State. It is undoubtedly a landmark in Missouri's history.\n  In 1720, the arrival of 500 slaves to the areas presently known as \nSt. Louis\n\n[[Page S148]]\n\nCounty and Jefferson County, marked the beginning of slavery in \nMissouri. Those slaves, who were brought to work in the lead mines in \nthose counties, experienced great discrimination over the course of \n1\\1/2\\ centuries. When the Territorial Slave Codes were created in \n1804, slaves were banned from using firearms, participating in \nassemblies, holding church services and selling alcohol. Under the \ncodes, slaves were also punished severely for participating in \nresistance efforts and the mutilation of slaves for the sexual assault \nof white women was made legal. White men who sexually assaulted slave \nwomen, however, were charged for trespassing upon a slave owner's \nproperty.\n  Retained by the State Constitution in 1820, the Territorial Slave \nCodes were only a premonition of more to come. In 1821, Missouri \nentered the Union as a slave State with the passing of the Missouri \nCompromise and in 1825, the Missouri Legislature passed a law which \ndeclared slaves to be incompetent as witnesses in legal cases involving \nwhites. That gloomy trend continued as the education of slaves was \nbanned in an 1847 ordinance. One of the most foreboding events, \nhowever, occurred in 1857 with the infamous Supreme Court case Dred \nScott v. Sandford when the judicial system in the state of Missouri and \nthe wider judicial system in the United States decided that persons of \nAfrican descent were not U.S. citizens.\n  At the time of the Civil War, over 100,000 slaves were living in the \nState of Missouri and when President Abraham Lincoln signed the \nEmancipation Proclamation in 1863, Missouri's slaves were not freed as \nMissouri was not officially in rebellion against the United States. \nMissouri's slaves received their freedom on January 11, 1865, when the \nEmancipation Ordinance was signed at a State convention in St. Louis. \nThat ordinance was made effective immediately and the strict codes of \nthe past were eliminated.\n  I ask that the Senate join me in reflecting upon this difficult time \nin Missouri's history and honoring the historical significance of the \nEmancipation Ordinance which ended slavery in the State of Missouri, \n150 years ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/12/senate-section/article/S148-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             REMEMBERING WILLIAM ``BILL'' HARRISON BULLOCK\n\n Mr. COONS. Mr. President, today I highlight the service of \nWilliam ``Bill'' Harrison Bullock to his country, commitment to his \nfamily, and contribution to both the city of Wilmington and the State \nof Delaware.\n  Bill was born on November 11, 1926, in Wilmington, DE, to William and \nAmy Bullock. He graduated from P.S. DuPont in 1945 and was immediately \ndrafted to serve as an aircraft mechanic in the Asia-Pacific theater \nduring the Second World War.\n  Upon his return to the United States, Bill joined and ultimately took \nover the five generation family business, Bullock Iron Works, which \nallowed him to meld his passions of building and construction with \nartistry. Bill invented a process for the precision bending of cold \nsteel for decorative applications, including railings. The family \nbusiness gave him an opportunity to work with his brother-in-law James \nBroad--husband to his sister Amy--and his nephew Jim Broad. Bill very \nmuch enjoyed and spoke often of the bond created by working and \ncreating beautiful ornamental steel creations with his family members.\n  Bill had a long-standing bet with his brother-in-law that he would \nnot get married before he turned 30 years old. Bill married Norma \nMcBride on November 10, 1956--1 day before his 30th birthday. They had \ntwo children, William and June. Through his management of Bullock Iron \nWorks, Bill developed a very strong set of business principles and \nethics, which he was able to pass along to his children, even though \nneither went into the family business.\n  His friends often joked with Bill that Delaware is not flat and that \nif he left he would not fall off a cliff into a chasm. He retorted that \nhe never left the State because he had no need or reason to do so. Bill \nloved Delaware and found there everything he needed to raise a family, \nto grow the family business, and to enjoy his hobbies and passions: \nfresh and salt water fishing, cultivating beautiful phalaenopsis and \ncattleya orchids, and enjoying the comradery of his fellow veterans at \nthe Delaware Veterans Club, Post #1.\n  Bill was preceded in death by his wife of 33 years Norma, his sister \nAmy, and brother-in-law James Broad. He is survived by his daughter \nBlake McBride, son William H. Bullock II, and daughter-in-law Marci \nHanlon, three grandchildren, his sister and brother-in-law, and several \nnieces and nephews.\n  Bill was a true Delawarean and one of the best and brightest of the \nGreatest Generation. He helped to win the Second World War, raised a \nstrong and loving family, grew and bolstered his business, and was a \ntrue friend to his neighbors, war buddies, and the wider Wilmington \ncommunity. He will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/12/senate-section/article/S148-2", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       COMMEMORATING THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF VIRGINIA ORGANIZING\n\n Mr. WARNER.

A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the State \n     of Louisiana urging the Congress of the United States, \n     pursuant to Article V of the United States Constitution, to \n     call a convention of the states for the sole and exclusive \n     purpose of proposing an amendment to the United States \n     Constitution that would provide for a balanced budget; to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 70\n\n       Whereas, the failure of the federal budget process has \n     produced an enormous federal budget deficit, and growing \n     national debt presently burdens the American people and \n     threatens to burden their descendants for generations to \n     come; and\n       Whereas, the congressional practice of deficit spending and \n     repeated raising of the ceiling on the federal debt has had \n     the effect of endangering the jobs, incomes, retirement \n     security, welfare, and future of American citizens; and\n       Whereas, such debt diverts scarce resources from crucial \n     programs to pay interest on the national debt, constricts the \n     ability of the federal government to address long-standing \n     national problems and to respond to new needs, and increases \n     pressures to raise taxes on the American people; and\n       Whereas, Article V of the Constitution of the United States \n     provides that an amendment to the constitution may be \n     proposed by congress, or on the application of the \n     legislatures of two-thirds of the states, congress is \n     required to call a constitutional convention for the purpose \n     of proposing an amendment, which, in either case, shall \n     become part of the constitution when ratified by three-\n     fourths of the several states: Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     make application to the Congress of the United States to call \n     a convention pursuant to Article V of the Constitution of the \n     United States of America for the specific and exclusive \n     purpose of proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States, for submission to the states for ratification, \n     to require that in the absence of a national emergency the \n     total of all federal outlays made by congress for any fiscal \n     year may not exceed the total of all estimated federal \n     revenues for that fiscal year, together with any related and \n     appropriate fiscal restraints; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this application is to be considered as \n     covering the same subject matter as the presently outstanding \n     balanced budget applications from other states, including but \n     not limited to previously adopted applications from Alabama, \n     Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, \n     Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, \n     Nebraska, Ohio, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North \n     Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texas; and that this \n     application shall be aggregated with such applications for \n     the purpose of attaining the two-thirds of states necessary \n     to require the calling of a convention but shall not be \n     aggregated with applications on any other subject; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted by the secretary of state to the \n     president and the secretary of the United States Senate, to \n     the speaker and clerk of the United States House of \n     Representatives, to each member of this state's delegation to \n     the congress, and to the presiding officer of each house of \n     each state legislature in the United States, requesting their \n     cooperation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this application by this legislature \n     supersedes all previous applications by this legislature on \n     this same subject matter and that this application \n     constitutes a continuing application in accordance with \n     Article V of the Constitution of the United States until the \n     legislatures of at least two-thirds of the several states \n     have made application for a similar convention pursuant to \n     Article V.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/12/senate-section/article/S150-2", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Ms. MURKOWSKI, from the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources, without amendment:\n       S. 147.

I thank the majority leader for allowing me this time to \nproceed. It is one thing to rewrite history a few years after it \npasses. It is another thing to rewrite it while you are still living \nthrough it. To say that this economic recovery is a Republican recovery \nis kind of funny and strange.\n  In fact, the year 2014 was the best year for job creation since 1999, \nand it could have been a lot better in 2014 and in prior years if our \nRepublican friends had not filibustered every single job proposal that \nPresident Obama put forward. It is sad because we could have gotten \nhere much quicker.\n  The economy added almost 3 million jobs in 2014, averaging almost \n250,000 jobs a month. The unemployment rate has fallen to 5.6 percent, \nand most of that decline--and here is the good news--came from long-\nterm unemployed workers getting back to work. The GDP growth has \naccelerated, reaching an annualized rate of 5 percent in the third \nquarter of 2014. This is the best GDP growth we have seen in over 10 \nyears.\n  Our economic recovery has been long, it has been tough, but it is \nhappening and I thank the President for his leadership. We have added \n11.2 million private sector jobs since February of 2010. That is the \nlongest streak of recorded private sector job gains in American \nhistory.\n  The stock market has bounced back from the crash and added more than \n10,000 points, reaching an all-time high of over 18,000 points. Our \nannual deficit has been reduced by almost two-thirds.\n  I think it is important to put into context the job growth under \nPresidents Democratic and Republican. I think we need to look at \nprivate sector job growth. This is an extraordinary chart. Under George \nHerbert Walker Bush, there were 1.5 million jobs created in his term of \noffice. In Bill Clinton's term of office, there were 21.2 million jobs \ncreated. I have seen that number up to 23 million, but that is probably \nincluding the public sector. But during Bill Clinton's term, there were \n21.2 million private sector jobs. Under George W. Bush, there was a \nloss of 460,000 jobs. Under President Obama, there is a gain so far of \n7 million, and he has 2 years to go, and we are just moving forward.\n  To me this says that we Democrats know what we are doing, and if you \nwant to look at deficits, that is another day's speech. It was Bill \nClinton who balanced the budget. It was George W. Bush who unbalanced \nit, put two wars on a credit card, gave a tax cut to the rich, and we \nhad terrible deficits. Barack Obama has now reduced this deficit by \ntwo-thirds.\n  So I say all this leading up to my discussion of the Keystone \nPipeline. How does that even connect? I will tell you. When a new \nmajority takes over in Congress you know the first bill they take up \nsymbolizes their priorities. Out of all the things that they pick, all \nthe things that they pick, they pick a bill that in terms of permanent \njob creation will be thirty-five jobs. And that\n\n[[Page S156]]\n\nis proven by the State Department--35 long-term jobs.\n\n  One has to wonder, Why are they doing this? I believe I know the \nanswer. This is really a big hug and a big kiss to big oil and Canadian \ninterests. That is what it is about. Otherwise, why wouldn't we turn to \nthe highway bill? I think the Presiding Officer and I know we have \nworked across partisan lines on that issue, and it means good jobs for \nAmerica--good jobs, long-lasting jobs, rebuilding our bridges and our \nroads and making sure we have transit systems that work. We have a \nterrible record in terms of the condition of our bridges today. \nThousands and thousands--tens of thousands of bridges are not in good \nshape, and we have seen bridges fail, and we know the outcome. Why are \nwe pursuing a project for Canadian oil business interests that they \nwill make billions off of instead of pursuing projects for America--\nAmerica--such as building our infrastructure?\n  This bill isn't about helping American workers or families. Let's be \nvery clear. It does nothing. Again, when I say 35 permanent jobs, I am \nnot making that up. That is in the final supplemental environmental \nimpact statement which I believe the Republicans want to make final, so \nthey are accepting it. The Republicans are accepting the fact that \nthere are 35 permanent jobs, because they, in their language, say, We \napprove of the final supplemental environmental impact statement, which \nis where it says there will be 35 permanent jobs.\n  Now, yes, there are temporary jobs for 2 years--a couple thousand--\nbut the fact is we can have millions of jobs when we rebuild our \ninfrastructure. We have 400 new jobs coming to the Imperial Valley in \nmy home State because we have lithium there and they are going to start \nproducing it. So 400 jobs, just one little project. This is 35 jobs for \nAmericans. They have to be kidding. This is what they have for us, \nafter all that blood, sweat, and tears during the election? I think \nthat wasting another minute on the tar sands project doesn't make any \nsense.\n  What we need is a multiyear surface transportation bill. We still \nhave unemployed people in the construction industry. We have 600,000 \nconstruction workers who remain out of work. What are we giving them? \nWe are giving them 2,000 temporary jobs and 35 permanent jobs? Let's do \na highway bill. By the way, the trust fund is running dry and in 4 \nmonths will be completely dry. Let's step up to the plate and do our \njob, not do the job for the Canadian oil interests.\n  I don't get it. I don't think it makes sense, because I know we have \nworked together on transportation projects. We are worried. Billions of \ndollars going to our States--whether it is Oklahoma, California, \nNevada, east coast, west coast--the funding is going to be delayed or \nstopped. And all these short-term extensions the House did are \nabsolutely irresponsible. It doesn't provide stability to our local \ngovernments, to our businesses.\n  So we know what we have to do. We have to invest in our aging \ninfrastructure. No country can be great if we don't have an \ninfrastructure that moves people and moves goods. Again, 50 percent of \nour Nation's roads are in less than good condition and 63,000 bridges \nare structurally deficient. Let's do something for America. That is \nwhat we are here for; not to do something good for Canadian oil \ncompanies. Let's focus on what is good for the people.\n  Now let's turn to this infrastructure project, the Keystone Pipeline. \nI want to say unequivocally--and I don't have any doubts because I \nresource everything I say--that from extraction to transportation to \nrefining to [waste/waist] storage, misery follows the tar sands. That \nis the oil that gets put in the pipeline--the dirtiest oil. I think XL \nstands for extra lethal.\n  So a pipeline is a pipeline. Fine. It is what we put in it. This is \nthe filthiest, most polluted kind of oil. Tar sands oil contains levels \nof toxic pollutants and metals that are much higher than conventional \ncrude oil--11 times more sulfur and nickel, 6 times more nitrogen, 5 \ntimes more lead than conventional crude oil. Who is saying that? Is it \nBarbara Boxer? No. Let me source it: The USGS, the U.S. Geological \nSurvey, the heavy oil and natural bitumen resources in geological \nbasins of the world--documented. Tar sands equal the dirtiest oil.\n  Why do some of my Republican friends and some of my Democratic \nfriends--I admit that; I know there are a few--want to rush to bring \nthis filthy oil into our country? The only benefit is to the Canadian \noil interests. The fact is we need less pollution, not more pollution.\n  Now high levels of dangerous air pollutants and carcinogens have been \ndocumented downwind from the tar sands refineries. People in nearby \ncommunities are suffering higher rates and types of cancers, such as \nleukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Again, is this me saying it? Some \nrightwing blog took me to task the last time I said it. They said, Oh, \nshe was on the floor making stuff up. OK. Let's be clear. I am not \nmaking stuff up. I am telling the truth, and I am going to document it \nin every case: Significantly higher levels of volatile compounds and \ncarcinogens were found downwind of tar sands processing facilities. \nThere were elevated rates of cancers linked to these toxic chemicals, \nincluding leukemia and non-Hodgkins lymphoma.\n  Where does this come from? Simpson, I.J., et al., air quality in the \nIndustrial Heartland of Alberta, Canada and potential impacts on human \nhealth. Characterization of trace gases measured over Alberta oil sands \nmining operations: 76 speciated C2-C10 volatile organic compounds, and \nthey list what they are. This is from two peer-reviewed papers.\n  Is this what the Republicans do first? I thought we wanted to make \npeople healthy. It is one thing to want to repeal the Affordable Care \nAct, which now, in my State, has reduced the uninsured by close to 50 \npercent--that is bad enough. Now they want to bring in this oil and \nhelp the Canadian oil people and it is going to bring all of these \ncarcinogens and all of this pollution to our country.\n\n  We already know about the people from Port Arthur, TX, where they \nhave these refineries. Look at this picture. A picture is worth a \nthousand words. I know that is a cliche, but it is a fact. I could try \nto explain to my colleagues what happens near the playground when this \nstuff is refined. One might say, Oh, that is nice, Barbara, but are you \nreally making this up? No. Here it is. Look at it. They suffer asthma, \nrespiratory ailments, skin irritations, and cancer. This is what \nhappens, right near a playground. Now, there are some politicians down \nthere saying, Bring it on. We want it. We like it. But talk to the real \npeople there who live there with children. They have had enough of tar \nsands. They have had it up to here with them. They want none of it. \nLet's not forget about the waste. Once they burn all of this stuff, \nthey have waste left over. It is called petcoke, petroleum coke. Look \nat this. This is what it looks like, as shown in this picture. It is \nstored in the Midwest. A lot of it is stored in the Midwest. What \nhappens? In this photograph we can see it is not wet, so it can blow in \nthe wind. Billowing black clouds have contaminated our children. They \ncontain heavy metals. Children playing baseball have been forced off \nthe field to seek cover from the clouds of black dust that pelted homes \nand cars.\n  This happened. This is why my friend Senator Durbin is so concerned, \nbecause it happened to his Little League players in the Chicago area. \nWhen inhaled, these particles can increase the number and severity of \nasthma attacks. They can aggravate bronchitis--I am coughing just at \nthe thought of it--lung disease. They reduce the body's ability to \nfight infections. Where does that come from? I will say it again. When \ninhaled, these particles can increase the number and severity of asthma \nattacks, cause or aggravate bronchitis and other lung diseases, and \nreduce the body's ability to fight infections. What is the source of \nthat? California Air Resources Board, Air Pollution Particulate Matter \nbrochure dated May 6, 2009.\n  So I don't know how exposing Americans to this kind of pollution is \nin the national interests. I believe instead of waiving all of the \nenvironmental reports as my Republican friends do in their bill, they \nought to call for more studies on the health impact of the tar sands \noil so our families know what they are going to get with this pipeline.\n  Also there are spills to worry about. Not only is the Keystone tar \nsands\n\n[[Page S157]]\n\npipeline harmful to human health, it hurts environments and communities \nlocated near it, because if there is a spill, it is the toughest kind \nof oil to clean up. Here is the source for that: The EPA NEPA \ncompliance comment letter, State Department. That is what they talk \nabout.\n  We have had spills at the tar sands--spills in Michigan, spills in \nArkansas. If my colleagues don't believe me, ask those folks. Do my \ncolleagues know in 2010 a pipeline ruptured and spilled over a million \ngallons of tar sands oil into the Kalamazoo River in Michigan? The \nlocal health department ordered the evacuation of 50 households and \napproximately 100 families were advised not to drink the water. The \nMichigan spill was the largest inland spill in U.S. history and more \nthan 40 years and $1 billion later, it is not cleaned up.\n  So wait a minute. Let's review. Republicans take over and the first \nbill they give us is the tar sands bill. The only people it helps, in \nmy opinion, backed up by fact, are Canadian oil interests. The only \njobs it creates permanently are 35 jobs. What it does to our health is \na disaster, because the tar sands oil is the most toxic, dirty type of \noil, and if there is a spill, it is the hardest to clean up. Who do we \nthink is paying the $1 billion to clean up a tar sand spill in \nMichigan? I can tell my colleagues. It is probably most of the \ngovernment. Maybe we are trying to collect some from the private \nsector.\n  If my colleagues don't believe me about Michigan, let's turn to \nMayflower, AR. This is a beautiful neighborhood of homes, as shown in \nthis picture. This is filthy, dirty, disgusting oil and the camera is \ntaking pictures of it. In 2013, 200,000 gallons of tar sands burst from \na pipeline, because it is volatile. It burst from the pipeline and \nspilled into the streets of a subdivision. It forced the evacuation and \nabandonment of 22 homes--residents who were exposed to high levels of \nbenzene, a known carcinogen, and hydrogen sulfide. People in this \ncommunity--not some made-up, mystical community or mythical community--\nin this community they suffered dizziness, nausea, headaches, \nrespiratory problems, all classic symptoms of exposure to the chemicals \nfound in the tar sands. So remember this picture and remember the \npicture of the filthy, dirty oil and the petcoke, because a picture \ntells a thousand words, and that is the picture my friends want to make \na reality in America. Their first great bill, their first great \ncontribution to the economy, 35 jobs. Please. We can do better. We can \nwork together on a highway bill, on a transportation bill. We do so \nwell on that. And we can add millions of jobs, especially in the \nconstruction industry.\n  Now there is the issue of climate change. We know we are dealing with \na lot of deniers on the other side of the aisle. They deny climate \nchange is real. It doesn't matter what we tell them. July was the \nhottest month, August was the hottest month, and September was the \nhottest month in 2014.\n  We know what is happening. The world knows what is happening. We have \ndeniers here, so they deny any problem and they go rush to build the \nKeystone Pipeline. What will happen is the Keystone Pipeline will \nundermine our efforts to address climate change. The State Department's \nown analysis says a barrel of tar sands oil carried by the Keystone tar \nsands pipeline will create at least 17 percent more carbon pollution \nthan domestic oil.\n  Peer-reviewed research estimates that the increase in oil consumption \ncaused by Keystone could result in up to 110 million metric tons of \ncarbon pollution each year--four times the State Department's estimate. \nSo this is even more than the State Department says. The source there \nis Erickson et al., ``Nature Climate Change.'' That is a peer-reviewed \nstudy as well. This is equivalent to carbon pollution adding 23 million \nnew cars to the road or building 29 coal-fired powerplants. So the \nState Department is very modest in its projection. Even that is too \nmuch.\n  Here is more. Here is the State Department. That is the 17 percent \nquote. And it could add up to an additional 27 million metric tons of \ncarbon pollution each year. That is more of the State Department. This \nis their modest conclusion. We believe the peer-reviewed study shows it \nis far worse than even the State Department says.\n  If you don't believe climate change is a problem, I am really sorry \nfor your constituency because let me tell you what scientists are \nsaying. And I am saying it is 98 percent of scientists. Let's be clear. \nNinety-eight percent of scientists say climate change is real, and 2 \npercent say: We are not so sure. So my friends side with the 2 percent.\n  Suppose one of my friends didn't feel well and went to the doctor, \nand the doctor said: I am sorry to tell you this, sir, but you have a \ncancer that is raging over your body, and we need to operate today.\n  You say: I want a second opinion.\n  That is good. You go get a second opinion.\n  The second doctor says: Absolutely, you better get that operation.\n  You say: Well, I want a third opinion.\n  All right. I understand it. You go for a third opinion. Absolutely, \nthose two doctors were right, but you keep going, and you get nine \nopinions that all say: Sir, you are a dead man if you don't get this \noperation. And then you find the 10th, and he says: You know, just go \non a vegetarian diet, and you will be fine. If you listen to that one \nout of 10 doctors, there is something wrong with you.\n  It is just like Big Tobacco. They did the same thing. They said: Oh, \ntobacco is fine, not a problem--until we realized there was a whole \ncampaign by the big tobacco companies to turn us away from the fact \nthat tobacco causes cancer. That is the truth. Guess what we found out. \nIn a Union of Concerned Scientists expose, they found out that the same \npeople who led that fight of tobacco denial are leading the fight of \nclimate denial.\n  If this was just going to hurt you, I say to my Republican friends \nrhetorically, I wouldn't care. I mean, I would be really sad and sorry \nif one of my friends went to the doctor and didn't listen to the best \nadvice. But you know what. That hurts him. I would be miserable, and I \nwould try to talk him out of it. But this is about my constituents and \nthe people of this country. I have to say this is wrong. This is just \nwrong.\n  This is an opportunity to bring the parties together. We could have \ndone it around so many issues and in particular the highway bill. So \ncommon sense tells us this isn't the right thing to do. We are looking \nat unleashing this dirty, filthy oil. It is going to be harmful to our \nfamilies' health. It is going to worsen the impact of climate change. \nIt will not create the jobs we need to create.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues vote no. It is not ready for prime time. \nThere are going to be amendments that will reveal the fact that if we \ngo forward with this, it is actually going to raise gas prices for \nAmericans because all this stuff is going to be exported. Even the tar \nsands that are now currently in America--they are going to export it \nbecause of the world market. We are going to have amendments that are \ngoing to show that.\n  This bill doesn't even have a ``Made in America'' amendment to it. We \nare going to offer that. Why don't we make this deal here? Why don't we \nput people to work here? That is not in this bill. This bill is not \nready. This bill does not help us; this bill hurts us. I know my \nfriends came here to make this country better. I think they think it \nhelps. I don't question that. But if you look at all of the facts--and \nI have them lined up here, one after the other--whether it is the jobs \nimpact, the health impact, who benefits, who gets hurt, it is pretty \nclear. It is on the record. All you have to do is look at it. Don't \nshop around for a doctor who will tell you this is a good deal because \nthey have already spoken. It is not a good deal. We can do so much \nbetter.\n  Because I think it is going to be a contentious debate, after this I \nhope we turn to the highway bill. My friend Jim Inhofe and I, who \nworked so well together, and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nand across the Capitol on the other side, the House, can finally come \ntogether and do something that will send a strong signal to the \nAmerican people that the election just ended, now let's govern. But \nwhen you bring things before the body that some of us feel are so \ndetrimental to the American people, I am willing to vote on it at \nmidnight. It is OK with me. We will vote at midnight and vote at 1 \no'clock in the morning. I don't care what time we vote, but why are we \ntaking this up? This is not what we should be doing.\n\n[[Page S158]]\n\n  S. 1--I looked at some of the S. 1 bills the Democrats have put \nforward, and they mostly have to do with creating a lot of jobs or \nmaking sure there is equal pay for equal work or making sure the \nminimum wage is increased. We could be doing all of those things \ntogether.\n  It is with pride that I stand here again for my State. It is with no \nanimosity about the election. It was hard-fought and hard-won. But I \nbelieve this is an enormous mistake, and I will continue to stand on my \nfeet as long as it takes to make the case as to why I think it is wrong \nand make the case where I think there is so much else we could do for \nthe good of our people.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his courtesy.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/12/senate-section/article/S158-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
