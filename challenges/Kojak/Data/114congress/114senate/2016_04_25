Madam President, the top Democrat on the \nAppropriations Committee recently said that the energy security and \nwater infrastructure funding legislation before us marks an ``excellent \nkickoff'' to the appropriations process.\n  This is the first bill of the ``Appropriations Committee to come to \nthe floor,'' she said, and ``it signals that we are ready to do regular \norder.'' I share Senator Mikulski's sentiment. It has been good to see \ncolleagues working across the aisle expressing an interest and working \ncooperatively this appropriations season because we know continued \ncooperation will be essential to a successful appropriations process.\n  We have seen plenty of positive signs in the Appropriations Committee \nalready. The committee has already approved one-third of the 12 funding \nbills on a bipartisan basis. With continued cooperation, we will have \nan opportunity to pass the first of these bills on the floor this week. \nThe energy security and water infrastructure funding legislation before \nus is the result of many hours of hard work and research. It will \nreduce wasteful spending, it will bolster national security, and by \nadvancing priorities like public safety, waterway infrastructure, \neconomic development, and energy innovation it will impact all 50 of \nour States.\n  This excellent kickoff to the appropriations season enjoys bipartisan \nsupport. It advanced out of committee by a unanimous vote. It \nrepresents yet another example of what is possible in a Senate that is \nback to work. I thank the subcommittee chairman, Senator Alexander, for \nworking with Ranking Member Feinstein to move this important bill out \nof committee.

Madam President, as each day passes, the senior Senator \nfrom Iowa further distinguishes himself as the most political and \npartisan Judiciary Committee chairman in history. Last Friday, Senator \nGrassley took his political partisanship to a new low when he \nencouraged the FBI to join the political crusade against Secretary \nHillary Clinton.\n  The Senator from Iowa is confused about the role of the FBI. By law, \nthe FBI is obligated to do its job and conduct an independent review \nfor everything it has to work on free from political interference.\n\n[[Page S2402]]\n\n  It is wrong for any Senator, especially the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee who deals with these issues day after day, to urge the \nselective leaking of any Federal investigation. The FBI is not in the \nbusiness of disclosing information to appease political operatives, but \naccording to press reports, that is just the sort of thing the \nRepublican Judiciary Committee has done.\n  Remember, there has been a lot of speculation that under Chairman \nGrassley's leadership the personal information of a Clinton staffer was \nleaked to the press, including payroll records and a Social Security \nnumber, but urging a leak of the FBI investigation for political \npurposes was not the only thing Senator Grassley said. The Senator from \nIowa was asked what he thought was the worst change in Congress during \nhis tenure. He responded that the increasing partisanship was \ndisappointing to him.\n  The audacity and even the hypocrisy of that statement is staggering. \nSenator Grassley decries partisanship, while he denies a hearing and a \nvote to an eminently qualified Supreme Court nominee. For what? No one \nhas a good answer on that. The Senator from Iowa complains of \npartisanship, even as he uses the Judiciary Committee to wage a \npolitical war against Secretary Clinton and her staff.\n  Under the guise of oversight, Senator Grassley has been wasting \ntaxpayer dollars trying to besmirch Hillary Clinton's good name. This \nhas been going on for years. The Senator's singular focus on Secretary \nClinton borders on an obsession. Senator Grassley has written dozens of \nletters containing hundreds of requests. He has held hearings. He has \nissued press releases. What have he and his committee achieved? \nNothing. All the chairman has done is waste taxpayer dollars.\n  The Judiciary Committee chairman is so desperate to legitimize his \nattacks against Hillary Clinton he is willing to encourage a selective \nleak of a Federal investigation by, of all people, the FBI.\n  All this in an effort to award the Presidential nomination to Donald \nTrump. I agree in one respect with Senator Grassley. Partisanship in \nthis Chamber is awful. It is paralyzing the Senate and is preventing us \nfrom doing our constitutional duties, but much of this is the handiwork \nof the Judiciary Committee and Senator Grassley.\n  I ask the Chair to announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/25/senate-section/article/S2402-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to use articles \nas examples relevant to the subject of my speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I rise today to speak about the rapid \nrise in child poisonings caused by single-use laundry products. Earlier \ntoday, we had an update on the number and severity of these poisonings \nfrom the American Academy of Pediatrics. It was in an indepth study \njust published in their journal, Pediatrics.\n  The news is not very good, because in 2013 and 2014 that academy \nreports that there were over 22,000 child exposures to laundry \nproducts, resulting in the deaths of at least two children due to the \nchemicals in these pods, and many others have faced serious injury, \nwith at least 17 children in that time period going into comas because \nof exposure to these chemicals.\n  What am I talking about? This is a laundry pod. It is very colorful \non the outside, and it smells very good. It is quite soft. Its texture, \nparticularly to the touch of an infant--an infant's hand and face--is \nvery soft and reassuring. The problem is that if it gets into an \ninfant's hand, where is it going to end up? It is going to end up in \ntheir mouth, and these packages are soluble. So, naturally, the plastic \nexterior is going to dissolve, and all of these chemicals are going to \nend up in the child's digestive system.\n  As a result of these pods, we have had two children die, and we had \n22,000 child exposures in that 2-year period the study covers, with 17 \nchildren going into comas. Others have suffered seizures or internal \nburns to their lips, mouths, and the esophagus. If it gets into their \nesophagus and burns, then you have a problem.\n  Now, what we have been advocating, Senator Durbin and I, in our \nlegislation is to make them as safe as possible and to get the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission involved in these things. This Senator has \nmet with the industry. Let me show you some of the things in which, \nindeed, they have made progress.\n  This is a detergent pod package, and in order to get in it--and this \npod came in this packaging--you have to tear it open. That is one good \nthing. They have designed this container so that it would be very \ndifficult to get into. Even I am having difficulty getting into it. The \npods would be in this container--something that would be child proof.\n  They designed this container. This has one of those slide bars, such \nas on a plastic sealant freezer package, where you have to push down on \nit and apply pressure in order to get the slide that unzips the seal. \nThat is also a good thing.\n  But let me show you what the industry is resistant to doing. Children \nare naturally attracted to colorful candy. Here shown on this chart are \na variety of candies, such as gummy bears, but among all of these are \ninterspersed some of these pods. This is one. This is another. This is \nanother, and this is another--not unlike the colors on this pod. So if \nwe don't have the packaging preventing the child from getting to this \npod, then we are going to have a problem, which is why we lost two \nchildren and 17 others went into comas in the last 2 years.\n  Now, a lot of people like these products, and so does the Nelson \nfamily. They serve a very useful purpose. At the same time, we need to \nmake them as safe as possible. So why not just remove the color from \nthe package and make it less attractive to the child.\n  Last year, Senator Durbin and I introduced legislation that would \nrequire better labeling, more child-resistant packaging and safer \nchemical formulations for these single-use laundry pod products. The \nbill has been referred to our Commerce Committee, and as the ranking \nmember of that committee, I am going to talk again to Senator Thune, \nwho is the chairman of the committee, to see if we can get the \ncommittee to take up the bill as soon as possible.\n  Earlier this year, we were able to get both the House and the Senate \nto pass legislation requiring childproof packaging for bottles of \nliquid nicotine, some of which had injured children and, in some cases, \nresulted in death as well and had poisoned thousands of others. If we \ncould get that done in a bipartisan manner, which we did and that is \nnow law, then there is no reason why we can't, in a bipartisan way, \naddress the issue posed by this problem. Keeping children safe is not a \npartisan issue. It is just common sense.\n  In the interim, we want to encourage the manufacturers to keep \nworking on new standards to reduce the poisonings. We appreciate very \nmuch the efforts at things such as this and this. That is helpful. Last \nweek, one manufacturer announced plans to put many of the laundry pods \nthey sell into new, more child-resistant packaging. They also announced \na public education campaign urging parents to keep laundry pods away \nfrom their children. That is certainly helpful. But at the same time, \nwe need to keep working to make these pods less attractive to children \nand, perhaps more\n\n[[Page S2403]]\n\nimportantly, make the chemicals inside these less toxic so that when a \nchild does get hold of one and it goes into their mouth, it is not \ngoing to turn into tragedy.\n  I thank the American Academy of Pediatrics for their very important \nstudy, and I look forward to working with our colleagues to put an end \nto the accidental deaths and poisonings that we see as a result of \nthese attractive products.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, on Sunday, during a joint press \nconference in Hannover, Germany, with Chancellor Angela Merkel, the \nPresident of the United States said this:\n\n       And with respect to Congress and the Trans-Pacific \n     Partnership--\n\n  That is the big 5,000-page trade agreement the President is trying to \nmove through Congress--\n\n       I think after the primary season is over--\n\n  After the primary season is over--\n\n     the politics settle down a little bit in Congress, and we'll \n     be in a position to start moving forward. Because I know that \n     we had a majority of members in the past who were in favor of \n     this deal. Otherwise we wouldn't have gotten the authority \n     for me to go ahead and fast track the agreement. But I think \n     we all know that elections can sometimes make things a little \n     more challenging, and people take positions, in part, to \n     protect themselves from attacks during the course of election \n     seasons.\n\n  I would suggest the American people should be very uneasy about their \nPresident making such a statement as that. We have already heard that \nthere are plans by a number of forces and interest groups to try to \nslip this TPP through after the election in a lameduck congressional \nsession.\n  Why would that be the case? Well, the President says it right here: \nThe American people are uneasy about it. They are not for this. Support \nfor it is sinking. Elections are turning on it. And it does not need to \nbecome law.\n  I am firmly opposed to this agreement. I believe it is bad for our \ncountry. It bothers me that if it is such a good deal, why don't they \nbring it forward? Why don't we have a debate here while elections are \non? Why aren't people willing to go home and explain to their \nconstituents how and why they voted the way they did and how and why \nthey believe the way they do? What is wrong with that? Why wait until \nafter, when things settle down a little bit, in the President's words, \nwhen people can't be held accountable by their constituents for the \nvotes they cast or they think they may be able to slide away afterward?\n  I don't like this. I don't think it is the right thing to do. I think \nit is arrogant. What the President is fundamentally saying and what a \nlot of these special interest groups are saying is, well, we know you \nin Congress are so smart, and we know the President is smart. But, the \npeople out here, they don't understand how smart we all are, and we \njust need to get this done, and so we will have this trade agreement. \nBut we understand you probably shouldn't do it right now while \nelections are going on because, well, you might get your clock cleaned. \nThey might vote you out of office. So we will see if we can't work up a \nway to pass it sometime in the future.\n  The President has made it clear that he intends to continue to push \nthrough this 5,544-page trade agreement that the American people don't \nwant. Polls show consistent disapproval of the TPP. A March poll by \nAmericans for Limited Government found that 51 percent of Americans did \nnot know anything about it. I would say at least 50 percent of the \nMembers of Congress don't know much about it. It is more than 5,000 \npages. I have probably spent more time on it than the vast majority \nhave, and it is rather difficult to read. No wonder the American people \nsay they don't know a lot about it. But of those who claim to be \nfamiliar with it, 58 percent oppose it. There are a lot of reasons for \nthis, and we will talk about it more.\n  Today, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman announced that they \nare beginning the 13th round of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment \nPartnership--TTIP, they call it--with the European Union in New York. \nSo this is the second part of the fast-track. The fast-track guarantees \na fast vote--without amendments, without the option to filibuster, on \nthe floor of the Senate for less than 2 days, and you get an up-or-down \nvote. That is what fast-track does.\n  So we will have the Pacific agreement probably coming up first, and \nthen we will have the TTIP, the Atlantic agreement, and then there is a \nthird one, the Trade in Services Agreement. All of these are huge trade \nagreements, unlike anything we have seen before, creating in the \nPacific an international trade union similar to the beginning of the \nEuropean Union that Britain is trying to get out of. I think we should \nbe very dubious about that.\n  How is the trade agreement faring in Europe? How about Germany, which \nis probably one of the leading trading countries in Europe? A poll by \nthe Bertelsmann Foundation, a nonprofit organization that studies \ndomestic and international politics, found that only 17 percent of \nGermans feel that TTIP--the transatlantic partnership--would be a good \ndeal even though less than 2 years ago it had a 55-percent positive \nrating. This study found that the more people learn about the \nagreement, the more they oppose it. The same thing is happening in the \nUnited States, in my opinion.\n  The President has referred to the TPP as the ``most progressive trade \ndeal in history.'' Its chapters create new labor and environmental \nprovisions that the public really knows nothing about.\n  Even the economic data the White House promotes as proving the \nvalidity of the TPP, if we look at it carefully, we can see that their \nown report and study that they cite the most--that signing the \nagreement will decrease the rate of American manufacturing jobs by \n120,000. How is this good for America? By their own study, we are going \nto lose 120,000 manufacturing jobs that we would have maintained had we \nnot signed the agreement. Another study by Tufts University said the \ncountry will lose 400,000 jobs. We are going to go into the differences \nin the studies, we are going to see the assumptions utilized in the \nmodel the President cites, and we are going to see that the assumptions \nthey made are not reasonable. They are extreme assumptions--assumptions \nthat would never occur in the next 15 years as they assume they will \noccur. No wonder they can justify positive numbers with those kinds of \nassumptions.\n  I think all of us have to begin to reveal--and the American people \nneed to be more alert--how bad this international agreement really is, \nhow it will not positively affect the lives of most Americans. It is \njust not going to do so.\n  We will look at how the Korean trade deal that I supported in 2011 \ncame nowhere close to being beneficial to the United States. In 2011, \nwhen President Obama signed the deal, the President said that it would \nincrease American exports by $10 billion to South Korea. I thought that \nwas a good thing. It sounded pretty good, but their estimates were way \noff.\n  The model that experts used to study the Korean trade deal is the \nsame one they are using to study the TPP, and so we have a pretty good \ntest: Did we increase exports by $10 billion each year to South Korea, \nas the model suggested? Well, their imports to us increased by $12 \nbillion, and as of last year, we only increased our exports to Korea by \nless than a couple of hundred million dollars more than in 2011. So we \ndidn't get any increase at all--virtually none. They had a huge \nincrease to us, and our trade deficit with our allies and friends in \nSouth Korea increased 280 percent. This is a serious matter.\n  The same thing happened: They used this same computer model when we \nsigned the agreement with China in 2000. We then had a little less than \n$70 billion in trade deficit with China. They assumed our exports to \nChina would grow at the same rate as China's exports to the United \nStates would grow. Did that happen? No. What is the\n\n[[Page S2404]]\n\ntrade deficit with China today? Pushing $400 billion. Our trade deficit \nwent up 6 percent again last year.\n  So who is right here: The American people, who are worried about \ntheir jobs, their wages, their incomes, or the experts who promised all \nthese grand things if we would just sign these agreements and everybody \nis going to be better off for it? I think the American people are the \nones who have been proven right by this data.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have 1 \nadditional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, the President does not need to be \nthreatening our allies in Britain about the decision of their own \npeople on whether to exit from the European Union. They are not happy \nwith how things are going in the European Union. A lot of people are \nconcerned about it. It is heading toward a close vote. The people of \nthe United Kingdom can make their own decision without hearing advice \nor threats from the President of the United States. I don't blame them \nfor being offended by it. This is certainly not an acceptable position \nfor the President to take.\n  Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to share these remarks. \nI want to push back from the President's recent statements about this \ntrade agreement, how he plans to move it through when people aren't \nwatching. I also think Congress needs to speak and assert that we \naffirm the right of the people of the UK to decide whether to remain in \nthe European Union.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today in support of the F-35 Joint \nStrike Fighter. I have previously addressed this body on the progress \nof the F-35 program and its importance to our national defense. On one \nof those occasions, I stated that this weapons system provides the \ncapabilities we need to protect our freedoms and those of our allies. \nThat statement resonates even more today as the international security \nlandscape grows even more precarious.\n  When the F-35 program started over 20 years ago, the strategic \nbackdrop for the program of record was significantly different than it \nis today. The Cold War had recently drawn to a close, and the menace of \nIslamic extremists, rogue states, and nonstate actors was just \nbeginning to surface. Today, these groups pose the most salient threat \nto our national security--and we all know it. To find examples of their \ndeviant behavior, look no further than the headlines of today's papers.\n  In Eastern Europe, Putin's invasion of a sovereign nation threatens \nnot only the security of the Ukrainian people but also tests the \nresolve of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization--perhaps our \ncountry's most important defense alliance.\n  In the Middle East, Iran grows more emboldened with its ballistic \nmissile tests, rattling a region already on the verge of violent \nconflict. And none of this is to mention the metastasis of ISIS in Iraq \nand a seemingly endless civil war in Syria.\n  In Asia, the North Korean regime constantly threatens South Korea \nwith war. Meanwhile, tensions over territorial waters in the South \nChina Sea grow more strained, escalating the possibility of conflict \nbetween China and our Asian allies. All the while, China continues to \nleverage its economic largesse to build highly advanced weapons \nsystems.\n  I believe many Members of this body would agree that the dangers \nfacing our country today are more immediate and far-reaching than they \nwere just 20 years ago.\n  As threats to our national security proliferate across the globe, we \nneed a next-generation weapon system of unparalleled capability. We \nneed a strike fighter powerful enough to deter the aggression of our \nfoes. We need an aircraft that can penetrate advanced enemy air \ndefenses and neutralize targets on the ground. In short, we need the F-\n35.\n  In fact, we need the F-35 today more than ever. Even so, there are \nthose who seek to reduce or delay the number of F-35s being produced. I \nstrongly advise against this action. Reducing procurement numbers for \nthe F-35 will only make the aircraft more expensive in the long run.\n  To ensure that our country continues to dominate airpower for decades \nto come, we must stay the course and resist the urge to cut aircraft. \nThat is why I believe we must increase, not decrease, the number of F-\n35s scheduled for production.\n  Recently, several of my colleagues, led by Senators Cornyn and \nShaheen, sent a letter to the Armed Services Committee and the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee in both the House and the Senate. Their \nletter was clear: The need for the F-35 in today's environment is \ncrucial. Therefore, the committees of jurisdiction should not follow \nthe President's budget reduction plan but should maintain the program \nof record.\n  I realize the frustrations that many of my colleagues have with the \nacquisition process of the Department of Defense. During the first two \ndecades of the F-35's journey, the Joint Strike Fighter Program Office \nexperienced its fair share of setbacks, broken promises, missteps, and \nfaulty leadership decisions--decisions made by both government leaders \nand industry partners. Even from within the Pentagon itself, we have \nheard the title of ``acquisition malpractice'' bestowed upon this \nprogram at the highest levels after the Nunn-McCurdy breach for cost \ngrowth.\n  Time and again, my much esteemed colleague, the senior Senator from \nArizona, has pointed out these shortfalls and missteps. I echo his \nfrustrations and stress the need for an acquisition and sustainment \nstrategy that focuses on delivering and sustaining the most available, \ncapable, and affordable weapon systems for the warfighter.\n  Nevertheless, we must recognize that reducing procurement numbers for \nthe F-35 will only put an unnecessary strain on our Armed Forces. Given \nthe dangerous state of global affairs, now is not the time to hamstring \nour military's capabilities.\n  Amid the many criticisms of the F-35 program, I wish to call \nattention to its successes. In terms of both capability and \nperformance, the F-35 program has made tremendous strides. On the \naffordability front, the price of each F-35 has dropped dramatically \nover the past 5 years to under $100 million per aircraft. This trend is \nexpected to continue for at least the next 5 years in order to achieve \na flyaway cost of $85 million per aircraft by 2019.\n  In an affordability and capability sense, the F-35 is a bargain, but \nin addition to being a bargain, the F-35 is also an indispensable asset \nto our defense arsenal. The F-35 has the ability to destroy some of the \nmost advanced air-to-air and air-to-ground systems in existence today. \nMany of these systems are being developed by the Russians and the \nChinese. The F-35's stealth technology, advanced sensors, and weapons \nallow it to defeat those integrated air-defense environments. That is \nto our advantage, no question about it.\n  Currently, even the most advanced versions of the F-16 and F/A-18 \nwould be hard-pressed to defeat such threats alone. That is why we need \nthe F-35. With the F-35, we can maintain our ability to strike any \ntarget anywhere in the world.\n  The F-35 is not only a tremendous strike aircraft, but it is also a \nwar-winning dogfighter. In fact, when facing legacy aircraft such as \nthe F-16 and F/A-18 in air-to-air combat scenarios, the F-35 \nconsistently wins these engagements. The aircraft's combination of \nstealth, maneuverability, and superior battlespace awareness allows the \nF-35 to enter the fight against legacy aircraft with a great advantage. \nIf you ask our Marine, Navy, and Air Force pilots flying this aircraft \ntoday, they will tell you what they told me: This is the best fighter \naircraft they have ever flown and the plane they want to take into \nbattle above all others.\n  This conclusion is shared not just by American pilots who have flown \nthe aircraft, but also by our allies who have chosen to purchase the F-\n35 out of a wide variety of aircraft that are currently available in \nother countries as well.\n  As the Israeli Defense Minister recently said, ``I'm very happy that \nwe'll\n\n[[Page S2405]]\n\nknow how to preserve the qualitative military edge of the Israeli \nDefense Forces and of the Israeli Air Force through acquisition of this \nimportant plane.''\n  Military might is useful only if three things occur: One, the \ncapability is present to counter and engage the threat; two, the \ncapacity and numbers are present for all of the threats; and three, \nthose in power have the resolve to use them to protect the sovereignty \nof our Nation and its citizens.\n  The current demand on our military requires every ounce of capability \nmade available by advanced weapon systems and, just as important, the \nnumbers needed to counter threats the globe over.\n  Consider how in the past we chose to reduce the number of F-22 \nadvanced fighters made available to combatant commanders. Originally, \nthe program of record for the F-22 was 750 aircraft, yet we procured \nonly 195. Today, the demand for the F-22 and its capabilities dwarfs \nthe available jets in the inventory. In hindsight, we should have \nbought 1,000.\n  Similar situations have also occurred with the B-2 bomber, the C-17 \ntransport, and numerous other aircraft. The lesson is clear: The \nprogram of record for 1,763 F-35 A models for the Air Force and 680 B \nand C models for the Navy and Marine Corps have to materialize and be \nrealized. The committees of jurisdiction should also insist to the \nDepartment that the F-35 Joint Program Office also acquire the spare \nparts needed to sustain the numbers and accelerate that purchase to \nensure that F-35s are sustained at the level of readiness demanded by \nthe current world dynamic. As the old adage goes, if we do not learn \nfrom history, then we are doomed to repeat it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                               GAO Report\n\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, it is the beginning of the appropriations \nseason here in Washington. I am glad we are doing that. We are a little \nbit ahead of schedule from past experiences, although we haven't been \ndoing appropriations bills during my second term in the Senate. I am \nglad we are doing them because that is really what we are here for.\n  For those listening, this is for when Congress determines how we \nspend taxpayer money. There are a number of people in the gallery \ntoday--they are all taxpayers--wondering: Where does this money that is \nsent to Washington go?\n  When Hoosiers from Indiana send their hard-earned tax dollars to \nWashington to be spent by the Federal Government, they expect their \nelected leaders to be good stewards of their resources. After all, they \nworked hard to earn this money. Before they get their net paycheck, \ntheir taxes are deducted and sent to Washington. They have every right \nto expect us to be good stewards.\n  It is no wonder taxpayers are furious with Washington when the \nFederal Government wastes the money they work so hard to make. When \nthey hear about or read about some of the ludicrous ways we spend their \nmoney or the wasteful ways we spend their money, they have every reason \nto be concerned and to be angry.\n  Clearly, there are essential functions the Federal Government has to \nundertake, but we can't continue to ignore the fact that our national \ndebt has now passed $19 trillion. Borrowing money in order to pay for \nexpenditures and then having obligations to pay that money back, along \nwith interest rates, puts us in a very deep hole that we have talked \nabout a lot, but we have not done what is necessary to address this \ncontinued plunge into debt.\n  Seemingly every day, we see examples of mismanagement and wasteful \nspending in Washington, which is one of the reasons I give my weekly \n``Waste of the Week'' addresses. I have come to the floor now more than \n40 times in this Congress to talk about documented cases of waste, \nfraud, and abuse within the Federal Government. It is not something \nmade up but documented abuses by, generally, the Government \nAccountability Office, whose job is to examine how we spend our money \nand to publicize how that money is spent.\n  Now we have racked up nearly $160 billion of documented waste, fraud, \nand abuse. This has included the ridiculous, such as Federal grant \nspending on rabbit massages, as well as the serious, such as double-\ndipping in the Social Security Disability Insurance funds.\n  While many Americans struggle every day to pay their mortgage or to \nput food on the table, it is infuriating that the Federal Government is \nwasting money renting empty warehouses or funding a study to determine \nif being ``hangry'' is a real thing.\n  I talked about the word ``hangry'' in one of my speeches several \nweeks ago. ``Hangry'' is a modification of the words hungry and angry. \nA considerable amount of taxpayer money was spent on a study to \ndetermine if a person gets angrier with their spouse when he or she is \nhungry and so they coined the word ``hangry.'' It refers to someone who \nis hungry, and because they are hungry, they get a little anxious or a \nlittle difficult to live with. This study determined and came to the \nconclusion that, yes, if you are hungry, you tend to be a little bit \nangry and you tend to take it out on the person nearest to you, who is \nusually your spouse.\n  I think any of us could have come up with that conclusion without \nspending $400,000 or so in order to determine that that is the case. \nThe word ``hangry'' has now been added to Webster's dictionary. You can \nlook it up. How can we spend $400,000 of the taxpayer's money to do \nthis study when people are having trouble paying their bills, their \nmortgage, or saving money so they can send their kids to school? This \nis the kind of thing that infuriates the American people. This is the \nkind of thing that has put our approval ratings in single digits. This \nis the kind of thing that causes people to say that Washington needs to \nbe shaken up. Why do we keep taking the American people's hard-earned \ntax dollars and spending them on things like this?\n  Many Americans struggle every day to put food on the table and pay \ntheir mortgage. It is infuriating to them that the Federal Government \nis wasting money doing these kind of things. Eliminating this wasteful \nspending can go a long way to restoring trust in Washington, and it \nneeds to start now. That is why, as I said, the studies by the \ngovernment's only watchdog agency, the Government Accountability \nOffice, are so important to the work we do here.\n  The GAO, or the Government Accountability Office, just released its \n``2016 Annual Report'' on additional opportunities to reduce \nfragmentation, overlap, and duplication. The GAO report presents 92 new \nactions we can take--either the Congress or the administration--to \nimprove government efficiency and effectiveness to achieve cost \nsavings. This report and some of its findings include programs I \nalready talked about, such as the failed advanced technology vehicles \nprogram I highlighted last week. Unfortunately, in an amendment I \noffered here on the floor, we came up short with a vote of 48 to 49, \nbut we raised the awareness of a program that is sitting on nearly $4 \nbillion of unspent money. Of the five proposals that were released--\nmoney\n\n[[Page S2406]]\n\nwas released on these five proposals--two of the companies have already \ngone bankrupt. Instead of sitting on $4 billion worth of additional \nmoney that we had to award, we simply said: Look, we have wasted $500 \nmillion in this program. Why don't we take that $4 billion and use it \nfor a better purpose, like returning it to the taxpayer. If not that, \nwe could have returned that money to the taxpayer or used the money to \noffset something essential, such as work that prolongs life and brings \nbetter health at NIH or perhaps put the money towards something else \nthat is needed, such as infrastructure, but, unfortunately, we came up \none vote short of a majority.\n  I am looking forward to exploring ways in which we can use examples \nin our continued efforts through ``Waste of the Week.'' We are looking \nat several things. We know the IRS is paying billions in fraudulent \nrefunds to criminals who steal people's IDs over the Internet, or \nwhatever method they use, and then file for IRS returns. We are looking \nat consolidating programs that are scattered across 22 different \nFederal agencies and have all kinds of duplications or selling unused \nFederal property, which could save billions of dollars a year. The list \ndoesn't end. It just continues.\n  I will be coming down here week after week. I will have another \n``Waste of the Week'' later this week. Exposing the waste, fraud, and \nabuse is only the first step that the administration and Congress must \ntake. According to this report, the actions Congress has already \ntaken--and Congress ought to be commended for this--by using GAO's \nrecommendations over the past 5 years has saved $56 billion. That is \nnot small change.\n  I have documented another $160 billion worth of savings in the last \n40 speeches--not million, billion. There is still plenty left to do.\n  In 2010, I asked Hoosiers to send me to Washington to rein in the \nFederal Government's runaway spending. Whether it is through my \ncontinued ``Waste of the Week'' speeches, legislation, or highlighting \nreports like the GAO report, as I am doing today, I will continue to \npour every ounce of effort I have into doing as much as I can to reduce \nwasteful government spending.\n  We will be back later this week with speech No. 41 of ``Waste of the \nWeek.'' Hopefully, we can continue to alert this Congress and this \ngovernment to the hard-earned money that is being wasted and could be \nused for much better purposes.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I am here to join Senator Merkley in \noffering amendment No. 3812 regarding funding for wind energy research.\n  This is a straightforward amendment. It simply restores funding for \nwind energy research to the amount provided for just last year--$95.4 \nmillion.\n  The underlying bill provides $80 million, so the Merkley-Grassley \namendment will increase funding by just $15.4 million. These additional \nfunds will come from within the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy \nProgram, so we can see there is no cost to this amendment from the \nbottom line of the bill. It does not raise overall spending levels. It \nsimply redirects $15 million from other renewable and efficiency \nprograms to wind energy research.\n  This funding will allow the Department of Energy to continue the \nadvancement of wind technologies and innovations. These advances have \ngreatly increased the competitiveness of wind and facilitated rapid \ngrowth in wind energy across the country.\n  In Iowa, wind energy now accounts for more than 30 percent of the \nState's total electricity supply. Wind supported 88,000 jobs in 2015, \nan increase of 20 percent from the previous year. Wind was also the No. \n1 source of new generating capacity in 2015--greater than natural gas \nand solar.\n  Some of my colleagues oppose wind energy and Federal policies that \nsupport this clean and renewable energy. They argue we shouldn't pick \nwinners or that wind is a mature industry. Don't kid yourself. Wind, \nwhile nearly mature, is just an infant compared to the Federal dollars \nand incentives provided for fossil and nuclear energy.\n  It is quite amusing to me that some of the strongest opponents of \nwind energy in this body are the biggest proponents of other much more \ncostly programs for mature, traditional energy sources. For example, \nthe 100-year-old oil and gas industry continues to benefit from tax \npreferences that benefit only their industry that result in the loss of \nmore than $4 billion annually in tax revenue.\n  Nuclear energy is another great example. The first nuclear powerplant \ncame online in the United States in 1958. That was 58 years ago. \nNuclear received special tax treatment, including--would you believe \nit--a production tax credit. Nuclear also benefits from Price-Anderson \nFederal liability insurance that Congress provided as a temporary \nmeasure way back in 1958. This temporary measure--can you believe it--\nhas been renewed through 2025. Nuclear energy has also received more \nthan $74 billion in Federal research and development dollars since \n1950. This bill includes over $1 billion for nuclear research. This is \nan increase of $71 million, or 7.3 percent, over fiscal year 2016 for \nwind energy research. We are just asking for the same amount of money \nappropriated for next year as this year.\n  Fossil energy research and development is another one I can point \nout, which is allocated $632 million in this bill, equal to the 2016 \nlevels. Even prominent conservative advocacy groups have called for the \nnuclear and fossil fuel energy funds to be cut or eliminated \naltogether.\n  Again, this amendment will simply provide level funding for wind \nenergy research by providing an additional $15 million. This is not new \nmoney, so there is no score by the CBO. I urge my colleagues to support \nthe Merkley-Grassley amendment.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes on \nanother subject as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    State of Our Political Discourse\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I recently gave a speech to the \nMidwest Political Science Undergraduate Research Conference, which was \nheld at Wartburg College in Waverly, IA. It dealt with the current \nstate of our political discourse and what we should all do as Americans \nto try and elevate that political discourse.\n  The election-year rhetoric is already heating up in the Senate, so I \nthink it is appropriate to share with the Senate what I told these \npolitical science students and their professors.\n  This is an election year, so there is a lot of talk about how \nAmericans have voted and will vote, as well as which Americans will \nvote and which ones will not vote. There is something that is evident \nin this election season, and it is also something I have seen increase \nsteadily since I have served in elected office, and that happens to be \ncynicism. Americans are increasingly cynical about their system of \ngovernment and those who serve in that government. Candidates of all \npolitical stripes are tapping into this cynicism by railing against so-\ncalled elites. Sometimes it is the notion of elites within a political \nparty, elites in Washington generally, or elites even in the private \nsector. Regardless, there is a perception that elites of some kind or \nanother have an undue influence over decisionmaking and ordinary \ncitizens are being ignored.\n  I am not saying that such concerns are all illegitimate, but I think \nthe cynicism is made worse by a lack of understanding when it comes to \nhow our government works and, more importantly, why it works the way it \ndoes. It seems to me there has been a decline in interest in teaching \nAmerican students about our constitutional system and especially the \nprinciples on which it was founded. You cannot understand how our \ngovernment works and how it is supposed to work without understanding \nthe Constitution. I would add that the best guide to the Constitution \nis the Federalist Papers.\n  You also cannot understand the Constitution without understanding the \nDeclaration of Independence, but you\n\n[[Page S2407]]\n\ncannot understand the Declaration of Independence without understanding \nthe natural rights philosophy. You also cannot separate the study of \nhistory from political science.\n  To understand our current political debate, it is important to \nunderstand how we got where we are today. For instance, the debate \nbetween anti-Federalists and Federalists sheds a great deal of light on \nwhat our founding generation agreed upon and what they disagreed upon. \nSubsequent events such as the Civil War, the progressive movement, and \nthe civil rights movement all drew upon earlier American political \nideas, either borrowing from or rejecting them. Our political discourse \ntoday is inevitably influenced by this heritage, but it also seems \ndisconnected from it.\n  From cable news shows to the local diner, people with different views \nshout past each other without comprehending the opposing arguments. In \nrecent years, there has been a realignment of political parties that \nfollows more closely along philosophical lines. That has led to more \nparty-line votes, but you would think that would make our debate more \nabout principles instead of pure partisanship, but it hasn't.\n  There has been a lot written about how Americans are increasingly \nsorting themselves into groups--where they live and work with people \nwho think like they do and only consume like-minded media. As a result, \nwhen people do encounter a view they don't agree with, there is a \ntendency to think there must be something wrong with the person who \nholds that view. Moreover, if a policy you disagree with gets enacted \nbut almost no one you know supports it, naturally you feel there must \nbe something amiss. That leads to anger, resentment, and cynicism, and \nthat makes for fertile ground for demagogues.\n  There are real differences of philosophy reflected in the two major \npolitical parties, so I am not arguing there shouldn't be vigorous \ndebate. In fact, the clash of ideas is an essential part of our \nrepresentative system of government, but you cannot effectively \nchallenge an opponent's philosophy if you don't understand that \nphilosophy, and you cannot understand your opponent's philosophy unless \nyou understand what you believe and why you believe it. That is why it \nis so important Americans study American history and civics.\n  Thomas Jefferson said:\n\n       If a Nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of \n     civilization, it expects what never was and never will be. If \n     we are to guard against ignorance and remain free, it is the \n     responsibility of every American to be informed.\n\n  In an election year, we talk a lot about voting being a civic duty, \nbut that is incomplete. Our civic duty goes well beyond the simple act \nof voting. We have a responsibility to understand what we believe and \nwhy before we go into the voting booth.\n  Representative government doesn't work very well if citizens are only \nengaged in the month or two before an election. Our system of \ngovernment relies on an informed and active citizenry. We need more \nAmericans to write their Members of Congress and to ask their \npositions, attend town meetings, and seek to understand both sides of \nan issue. Still, we have to come to terms with the fact that we are a \nclosely divided nation. Better understanding of each other's principles \nwill elevate the debate, which is good for representative government, \nbut it will not eliminate and shouldn't eliminate political \ndifferences.\n  The next step is to respect other people's right to live according to \ntheir principles. I believe that calls for a renewed commitment to \nfederalism. The Father of our Constitution, James Madison, designed a \nsystem for what he called an extended republic. The classical \nunderstanding of a republic as small, unitary, and homogeneous did not \napply to the new United States and it certainly doesn't now. In fact, \nMadison argued that our large, diverse country could better prevent a \nmajority faction from forming and trampling on the rights of others. \nHowever, it also required decentralizing power and allowing different \nStates and communities to do things their own way.\n  Whenever a government takes an action, there will almost certainly be \nsome people unhappy with it. That is why the presumption should be to \nlet individual Americans live their lives as they see fit. When \ngovernment action is warranted, the decision should be made as close as \npossible to those it affects. In my view, the extent to which the \nFederal Government now makes a great many decisions that affect the \nlives of Americans beyond the limited role envisioned in the \nConstitution leads to a great deal of unnecessary conflict.\n  Since our government is so closely divided, a great many decisions \nwill upset almost half of the American people. That is not a \nsustainable situation. So my preferred solution--which, of course, is \nbased upon my political philosophy--is to let States and communities \nmake more of their own decisions when it comes to issues such as health \ncare and education. Of course, others may disagree and do disagree, and \nwe should have that debate, but it should be an honest and respectful \ndebate based upon very basic principles.\n\n  That was the end of my substantive remarks to those students at \nWartburg College. I then commended the students for their interest in \nexploring political issues. I also said to the students that the fact \nthat they are interested and that they are engaged and many of their \npeers are not gives these students a very special calling.\n  I ended my speech with a challenge. I said: I would challenge you to \ncontinue developing your understanding of your political beliefs and \nthose of others with whom you may disagree and then do your part to \nelevate the political dialogue. I would issue the same challenge to my \ncolleagues here in the Senate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I want to thank the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa for his remarks and also his chairmanship of the \nJudiciary Committee. I found his remarks very interesting.\n  I note that the distinguished chairman of the Energy and Water \nAppropriations Subcommittee is now on the floor. I have been very \nfortunate to serve as his ranking member, and I think that we have put \na very good bill together and that his leadership has been very strong.\n  Last week Senator Alexander brought to the floor a chart, and on that \nchart there were red and blue lines, and they depicted a lot about the \nspending patterns of this Nation, which absolutely is relevant, \nconsidering we are talking about spending. Well, I wanted to put my \nrendition before us since no one on the floor is asking to speak at \nthis time.\n  Since 2006 I have asked my staff to put together some charts on \nspending, which I share every week at my constituent breakfast with the \nconstituency from California.\n  I want to tell you a little bit about this chart. The source of this \nchart is the Congressional Budget Office, and it is the budget and \neconomic outlook part of that. Going back to 2006, we looked at budget \nnumbers, but the actual way to look at it is really outlays. What does \nthe Federal Government spend every year? That is the number which \ncreates the debt and creates interest on the debt.\n  In 2006 the Federal Government spent $2.654 trillion in total. Here \nis how it was spent: This big red part is what are called entitlements. \nThese are mandatory payments to programs to which an individual is \nentitled. If you are entitled to it, you get it regardless of what \nimpact it has on the budget. They were 53 percent of what the Federal \nGovernment spent in 2006, and interest on the debt was 8 percent. So if \nwe add 53 percent and 8 percent, that was about 61 percent of \neverything that was spent during that year. Nondefense discretionary \nwas 19 percent and defense was 20 percent. So the green and the blue \nwere the discretionary programs, the yellow was interest on the debt, \nand the rest were entitlements.\n  This year the total outlay is $3.919 trillion. Entitlements have gone \nup to 63 percent of what the Federal Government will pay out this year. \nInterest on the debt has dropped 2 percent to 6.5\n\n[[Page S2408]]\n\npercent, largely because interest rates are low. Defense discretionary \nis 15 percent, and nondefense discretionary is 15.5 percent. So if we \nput these two things together, which we are now passing appropriations \nbills on, they comprise only about 30.5 percent of what the Federal \nGovernment will spend this year. The rest is entitlements and interest \non the debt.\n  If you are entitled to Social Security, you get it. If you are \nentitled to Medicare, you get it. If you are entitled to Medicaid; \ndisabled; women, infants, and children; and a whole host of very good \nprograms because they help people--but they are expensive and they \ncost. This isn't often talked about, and I think it is not talked about \nbecause individuals don't want to worry people. But it is a problem, \nand it is a problem that needs some solutions.\n  If you project these numbers 10 years forward to 2026, we go from \ntotal outlays, total government payments in 2016 of $3.9 trillion, to \n$6.401 trillion, and entitlements are then 65 percent of what the \ngovernment will spend in the year 2026. Interest on the debt will \ndouble from what it is today to 13 percent because it is estimated that \ninterest rates will go up. So, adding the two together, you see that we \nare well over 70 percent in spending. If we look at discretionary \nspending, defense discretionary and nondefense discretionary, we will \nsee they are both 11 percent. That is the economic outlook.\n  So only 22 percent of the budget will be what the Appropriations \nCommittee will be doing in 10 years from now because the rest of it \nwill not be able to be controlled. So we have a constantly escalating \npicture.\n  In my own view, those things like the Army Corps of Engineers, which \nin a sense is the only infrastructure program this country really has \noutside of the highway program, will be compressed more, and everything \nwe spend to make this a better country will be compressed more because \nof the growth in entitlements and interest on the debt.\n  Well, I believe the time has come for Members on both sides of the \naisle to sit down and see what we can do to work out solutions to this \never-growing problem. Is it additional taxes? Are there ways we can \nchange these programs so that they become more efficient to cover \npeople and pay for them in a better way than putting them on the debt, \nwhich is effectively what we are doing?\n  So I want to state to our distinguished chairman, who is now here, \nlast week we had his red and blue lines, so this week I brought my \ncharts that I have been using since 2006, and I believe the numbers are \ncorrect, and I believe they are also astonishing and they need our \nconcern.\n  I would like to work with the chairman in the future, and perhaps we \ncould bring together Republicans and Democrats to sit down and consider \nsome remedies that will not be punishing for people but will bring this \nhuge red mark and thereby the interest mark into better control than \ntoday.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I congratulate the Senator from \nCalifornia. With her usual precision, she has identified the big \nproblem, and she approached it as she usually does--in a very direct \nway. The picture she presents is not one we can tolerate in the United \nStates of America. The good news is, we have done a good job on \ndiscretionary spending. That is what we are working on in these bills.\n  The chart I showed last week, which shows about the same things in a \nlittle different way than hers, points out that the spending in 12 \nappropriations bills has been flat and will be flat for the next 10 \nyears. In other words, if the work the Appropriations Committee is \ndoing on $1 trillion were all that there was to the Federal budget, we \nwould not have a Federal debt problem. That blue line is Federal \nspending under control. We set priorities. We have oversight. Senator \nFeinstein and I have eliminated programs. We do that every year. We are \ngetting control of this budget of big cost overruns that persistently \nhappened on large construction projects. So I am proud of that blue \nline. I am not proud of the red one. That is the one Senator Feinstein \nis talking about. This is $1 trillion, but on top of that is $3 \ntrillion. That is the automatic spending.\n  There has been very little courage shown on the Republican side of \nthe aisle or on the Democratic side of the aisle. We make big speeches \nsometimes about the blue line, which isn't a problem, but very few \nspeeches about the red line that are as straightforward as Senator \nFeinstein's remarks today.\n  We have a responsibility to taxpayers, to ourselves, and to the next \ngeneration to deal with this line because that is the line which is \ncausing the Joint Chiefs of Staff to say that our Federal debt is our \nbiggest national security problem, which is quite a thing to say in a \nworld as unsafe as we have today.\n  I thank the Senator from California. Her prestige in the Chamber \nmakes her remarks today even more important. I look forward to working \nwith her to gradually bring this red line under control while we still \ncan.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3813 to Amendment No. 3801\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Murray, I call up \nMurray amendment No. 3813 and ask unanimous consent that it be reported \nby number.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the \namendment by number.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for Mrs. \n     Murray, proposes an amendment numbered 3813 to amendment No. \n     3801.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To add a provision relating to certain requirements in the \n       acquisition of welded shipboard anchor and mooring chain)\n\n       At the end of title I, add the following:\n       Sec. 1__.  None of the funds made available by this title \n     may be used for any acquisition that is not consistent with \n     section 225.7007 of title 48, Code of Federal Regulations.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, is it appropriate for me to speak on \nthe Murray amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I say to the body that I support this \namendment. The Murray amendment would reinforce ``Buy American'' \nprovisions that have been in place for decades. These provisions say \nthat when American tax dollars are being spent, the preference should \nbe to buy American products.\n  Despite current Federal regulations, there are concerns that the \nCorps of Engineers is circumventing these ``Buy American'' provisions \nand acquiring welded shipboard anchor and mooring chain manufactured by \nforeign sources. The Murray amendment simply reiterates current \nrequirements to support American-made products, echoing language from \nour colleagues in the House and the 2016 appropriations bill.\n  The amendment is good for families and workers across the country, \nand I urge this body to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, Murray amendment No. 3813 simply \nrestates an existing regulation, so I have no objection to it. I am \ngoing to vote for it.\n  I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3813.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Texas (Mr. Cruz), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. \nGraham), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey), and the Senator \nfrom Louisiana (Mr. Vitter).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow vote on these amendments en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S2410]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I know of no further debate on these \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendments en bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3841; 3842; 3851; 3843; 3844; 3808; 3869, as \nmodified; and 3870) were agreed to.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader, Senator \nMcConnell, the Democratic leader, Senator Reid, and my colleague, \nSenator Feinstein.\n  What we have done is approved eight more amendments by Senators with \na voice vote, and we have already agreed to have three more votes at 11 \na.m. tomorrow. We are making good progress. We hope to continue to do \nthat and wrap up the bill soon.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I wish to support two crucial \nprograms important to Utah and the West in the Energy and Water \nAppropriations bill pending before us.\n  The bill includes $10 million for the Central Utah Project in the \nDepartment of the Interior. This funding makes great strides in \nsupporting rural water infrastructure. Over the decades-long life of \nthis project, I have always advocated for appropriate funding levels to \nensure timely completion of this project.\n  This vital program was authorized in the 1956 Colorado River Storage \nProject Act and allows the State of Utah to develop its share of the \nColorado River for irrigation and water supply. This program also \nreaches into five other States and provides for construction of water \ndelivery infrastructure.\n  Over the past few years, the Obama administration has constantly \ntried to underfund the Central Utah Project, but Senator Alexander and \nSenator Feinstein have been able to restore funding to levels that \nenable construction to move forward.\n  Continuing funding for this project is important to taxpayers. Once \nthe project is built and begins to deliver water, the people of Utah \nwill start to repay their share of the costs to the Treasury.\n  This funding also allows mitigation work to continue, which restores \nand protects lands that are important to fish and wildlife that have \nbeen impacted by Federal water development for this project.\n  While we all wish additional funding were available for the important \nprojects in our State, I believe that Senator Alexander and Senator \nFeinstein have done a good job in balancing priorities, and I \nappreciate them including funding to continue this vital program.\n  Another important program funded in this bill is the section 595 \nenvironmental infrastructure program in the Corps of Engineers.\n  Section 595 is a program that provides funding to rural areas in \nIdaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming for water \nconstruction projects.\n  The bill includes $10 million for this program, which the Corps of \nEngineers will allocate competitively among the eligible States.\n  Section 595 funding is particularly important for projects in rural \nareas surrounded by Federal lands. Often, local sponsors can't meet the \ngeneral 50/50 cost share required for construction projects, but \nsection 595 reduces the non-Federal cost-share.\n  An example of where this program made a big difference in my State is \nin the small town of Escalante, where section 595 funds were used to \nrehabilitate and enlarge the Wide Hollow Reservoir.\n  Before the project began, irrigation water that was held in the \nreservoir only lasted until mid-July, leaving most farmers with wilted \ncrops during the heat of the summer.\n  The Corps of Engineers provided $5.5 million under the section 595 \nprogram, which was matched with nearly $8 million in State grants and \nloans.\n  Today, because of Section 595, Escalante farmers can expect to \nreceive water throughout the growing season, which allows them to \nharvest hay and other critical crops that, in the past, they would have \nhad to purchase.\n  There are projects just like Wide Hollow Reservoir throughout the \nState of Utah--in fact, all throughout the West--and taxpayers can be \nassured that the $10 million provided in the Energy and Water bill will \nbe put to good use.\n  I appreciate Senator Alexander and Senator Feinstein working with me \nto include these critical funds, especially given the tight budgets \nthat we face this year and the competing priorities they had to \nconsider.\n  To conclude, Mr. President, I believe that the Energy and Water bill \nthat Senator Alexander and Senator Feinstein have before the Senate is \na balanced, prioritized bill that includes important priorities not \nonly for my State of Utah, but also for the Nation and I urge its \npassage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n      Honoring Nebraska's Soldiers Who Lost Their Lives In Combat\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise today to continue my tribute to \nNebraska's heroes and the current generation of men and women who lost \ntheir lives defending our freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Each of these Nebraskans has a special story to tell. Throughout this \nyear and beyond, I will continue to honor their memory here on the \nSenate floor.\n\n\n                  Master Sergeant Linda Tarango-Griess\n\n  Mr. President, today, I wish to highlight the life of MSG Linda \nTarango-Griess of Sutton, NE.\n  Linda was known to everyone as one proud soldier. From an early age, \nshe was disciplined and focused on the future. Her Aunt Marie remembers \nthis future soldier as ``a great kid'' who was always helping others. \nMarie would know because she raised Linda from the age of 11.\n  Linda attended Kearney High School, where she enjoyed playing \nsoftball and volleyball. She was also active in the Big Brothers Big \nSisters program.\n  Linda's willingness to serve as a role model and mentor for others \ncame as no surprise to those who knew her. As one of her high school \nclassmates recalled, Linda was ``someone who always had a smile and a \npositive attitude.''\n  After graduating from Kearney High School in 1989, Linda was \ndetermined to go to college, but she struggled to find a way to pay for \nit. She learned about tuition assistance opportunities offered by the \nNational Guard and she decided to enlist.\n  Through the National Guard, Linda discovered her passion for being a \nsoldier in the U.S. military. It also allowed her to complete her \ncollege education.\n  Linda graduated from the University of Nebraska in Kearney with a \ndegree in criminal justice.\n  As part of her service, Linda was required to train one weekend a \nmonth in York, NE. It was there that Linda met her soulmate, Doug \nGriess. After dating for a few years, they were married in 1994.\n  For the next several years, the young couple formed a new bond and \nthey began planning for the future while continuing their service in \nthe National Guard.\n  Less than a decade after they were married, their roles in the \nmilitary would bring them both to the frontlines of a new war a world \naway from home in Iraq. Linda and Doug wondered which of them would be \ncalled up first. Then the news came for Linda to deploy with the 267th \nOrdnance Company.\n  After deployment training, the 267th arrived at Camp Speicher near \nTikrit, Iraq, in February of 2004. As one of the unit's senior \nsergeants, Linda's helpful nature and her insistence on doing every job \nwell quickly stood out. Her professionalism and caring nature boosted \nthe morale of her platoon.\n  An officer from a nearby unit said Linda ``was always a true \nprofessional--not only a mentor but also a friend. She served her \ncountry honorably.''\n  The summer of 2004 was shaping up to be a complicated period. Doug \nwas at annual training back home, and rumors were flying about his unit \ndeploying. At the same time, Linda was planning to return home on leave \nto be with Doug and her family for a short time.\n  On July 10, Doug's unit received deployment orders. The following \nday, on July 11, 2004, the unthinkable happened. Linda was driving in a \nconvoy through a high-threat area in Samarra, Iraq. The convoy was \nattacked by Al Qaeda insurgents, and Linda's vehicle\n\n[[Page S2411]]\n\ntook a direct hit from an improvised explosive device. Linda and \nanother soldier were killed.\n  She was only 2 weeks from returning to Nebraska.\n  Doug was at home with his friends discussing their upcoming \ndeployment. Suddenly, a car pulled up with three soldiers dressed in \nClass A uniforms, and Doug knew why they were there.\n  Linda was buried in Sutton, NE, and over 1,000 mourners traveled to \nthis small town in Central Nebraska to honor this brave soldier. A \nmonth later, Doug deployed to Iraq with his unit. His grief over the \nloss of Linda was held at bay for a year as he focused on his mission \nand his fellow soldiers. Linda would have wanted it that way. Doug's \ncommitment to fulfilling his oath and serving his Nation would have \nmade her proud.\n  MSG Linda Tarango-Griess was the first woman to lose her life in \ncombat while serving in the Nebraska National Guard. She earned the \nPurple Heart, the Bronze Star, and was promoted posthumously to Master \nSergeant.\n  Doug would later remarry, and he is now the proud father of three \nwonderful children. Linda's Aunt Marie lives in Lincoln, where she is \nactive in Yellow Ribbon activities for troops serving abroad. Linda's \nsister Vicki lives in North Platte with her three children, not far \nfrom her brother Augie and her father Augustin.\n  To this day, one of Linda's cousins keeps an email from Linda that \nwas sent before she departed on her final mission. In the email, Linda \nproudly describes how her platoon competed in a 5-mile run which the \n267th nicknamed the ``Desert Dash.'' Linda said: ``None of us won the \nrace, but in our hearts we are winners, our reward is the self-\nsatisfaction for just finishing the race.''\n  I hope all Nebraskans remember her as an example of what it means to \nserve our Nation with bravery, compassion, and joy.\n  MSG Linda Tarango-Griess is a hero. She embodied the grit and \ndetermination of an American soldier, and I am honored to tell her \nstory.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Nomination of Jessica Rosenworcel\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, we have a great opportunity in the \nSenate to recognize and reconfirm an extraordinarily distinguished and \ndedicated public servant who happens to be from West Hartford, CT, \nJessica Rosenworcel of the Federal Communications Commission.\n  I understand there was an agreement as part of the approval of \nCommissioner O'Rielly and that Michael O'Rielly, in fact, was \nreconfirmed as part of a very unusual request that there be that \nagreement. The President renominated Ms. Rosenworcel for a new 5-year \nterm in 2015, and she was easily and unanimously confirmed by the \nCommerce Committee. I think we ought to keep that agreement in the \nSenate, that anyone a party to that agreement when the Democratic \nleader, Senator Reid, agreed to reconfirm Republican FCC Commissioner \nMichael O'Rielly--that we ought to move forward. But apart from the \npolitics and the internal agreements that may have been reached--and \nthey deserve to be honored--Commissioner Rosenworcel is supremely well \nqualified, and she is needed on the Commission, which is sorely in need \nof her expertise and experience in specific areas.\n  Let me give just a few examples. No. 1, as an example of her \nleadership, she led the effort to provide for writing rules that will \nenable enforcement of the 9/11 locating standards for all 9/11 services \nacross the country. The GPS location services require those rules. She \nhas written standards and will enable those standards to become the \nguiding light for all 9/11 services. That is important in cases of \nemergency. It is important in cases of physical and emotional trauma or \ncrashes--an accident. It is important in cases of opioid or heroin \noverdoses, which are becoming increasingly prevalent across the \ncountry. In fact, in Connecticut and, my guess, Oklahoma and all across \nthe country, there is an epidemic of opioid and heroin addiction \ntragically taking a toll in deaths and financial costs. When there are \noverdoses, the administration of Narcan or naloxone within a limited \nperiod of time may be the difference between life and death and, in \nfact, can bring people back from the brink of death.\n  Those types of location standards will help emergency responders go \nto the places they are needed. The standards applied to the 9/11 \nservices that enable the first responders to go to those places are a \nresult of the work that Commissioner Rosenworcel has done on the FCC. \nThat is only one example of the kind of work she has done.\n  She has been outspoken on the cruel struggle faced by students left \nout of the broadband revolution, as countless are in areas that have no \nInternet access at home and face obstacles, literally, to complete \nhomework they are given at school and to apply for scholarships they \nneed financially. Today, roughly 7 in 10 teachers assign homework that \nrequires access to broadband, but the data from the FCC suggests that \nalmost 1 in 3 households lacks subscriptions to broadband services. \nThey simply do not subscribe to those services at any speed with any \nserver due to lack of affordability and, frankly, lack of interest.\n  Ms. Rosenworcel has made this ``homework gap''--a term, by the way, \nthat she coined--one of her top priorities and has pushed all of us to \nthink creatively to provide all students with the connectivity they \nneed for a fair chance to succeed. That is really the American dream--a \nfair chance to succeed, closing the gap that results from this lack of \naccess to the Internet, which in turn creates a homework gap and a \nscholarship gap and generally deprives those students of a fair chance.\n  As Commissioner, Ms. Rosenworcel has visited schools across the \ncountry in Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, and many more and witnessed how \nthe Internet can support greater learning opportunities and also how \nlimited broadband capacity prevents students from developing the skills \nessential for them to compete in the global, digital economy. Drawing \nfrom these experiences and her experience in the Senate working on this \nprogram, she called for an E-Rate 2.0 to ensure that the E-Rate Program \nis reinvigorated to meet the future connectivity needs for libraries \nand schools through stronger broadband capacity standards and robust \nfunding. That robust funding is an investment this Nation needs to \nmake.\n  She is continuing the legacy of Senator Rockefeller to fight for \nstrong public safety, not only on the FCC 9/11 rules, which keep \ncommunities safe and provide emergency responders the ability they need \nto go to places where there are overdoses or other health emergencies, \nbut she has also worked on a bipartisan policy, a spectrum policy \nleading the FCC to raise recordbreaking amounts in the last year's \nwireless spectrum auction and ensuring that there is more than enough \nto fully fund FirstNet, the nationwide interoperability network for \npublic safety officials to communicate during emergencies.\n  She has taken her own time--and she has a young family--on multiple \noccasions when she is back home in Connecticut to join me in helping to \neducate wireless customers and consumers on what they can do to avoid \ncramming--those are the charges on phone bills that consumers never \nconsent to and never know about in many instances--and where they can \ngo to seek refunds when they are victims of these kinds of cramming \nscams. She has been a champion of consumer interest on cramming \nrefunds, on preventing cramming, and on helping to reach wise and \nprudent settlements with the carriers.\n  She has joined me to call on telephone companies to offer consumers \nnew tools to block robocalls. What I find--and it is a relevant point \nduring the campaign season in which we find ourselves--is that voters, \nconsumers, residents, people from all walks of life in both parties, \nand a lot with no party at all, deeply resent the robocalling we see so \noften. Those robocalls come from commercial interests and sometimes \nfrom political interests. I approve banning robocalls. Whether or not \nwe agree to ban them, consumers ought to have the ability to block them \nif they choose to. That is the cause she has championed with me.\n\n[[Page S2412]]\n\n  I deeply respect her commitment to consumer interests. She is widely \nacknowledged for her keen judgment and insight on all these issues, \nadvancing smart telecommunications policy for the public benefit.\n  She is a graduate of Wesleyan University and New York University Law \nSchool. Her career has been about telecommunications law, which \nincluded time as senior communications counsel for the Senate Commerce \nCommittee under the leadership of both Senator Rockefeller and Senator \nInouye.\n  In her time on the Commission, she has been a champion of consumers, \nstudents, emergency responders, of everyday working men and women who \ndeserve the best system and protection of their interests when it comes \nto telecommunications.\n  There was an agreement that ought to be respected, but as important \nor even more important than an agreement, she deserves and the country \nneeds for her to serve as a Commissioner.\n  I urge my colleagues to reconfirm her swiftly and overwhelmingly so \nthat she can continue to do this vital and important work she has been \ndoing.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, last Friday marked the 46th annual Earth \nDay, and we cannot ignore that we are at a crossroads in time. Human-\ncaused climate change is accelerating with each passing year and is now \ntaking a severe toll on our planet. We see it in our scorched farmlands \nand burnt forests in the West and in the flood ravaged river valleys \nand superstorm battered coastlines in the East. Climate change is not a \nhoax, and we must act now to protect our future and our future \ngenerations.\n  Earth Day is an opportunity to recognize that climate change is not \nonly the greatest threat to our environment today, but it also poses a \nthreat to public health and to our national and economic security. In \ncoming years, the economy of Vermont, the United States, and every \ncountry on Earth will be altered. We must guide that economic \ntransformation to protect future generations.\n  We are really just beginning to grapple with the serious economic \nconsequences of climate change across the country. In Vermont, we saw \nthe warmest winter on record this year, with mean temperatures 5 to 10 \ndegrees above normal and snowfall several feet below normal. On \nChristmas Eve, the mercury hit 68 degrees in the State capital of \nMontpelier, beating the previous record by 17 degrees. The abnormally \nhigh temperatures and lack of snow hurt our ski and tourism industries. \nMany ski areas saw business down 20 percent, and some saw a drop of as \nmuch as 40 percent. This does not just impact the ski areas and the \nmountains, but also our restaurants, local hotels, contractors, and \nother businesses that are driven by the ski industry.\n  Climate change could also impact Vermont's maple industry, which \ncontributes more than $300 million in sales to Vermont's economy every \nyear. While 2016 has been a successful year for producing maple syrup, \nif temperatures continue to rise each year, in the short term we could \nface reduced sap quality and even a decrease in the amount of sap \nproduced. I am also very concerned that, in the long term, our sugar \nmaple stands could be decimated by invasive pests or threatened by \ndrought and forest fires. The agriculture and fisheries sector is \nhighly dependent on specific climate conditions, and maple production \nwill not be the only agricultural industry affected. The Pacific \nNorthwest's winemakers, Alaska's salmon fisheries, the Southeast's \npeanut producers, and corn growers in the Midwest could all face \nsignificant climate-related challenges.\n  The threats posed by climate change are numerous and can be downright \nfrightening. However, Earth Day--and every day--we must remember that, \nif we can have such a profound negative impact on our environment, we \ncan also have a profound positive affect on the drivers of climate \nchange. If we make climate the top priority around which we organize \nand refocus economic decisions, we can find solutions to climate risk \nthrough creative thinking and innovation. While climate change does \nrepresent one of the greatest challenges of our time, we should see it \nas opportunity to nurture and attract entrepreneurism, rather than \ndragging our heels or denying that there is a problem.\n  I am proud that time after time Vermonters continue to come together \nto identify solutions to big problems. I am amazed and energized every \nday by Vermont innovators who are thinking creatively and already \nleading nationally and internationally. Vermont businesses, nonprofits, \nand educational institutions are already tackling big problems and \nfinding solutions to climate change, solutions that are being readied \nto be deployed in Vermont and exported around the world. Just last \nweek, I had joined leaders from the University of Vermont to announce a \nNational Science Foundation competitive award of $20 million to Vermont \nEPSCoR, which will support research of the Lake Champlain Basin and its \nwatersheds to find out what has made some parts of the basin resilient \nin the face of extreme weather events, while\n\n[[Page S2413]]\n\nother parts fail to recover and rebound. Work like this on Lake \nChamplain will give Vermont and other regions new tools to help build \nresiliency in areas that have been vulnerable in the past.\n  Recently, I was pleased to hear that not just one, but two Vermont \ncompanies, Green Mountain Power and Vermont Electric Power Company, or \nVELCO, are finalists for the Edison Electric Institute's prestigious \nEdison Award this year for their innovation and contribution to the \nadvancement of the electric industry. Green Mountain Power is working \nto expand renewable energy production in Vermont and is taking their \nCow Power model to the next level with a large multifarm bio-digester. \nMeanwhile, VELCO's Vermont Weather Analytics Center will help to build \na more reliable grid as customers, communities, and energy businesses \nwork to prepare for the more severe storms brought by climate change \nand will also help garner renewable energy's full value and potential \nin the State. These are cutting-edge projects, generating jobs and \nknowledge while generating energy.\n  Some people see climate change simply as an environmental issue, but \nit is about so much more than that. Creating a green energy sector is \nnot just about cutting greenhouse gas emissions. It is about providing \njobs for Americans in the renewable energy and energy efficiency \nsectors. This is about strengthening national security through energy \nindependence. This is about breaking the stranglehold of oil on the \ntransportation system by developing alternative transportation energy \nsources. Addressing climate change is also about ensuring that our \nchildren and grandchildren have clean air to breathe on Earth Day and \nevery day for generations to come.\n  We have come together before, across the aisle and across regions, to \nsolve large problems. We must do so again. We owe it to the planet and \nto future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/25/senate-section/article/S2413-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2413-S2415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION\n\n  Mr. CORKER.

Also included: Operational \n     Flight Plan upgrade to M6.5 tape for the Polish F-16C/D Block \n     52 aircraft to include JASSM integration, missile containers, \n     spare and repair parts, support and test equipment, \n     publications and technical documentation, personnel training \n     and training equipment, U.S. Government and contractor \n     engineering, technical, and logistics support services, and \n     other related elements of logistical and program support. The \n     estimated total cost was $500 million. Major Defense \n     Equipment (MDE) constituted $270 million of this total.\n       This transmittal reports the addition of twenty-eight (28) \n     AGM-158A Joint Air-to Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM) to \n     the previously notified sale. Upon completion of contract \n     negotiations between the U.S. Government and the vendor, the \n     per-missile price was significantly lower than anticipated, \n     resulting in residual funds available to Poland. Poland \n     decided to use these funds to procure twenty-eight (28) \n     additional missiles. Increasing the quantity of missiles will \n     not result in a net increase in the value of MDE originally \n     notified. The total case value will remain $500 million.\n       (iv) Significance: The proposed increase in quantity will \n     improve Poland's capacity to deter regional threats and to \n     strengthen its homeland defense as well as to strengthen its \n     air-to-ground strike capabilities.\n       (v) Justification: The proposed sale will contribute to the \n     foreign policy and the national security objectives of the \n     United States by helping to improve the security of a NATO \n     ally. Poland continues to be an important force for political \n     stability and economic progress in Central Europe.\n       (vi) Date Report Delivered to Congress: April 21, 2016.\n                                                  Defense Security\n\n\n                                           Cooperation Agency,\n\n                                                    Arlington, VA.\n     Hon.

This \n     report relates to enhancements or upgrades from the level of \n     sensitivity of technology or capability described in the \n     Section 36(b)(1) AECA certification 14-23 of 23 July 2014.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Jennifer Zakriski,\n\n                                    (For J.W. Rixey, Vice Admiral,\n                                                   USN, Director).\n       Enclosures.\n\n\n                         transmittal no. 0e-16\n\n     Report of Enhancement or Upgrade of Sensitivity of Technology \n         or Capability (Sec. 36(b)(5)(A), AECA)\n       (i) Purchaser: Government of Tunisia.\n       (ii) Sec. 36(b)(l), AECA Transmittal No.: 14-23; Date: 23 \n     July 2014; Military Department: Army.\n       (iii) Description: On 23 July 2014, Congress was notified \n     by Congressional Notification Transmittal Number 14-23, of \n     the possible sale under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export \n     Control Act of twelve UH-60M Black Hawk aircraft as well as \n     spare and repair parts, weapon systems, configurations \n     updates, communications security equipment and radios, \n     integration studies, support equipment, aircraft ferry and \n     tanker support, repair and return, publications and technical \n     documentation, personnel training and training equipment, \n     U.S. Government and contractor engineering and logistics \n     personnel services, and other related elements of logistics \n     support. The estimated total cost was $700 million. Major \n     Defense Equipment (MDE) constituted $440 million of this \n     total.\n       This transmittal reports the inclusion of eighteen (18) \n     sets of Embedded Global Positioning System/Inertial \n     Navigation System (GPS/INS) equipment as MDE. Although the \n     value of the GPS/INS was included in the total value of the \n     case, it was not enumerated or valued as MDE in the original \n     notification. Upgrading the status of this equipment to MDE \n     will increase the MDE cost by $7.5 million.\n       Additionally, this transmittal reports the inclusion of two \n     (2) M36-E9 Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM) in the \n     weapons configuration (Hellfire training missiles) as MDE. \n     Although the value of the CATM was included in the total \n     value of the case, it was not enumerated or valued as MDE in \n     the original notification. Upgrading the status of this \n     equipment to MDE will increase the MDE cost by $105,000.\n       Finally, this transmittal report designates the Advanced \n     Precision Kill Weapons System (APKWS) as the specific \n     Precision Guided Rocket System listed in the original \n     notification. It has now been determined that the APKWS will \n     be the Precision Guided Rocket System integrated into the \n     aircraft and will include 515 all up rounds. The APKWS all-up \n     rounds consist of guidance sections, MK66 MOD 4 2.75 inch \n     rocket motors, and M152 High Explosive (HE) warheads. The \n     value of the APKWS was included in the total case value of \n     the original notification but was not included in the MDE \n     cost. The inclusion of the APKWS as MDE will increase the MDE \n     cost by $17.5 million. The revised total MDE cost is $465.1 \n     million. The total case value will remain $700 million.\n       (iv) Significance: The GPS/INS provides highly accurate \n     all-altitude, all-weather navigation and timing information \n     to the UH-60M Black Hawk aircraft, allowing more precise \n     flight pattern and rendezvous. The CATM consists of a \n     functional guidance section coupled to an inert missile bus \n     and is used for flight training but cannot be launched. The \n     inclusion of APKWS rounds will improve Tunisia's capacity to \n     sustain security operations and strengthen its internal and \n     external defense capabilities and increase its ability to \n     carry out operations against terrorist forces while \n     significantly reducing risk to civilians.\n       (v) Justification: The United States is committed to the \n     security of Tunisia, and it is vital to U.S. national \n     interests to assist Tunisia to develop and maintain a strong \n     and ready self-defense capability. This upgrade to a \n     previously approved sale will further enhance Tunisia's \n     interoperability with the U.S. Army.\n       (vi) Date Report Delivered to Congress: April 21, 2016.\n\n\n                         transmittal no. 0e-16\n\n     Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to \n         Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act\n\n                           Annex Item No. vii\n\n       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:\n       1. The CATM consists of a functional guidance section \n     coupled to an inert missile bus and is used for flight \n     training but cannot be launched. The missile has an \n     operational semi-active laser seeker that can search for and \n     lock-on to laser-designated targets. It functions like a \n     tactical missile (without launch capability) during captive \n     carry on the aircraft, making it suitable for training the \n     aircrew in simulated Hellfire missile target acquisition and \n     lock. The Sensitive Technology is contained within the \n     operational semi-active laser seeker. The highest level for \n     release of the M36-E9 CATM is SECRET, based upon the semi-\n     active seeker. Reverse engineering could reveal CONFIDENTIAL \n     information. Vulnerability data, countermeasures, \n     vulnerability/susceptibility analyses, and threat definitions \n     are classified SECRET or CONFIDENTIAL.\n       2. The APKWS II All-Up-Round (AUR) is an air-to-ground \n     weapon that consists of an APKWS II Guidance Section (GS), \n     legacy 2.75-inch MK66 Mod 4 rocket motor and legacy MK152 and \n     MK435/436 warhead/fuze. The APKWS is a tactical rocket system \n     that can be launched from several platforms, offering multi-\n     mission, multi-target capability and precision-strike \n     lethality. These guided rockets are steered to the target by \n     following reflected laser beam energy directed onto the \n     target either by the launching aircraft, a second aircraft, \n     or ground-based troops operating a laser designator. Hardware \n     is Unclassified; information related to performance, \n     effectiveness, vulnerabilities and counter-measure is \n     classified up to SECRET.\n       3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain \n     knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the \n     information could be used to develop countermeasures that \n     might reduce system effectiveness or be used in the \n     development of a system with similar or advanced \n     capabilities.\n       4. A determination has been made that the recipient country \n     can provide the same degree of protection for the sensitive \n     technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale \n     is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and \n     national security objectives outlined in the Policy \n     Justification.\n       5.

It was on that farm that he met Dawn, and the two \nwould later get married. A colleague fondly remembered him as ``a hard-\nworking country boy.'' He enjoyed helping people. Personally and \nprofessionally, he was selfless and generous. This altruism made him \nnot only a good person, but an ideal public servant.\n  John Ulmschneider worked out of the Landover Hills Fire/EMS Station \n830. He was a 13-year veteran of the Prince George's County Fire/EMS \nDepartment and was described as dedicated, humble, and funny. The \nPrince George's County Fire/EMS Department is composed of nearly 2,000 \nvolunteers, career professionals, and support personnel covering \napproximately 580 square miles and protecting almost 900,000 people. \nMarylanders should take solace in knowing that John was able to leave \nhis mark on a department with such immense responsibilities.\n  Maryland's first responders are some of the best in the country. \nTheir dedication, bravery, and skill are worthy of the highest praise. \nJohn Ulmschneider had all of these traits in abundance.\n  I thank the Ulmschneider family for sharing John with the people of \nPrince George's County. I also thank John's fellow first responders and \nstaff at Med Star Southern Maryland Hospital Center in Clinton, MD, for \ndoing their utmost to save John. His legacy will never be forgotten, \nand I join the people of Prince George's County in mourning his loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/25/senate-section/article/S2415-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO STEPHEN COMPTON\n\n Mr. BARRASSO.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Delegates of the State of West Virginia urging the United \n     States Congress to provide funding for the West Virginia \n     National Guard to sustain and enhance its capabilities in its \n     role in a regional catastrophe and to modernize the \n     antiquated avionics of its fleet of C130s and other aircraft \n     to meet global airspace requirements for 2020; to the \n     Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 20\n\n       Whereas, In the event of a regional catastrophe, West \n     Virginia's east-west highways, including 1-68 and 1-64 are \n     links to the major exit corridors from the FEMA National \n     Capital Region (NCR) westward and, assuming that a regional \n     catastrophe will likely include Baltimore to the north of the \n     NCR and Richmond to the south of the NCR, westward evacuation \n     utilizing these highways is highly likely and is, in fact \n     anticipated; and\n       Whereas, The routes through West Virginia will traverse \n     rural areas that do not have infrastructure adequate for what \n     could be a mass of evacuees in the worst-case scenario; \n     experience in regional emergencies, such as Superstorm Sandy \n     in 2012, illustrates some shortcomings in planning that is \n     less focused on regions and more on states; and\n       Whereas, West Virginia is perfectly (and geographically) \n     postured to support any emergency or disaster response to the \n     NCR, including mass evacuation westward; and\n       Whereas, FEMA regions do not necessarily represent grouping \n     of states likely to be involved in some scenarios; FEMA \n     region III contains the NCR and West Virginia as its western-\n     most edge and in a major catastrophe, Regions V, with Ohio, \n     Indiana, and Illinois, VII with Missouri, and IV with \n     Kentucky, Tennessee, and North Carolina are likely to be \n     involved in some combinations; and\n       Whereas, The National Guard, through the use of Emergency \n     Management Assistance Compacts, can operate across state \n     lines to provide vital response capability in security, \n     transportation, medical, housing, communications, command and \n     control, and others based on its dual role in military \n     preparedness and state civil support; and\n       Whereas, Military Force Structure assigned to the National \n     Guard must be considered by Federal Military planners for the \n     dual use they can encounter; National Guard Organizations \n     require personnel, equipment, organization, training, \n     leadership and funding to maintain federal military standards \n     and to be prepared to respond to a domestic emergency or \n     disaster; and\n       Whereas, Regional catastrophic planning is dependent on \n     National Guard assets, capabilities and responsiveness; \n     consequently, it is also critical that federal military \n     planners assess the impact of their force structure changes \n     on regional capability needs as I well as those that are \n     state specific; and\n       Whereas, The C-I30 H3 ``Hercules'' aircraft assigned to the \n     130th Airlift Wing of the West Virginia National Guard at \n     Yeager Airport in Charleston, West Virginia will eventually \n     become obsolete without system modernization to the \n     communication, navigation, and surveillance (CNS) components; \n     National Air Traffic Control (ATC) agencies and the \n     International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) are \n     modernizing airspace faster than the US Air Force is updating \n     C-130 avionics capabilities; and\n       Whereas, Aircraft component acquisition becomes \n     increasingly difficult as fewer C-130 H aircraft remain in \n     the Air Force inventory and the unique components of the C-\n     130, including its self contained navigational system (SCNS), \n     face short term supply chain shortages that could be remedied \n     with aircraft avionics modernization; and\n       Whereas, The contract to perform maintenance on aircraft \n     flight computers is renewed annually and this perpetual \n     reliance on short term contracts increases sustainment cost \n     and challenges mission effectiveness and operational \n     planning; and\n       Whereas, Reliance on short term contracts and antiquated \n     avionics will increase Air Force expense in the long run as \n     it translates to more expensive mission-essential contracts \n     and increased fuel expenditures due to inefficient routing: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of West Virginia, That the \n     Legislature hereby urges the United States Congress to \n     provide funding for the West Virginia National Guard to \n     sustain and enhance its capabilities in its role in a \n     regional catastrophe and to modernize the antiquated avionics \n     of its fleet of C-130s and other aircraft to meet global \n     airspace requirements for 2020; and be it\n       Further Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of Delegates \n     is hereby directed to forward a copy of this resolution to \n     the President and Secretary of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker and Clerk of the House of Representatives and to the \n     members of West Virginia congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-158. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Tennessee urging the President of the United \n     States and the United States Congress to take immediate \n     action to protect citizens and lawful residents from the \n     consequences resulting from the uncontrolled influx of \n     undocumented immigrants into this country; to the Committee \n     on the Judiciary.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 70\n\n       Whereas, the federal Department of Homeland Security has \n     set forth in a report, entitled Estimates of the Unauthorized \n     Immigrant Population Residing in the United States: January \n     20111 that the unauthorized immigrant population totaled 11.5 \n     million in 2011; and\n       Whereas, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency \n     apprehended 486,651 individuals crossing the borders of the \n     United States in fiscal year 2014 alone; and\n       Whereas, the power to control immigration and \n     naturalization is reserved to the federal government by the \n     provisions of Article I, Section 8, of the United States \n     Constitution, which tasks the legislative branch with \n     establishing uniform rules of naturalization; and\n       Whereas, the explosive growth in numbers of illegal \n     immigrants, including a substantial increase in unaccompanied \n     alien children, over the past few years reflects a failure by \n     the President of the United States, his administration, and \n     the various members of Congress to implement procedures that \n     adequately address this issue; and\n       Whereas, despite the lack of authority granted to the \n     states to fully address the issue of illegal immigration, as \n     evidenced by recent court decisions, including Arizona v. \n     United States, 132 S. Ct. 2492 (2012), the costs of \n     supporting illegal immigrants in this country continues to \n     fall directly to the several states, and their counties and \n     cities; and\n\n[[Page S2419]]\n\n       Whereas, according to the complaint filed by several states \n     against certain officials in the administration in charge of \n     immigration enforcement, the Texas Department of Public \n     Safety estimated that it was spending $1.3 million per week \n     on troopers and resources to deal with the immigration surge, \n     as well as deploying 1,000 National Guard troops to the \n     border at a cost of $38 million; and\n       Whereas, the Supreme Court of the United States has decreed \n     in Plyler v. Doe, 102 S. Ct. 2382 (1982), that education \n     cannot be denied even to those who have entered this country \n     illegally; and\n       Whereas, Congress has likewise decreed that emergency \n     medical care, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1611 and 1621, \n     cannot be denied even to those who have come here illegally; \n     and\n       Whereas, this General Assembly is fully aware of the \n     growing existence of illegal immigrants in the various \n     counties of this State, including the 1,294 unaccompanied \n     alien children released to sponsors in this State by the \n     Office of Refugee Resettlement in fiscal year 2014; and\n       Whereas, the costs of illegal immigration present a \n     significant financial burden to each state in the form of \n     expenditures for education, criminal justice, and emergency \n     medical care, a burden this State cannot absorb without \n     jeopardizing the quality of life for its U.S. citizens and \n     lawful immigrant population: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the One Hundred \n     Ninth General Assembly of the State of Tennessee, the Senate \n     Concurring, That even as the members of this General Assembly \n     take decisive steps to address the issue of illegal \n     immigration to the fullest extent of our powers, we strongly \n     urge the President and the Congress of these United States to \n     resolve this issue in a timely and efficient manner, to pass \n     a comprehensive immigration policy that allows those wishing \n     to immigrate to this country to do so only in a lawful \n     manner, and to ensure that American society is not threatened \n     by a decline in public safety, educational standards, medical \n     accessibility, and the overall standard of living resulting \n     from those who knowingly choose to enter this country in \n     violation of the law; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the President and the Congress of these \n     United States include in any comprehensive immigration policy \n     a revision to existing federal law that would favor U.S. \n     citizens and lawful residents in receiving benefits such as \n     health care, education, and any other government benefits \n     before offering any benefits to those individuals entering \n     this country illegally; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the President and the Congress of these \n     United States incorporate into any comprehensive immigration \n     policy a system in which the several states may be fully \n     compensated by the federal government for any financial \n     burdens that result from decisions made in Washington, D.C., \n     with regard to illegal immigrants.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/25/senate-section/article/S2419-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. THUNE, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation, with an amendment in the nature of a \n     substitute:\n       H.R. 710.
