Mr. President, for 14 hours and 50 minutes, beginning late \nWednesday morning and ending early Thursday morning, the entire Nation \nwatched as the junior Senator from Connecticut gave our Republican \ncolleagues a lesson in a number of things, not the least of which was \ncourage.\n  Senator Murphy stood here for 14 hours. We talk a lot about \nfilibusters in the Senate. They don't happen very often. I have been in \nCongress for 34 years. I have probably been involved in two more \nfilibusters than anyone else. We have talked about them and there are \nfake filibusters, but this one was real.\n  I admire and appreciate the junior Senator from Connecticut very \nmuch. Four days after 49 innocent Americans were gunned down in cold \nblood, Senator Murphy stood here on the Senate floor, as I have already \nindicated, for 14 hours, pleading with Republicans to join us in doing \nsomething to help stop our Nation's scourge of gun violence--and it is \na scourge. Thirty-eight other Democrats joined him on the floor, all of \nwhom, without exception, echoed Senator Murphy's call to keep guns out \nof the hands of terrorists and criminals.\n  All 46 of us were united together, led by Senator Murphy in support \nof what he was doing. We all believe that he echoed the words that we \nwish to speak--to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists and \ncriminals. It was an inspiring reminder to Americans that the Senate \nDemocrats will not cave in to the National Rifle Association or Gun \nOwners of America. We will not cave in to them, and the people of this \nNation responded to Senator Murphy's stand against gun violence in an \noverwhelming way.\n  Throughout the course of Senator Murphy's filibuster, hundreds of our \nconstituents came and watched from the Senate gallery. There were \nnearly 100 people still sitting in the gallery at 2:12 a.m. this \nmorning as Senator Murphy brought his filibuster to a close. Thousands \nand thousands and thousands of constituents called Senate offices \ndemanding that Congress do something to address this gun violence.\n  Senator Murphy's filibuster took over social media. ``Hold the \nfloor'' was the top-trending topic nationally and globally. Senator \nMurphy got the world's attention and certainly America's attention, and \nI hope the attention of the Senate Republicans.\n  In the early morning hours, the Republican leader and I spoke. He \nindicated that he would commit to a vote on the Murphy-Booker-Feinstein \nlegislation to expand background checks and the Feinstein measure to \nclose the terror loophole, preventing terrorists from walking into a \ngun store and buying all the firearms and explosives they want.\n  Why the passion by Senator Murphy? Why? Could it have been the deaths \nof these little babies by some madman walking into Sandy Hook \nElementary School? Of course it was. He has indicated that he can't get \nthat out of his mind. He thinks about that every day--not 24 hours a \nday, but every day.\n  Why was Cory Booker here every minute of the time with Senator \nMurphy? He was here because he lives in an area where people are \nkilled--several a week. He gave one of the most passionate speeches on \nTuesday in our caucus about holding a little boy who was shot in the \nhead and died in his arms.\n  Senator Schumer, the third sponsor of this legislation, has been \ninvolved in gun issues since his early days in the House of \nRepresentatives. Dianne Feinstein--doing something about guns has been \non her portfolio since she was a member of the board of supervisors of \nSan Francisco. She became mayor as a result of the mayor being \nmurdered. Dianne Feinstein led the charge a number of years ago to pass \nlegislation on this floor when filibusters were not the way we did \nthings around here, stopping every piece of legislation from going \nthrough. She persevered and\n\n[[Page S4258]]\n\npassed legislation to stop the easily obtainable assault weapons.\n  Does anybody think these assault weapons are good for hunting or \nprotecting your family? This evil man that went into this nightclub in \nOrlando, FL--I don't personally know how many clips he had, but he had \nat least three 30-bullet clips. It took less than 3 seconds to shoot \nthose victims. They were all gone in less than 3 seconds. If you are \nreally not very good at it, it takes a couple of seconds to reload. So \nto fire off 90 shells would take 10 or 15 seconds if that was what he \nwanted to do.\n  Dianne Feinstein was right many years ago, and she is still right \ntoday. These assault weapons are not for the American people's \nentertainment, and they shouldn't be, but the NRA and Gun Owners of \nAmerica love to sell these guns. We are going to vote on the Murphy-\nBooker-Schumer legislation to expand background checks, and we are \ngoing to vote on the Feinstein measure to close up terrorist loopholes \nto prevent a terrorist from walking into a gun store and buying all of \nthe firearms and explosives they want. These are commonsense safety \nmeasures that the American people overwhelmingly support.\n  According to a December poll--December, September, October, August, \nit doesn't matter; it has been this way for years--almost 90 percent of \nAmericans are in favor of expanding background checks. Ask anyone: Do \nwe want a criminal or someone who has problems with their mental \ncapacity to purchase a gun? Of course we don't. That is what background \nchecks are all about. More than 80 percent of Americans want to close \nthe so-called terror loophole preventing suspected terrorists from \npurchasing firearms, and legislation by Senator Feinstein will cover \njust that.\n  I am glad that there will be votes, and I appreciate that very much. \nI shouldn't have to be appreciative about something that should just \nhappen, but I am because around here we don't get votes on a lot of \nstuff.\n  I want to be very clear: It is not enough for Republicans to simply \nlet us vote. Democrats can't pass the gun safety legislation by \nourselves. We are the minority party as a result of the elections 2 \nyears ago. It will change, and there will be a new majority in the \nfirst part of next year, but for now we are in the minority in this \nChamber and Republicans must join us in order for those measures to \npass. That will not happen if the Republicans continue to take their \norders--and I mean orders--from the National Rifle Association and Gun \nOwners of America. We need Americans to understand that we need \nRepublicans to follow Senator Murphy's and Senator Feinstein's lead and \nshow courage in standing up to the gun lobby.\n  In the aftermath of the worst shooting in modern American history, \nour constituents elected us for help. They want to feel safe, and they \nwant to be safe. We can help provide that safety by closing the terror \nloophole and expanding background checks today and do it immediately. I \nhope Republicans will do the right thing and work with us to protect \nAmericans from this gun violence. We need gun safety, not more guns. We \nmust take a stand in the Senate and say enough is enough.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/16/senate-section/article/S4257-5"}, {"day": "16", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CELEBRATING JUNETEENTH\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this Sunday, June 19, is Juneteenth, a day \nwe celebrate each year as a reminder that liberty and justice must \nreach all corners of our great Nation.\n  On June 19, 1865, nearly 2\\1/2\\ years after President Lincoln's \nEmancipation Proclamation and more than 2 months after General Lee's \nsurrender at Appomattox, a number of slaves in Galveston, TX, learned \nthat the institution of slavery was no longer. There was no media, no \npress, no Internet, and no television at that time.\n  As we celebrate Juneteenth, I hope we take a moment to reflect on \nwhat it represents, the celebration of liberty and freedom for all \nAmericans. Sadly, 151 years later, we have much work to do to ensure \nthat all citizens are treated equally, no matter their race, religion, \nnational origin, or whom they love.\n  We must ensure all of our citizens can assert their right to vote. \nOur Nation continues to struggle to make the ballot box more accessible \nfor those who continue to be disfranchised in a number of areas, \nincluding ex-felons. They have done their time. Let them be a part of \nsociety. We want them to come back and be citizens and a part of the \nnetwork of our great communities. Let them vote.\n  Here in our Nation's capital, Washington, DC, more than 600,000 \nresidents in the District of Columbia--that is how many live here--\ncontinue to face taxation without representation. I have been here a \nlong time, and I have always supported Statehood for DC. Why not?\n  As we celebrate Juneteenth this year, I hope that all Americans will \nlook at the example Lincoln set when he sent troops to Galveston, TX, \nwhich is, no matter who you are or where you may be, this Nation is a \nland of liberty and justice for all.\n  Let the record reflect, I understand protocol here, and I was told \nthat Senator McConnell may be a little bit late. So I was told to go \nforward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/16/senate-section/article/S4258-1"}, {"day": "16", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, over the past few months, terrorists \ninspired or directed by ISIL have committed mass murder in Brussels, in \nCalifornia, and in France. When ISIL issued a call for lone-wolf \nattacks against the West during Ramadan, its followers heard the call.\n  This week, just outside Paris, more innocent lives were ended \nbrutally by a terrorist who broadcasted news of the attack over the \nInternet.\n  This week in Orlando, Americans were targeted deliberately and taken \nforever from their families by a terrorist ISIL has claimed is ``one of \nthe soldiers of the caliphate.''\n  It is clear from his behavior that this was not a random act of \nviolence. This was a calculated act of terror.\n  As CIA Director John Brennan testified this morning before the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence: Islamic State militants are \n``training and attempting to deploy operatives for further attacks on \nthe West.'' He also called this terrorist attack an assault on the \nvalues of openness and tolerance that define the United States as a \nnation.\n  Well, of course, he is absolutely right. It throws into stark relief \nthe troubling reality we now face.\n  ISIL is not the JV team. ISIL is certainly not ``contained.'' ISIL is \nthe personification of evil in the world, and it will continue to bring \ntragedy after tragedy to our own doorsteps until it is defeated.\n  President Obama needs to finally lead a campaign to accomplish this \nobjective or, at the very least, prepare the military and intelligence \ncommunity to help the next President do it if he won't. This is his \nprimary responsibility in the wake of this terrorist tragedy.\n  Here is ours. Here is what we need to do. Our responsibility in the \nSenate is to make a choice: work on serious solutions to prevent \nterrorist attacks or use the Senate as a campaign studio--as a campaign \nstudio. Yesterday, the FBI Director came to deliver a critical briefing \non Orlando and explain what is needed to prevent similar terrorist \nattacks in the future. Senate Republicans attended and asked serious \nquestions. A rather significant group of Senate Democrats skipped it--\nskipped the briefing all together--for a campaign talkathon out here on \nthe Senate floor, which also prevented us from going forward on the \nbill, offering amendments and votes.\n  It is hard to think of a clearer contrast between serious work for \nsolutions on the one hand and endless partisan campaigning on the \nother.\n  Doing what we can to fight terror beyond our borders and to prevent \nattacks within our border were priorities of ours well before the \nterrorist attack\n\n[[Page S4259]]\n\nin Orlando, and they continue to be at the forefront of our efforts \nnow.\n  We just passed the annual National Defense Authorization Act. It will \ngo a long way toward helping Americans confront global security \nchallenges today and toward preparing the next Commander in Chief to \ntake on the threats tomorrow.\n  We are now working to pass an appropriations bill that will give the \nFBI and other law enforcement officials more of the resources needed to \ntrack down and defuse threats right here on American soil. As we \nconsider that measure, we are continuing to explore additional tools \nthat can help prevent devastating terrorist attacks, such as tools to \nhelp us permanently address the threat of lone-wolf terrorists and to \nhelp us connect the dots when it comes to terrorist communications.\n  Now is the time for Democrats to finally join with us in pursuing \nserious solutions that can actually make a real difference.\n  As we said on Tuesday, there will be amendment votes on this bill. \nThere will be amendment votes on this bill. Yesterday, we were prepared \nto begin that process but were unable to get amendments pending because \nof the extended floor debate that went on until 2 o'clock this morning. \nWe will try again today to move forward with amendments from both \nsides, and once there is an agreement to do so, we will update \neverybody.\n  So, look, of course, no one wants terrorists to be able to buy guns. \nNo one wants terrorists to be able to buy guns. So if Democrats are \nactually serious about getting a solution on that issue and not just \nmaking a political talking point, they will join with us to support \nSenator Cornyn's SHIELD Act. It will give the Justice Department the \nability to prevent known or suspected terrorists from purchasing \nfirearms. It will protect the constitutional rights of all Americans. \nIt will go a step further as well and actually allow terrorists to be \ntaken into custody if a judge finds probable cause.\n  Now, that is a serious solution on this issue. Let's remember, \nhowever, that this issue represents only a piece of a much bigger \nchallenge. Director Brennan also told the Intelligence Committee today \nthat ``despite all of our progress against ISIL on the battlefield and \nin the financial realm, our efforts have not reduced the group's \nterrorist capability and global reach.'' That is Brennan.\n  If we want to prevent ISIL-inspired and directed attacks, we have to \ndefeat ISIL in Iraq and in Syria. If we want to prevent ISIL-inspired \nand directed attacks, we have to defeat ISIL in Iraq and in Syria.\n  Here is what that means. From the White House, it means we don't need \nanother lecture or another threat to veto the Defense bill. It means we \nneed real leadership and a plan of action to defeat ISIL.\n  From our colleagues here in the Senate, it means we don't need more \ncampaign talkathons like we witnessed yesterday, preventing us from \nactually voting. It means we need serious solutions and hard work. \nAfter all, that is what our constituents sent us here to do.\n  We may have gotten held back by a day, but now we are able to keep \nmoving forward to set up votes on both sides, just as we always \nexpected.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/16/senate-section/article/S4258-4"}, {"day": "16", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, most mornings when the Senate is in \nsession, the minority leader comes to the floor--Senator Reid--and \ntalks for a while, and he sometimes talks about things in the news. So \nI come today to the floor to talk about a headline in the news today--\nin the New York Times, of all places--with this headline: ``Obamacare \nPremiums Are Rising, and Not by a Little.'' ``Obamacare Premiums Are \nRising, and Not By a Little'' is today's New York Times headline.\n  It is interesting that when I hear Senator Reid come to the floor, so \noften he is coming to the floor to defend the Obama health care law. A \ncouple of weeks ago he came to the floor and he said that ObamaCare is \n``continuing to work.'' Those are his words. So today I find \ninteresting the New York Times story with this headline: ``Obamacare \nPremiums Are Rising, and Not By a Little.'' It says:\n\n       Even in urban areas where competition was expected to be \n     brisk and the risk pool young and healthy--\n\n  ``Expected'' is the key word there--\n\n       insurers appear to be struggling. In 14 major cities, \n     insurers are asking for 2017 increases twice as big as 2016.\n\n  Twice as big as last year--yet Senator Reid says ObamaCare is \ncontinuing to work.\n  The next day after he said that, he said that the Affordable Care Act \nis working. Well, I don't know anyone who could be a Member of the \nSenate and could actually be going home to their home States on the \nweekends and listening to people who live in their home States who \ncould believe that ObamaCare is working.\n  Across the country, people are seeing how much more money they are \nexpected to pay for their health insurance premiums next year. I just \nread that story from today's New York Times.\n  Yesterday's Washington Post said:\n\n       Premiums for health plans sold through the federal \n     insurance exchange--\n\nthe one that Democrats came to the floor and said they loved and was \ngoing to work--\n\n     could jump substantially next year--\n\n  That was from the Washington Post yesterday--\n\n     perhaps more than at any point since the Affordable Care Act \n     marketplaces began in 2013.\n\n  Does Senator Reid read the newspapers? Does he talk to his \nconstituents? Otherwise, how can he be so terribly confused about the \nimpact of this health care law and the damage it has done to the \nAmerican people?\n  So far, 31 States and the District of Columbia have released \ninformation on what insurance companies plan to charge next year. The \naverage American is facing premiums that are 22 percent higher than \nthis year. That is what is bringing about these headlines in the \nWashington Post and the New York Times.\n  In Iowa, an insurance company says that it wants its customers in the \nObamaCare exchange to pay as much as 43 percent more next year. One \ncustomer wrote in to the State insurance division and said: ``You're \nkilling me.''\n  Does Senator Reid understand the impact of this law?\n  Another wrote in and said: ``Who can afford this? It's disastrous.''\n  Does Senator Reid note any of that?\n  In North Carolina, the largest insurance company in the State said it \nplans to charge people an average of 19 percent more next year.\n  In Pennsylvania, one company says it is going to charge people up to \n48 percent more starting in January.\n  In Arizona, people are facing premium increases of 53 percent. That \nis the average increase in Arizona.\n  So it is not surprising to see a headline in the New York Times \ntoday--and I hope Senator Reid read the paper: ``Obamacare Premiums Are \nRising, and Not By a Little.''\n  Well, whose fault is this? Who should people across the country blame \nwhen they see these outrageous price increases that affect them at \nhome? Well, I believe they should blame Senator Reid and every Democrat \nin Congress who voted for ObamaCare and all of the expensive \nrequirements, regulations, and restrictions.\n  So the question is, Is ObamaCare working? Let's use President Obama's\n\n[[Page S4260]]\n\nstandard, the one that he set for himself. Well, he promised that if \nyou liked your doctor, you could keep your doctor. Well, insurance \nplans have been trying to cut costs by doing what? By narrowing the \nnetwork of doctors that patients can see. People are finding that they \ncan't keep their doctors. They have been losing their doctor because \nthe doctor is no longer covered by their insurance.\n  Well, you say, this is from a guy who has practiced medicine for a \nlong time. No, it is a whole weekend section in the Sunday Review of \nthe New York Times: ``Sorry, We Don't Take Obamacare.'' People who have \nObamaCare, people who actually supported the idea of ObamaCare cannot \nsee a doctor, cannot go to a hospital because of this health care law.\n  President Obama said if you liked your insurance, you could keep your \ninsurance. Well, can you? Ninety-two thousand people in Colorado are \nlosing their insurance plan because companies are pulling out of the \nState. Twenty-two thousand people in Ohio are now scrambling to find \nnew health insurance because the co-op they were in went broke last \nmonth.\n  The health care law actually created 23 different co-ops; 13 of them \nhave gone out of business.\n  Over the past couple of years, 745,000 Americans who were promised by \nBarack Obama that if they like their insurance they can keep it lost \ntheir insurance because their co-ops have closed down, just under the \nhealth care law. President Obama promised--it is his standard--that \nunder his health care law, the average family would see their health \ncare rates go down by $2,500 per year. Anyone who wants to know if \nObamaCare is working should ask one simple question: Did your health \ninsurance rates go down by $2,500? That is the standard the Democrats \nshould be held to.\n\n  Now we know that ObamaCare did take millions of people and put them \ninto Medicaid, which is a failed system, a broken system. Many refer to \nit as a second-class citizen. It is hard to see a doctor, hard to get \ncare. It took other people and gave them big taxpayer subsidies, paid \nfor by the American taxpayers, to help them afford the high premiums--\nthe subsidies helped them afford the high premiums for this overpriced \nObamaCare insurance, but those people will tell you that it left them \nwith deductibles and copays so high that they can't actually use the \ninsurance. For millions of other Americans, there are no subsidies--\njust enormous bills.\n  The President says: Don't worry, you are going to get a subsidy. But \nlet's take a look at how many people will get subsidies and how many \nwill get none who happen to be buying insurance through the exchanges. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office--the people who look into \nthis--there are 12 million Americans who get some sort of subsidy to \nbuy ObamaCare insurance. The premiums go up, the subsidies go up, but \nthat is a bill that hits the taxpayers, the hard-working men and women \nin the country who pay their taxes year in and year out.\n  So that is 12 million, but there are another 12 million--an equal \nnumber of people--who have to buy this insurance without any of the \nsubsidies at all. So when the President takes a look and talks about \nthese 12 million, that is a significant hit to the American taxpayers \nand it turns a blind eye to the 12 million Americans who buy insurance \nwithout any of the subsidies. They are left to pay the full freight for \nthese enormous premium increases we are looking at next year.\n  There was an Associated Press story on Monday. I read the story in \ntoday's paper, the story in yesterday's paper, the Associated Press \nheadline on Monday--``Rising premiums rattle consumers paying their own \nway.'' Are Senator Reid and the Democrats rattled by it? They should be \nbecause the American public is rattled by it. This tells the story of a \nwoman from Queens, NY. We have two Democratic Senators in this body who \nvoted for this health care law. This is one of their constituents from \nQueens, NY. She got a notice from her insurance company that they plan \nto raise her rates by as much as 25 percent next year. On top of this, \nher plan dropped the hospital network she wants. Well, President Obama \npromised that she could keep her insurance, she could keep her doctor, \nand she could keep her hospital. It doesn't apply to this woman in \nQueens. She says: ``For people like me who are in the middle, there is \nvery limited choice, and now that limited choice is going to get more \nexpensive.'' How do the Senators from New York respond to that? Why \naren't they on the floor talking about it?\n  For most Americans, the Democrats' health care law has meant higher \nprices, worse health care, and less freedom to choose what is right for \nthem and their families. That is why the polls show that, on average, \nonly 4 out of 10 Americans have a favorable view of the health care law \nat all, and it is because the premiums keep going up and up without end \nand are hitting them in the pocket. It is because people are also \npaying higher deductibles and higher copayments just to see a doctor.\n  The Kaiser Family Foundation did a survey, and they asked about these \ndeductibles and copays. What they said was that for people who have \ndeductibles over $1,500--even those people who are getting the \nsubsidies for ObamaCare, which the President says is so great--70 \npercent of them with deductibles over $1,500 ranked ObamaCare as a poor \nvalue.\n  This is a $1,500 deductible. The average silver plan in the ObamaCare \nexchanges has a deductible of more than $3,000. Insurance plans for \nnext year are starting to come with deductibles of $7,000. How can the \nPresident say this is valuable? The people who are getting it--even \nwith his expensive subsidies paid for by taxpayers--are saying this is \ngiving them very little value and is a poor value. That is why this law \nis so unpopular. That is why ObamaCare continues to be underwater in \nterms of those who support it and those who oppose it. The average \ndeductible for a silver plan this year is $600 higher than it was just \n2 years ago.\n  That is why, when we see these headlines in the New York Times today \nand the Washington Post yesterday, we realize that people all across \nthe country are being hurt by this Obama health care law. One out of \nfour Americans say they have been personally hurt by the health care \nlaw--not that they know somebody who has been hurt but that they have \npersonally been hurt by the health care law.\n  Even for people who are getting the subsidies for their premiums, the \ndeductibles and the copays have been rising very fast. People never get \nto the point of being able to use their insurance. I mean, that is the \nreal problem with the way this was set up. They have coverage; they \nstill can't afford care.\n  It is interesting to listen to the President's speech. If you listen \nto him carefully, he doesn't actually use the word ``care,'' he uses \nthe word ``coverage.'' If you can't get care, coverage is useless, but \nthat is what the President's numbers are. He talks about coverage, \nrefusing to talk about care. This is about health care. People want \ncare, not empty coverage.\n  But in the face of all this evidence, the Democratic leader, Harry \nReid, has stood here on the floor of the Senate and pretended in front \nof the American people that ObamaCare is working. He has repeatedly \nignored every broken promise that every Democratic Member in Congress \nmade about the health care law. He has come to the floor and repeatedly \nignored every American who has lost their insurance. He repeatedly \ncomes to the floor and ignores every American who has had to pay \noutrageous amounts of money for insurance that for many of them is \nunusable but is mandated by President Obama and the Democrats that they \nhave to buy under penalty of law. None of that seems to matter to the \nDemocratic leader, who personally supervised the writing of the health \ncare law in his office behind closed doors. It is a terribly flawed \nlaw, but behind the closed doors of his office, it was written and \npassed on a party-line vote.\n  Well, the American people have spoken, and they have given Senator \nReid's efforts and the ObamaCare health care law a failing grade. Even \nthose with the subsidies say it is a poor value today. Americans all \nacross the country are hurting because of ObamaCare, and Senator Reid \nand President Obama bear the responsibility. How much more do the \nAmerican people have to suffer before the\n\n[[Page S4261]]\n\nWashington Democrats will accept the facts? People want the care they \nneed from a doctor they choose at a lower cost.\n  Republicans have offered ways to give people what they have been \nasking for all along. It is time for Democrats to work with us. It is \ntime for Democrats to stop trying to deliberately deceive the American \npeople by pretending this broken health care law is working--\npretending. That is what this is all about because it is not working. \nObamaCare remains very unpopular because people realize that for them \npersonally, it is a very bad deal. Republicans have better ideas, \nbetter solutions. Republicans are offering the American people the \nfreedom, the flexibility, and the choice they want when it comes to \ntheir health care.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n              Working Together to Protect our Communities\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, as my colleagues know, I come to the floor \neach week to deliver a ``waste of the week'' speech. My concern over \nexcessive government spending and spending on nonessential programs in \nwasteful ways needs to be shared with the American people, and my \ncolleagues need to know that a lot of hard-earned tax dollars are \nwasted through waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  Some of these have been very serious, resulting in literally billions \nof dollars of waste. Some have been smaller expenditures but ludicrous \nexpenditures, the kinds of expenditures where people say why in the \nworld does the Federal Government have to do that? Or why--where's the \ncommon sense here? The American people work very hard to earn the \ndollars they send to Washington.\n  A lot of them are scraping by to pay the mortgage that's due at the \nend of the month, to pay the rent that is due at the end of the week, \nto get the groceries in the house or the savings to put in the savings \naccount for an education; any number of ways the American people today, \nas the statistics are showing us today, have less spending money. The \naverage American worker today has up to $3,000-plus less per year in \nearnings than they did at the beginning of this administration.\n  I don't know how the President keeps going on the airwaves saying \nthings are just great and look how much better we are doing when people \nare earning on an average $3,000 less than they earned 8 years after \nthe President first took office.\n  However, walking over to the floor to deliver this--and this one is \none of those speeches--you can't make this up. It's so ridiculous. Can \nyou believe that really an agency that is held in high regard, the \nNational Science Foundation, actually is issuing grants of taxpayer \nmoney for these kinds of projects? Normally it would bring a lot of \nlaughs and a lot of outrage over this waste of money.\n  I couldn't help but think of what is plaguing most Americans this \nweek, after the tragic shooting in Orlando, Sandy Hook, San Bernardino, \nand all of the other breaking news and tragedies we have been hit with \nas Americans. I am having trouble with it, as all Americans are having \ntrouble with it. We are trying to fight toward a solution. I am not \nsure what that solution is. It is not a simplistic solution. Clearly, \nin a democracy as free and as open as America, whether it is ISIL-\ninspired or terrorist-inspired or whether it is just someone mentally \nill, someone whose hatred drives their life, or someone sitting in \ntheir basement at 2 a.m. Being inspired by ISIS web sites or just \nsimply some of the stuff that comes across the internet, we are facing \na tough situation here. But this week seems to be importantly \ndifficult, and we are searching for ways--and the last thing we need to \ndo is to politicize this issue.\n  We have to address issues to make sure we have done everything we \npossibly can to prevent the wrong people, to prevent terrorists, from \npurchasing and owning weapons of mass destruction or that can cause the \nkind of issues we are dealing with in Orlando and other places. There \nis not a Member of this body, Republican or Democratic, who has not \nbeen impacted by what is happening not just in Orlando but by a series \nof events similar to this. There is not a Senator here--Republican or \nDemocratic, liberal or conservative--who doesn't want to find a way to \naddress the situation in a way that would reduce the incidence or \nhopefully eliminate the incidence of these issues.\n  We are working through that now, and working through that is \ndifficult because we do want Americans to have the ability and the \nrights that are promised to them under the Constitution and the Second \nAmendment, which is to protect themselves. We want to make sure their \nconstitutional rights aren't breached for their own self-defense.\n  What do we say to a woman living alone in a neighborhood where there \nis a lot of drug dealing going on and a lot of random shootings and a \nlot of home invasions that she can't protect herself? We don't want to \ndo that. We don't want to say to someone who owns a business and wants \nto ensure that the business is not broken into and they lose everything \nthey have invested and who hires a security guard or someone to provide \nprotection, that we are going to take away that right. By the same \ntoken, we don't want these kinds of weapons used in these mass killings \nto be in the hands of the wrong people. So we are trying to find that \nbalance.\n  The best way to do that is for all of us to work together to find \nthat balance, instead of blaming one side or the other side for not \ndoing enough or for doing too little. This is not an easy issue to \nresolve.\n  It just doesn't seem appropriate for me to come to the floor and talk \nabout the waste of the week because that involves something people \nnormally would laugh at. This is not a week to laugh. This is a week to \nmourn. This is a week to work together to find a sensible way of trying \nto prevent these kinds of things from happening, and we are working \nthrough that. So next week I will come down and do two waste-of-the-\nweek issues because this waste keeps going on, and it is an issue we \nall need to be aware of because the people we represent are forced, \nthrough the tax system, to send money to Washington, and they want it \nreasonably spent and reasonably used for necessary purposes.\n  With that, let's keep our focus and our eyes on the task at hand in \nrespect and in mourning for what has happened in Orlando and what has \nbeen happening across our country far, far, far too often. Let's work \ntogether to find a reasonable solution that can take us in the right \ndirection toward preventing these things from happening. Not one of \nus--not one of us--wants to have a process which puts these weapons in \nthe hands of terrorists or those who mean to do us harm.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, it appears there is an absence of Members here, so I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               SHIELD Act\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the past few days, we have been \ncontemplating the horrific shooting in Orlando and asking ourselves how \nthis could happen and, of course, grieving and praying and thinking \nabout the people who lost their lives and their families and those who \nwere injured.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, yesterday we had the opportunity to \nget briefed by the FBI Director and the Secretary of Homeland Security. \nWhat we learned is that there is still a lot left to learn and that the \ninvestigation is ongoing. But clearly this was not a random act of \nviolence. This is not about somebody going to purchase a gun at a store \nand then going out and deciding indiscriminately to kill the first \nperson they meet, but then again, neither was the shooting in San \nBernardino a random act of violence or the attempted shooting in \nGarland,\n\n[[Page S4262]]\n\nTX, which was thwarted by a security guard. These were calculated acts \nof terror and a reminder--a reminder of the threats to our homeland \nfrom ISIS, not just in the Middle East but right here at home by people \nwho have never traveled to the Middle East but who communicate through \nsocial media and online and become radicalized by this ideology of \nhate, one that results in terrible tragedies such as the one we saw in \nOrlando.\n  Sadly, our friends on the other side of the aisle have seen this as \nan opportunity to make this a political debate about gun control, and \nthey simply are refusing to acknowledge the threat we face from radical \nIslam. Rather than trying to solve the problem, they are trying to \ndrive a wedge between the American people and come up with something \nthat basically does nothing.\n  I think one thing that makes people crazy about Washington, DC, is \nwhen people stand up and claim to understand the problem and yet offer \nsolutions that don't solve the problem but, rather, fit some sort of \ntalking points or ideological agenda. It is clear that what we heard \nyesterday from our friends across the aisle has nothing to do with \ndefeating ISIS or the threat of international terrorism or the \nradicalization of Americans in their homes.\n  So today I am filing an amendment that I believe will offer a \nsolution. I believe that if it had been enacted beforehand, it may have \nprovided the law enforcement agencies, such as the FBI, the tools they \nneed in order to identify somebody like the Orlando shooter beforehand \nand to take them off the streets. This amendment is called the SHIELD \nAct. It would not only stop terrorists from getting guns, but it would \ntake them off the streets, and it would do so in a way that is \nconsistent with our Constitution.\n  I want to make this clear so there is no doubt at all. Every single \nSenator wants to deny terrorists access to the guns they use to harm \ninnocent civilians. But there is a right way to do things and a wrong \nway.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle have put forward a measure \nthat was voted on last December, sponsored by Mrs. Feinstein, the \nSenator from California. The bottom line is that proposal doesn't \nprotect our constitutional rights, and it doesn't go far enough to make \nour country safer. Under Senator Feinstein's proposal, after being \ndenied a gun for being on some classified list created by the \ngovernment--lists that are often riddled with errors and include law-\nabiding citizens--the individual can go home, search the Internet for \nhow to build a homemade bomb or go to the hardware store to buy \neverything they need to carry out some other sort of terrorist attack, \nand they are free to walk the streets and to plot that attack.\n  As I mentioned, my legislation actually does what we need to do to \ngive law enforcement, first, the notice that this individual is trying \nto buy a weapon but then an opportunity to take them off the streets \nand deny them access to a firearm. Their legislation does nothing to \nprotect the due process rights of American citizens under the Bill of \nRights and under our Constitution.\n  Many of us remember that a few years ago, the late Teddy Kennedy \ncited his own frustration with showing up on a list that was created by \nthe government in secret, only to find out that he, a United States \nSenator, was on a no-fly list. Back in 2004, he was put on the list and \nhe was denied an airplane ticket. If Teddy Kennedy from the Kennedy \nfamily--one of the most powerful political families in America in our \nwhole history--was denied an opportunity to get on an airplane because \nhe was erroneously put on a no-fly list, you can imagine the problems \nthe rest of us would have.\n  Senator Kennedy said at the time:\n\n       Now, if they had that kind of difficulty for a member of \n     Congress . . . how in the world are average Americans who are \n     going to get caught up in this kind of thing, how are they \n     going to be able to get treated fairly and not have their \n     rights abused?\n\n  That is a pretty good question. It highlights my greater point that \nwe have to be very careful. We need a robust response to protect \nAmerican citizens but one that doesn't infringe on constitutional \nrights.\n  If Senator Kennedy was placed on a watch list and had trouble getting \nhis name removed, do we have any confidence that average Americans like \nthe rest of us will not have their constitutional rights stripped, with \nno legal process to remedy it?\n  In the United States of America, where I was born and grew up, we \nsimply cannot deny somebody a constitutional right without due process \nof law and making the government come forward and presenting evidence \nto a judge so that a determination can be made not by the government \nbut by an impartial third party.\n  The proposal I am filing today will help fight terrorism at home and \nensure that due process is protected. It is called the SHIELD Act. It \nwould create a process for our law enforcement officials to actually \ninvestigate and look at the evidence. But it wouldn't just stop \nterrorists from buying guns; it would go further--certainly further \nthan the Democrats' amendment--by helping law enforcement take them off \nthe streets. Under my proposal, if someone who is known or suspected of \nbeing a terrorist tries to buy a gun, they will be blocked from doing \nso while the authorities carry out an investigation, followed by an \nexpedited hearing where a judge can block the sale permanently if \nadequate evidence is produced. And importantly, if the judge determines \nthere is probable cause to block the sale, they can do more than just \nblock the sale; they can take the terrorist into custody. If we believe \nsomeone is dangerous enough to not be able to buy a gun, shouldn't we \ndo our best to take them off the streets so they don't pose a danger to \nour communities?\n  We also learned from Director Comey yesterday that there are \nadditional tools the FBI does not currently have that we ought to make \nsure it has, things to make sure that they can use, for example, \nnational security letters to collect not only financial information in \ncounterterrorism cases, which they currently can, but also to make sure \nthat Internet providers can provide IP addresses and email addresses--\nnot content. Not the content. That would require a court order and a \nshowing of probable cause. But the fact is, if we are going to have the \nFBI and our law enforcement officials connect the dots, we are going to \nhave to make sure they have the tools to collect the dots. That is what \nwe need to be focusing on, not pursuing some opportunistic political \nagenda that will not solve any problems at all.\n  I believe my amendment could have had an impact on the Orlando \nshooting because, as we all have learned, while the shooter in Orlando \nwas not on a watch list at the time he bought the weapons he used in \nthe shooting, he had been on a watch list and he had been investigated \nby the FBI. Unfortunately, they didn't come up with sufficient evidence \nwith which to detain him at the time.\n  Under my amendment, when somebody who was previously under \ninvestigation for suspicion of terrorism within the last 5 years--like \nthe Orlando attacker--goes to buy the gun, the FBI and the State and \nlocal law enforcement authorities will be immediately notified, and \nthey can then escalate their investigation. They can go to a judge and \nsay: Judge, we need a wiretap so we can listen to--based on a showing \nof probable cause under the Fourth Amendment--we can listen to the \nconversations to see if they are calling people and engaging in another \nplot with coconspirators.\n  In this way, I believe the SHIELD Act could have prevented the \ntragedy that occurred over the weekend in Orlando because this shooter \nwas on a watch list within the previous 5 years, and if the FBI had \nbeen notified, which they would have been if he were on a watch list, \nthen they could have escalated the investigation further and perhaps \nhave discovered enough evidence to take him off the streets.\n  This is a similar proposal to the one I offered back in December that \ngarnered bipartisan support and received more votes than my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle. As a matter of fact, we had 55 votes \nwith a bipartisan majority on my amendment last December. This new \namendment is a small tweak in modification, but it is a straightforward \nplan that reflects input from all sides, and it will stop terrorists \nfrom buying guns and will provide a means to get them off the\n\n[[Page S4263]]\n\nstreets but doing so in a way that ensures American citizens' \nconstitutional rights will be respected.\n  I think this just makes sense. I think it is pretty reasonable, and \nit is a good starting point if we are trying to address the real threat \nof Islamic extremism rearing its ugly head here at home, but as I \nmentioned, we must do more than equip our law enforcement officials \nwith the tools they need in order to collect evidence and hopefully \nprevent these attacks from occurring in the future.\n  So going forward, I hope we will come up with an agreement that any \nresponse to domestic terrorism must include providing the FBI and other \nlaw enforcement the resources and authorities to track down terrorists \nand take them off the streets.\n\n\n                           Fort Hood Tragedy\n\n  Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, about a dozen soldiers were in an Army \ntactical vehicle in Fort Hood, TX, as part of a larger training \nexercise when they were swept off the road. Nine of them lost their \nlives by drowning. This was in the aftermath of heavy rain and flooding \nthroughout Texas, and their vehicle overturned as they tried to cross a \nflooded creek.\n  As I said, out of the 12 people swept out of the tactical vehicle, 9 \nof them drowned, but thankfully 3 survived. The nine who died came from \nall over America--California, New York, New Jersey, Florida, Indiana, \nand Texas. They were also at various stages of their honorable careers \nof serving our country and the U.S. Army.\n  Today, at the Spirit of Fort Hood Chapel, the Fort Hood community is \ngathering to remember each of them, their families, to offer prayers \nfor their friends and family left behind, and to consider how we can \nhonor their legacy going forward.\n  I, of course, send my prayers and deepest condolences to those who \nhave lost loved ones. I can't imagine their pain, but I share in their \ngrief. Fort Hood is a resilient place. Over the years, it has \nexperienced a number of tragedies, including the shooting by MAJ Nidal \nHusan, just to name another one. They have experienced tragedy before, \nand I hate that they have to do so again, but I know, without a doubt, \nthat the community there that is nicknamed ``the great place'' is \nstrong, and I hope and pray the service today is a time of hopeful \nremembrance for those who committed their lives to protect and defend \nour freedoms.\n  I thank them for their service, and I stand ready to support the Fort \nHood community in any way I can while they continue to grieve the loss \nof these nine heroes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/16/senate-section/article/S4259-2"}, {"day": "16", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RESOLUTIONS SUBMITTED TODAY\n\n  Mr. CORNYN.

IMPROVING THE RESTITUTION PROCESS.\n\n       Section 3612 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n\n[[Page S4275]]\n\n       ``(j) Evaluation of Offices of the United States Attorney \n     and Department Components.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The Attorney General shall, as part of \n     the regular evaluation process, evaluate each office of the \n     United States attorney and each component of the Department \n     of Justice on the performance of the office or the component, \n     as the case may be, in seeking and recovering restitution for \n     victims under each provision of this title and the Controlled \n     Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.) that authorizes \n     restitution.\n       ``(2) Requirement.--Following an evaluation under paragraph \n     (1), each office of the United States attorney and each \n     component of the Department of Justice shall work to improve \n     the practices of the office or component, as the case may be, \n     with respect to seeking and recovering restitution for \n     victims under each provision of this title and the Controlled \n     Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.) that authorizes \n     restitution.\n       ``(k) GAO Reports.--\n       ``(1) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this subsection, the Comptroller General of the \n     United States shall prepare and submit to the Committee on \n     the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the \n     Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate a report on \n     restitution sought by the Attorney General under each \n     provision of this title and the Controlled Substances Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 801 et seq.) that authorizes restitution during the 3-\n     year period preceding the report.\n       ``(2) Contents.--The report required under paragraph (1) \n     shall include statistically valid estimates of--\n       ``(A) the number of cases in which a defendant was \n     convicted and the Attorney General could seek restitution \n     under this title or the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \n     801 et seq.);\n       ``(B) the number of cases in which the Attorney General \n     sought restitution;\n       ``(C) of the cases in which the Attorney General sought \n     restitution, the number of times restitution was ordered by \n     the district courts of the United States;\n       ``(D) the amount of restitution ordered by the district \n     courts of the United States;\n       ``(E) the amount of restitution collected pursuant to the \n     restitution orders described in subparagraph (D);\n       ``(F) the percentage of restitution orders for which the \n     full amount of restitution has not been collected; and\n       ``(G) any other measurement the Comptroller General \n     determines would assist in evaluating how to improve the \n     restitution process in Federal criminal cases.\n       ``(3) Recommendations.--The report required under paragraph \n     (1) shall include recommendations on the best practices for--\n       ``(A) requesting restitution in cases in which restitution \n     may be sought under each provision of this title and the \n     Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.) that \n     authorizes restitution;\n       ``(B) obtaining restitution orders from the district courts \n     of the United States; and\n       ``(C) collecting restitution ordered by the district courts \n     of the United States.\n       ``(4) Report.--Not later than 3 years after the date on \n     which the report required under paragraph (1) is submitted, \n     the Comptroller General of the United States shall prepare \n     and submit to the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on the Judiciary of the \n     Senate a report on the implementation by the Attorney General \n     of the best practices recommended under paragraph (3).''.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, by way of explanation, that final piece of \nlegislation represents the passage of the Justice for All \nReauthorization Act. This is legislation the Judiciary Committee has \nconsidered, as the Presiding Officer knows, which Senator Pat Leahy, \nthe ranking member, and I have been working on for some time.\n  It would improve victims' rights by increasing access to restitution \nand reauthorize programs that support crime victims in court, and it \nwould increase resources for forensic labs to reduce the rape kit \nbacklog. That last measure is something that has been a concern of mine \nfor a number of years. Congress has appropriated a significant amount \nof money, under the Debbie Smith Act, to test forensic evidence in rape \nkits to identify the offenders in sexual assault cases. Unfortunately, \nover time, more and more of that money had been used for administrative \nand not testing purposes. If reports are to be believed, as many as \n400,000 untested rape kits either sat in evidence lockers or in labs \nuntested, thus denying those victims, whom those kits represent, \nresolution of their issues of closing the circle on their grief. We \nneed to also make sure we have done everything we can in keeping our \ncommitment to pursue the offender who has committed those sexual \nassaults.\n  Since my days as attorney general of Texas, protecting the rights of \ncrime victims has been close to my heart, but I know we always worry \nabout whether there is enough money to be able to adequately fund law \nenforcement. We have also previously--particularly on the issue of \ntrafficking--made sure we created a crime victims fund that takes the \nmoney from the fines and penalties paid by the procurers, or the people \nwho are charged with purchasing sexual services from trafficking \nvictims, puts that money into the fund that will then be used to help \nthe victims heal. In particular, we need to get rid of this rape kit \nbacklog.\n  I have been working with one of my personal heroes, Debbie Smith. She \nhas worked very hard to make sure we don't forget these victims, just \nas she courageously talks about her own terrible experience. It is very \nimportant that we get more of these rape kits inventoried so we know \nexactly what the scope of the problem is and we get more of them \ntested.\n  Some cities like Houston, TX, have waited around for the Federal \nGovernment. Thanks to former Mayor Parker, Houston has cleared its rape \nkit backlog by testing all of them. It is incredible what sort of \nevidence they have been able to produce by creating hits on the DNA \ntesting matchup and being able to solve previously unsolved crimes. Of \ncourse, DNA being as powerful as it is can also make sure that people \nwho are falsely accused of a crime are exonerated.\n  I appreciate the work of the senior Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, \nwho joined me in introducing the bill, and I appreciate his commitment \nto seeing it through. As always, I thank Senator Grassley, chairman of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, for his leadership in helping shepherd \nthis bipartisan bill through the committee. This is now ready to go to \nPresident Obama and be signed into law.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of America's greatest strengths is our \njudicial system: a system based on the ideal of equal justice for all. \nThe Senate has a critical role to play in protecting this judicial \nsystem. Perhaps most importantly, it is our responsibility to confirm \nqualified judges to vacancies throughout the country so that our courts \nfunction at full strength and Americans receive swift and reliable \njustice. Another core responsibility is ensuring fairness. In criminal \ncases, fairness requires that the rights of victims and the accused are \nrespected. It requires that evidence is processed quickly and \naccurately. And if there is a mistake and an innocent person is wrongly \nconvicted, fairness requires that we have the tools available to \ncorrect them.\n  The bill the Senate passes today, the Justice for All Reauthorization \nAct, will make our courts more fair. It provides tools to strengthen \nindigent defense and expand the rights of crime victims. It will \nimprove the use of forensic evidence, including rape kits, to provide \njustice as swiftly as possible. It will help protect the innocent by \nincreasing access to postconviction DNA testing. Passage of this \nbipartisan bill is long overdue, but it is an important step that we \ncelebrate today.\n  The Justice for All Reauthorization Act builds on the work I began in \n2000, when I introduced the Innocence Protection Act. That bill sought \nto ensure that defendants in the most serious cases receive competent \nrepresentation and, when appropriate, access to postconviction DNA \ntesting.\n  I started my career as a prosecutor in Vermont. I know that we must \nhold those who commit crimes accountable, but we must also ensure that \nour system treats the accused fairly and does not wrongly convict those \nwho are not guilty. In some cases, DNA testing can prove the innocence \nof individuals where the system got it grievously wrong. ``Innocent \nuntil proven guilty'' is a hallmark of our criminal justice system, but \nwhen a person who has been found guilty is actually innocent, we must \nprovide access to tools like DNA testing that can set the record \nstraight.\n  The Innocence Protection Act and the funding it provides for \npostconviction DNA testing has played a critical role in helping the \ninnocent clear their names and receive the exonerations they deserve. \nThese cases happen more often than people might think. In the first 6 \nmonths of 2016, at\n\n[[Page S4276]]\n\nleast four people have been exonerated by DNA testing after spending a \ncombined 100 years in prison for crimes they had not committed.\n  Can you imagine how terrifying it must be to be convicted of a crime \nyou did not commit? You are separated from all that you know and all \nthose you love--perhaps for decades or life. You are housed in a cold, \nbare prison cell, isolated and scared. And perhaps worst of all, no one \nbelieves you when you say you did not do it. The four men exonerated by \nDNA in just the last few months no doubt experienced that and worse, so \ndid my friend Kirk Bloodsworth.\n  Kirk was a young man just out of the Marines when, in 1984, he was \nsentenced to death for the rape and murder of a 9 year-old girl, a \nheinous crime he did not commit. He maintained his innocence and \nfinally received a second trial, only to be convicted again, though \nthis time he received two consecutive life sentences. Again, he fought \nto clear his name, pushing to have the evidence against him tested for \nDNA, then a novel new scientific method. The DNA found at the crime \nscene was not his, and he was released from prison in 1993. He became \nthe first death row inmate in the United States to be exonerated \nthrough the use of DNA evidence.\n  Kirk inspired me to create the Kirk Bloodsworth Post Conviction DNA \nTesting Grant Program as part of the Innocence Protection Act in 2000. \nHe continues to be a remarkable champion for justice, and I am proud \nthe grant program we both care so deeply about is reauthorized as part \nof the bipartisan legislation before us today.\n  We must continue funding this critical postconviction DNA testing \nsince we know our system is imperfect. It is an outrage when an \ninnocent person is wrongly punished, and this injustice is compounded \nwhen the true perpetrator remains on the streets, able to commit more \ncrimes. We are all less safe when the system gets it wrong.\n  Of course we must do more to ensure that our justice system gets it \nright from the beginning, and that means improving the quality of \nindigent defense. This legislation requires the Department of Justice \nto provide technical assistance to States to improve their indigent \ndefense systems, and it ensures that public defenders will have a seat \nat the table when States determine how to use their Byrne JAG criminal \njustice funding. Although these are small changes, I hope they lay the \nground work for greater improvements ahead, including adoption of my \nGideon's Promise Act. That legislation would allow the Department of \nJustice to ensure that States are satisfying their obligations to \nprovide competent counsel under the 6th and 14th Amendments. It has \nbeen a part of this bill in previous years, but unfortunately does not \nyet have the support it needs for passage. We must do more to protect \nthis fundamental right, and I will continue to work to see the Gideon's \nPromise Act passed into law.\n  In addition to the Innocence Protection Act, the Justice for All \nReauthorization Act also increases resources for public forensic \nlaboratories by reauthorizing the Coverdell program. It addresses the \nneeds of sexual assault survivors by ensuring that rape kit backlogs \nare reduced and forensic exam programs are expanded. It strengthens \nsome key provisions of the Prison Rape Elimination Act. And it expands \nrights for victims of all crime.\n  While we still have a long way to go, we have made progress over the \nyears to respond to the needs of sexual assault survivors, and I am \nglad this legislation continues to build on that strong record. Last \nCongress, we reauthorized the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Reduction \nProgram, named for my brave friend Debbie Smith who waited for years \nafter being attacked before her rape kit was tested and the perpetrator \nwas caught. I included language in the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against \nWomen Reauthorization Act of 2013 to increase services and funding for \nsurvivors of sexual assault and further reduce the rape kit backlog.\n  I thank Senator Cornyn for working with me to pass this important \nlegislation today. The programs authorized through the Justice for All \nAct are a smart use of taxpayer dollars that ensure the integrity of \nour justice system. Senators who talk about the need to go after \ncriminals and promote public safety should support our legislation, \nwhich I hope we can enact into law this year.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Cornyn and the ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, for their work on the \nJustice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016, which today passed the \nSenate. I also want to thank the sponsors for agreeing to accept, as \npart of this reauthorization measure, some transparency language that I \ndeveloped. This language also passed the Senate today by unanimous \nconsent in the form of a floor amendment to the Justice for All \nReauthorization Act.\n  The purpose of the original Justice for All Act, on which many of us \nworked during congressional consideration of the measure in 2004, is to \nprotect crime victims' rights, authorize resources to reduce backlogs \nof unanalyzed DNA evidence from crime scenes and convicted offenders, \nand expand the DNA testing capacity of the Nation's crime laboratories. \nThe statute also authorizes resources for testing DNA evidence to \nprotect the innocent from wrongful convictions. By working together in \na bipartisan fashion, our colleagues have produced legislation that \nwill extend these programs for several more years.\n  The purpose of my amendment to this reauthorization measure is to \nincrease the transparency and promote accountability of many DNA-\nrelated programs and activities that are administered by the Justice \nDepartment's Office of Justice Programs. We have all seen the recent \narticles in USA Today, ProPublica, and elsewhere that suggest we may \nneed to take additional steps to effectively accomplish the goals of \nthese programs. In particular, these articles have raised questions \nabout the DNA capacity enhancement and backlog reduction program, which \nis administered by OJP's National Institute of Justice.\n  We don't fully understand, for example, why significant backlogs of \nDNA evidence from crimes of murder and sexual violence persist, despite \nthe appropriation of more than $1 billion by Congress for the DNA \nprograms that are authorized under the Justice for All Act. The U.S. \nGovernment Accountability Office, in a 2013 report entitled ``DOJ Could \nImprove Decision-Making Documentation and Better Assess Results of DNA \nBacklog Reduction Program Funds,'' suggested that NIJ could better \ndocument the rationale for its yearly funding priorities and take \nadditional steps to verify the reliability of grantee performance data. \nThe Justice Department's inspector general also suggested, in a March \n2016 audit report of the DNA program, that NIJ's process for \nidentifying grantees with the potential for generating program income \nneeds improvement.\n  My transparency language, which is modeled on accountability language \nthat already applies to grant recipients under the STOP grant program, \nis designed to elicit more information about how the funds appropriated \nfor Justice for All Act programs are being used in practice. First, it \nwould require the Attorney General to annually report to Congress, for \neach recipient of DNA grants, the amounts distributed to each grant \nrecipient, the purposes for which these funds were used, and each \nrecipient's progress in achieving those purposes. Second, under this \namendment, the Attorney General must summarize the types of DNA samples \nsubmitted to crime labs, the average time it took to test these DNA \nsamples, and the proportion of each grant that went to private crime \nlabs. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it would require the \nAttorney General to evaluate the effectiveness of grant amounts in \nincreasing crime labs' capacity and reducing backlogs of DNA evidence.\n  The amendment I sponsored also includes some language that is \ndesigned to ensure we avoid duplication in grant programs, as well as a \nprovision that is intended to enhance crime victims' access to \nrestitution. I thank Senator Lankford, who cosponsored the amendment, \nfor suggesting the inclusion of the antiduplication language, which is \nmodeled on language that I led the Judiciary Committee in approving as \npart of several other measures before our committee. Senator Feinstein, \nwho also cosponsored this amendment, also deserves credit for \nsuggesting the addition of restitution language.\n\n[[Page S4277]]\n\n  In closing, I want to again extend my appreciation to Senators Cornyn \nand Leahy for their hard work on this measure, which our Judiciary \nCommittee reported last month and congratulate them on Senate passage \nof the Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Inhofe, Dean Heller, Pat \n           Roberts, Lamar Alexander, Ron Johnson, Tom Cotton, Thom \n           Tillis, Mitch McConnell.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXVIII, there will now be up \nto 2 hours of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I wish to start by commending the \nmajority leader who just came to the floor and offered a motion to go \nto conference on CARA, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of \n2016. This is an incredibly important piece of legislation because it \nwill allow the U.S. Congress to be a better partner in fighting against \nthis heroin and prescription drug epidemic that is seizing our \ncommunities.\n  This is a big step today because it says we are going to send a few \nSenators over to work with the House to come up with a consensus bill \nbetween CARA, which passed in this body on March 10, by the way, by a \n94-to-1 vote. That never happens around here, and it happened because \nafter 2\\1/2\\ weeks of debate on the floor, everybody realized this is \nan issue that had to be addressed and that the legislation we came up \nwith was the sensible and responsible way to do it.\n  It was legislation we developed over a 3-year period. Senator \nWhitehouse and I were the leads on it. We had five conferences here in \nWashington, bringing experts in from around the country. We took the \nbest ideas, regardless of where they came from, and came up with a way \nto deal with the prevention and education aspect of this, to prevent \npeople from getting into the funnel of addiction in the first place, \nbut then, for those who are addicted, to treat addiction like the \ndisease that it is, to get them into the treatment and recovery \nservices that they need, as well as to help our law enforcement; \nspecifically, to help our law enforcement with regard to Narcan, which \nis naloxone, which helps to stop the overdose deaths. We also help to \nget prescription drugs off of people's shelves and to avoid this issue \nof people getting into the issue of opioid addiction, sometimes \ninadvertently, through prescription drug overprescribing.\n  This is a bill that actually addresses the problem in a responsible \nway. It is comprehensive.\n  The House then passed its own legislation. They passed 18 separate \nbills, smaller bills, not as comprehensive but which included some good \nideas that were not in the Senate bill; one, for instance, raising the \ncap on doctors who are treating people with Suboxone. Some of those \nideas should be incorporated as well, but the point is, we have to move \nand move quickly.\n  If we think about this, since the Senate passed its legislation, \nwhich was on March 10, we have unfortunately seen roughly 129 people a \nday lose their lives to overdoses. So many thousands of Americans have \nlost their lives even since March 10. This legislation takes the right \nstep to address that problem and not to address just those who have \noverdosed and died but those who are casualties of this epidemic, who \nhave therefore lost their job, lost their family, lost their ability to \nbe able to function.\n  As I talk to recovering addicts around my State of Ohio, I hear the \nsame thing again and again: The drugs become everything, and this does \ncause families to be torn apart. It does cause crime. When I talk to \nprosecutors in my State, they tell me that most of the crime--in one \ncounty, recently a county prosecutor told me that 80 percent of the \ncrime is due to this heroin and prescription drug epidemic. So this is \none we must address for so many reasons, and we must address it right \naway.\n  I am pleased we are finally appointing conferees. I hope the other \nside will not consider blocking this because we need to move on with \nthis to get this legislation to the President's desk. We have been \ntalking with the House about their legislation that was passed \nsubsequent to our legislation and talking about how to make some of \nthese compromises to be able to come up with a consensus bill. I think \nwe are very close. Again, I think there are some ideas in the House \nbill we should incorporate, and I think there are some ideas in the \nSenate bill that must be included in the House bill that are not \nincluded now. I think one is with regard to recovery services.\n  We know that the best evidence-based treatment and recovery can make \na difference in turning people's lives around, and therefore we do \nsupport recovery services. For those in the field, they will tell us it \nis not just about the medication-assisted treatment, it is that longer \nterm recovery that creates the success we are all looking for.\n  Then, on the prevention side, we have focused more specifically on a \nnational awareness campaign to get people again focused on this issue \nof the link between prescription drugs and the dangers there that are \nnarcotic prescription drugs and the opioid addiction issue. I can't \ntell you how sad it is to talk to parents back home who have lost a \nchild because that child started on prescription drugs. In two cases, I \ncan tell you about parents who have come to talk to me--one testified \nat a hearing that we had back in Cleveland, OH--two cases where the \nteenager went in to get a wisdom tooth extracted and was given \npainkillers--prescription drugs--and from that became addicted and from \nthat went to heroin and from that, sadly, had an overdose and died.\n  So I think this awareness is incredibly important because most people \ndon't realize that four out of five heroin addicts in Ohio started on \nprescription drugs. That awareness alone will save so many lives and \ncreate the opportunity for us to keep people out of that funnel of \naddiction in the first\n\n[[Page S4278]]\n\nplace. The grip of addiction is so strong that once you are in it, it \nis a huge challenge, but it is one that can be overcome, again with the \nright kind of treatment and the right kind of recovery.\n  Again, I am pleased that the majority leader came to the floor today \nto actually begin this process of the formal conference, to get this \nbill to the President's desk and, more importantly, to get this bill \nout to our communities so it can begin to help and it can begin to turn \nthe tide.\n  It is not getting better. I wish I could say it was. When I talk to \npeople who are staffing the hotlines back home, they tell me, \nunfortunately, there are more calls coming in. When I talk to people in \nour hospitals, they tell me, unfortunately, there are more babies born \nwith addiction who are showing up in neonatal units. There has been a \n750-percent increase in my State of Ohio in babies born with addiction \njust in the last dozen years.\n  Unfortunately, when I talk to people about the emergency room--I \ntalked to an emergency room nurse last weekend when I was in Cleveland. \nI was at a festival talking to people, and an emergency room nurse came \nup to me. I heard the same thing I have heard many times, which is you \nhave to do something about this issue. More and more people are coming \nto our emergency rooms seeking help.\n  Of course, it is creating an issue in terms of jobs and employment \nbecause people who are addicted often are not able to work, cannot hold \ndown a job, and cannot pass a drug test. So it is affecting our economy \nin so many ways, and of course affecting our families. Ultimately, it \nis about individuals not being able to pursue their God-given purpose \nin life because these drugs are getting them off track.\n  CARA passed in the Senate by a 94-to-1 vote, as I said. So there is \ncommon ground here among Republicans and Democrats alike. This is not a \npartisan issue. It never has been. From the start, over the last few \nyears we have worked together. In fact, we worked with the House, not \njust bipartisan but bicameral, and put together legislation both \nChambers could support. There were about 129 House Members who were \ncosponsors of the legislation that passed the Senate. Initially, we \ntook ideas from the House and the Senate, and this is why I am a little \nfrustrated, frankly, that we haven't made more progress already. Now is \nthe time to move. Let's get this done before July 4. Let's get it done \nnext week. Let's get it to the President and to our communities. There \nis no reason for us to wait. With this step today, of the formal naming \nof the conferees, there is no reason for us not to move forward with \nthis and move forward with it in a way that shows we can work together \nas a House and Senate to solve these problems.\n  Some have said: Well, there might be some other ideas that will come \nup. That is fine. I hope there will be lots of new ideas that will come \nup because there is no silver bullet, but we know this legislation will \nhelp. We know it is comprehensive. We know it is well-thought-out. We \nknow it is based on best practices. Let's move forward with this now \nbecause it is urgent.\n  One American every 12 minutes loses his or her life to overdoses. \nSince CARA passed, this means more than 11,000 Americans have died of \noverdoses. So since March 10, when this legislation passed on the \nSenate floor, 11,000 Americans lost their lives. Again, it doesn't \ninclude the hundreds of thousands more who are affected in some \nfundamental ways.\n  People back home get this. When I was on a tele-townhall meeting \nrecently, one of my constituents called in, and he started talking \nabout the CARA legislation and the importance of more funding for \nevidence-based treatment that works. There was something about the way \nhe was describing it, and I could tell this was personal. So I said: \nSir, can you tell us why you know so much about this and why you are so \ninterested?\n  There was a pause. I knew what was coming because I heard it too many \ntimes before. He explained that he had lost his daughter. She had been \nin and out of treatment programs, and relapsed. She had been in prison \nand out. She had finally decided that she was ready, that she wanted to \naccept a treatment program to be able to turn her life around. She was \nin a position to do so. They took her to a treatment center to get \ntreatment, and there was a waiting list. During the time she was on \nthat waiting list--I believe it was 14 days--was when they found her. \nShe had overdosed. His point was very simple. You can imagine the \nemotion on the call.\n  His point was very simple. When someone is ready to seek treatment, \nwe need to have treatment available for them. We are told that eight \nout of ten heroin addicts--nine out of ten overall--are not seeking \ntreatment who need it. Some of that is because of the stigma associated \nwith addiction. We need to wipe that stigma away to get people into \ntreatment. Some of it is because there is not the availability of \ntreatment in some parts of Ohio. In some parts of Ohio, in some of our \nrural areas, there literally is no effective treatment available. In \nother areas, in some of our urban areas, where there is good treatment \navailable and some amazing places that are doing incredible work, they \ndo have a waiting list at some of them. We also have a waiting list \nwith regard to some of the longer term recovery centers and residential \ncenters in Ohio. That again is helped by this legislation. We also have \ndifficulty with some of our detox centers in some areas of Ohio. There \nis not enough room in the detox center so the police don't know where \nto take people to get them started in this process.\n  We hear stories constantly back home in Ohio about this issue \nbecause, sadly, we are one of the States that is hardest hit. We are in \nthe top five in the country in overdoses, and in fentanyl overdoses we \nmay be No. 1. Fentanyl, by the way, is a synthetic form of heroin.\n  People ask: Is it about prescription drugs or heroin? It is about the \ndrugs. If it is not heroin, it may be fentanyl. If it is not fentanyl, \nnext year it may be something else. It may go back to methamphetamines. \nIt may be about cocaine. It is about the drugs, and we can't take our \neye off of this issue because when we think we solve one problem \nanother problem will crop up.\n  Fentanyl is produced synthetically. It is usually in the mail, and it \nis mailed mostly from Ohio. From our experience, it is coming from \nChina to the United States. It is made by chemists who don't care about \nour kids or our citizens, because they are making this deadly poison. \nSometimes it is mixed with heroin. Sometimes it is put into a pill form \nto try to indicate that it might be a prescription drug pill that \npeople might think is more safe, which it is obviously not. This \nfentanyl is causing more deaths in my hometown of Cincinnati and \nCleveland, OH, than heroin these days.\n  We hear stories such as the story of Nicholas Dicillo of Cleveland, \nOH. Nicholas was a bright young man, a gifted musician. He had a full \nscholarship to Northwestern University. His father died of a heroin \noverdose when he was a child. Two decades later, sadly, Nick became a \nheroin addict himself after experimenting with it with some friends. It \nwas an experiment, and he got addicted. I hope people who are listening \ntoday understand this is something that cannot be played with. You are \nplaying with fire.\n  He soon realized that he had made a tragic mistake. He said: ``Heroin \ntook me to the depths of hell.'' That was his quote.\n  Then his mother Celeste died of a heroin overdose in January. \nNicholas was the one who found her body. That heartbreaking experience \nmotivated Nick to get clean. He made a promise to himself that he would \nnot suffer that same fate, the fate of both of his parents. After his \nmother died, he was homeless. He tried quitting cold turkey. That \ndidn't work. He wasn't able to do it. Most heroin prescription drug \naddicts are not. He sought help, he sought treatment, and he was clean \nfor 2 months.\n\n       I am just starting to like myself again. I have a whole lot \n     more life to live. I have a whole lot more I want to do. I \n     don't want to become another statistic.\n\n  But then, sadly, he relapsed. He overdosed. He was found dead with a \nneedle in his arm on May 4 in west Cleveland, OH. Memorial services are \nbeing held for him in Cleveland this week.\n  That is what is happening in northeast Ohio. In southwest Ohio, a \nwoman\n\n[[Page S4279]]\n\narrested by the Cincinnati Police pled guilty last week to repeatedly \ntrafficking her own 11-year-old old daughter to her 42-year-old drug \ndealer in exchange for heroin. Sadly, she even gave this girl--her 11-\nyear-old daughter--heroin.\n  You get the picture. This is not in one ZIP Code. This is not in one \ncommunity. It knows no ZIP Code. It is in our rural areas, in our \nsuburban areas, and in our inner cities. It is affecting every person \nregardless of their station in life, regardless of their background. No \none is immune from it, and no one is unaffected by it. Ohioans know \nthis is happening and they are taking action. That is positive. Terri \nThompson, of Bluffton, OH, has founded a group called Ohio Moms Against \nHeroin, and I commend her for it. She has seven kids, by the way, and \nfive of them have been addicted to heroin at one point or another over \nthe past 20 years. They are from a middle-class Ohio home. One son went \nto prison. Over the next year, 12 of his peers died of heroin \noverdoses. Terri's youngest daughter--a cheerleader, a soccer player, \nand a talented piano player--made the mistake of trying heroin with her \nboyfriend. She became addicted. One of her brothers who got treatment \nand is now leading a productive life, is a small business owner. He \nencouraged her to get treatment, too, as he had gotten. She did, and \nnow she is living a sober, clean, and a productive life.\n  Seven hundred Ohio moms have now joined Terri's group. We already \nknow they have been saving people. They tell me a story about one woman \nwho contacted the group when she needed treatment. Terri personally \npicked her up and drove her to detox and the woman has been clean for 3 \nmonths and is now back on track. On June 18, Terri and dozens of other \nmoms will be rallying and marching in Findlay, OH, to educate people \nthat addiction is a disease and it needs to be treated. Again, I \ncommend her. I want to thank Terri and all those involved in this body. \nShe is a brave woman who is channeling her grief toward something \nconstructive, and that is helping others to avoid this disease.\n  In my hometown of Cincinnati, the Center for Addiction Treatment, \nalso known as the CAT House, has announced a $5.7 million capital \ncampaign to construct a new 17,000-square foot building to address the \nopioid epidemic. This will triple their capacity to be able to treat \nmore patients. They will be able to treat about 6,000 patients. They do \ngreat work, and they have had great success. Construction has already \nbegun. It is expected to be completed within a year.\n  I want to thank everyone who has made that possible, including the \nfolks at the CAT House, but also the State of Ohio, the city of \nCincinnati, the Deaconess Health Associations Foundation, and Bethesda, \nInc.\n  The University of Cincinnati former law school dean emeritus, Joe \nTomain, who is a friend of mine, has been speaking out about this \nepidemic, writing in the Cincinnati Enquirer: ``There is no more urgent \nneed in our community than to address this drug scourge.'' I think he \nis right. I want to thank him for doing his part in helping to lend his \nvoice to those who don't have a voice.\n  I know the scope of this epidemic can sometimes feel overwhelming. I \nknow the way we talked about it today, it has to be frustrating to \neverybody hearing it. What are the solutions? How can we get at this? \nBut we know there is hope. We know that prevention can work. It is the \nright kind of prevention, if it is focused and targeted. We know that \ntreatment and recovery can work. I have given you examples of that. \nAgain, it has to be evidence-based. It has to be stuff that we are \nfunding here because it works, not because we want to throw more money \nat a problem.\n  Reggie Gant, of Columbus, OH, was a married father of three who had a \ngood job working at a paint company. He tore his rotator cuff. He was \nin pain. His doctor prescribed Percocet for his pain. He became \naddicted. When his doctor stopped filling the prescription, he started \nbuying off of other people in the doctor's waiting room. When the pills \nweren't available or were too expensive, which is often the problem for \nthese prescription drug addicts who turn to heroin, he switched to \nheroin. It was less expensive. It was more available. He was trapped in \nthe funnel of addiction, and the drug became everything. He lost his \nrelationship with his wife and his kids. He started stealing from his \nworkplace. ``I did things I never thought I would do in a million \nyears,'' he said.\n  As I said earlier, the drugs are everything. But he got treatment, \nspending 40 days at an inpatient facility. He has been clean for 6 \nmonths. He is getting help from the Lima Urban Minority Alcoholism and \nDrug Abuse Outreach Program. He is beating this because he was able to \nstep forward and get into treatment. It was there for him. People can \nbeat this, and they do every day.\n  Experts tell us 9 out of 10 of those who need treatment aren't \ngetting it. As I said earlier, some of that is because of the stigma, \nand some of that is because of lack of access to facilities in their \ncommunities. This House effort that was undertaken with 18 separate \nbills combined with the Senate bill, the Comprehensive Addiction and \nRecovery Act, or CARA, will make a difference. It will provide more \nhelp to the type of treatment programs and recovery efforts that \nactually work.\n  If we can get this comprehensive bill to the President, we can help \nmore people who are struggling to get treatment. We can help give them \nmore hope. It is time to act and act quickly to find common ground \nbefore we lose more of our fellow Americans. Let's get this \ncomprehensive bill into law and begin to help those millions of our \nfellow citizens who are struggling with this epidemic.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield back my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Radical Islamic Terrorism\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, our Nation is at war. Five days ago, we \nsaw a horrific terror attack in Orlando, FL. From September 11 to the \nBoston Marathon, from Fort Hood to Chattanooga, from San Bernardino to \nthis attack in Orlando, radical Islamic terrorism has declared jihad on \nAmerica. As the facts have unfolded, they now indicate that the Orlando \nterrorist had pledged his allegiance to ISIS in the process of \nmurdering 49 and wounding more than 50 at a nightclub.\n  All of our hearts go out to those who were murdered. To the families \nof those who were victims and who are grieving, we stand in solidarity, \nwe lift them up in prayer at this horrific act of terrorism. But it is \nalso a time for action. We need a Commander in Chief who will speak the \ntruth, who will address the enemy we face, who will unleash the full \nforce and fury of the American military on defeating ISIS and defeating \nradical Islamic terrorists.\n  In the wake of the attack, many of us predicted what would unfold, \nand it was, sadly, the same political tale we have seen over and over \nagain. Many of us predicted that Democrats would, as a matter of rigid \npartisan ideology, refuse even to say the words ``radical Islamic \nterrorist''; that they would suggest this attack was yet another \nisolated incident, one lone criminal, not connected to any global \nideology, not connected to any global jihad; and that, even worse, they \nwould try to use it as an excuse to go after the Second Amendment \nrights of law-abiding citizens. I wish, when we predicted that, that we \nhad been proven incorrect. But this week played out all too \npredictably.\n  Yesterday we saw a political show on the Senate floor, with Democrat \nafter Democrat standing for hours, incensed not at ISIS, incensed not \nat radical Islamic terrorism, but incensed that Americans have a right \nto keep and bear arms. This is political distraction. This is political \ngamesmanship. I think the American people find it ridiculous that in \nresponse to an ISIS terror attack, the Democrats go on high dudgeon \nthat we have to restrict the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding \ncitizens. This is not a gun control issue. This is a terrorism issue. \nAnd it is nothing less than political gamesmanship for them to try to \nshift to their favorite hobbyhorse of taking away the Bill of Rights \nfrom law-abiding citizens.\n\n[[Page S4280]]\n\n  I have spent years defending the Second Amendment--the right to keep \nand bear arms--the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights, and I, along \nwith the Presiding Officer, along with a great many Members of this \nChamber, am committed to defending the constitutional rights of every \nAmerican. You don't defeat terrorism by taking away our guns; you \ndefeat terrorism by using our guns. This body should not be engaged in \na political circus trying to restrict the Second Amendment. Instead, we \nshould be focusing on the problem at hand.\n  Why did we see yesterday's series of speeches? Because Senate \nDemocrats have an election coming up in November, and they don't want \nto talk about the real issue. Let's talk about ISIS. Let's talk about \nradical Islamic terrorism. Let's talk about the failures of the last 7 \nyears of this administration to keep this country safe.\n  In response to my criticism and that of many others, President Obama \ngave a press conference where he said, echoing the words of Hillary \nClinton: What difference does it make if we call it radical Islamic \nterrorism? Well, Mr. President, it makes a world of difference because \nthe failure to address the enemy impacts every action taken to fight \nthat enemy.\n  I want to talk in particular about three areas where this \nadministration and the Senate Democrats' refusal to confront radical \nIslamic terrorism has made America less safe and what we need to do \nabout it. Let's start with prevention. Over and over again we have seen \nthe Obama administration having ample information to stop a terrorist \nattack. Yet, because of the political correctness, because of the \nideology of this administration that will not even say the word \n``jihad,'' will not even say the words ``radical Islamic terrorism,'' \nthey look the other way, and the attacks go forward.\n  In my home State of Texas, Fort Hood, Nidal Hasan--the Obama \nadministration knew that Nidal Hasan had been in communication with the \nradical Islamic cleric Anwar al-Awlaki. The Obama administration knew \nthat Nidal Hasan had asked al-Awlaki about the permissibility of waging \njihad against his fellow soldiers. All of that was known beforehand, \nyet they did nothing. They did nothing. And on that fateful day, Nidal \nHasan murdered 14 innocent souls, yelling ``Allahu Akbar'' as he pulled \nthe trigger. Yet, just to underscore the blindness of this \nadministration even after the terror attack, the administration \ninsisted on characterizing that terror attack as ``workplace \nviolence.'' That is nothing short of delusion, and it is a delusion \nthat cost 14 lives.\n  If we know of a U.S. servicemember who is communicating with a \nradical Islamic cleric and asking about waging jihad against his fellow \nsoldiers, MPs should show up at that individual's door within minutes. \nAnd if we didn't have an administration that plunged its head in the \nsand like an ostrich and refused to acknowledge radical Islamic \nterrorism, Nidal Hasan would have been stopped before he carried out \nthat horrific act of terrorism.\n  Likewise, with the Boston bombing and the Tsarnaev brothers, Russia \nhad informed the Obama administration they were connected with radical \nIslamic terrorism. We knew that. The FBI had gone and interviewed them. \nYet, once again, they dropped the ball. They stopped monitoring them. \nThey didn't even note when the elder Tsarnaev brother posted on YouTube \na public call to jihad. Mind you, this did not require complicated \nsurveillance. This was YouTube. Anyone with a computer who could type \nin ``Google'' could see this. Yet, because the administration will not \nacknowledge that we are fighting radical Islamic terrorism, they were \nnot watching and monitoring the Tsarnaev brothers. So they called for \npublic jihad and then carried out that public jihad with pressure \ncookers at the Boston Marathon--yet another example where we knew about \nthe individual beforehand, and if we had focused prevention on the \nproblem, we could have stopped it.\n  A third example was San Bernardino, that horrific terror attack. Once \nagain, we had ample information about the individuals in question. The \nfemale terrorist who came to San Bernardino had given the \nadministration a fake address in Pakistan. Yet the so-called vetting \nthat this administration tells us they do had failed to discover that \nit was a fake address. She had made calls for jihad; yet the \nadministration failed to discover that. In San Bernardino, we saw yet \nanother horrific terror attack.\n  And how about Orlando? Let's talk about what the facts are in \nOrlando. Now, we are only 5 days in. The facts will develop further as \nthey are more fully developed, but here is what has been publicly \nreported.\n  What has been publicly reported is that Omar Mateen was interviewed \nnot once, not twice, but three times by the FBI in 2013 and 2014. One \nof the reasons he was interviewed by the FBI was that he was talking in \nhis place of employment, which, ironically and shockingly enough, was a \ncontractor to the Department of Homeland Security, and he was talking \nabout being connected to terrorist organizations, including the Boston \nbombers. To any rational person, that is a big red flag. Yet it has \nalso been reported that his coworkers were so afraid to say anything \nbecause they didn't want to be labeled as somehow anti-Muslim by \nspeaking out about someone claiming to be connected to radical Islamic \nterrorists.\n  We also know that when he was questioned by the FBI in 2004, \naccording to public reports, it was because he was believed to have \nbeen connected to and knew Moner Mohammad Abusalha, who traveled to \nSyria to join the terrorist organization al-Nusra Front and who became \nthe first known American suicide bomber in the Syrian conflict. That is \nyet another big red flag. If you are palling around with al-Nusra \nsuicide bombers, that ought to be a real flag. If the administration is \nfocused on radical Islamic terrorism, this is an individual we ought to \nbe watching.\n  We know that Mateen, as it has been reported, traveled to Mecca in \nSaudi Arabia for 10 days on March 2011 and for 8 days in March 2012. \nAnd we also have indications that the FBI may have been aware that he \nwas a follower of the Islamist educational Web site run by radical \nImams. Not only that, but his father has posted online videos \nexpressing not only sympathy but arguably support for the Taliban. All \nof that is what the Obama administration knew. Yet by Sunday morning \nthey were no longer watching Omar Mateen. They were no longer watching \nOmar Mateen. They were not monitoring him, and he was able to go in and \ncommit a horrific act of murder.\n  The question that every Member of this body should be asking is, Why \nis the ball being dropped over and over and over again? It is not once. \nIt is not twice. It is a pattern. It is a pattern of failing to connect \nthe dots. I would suggest it is directly connected to President Obama \nand this administration's refusal to acknowledge what it is we are \nfighting. If you direct the prevention efforts to stopping radical \nIslamic terrorism--we had all the information we had on Mateen to keep \na very close eye on him. Yet if that is not what you are fighting, then \nyou close the investigation and yet another attack goes forward.\n  I would suggest that this willful blindness is one of the reasons we \nsaw the circus yesterday on the Senate floor. Senate Democrats should \nbe asking these questions, yet we don't hear them asking those \nquestions. Instead, they want to shift this to gun control. They want \nto shift this to putting the Federal Government in charge of approving \nevery firearms transaction between law-abiding citizens in America. \nMind you, that would not have prevented this attack. Mind you, it was \nnot directed at the evil of this attack. Mind you, it ignores the \nglobal jihad we are facing, but it is a convenient political dodge. We \nneed serious leadership focused on keeping this country safe.\n  A second component of keeping this country safe is defeating ISIS--\nutterly and completely defeating ISIS.\n  In yesterday's circus, when calling for taking away your and my \nconstitutional rights, how often did Senate Democrats say: Let's \nutterly destroy ISIS. Not with the pinprick attacks we are seeing, not \nwith the photo-op foreign policy of this administration--a failed \neffort that leaves the terrorists laughing at us--but instead, using \noverwhelming airpower; instead, using the concerted power of the U.S. \nmilitary, with rules of engagement that allow us to fight and win. \nRight now, sending our service men and women into combat with rules of \nengagement\n\n[[Page S4281]]\n\ntying their hands behind their backs is wrong, it is immoral, and it is \nnot accomplishing the task.\n  Do you want a response to the Orlando attacks? President Obama and \nVice President Biden are going down. They will no doubt give a self-\nrighteous speech about gun control, trying to strip away the rights of \nlaw-abiding Americans. How about they stand up and have the President \npledge that ISIS will be driven from the face of the Earth? Do you want \nto see a response to murdering innocent Americans? If you declare war \non America, you are signing your death warrant. That is the response of \na Commander in Chief. That is the seriousness we need.\n  A third component of focusing on the enemy is that we should focus on \nkeeping us safe--in particular, passing two pieces of legislation, both \nof which I introduced, the first of which is the Expatriate Terrorist \nAct. This is legislation which provides that if any American citizen \ngoes and takes up arms and joins ISIS, joins a radical Islamic \nterrorist group, that he or she forfeits their U.S. citizenship. So you \ndo not have American citizens coming back to America with U.S. \npassports to wage jihad on America. We have seen Americans such as Jose \nPadilla, Anwar al-Awlaki, and Faisal Shahzad, just to name a few, who \nhave abandoned their country and joined with the terrorists in waging \nwar against us. Just this week, the CIA Director testified to the \nSenate that more are coming; ISIS intends to send individuals back here \nto wage jihad.\n  Rather than engaging in political showmanship, trying to gain \npartisan advantage in the November election, how about we come together \nand say: If you join ISIS, you are not using a U.S. passport to come \nback here and murder American citizens. That ought to be a unanimous \nagreement if we were focused on keeping this country safe.\n  Likewise, let's talk about the problem of refugees. What are the \nconsequences of the willful blindness of this administration that \nPresident Obama, in the face of this terror attack, says that he will \nadmit some 10,000 Syrian Muslim refugees, despite the fact that the FBI \nDirector has told Congress he cannot possibly vet them to determine if \nthey are terrorists?\n  Here is what FBI Director Comey said:\n\n       We can only query against that which we have collected. And \n     so if someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in \n     a way that would get their identity or their interest \n     reflected in our database, we can query our database until \n     the cows come home, but there will be nothing to show up \n     because we have no record of them.\n\n  This is an FBI Director who was appointed by President Obama who is \ntelling the administration they cannot vet these refugees. Yet what \ndoes the administration say? What does Hillary Clinton say? What do the \nSenate Democrats say? Let the refugees in, even though ISIS is telling \nus they are going to use those refugees to send terrorists here to come \nand murder us. This transcends mere partisan disagreement; this is \nlunacy.\n  We know the Paris attack was carried out in part by people who came \nin using the refugee program, taking advantage of the refugee program. \nIndeed, earlier this year, on January 6, 2016, Omar Faraj Saeed Al \nHardan, a Palestinian born in Iraq who entered the United States as a \nrefugee in 2009, was charged with attempting to provide support to \nISIS. He wanted to set off bombs using cell phone detonators at two \nmalls in my hometown of Houston, TX. This is a refugee who came from \nIraq. Yet, do you hear the administration saying: This is a dangerous \nworld. Jihadists are attempting to kill us. We have to keep us safe. \nThey don't say that.\n  The legislation I have introduced, which I would urge this body to \ntake up, would impose a 3-year moratorium on refugees coming from any \nnation where ISIS or Al Qaeda or radical Islamic terrorists control a \nsubstantial portion of the territory. We can help with humanitarian \nefforts. We can help resettling refugees in majority Muslim countries \nin the Middle East. America is a compassionate country that has given \nmore than 10 times as much money as any country on Earth to caring for \nrefugees. But being compassionate doesn't mean we are suicidal. It \ndoesn't mean we invite to America, we invite to our homes people who \nthe FBI cannot tell us if they are terrorists or not.\n  What should this Senate be doing? We shouldn't be engaging in a \nsideshow of gun control. By the way, I will say on behalf of a lot of \nAmerican citizens, in the wake of this terror attack, it is offensive. \nI sat in that chair and presided yesterday over some of the show. It \nwas offensive to see Democrat after Democrat prattling on about the \nNRA. It wasn't the NRA that murdered 49 people in Orlando. It wasn't \nthe NRA that set up pressure cookers in the Boston bombing. It wasn't \nthe NRA that murdered 14 innocent souls at Fort Hood. It is offensive \nto play political games with the constitutional rights of American \ncitizens instead of getting serious about keeping this country safe.\n  I would urge this body to take up both pieces of legislation--the \nExpatriate Terrorist Act to prevent terrorists from using U.S. \npassports to come back to America and TRIPA to prevent refugees from \ncountries with majority control, major control from ISIS or Al Qaeda \nfrom coming in, ISIS terrorists as refugees. Those would be commonsense \nsteps. The overwhelming majority of Americans would agree. Yet, in this \npoliticized environment, that is not what our friends on the other side \nof the aisle want to talk about. Until we get serious about defeating \nradical Islamic terrorists, we will continue to lose innocents.\n  I would note one aspect of the attack on Sunday morning. It was \nwidely reported that it was at a gay bar. There are a great many \nDemocrats who are fond of calling themselves champions of the LGBT \ncommunity. I would suggest there is no more important issue to champion \nin that regard than protecting Americans from murder by a vicious \nideology that systematically murders homosexuals, that throws them off \nbuildings, that buries them under rocks. The regime in Iran, now \nsupported by billions of dollars of American taxpayer dollars at the \nbehest of President Obama, murders homosexuals regularly.\n  I will confess, some in the press pool were a little bit puzzled: \nWell, how can a Republican be speaking out against this? Let me be very \nclear. I am against murder. I am against murder of any American. Nobody \nhas a right to murder anybody because they differ in faith, because \nthey differ in sexual orientation, because they differ in any respect. \nWe are a nation founded on protecting the rights of everyone to live \naccording to their conscience, according to their faith. This murder in \nOrlando was not random; it was part of a global jihad, an ideology, an \nIslamist ideology that commands its adherents to murder or forcibly \nconvert the infidel, by whom they mean every one of us.\n  This body should not be engaged in political games. We should be \nfocused on the threat and keeping America safe and defeating radical \nIslamic terrorists.\n  As we remember the victims of this latest terror attack, the greatest \nmemorial we can give to them is to redouble ourselves to a seriousness \nof purpose to prevent the next terror attack from taking innocent \nAmerican lives. I hope that is what this body does. I hope we do so in \na bipartisan manner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am a proud cosponsor of the \nComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, and I am glad that this \nimportant bill is now going to be moving to conference. I am glad that \nas the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, I will be a \nconferee.\n  Beyond the idea of being a conferee, it is urgent that we find \ncomprehensive and real solutions to the epidemic of heroin and \nprescription opioid abuse. I am in Vermont many times a month. I hear \nfrom people I know and from some I do not know. They are in the grocery \nstores, on the street, even coming out of church on Sunday. They are \ntelling me of their concerns either within their own family or in their \nown neighborhood with the problems of opioid abuse. Communities \nthroughout the Nation are grappling with this issue, whether they are \nin urban areas or rural areas or a State such as the Presiding Officer \nand I represent that has a mixture of both urban and rural.\n  I think the Federal Government has to do its part to provide the \nsupport\n\n[[Page S4282]]\n\nnecessary to sustain those efforts. It means real money. For rural \ncommunities, which are predominantly the communities in my home State \nof Vermont, it means better access to the opioid antidote Naloxone, \nwhich saves lives. I have held hearings throughout Vermont, and I have \nheard from not only the police but physicians, the faith community, \nparents, teachers, and others that Naloxone can save lives.\n  It is really not a question of whether there is a heroin-opioid \nepidemic; the question is how quickly we can respond. We have to act \nnow. The American people expect us to, and that is an expectation they \nare justified to have. So let us fulfill the expectation.\n  I support the efforts by my neighbor from New Hampshire, Senator \nShaheen, and I support her motion to instruct conferees to provide \nfunding for State and local efforts to combat the opioid epidemic.\n  I also support my fellow New Englander, Senator Whitehouse, in his \nmotion to instruct conferees to address the needs of rural communities. \nI come from a State of 625,000 people--625,000 very special people. It \nis very rural. We need the help. I support Senator Whitehouse in this.\n  I see other Senators on the floor, so I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                              Puerto Rico\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise today to be a voice for the \n3\\1/2\\ million citizens living on the island of Puerto Rico. I rise so \ntheir concerns for themselves, their families, and their livelihoods \nwill be heard--to ask that we improve House-passed legislation known as \nPROMESA. The word ``promesa'' in English would mean ``promise,'' but \nthe only thing the House bill promises the people of Puerto Rico is \nyears of subjugation at the hands of an anti-democratic control board.\n  All of us in this Senate will soon be faced with an immediate and \nserious choice, one which will have profound consequences on the people \nof Puerto Rico for a generation. I have said from the beginning, in \nterms of the challenge Puerto Rico has--a $70 billion debt; pays one-\nthird of every dollar it receives toward paying interest, which is \nunsustainable for them and unsustainable for any governmental entity \nthat would face that challenge; made tough, horrible decisions--closed \nschools, closed hospitals, reduced public safety--and still cannot meet \nthe challenge. They need a clear path to restructuring. That is not a \nbailout. A bailout is when somebody has a debt, you bring them the \nmoney and say, OK, we are going take care of your debt, but that is not \nthe case. Restructuring is about taking the debt you have and giving \nthe wherewithal for that debt to be restructured in a way that is both \nsustainable and can take care of the obligations therein.\n\n  It needs an oversight board that represents the people, the U.S. \ncitizens of Puerto Rico, their needs and their concerns, and \nacknowledges and respects their Democratic rights as Americans, but, \nsadly, the legislation passed by the House last week falls far short of \nwhat we need on several fronts. Instead of offering a clear path to \nrestructuring, it creates more obstacles. It creates a supermajority 5-\nto-2 vote by an unelected control board to get to the possibility of \nrestructuring that could derail the island's attempts to achieve \nsustainable debt payments. Without any authority to restructure its \ndebt, all this legislation will do is take away the Democratic rights \nof 3\\1/2\\ million Americans and leave the future to wishful thinking \nand a prayer that the crisis will somehow be resolved. Even if the \nboard did allow restructuring after a series of hurdles, it will come \nat a steep price, and that price is the right of self-governance.\n  In return for being able to rework its debts, the people of Puerto \nRico will be forced to relinquish their fundamental right to govern \nthemselves and make their own decisions, the very same rights we fought \nto secure in a revolution 240 years ago.\n  What I am saying shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone who read the \nHouse Natural Resources Committee report, which was unequivocal when \ndescribing the vast powers this control board will exercise, which we \nwill be voting on.\n  In an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, it \nstates: ``The board would have broad sovereign powers to effectively \noverrule decisions by Puerto Rico's legislature, governor and other \npublic authorities.''\n  Let me repeat that. They will have broad sovereign powers. Words have \nconsequences and meaning in legislation and in law. They will have \nbroad sovereign powers to effectively overrule decisions made by the \nelected government of the 3\\1/2\\ million U.S. citizens who call Puerto \nRico their home.\n  The Congressional Budget Office went on to say that the Board can \n``effectively nullify''--cancel, goodbye, hasta la vista--``any new \nlaws or policies adopted by Puerto Rico that did not conform to \nrequirements specified in the bill.'' So not only can the control board \nset budgets and fiscal policy, it also has the power to veto other \nlaws. Essentially, this means that the Board combines--think of this--\nthe legislative powers of Congress with the veto powers of the \nExecutive to form an omnipotent entity, the powers which are virtually \nunprecedented. We talk about checks and balances in our government as \none of the creations by the Founders which was essential to a modern \ndemocracy. Well, we obliterate the checks and balances and the rights \nof the people of Puerto Rico by having an omnipotent entity, the powers \nof which are virtually unprecedented.\n  As the bill's own author noted in the markup memo, and I quote, \n``[T]he Oversight Board may impose mandatory cuts on Puerto Rico's \ngovernment and instrumentalities--a power far beyond that exercised by \nthe Control Board established for the District of Columbia, when there \nwas a control board, when the District of Columbia found itself in \nFiscal Challenge.''\n  The fact that the Puerto Rican people will have absolutely no say \nover who is appointed or what action this Board decides is blatant \nneocolonialism. Instead, their fate will be determined by seven \nunelected, unaccountable members of a so-called oversight board that \nwill act as a virtual oligarchy and impose their unchecked will on the \nisland. If the Board uses the superpowers in this bill to close \nschools, shutter more hospitals, cut senior citizens' pensions to the \nbone, if it decides to hold a fire sale and put Puerto Rico's natural \nwonders on the auction block to the highest bidder, if it puts balanced \nbudgets ahead of the health, safety, and well-being of children and \nfamilies similar to the control board travesty that unfolded in Flint, \nthere will be nothing the people of Puerto Rico or their elected \nrepresentatives can do to stop them.\n  Of course the bill doesn't stop there. It also provides an exception \nto the Federal minimum wage for younger workers, and it exempts the \nisland from recently finalized overtime protections. At a time when we \nare working to increase workers' wages, the people in the country have \nsaid through this election process: My wages are stagnant, and I feel I \ncan't meet the challenges of myself and my family, PROMESA goes in the \nopposite direction, and it actually cuts workers' wages. It amazes me \nthat the solution to get Puerto Rico's economy growing again is to \nensure that workers make even less money. The island consists of 3\\1/2\\ \nmillion U.S. citizens, 40 percent of which are below the Federal \npoverty level, and now we are going to cut their wages. Lowering \npeople's wages is not a pro-growth strategy. What it is, is a pro-\nmigration strategy. All it will do is intensify outmigration to the \nmainland, where people who are U.S. citizens and happen to live in \nPuerto Rico are eligible for a higher minimum wage here, where they \nwould have commonsense overtime protections, are eligible for full \nMedicare, Medicaid reimbursement, are eligible for the child tax credit \nas they try to raise their child and realize their hopes and dreams and \naspirations, are eligible for the earned-income tax credit--all they \nhave to do is take one flight to the United States. Yet we somehow \nthink that a policy that subjugates these 3\\1/2\\ million citizens and \ntakes away essential rights they have as American citizens is going to \nbe a good fiscal policy for us as well.\n  Every time I talk about my brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico, I \nlike to remind my colleagues in this Chamber and in the other that they \nhave fought on behalf of America since World War\n\n[[Page S4283]]\n\nI. They have fought in World War II, the Korean war, Vietnam, Desert \nStorm, Desert Shield, Iraq, Afghanistan, and the War on Terror. As a \nmatter of fact, if you go and visit the Vietnam Memorial as it \ncommemorates its 50th anniversary, you will find a disproportionately \nhigh number of Puerto Rican names etched in that solemn black stone as \ncompared to the rest of the American population.\n  I remember being in the Visitor Center when the Speaker of the House \nhad a celebration of the 65th Infantry Division, an all-Puerto Rican \ndivision, one of the most highly decorated in U.S. history, known as \nthe Borinqueneers. They received the Congressional Gold Medal, the \nhighest honor Congress gives any citizen.\n  We talked about their enormous contributions, their sacrifices on \nbehalf of the Nation. These men and women--many of whom gave their \nlives--still serve so we can remain the land of the free. They will go \nback home to where their freedom and their right to self-governance \nwill be stripped. These heroes deserve the same rights and respect as \nU.S. citizens in New Jersey, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida, Utah, or \nany other State in the Nation, but what this bill tells the people of \nPuerto Rico is this: Though you may be good enough to wear the uniform \nof your country, you may be good enough to fight and die to defend the \nUnited States, you are not good enough to make your own decisions, \ngovern yourself, and have a voice in your own future.\n  I am not advocating to completely remove all oversight powers--to the \ncontrary. I support helping Puerto Rico make informed, prudent \ndecisions that put it on the path to economic growth and solvency. \nDespite its name, the oversight board envisioned by this bill doesn't \nsimply oversee, it directs and commands. It doesn't assist. It \nabsolutely controls potentially every significant public policy \ndecision that affects those 3\\1/2\\ million U.S. citizens.\n  The Senate has an opportunity to change that situation. We have a \nchance to improve this bill and strike the right balance. I want the \nopportunity to offer a number of targeted, commonsense amendments to \nrestore a proper balance and ensure the people of Puerto Rico have a \nsay in their future and to temper the powers of the control board and \ngive the people of Puerto Rico more of a say as to who is on the Board \nthat is going to determine their future for quite some time.\n  I know, as all of us do, that success is never guaranteed, but at the \nvery least, the people of Puerto Rico deserve a thorough and thoughtful \ndebate on the Senate floor.\n  I do not take lightly, nor should my colleagues, a decision to \ninfringe upon the Democratic rights of the 3\\1/2\\ million U.S. citizens \nin Puerto Rico. Those 3\\1/2\\ million American citizens living in Puerto \nRico and their 5 million family members living in our States and our \ndistricts deserve more than the Senate holding its nose to improve an \ninferior solution.\n  I am pleased to say that this sentiment has some bipartisan support. \nI sent a letter, with Senator Wicker, to Senate leadership asking for a \nfull and thorough debate. I hope we do not get jammed at the final \nmoment as an attempt to push an undemocratic bill through the Senate by \nwaiting until the very end of this session as a tactical maneuver to \navoid a thoughtful debate and an opportunity for amendments.\n  I took Majority Leader McConnell at his word when he said: ``We need \nto open up the legislative process in a way that allows more amendments \nfrom both sides.'' I am hopeful he will honor that commitment.\n  Like some of my colleagues, I was once a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, and I have enormous respect for that Chamber, but I \ndidn't get elected to the Senate to abdicate my responsibility and \nsimply rubberstamp whatever bills come over from the House of \nRepresentatives. I would hope we would immediately call up this bill \nfor debate and do what we were elected to do--fix problems and make the \nlives of the American people better.\n  Just because these 3\\1/2\\ million citizens are Puerto Rican, they are \nno less a citizen than you or the Presiding Officer or my colleagues \nwho are on the floor or those who get to serve in this institution. \nThey deserve better. They deserve better than to be jammed with an \nundemocratic process that will affect their lives in ways far beyond \nanybody in this Chamber would be willing to accept.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nmandatory quorum call be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nand notwithstanding the adoption of the compound motion to go to \nconference on S. 524, that Senator Shaheen and Senator Whitehouse or \ntheir designees be recognized to each offer a motion to instruct \nconferees and that there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided on the \nmotions, and that following the use or yielding back of that time, the \nSenate vote on the motions to instruct conferees with no intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I understand that prior to the cloture \nvote, the Democratic side still had some time. I yield back that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It supports the bipartisan language worked \nout between Senator Blunt and Senator McCaskill on the Missouri county \nprescription drug management program issue. It supports a focus on the \nrural communities for which opioid has been a plague, which is a \nbipartisan concern. It supports the passed bipartisan version of the \nveterans opioids measure from the Senate Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs. And it supports the Senate HELP Committee's passed bipartisan \nversion of the bipartisan TREAT Act.\n  If we can pull together as a Senate, we can have a really great bill. \nPlease send the conferees a strong bipartisan vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I concur in the comments of my colleague. \nThis is the CARA legislation which passed here on a 94-to-1 vote.

Mr. President, a few weeks ago, when I started preparing \nto give this speech, I must admit I was overwhelmed with emotion. One \nyear ago tomorrow, a brutal attack, fueled by hate, led to the deaths \nof nine parishioners at Mother Emanuel AME Church in my hometown of \nCharleston, SC.\n  A year later, the idea that someone's heart could be filled with so \nmuch anger and venom is still jarring.\n  Then, over the weekend, we saw it again. In Orlando, FL, a brutal \nattack, fueled by hate, led to the deaths of 49 people at the Pulse \nnightclub. This was an assault against the people of Orlando, the State \nof Florida, and the United States as a whole.\n  We can, and we will, have a much longer discussion on ISIS, Islamic \nterror, and the steps that must be taken in those areas. But today, as \nOrlando mourns and Charleston remembers, I want to return to 365 days \nago and show how, with the world watching, love overcame hate.\n  On the night of June 17, 2015, I was here in Washington. Much like \nthis week, we were debating the NDAA and our military priorities. But \nin Charleston, there was a Bible study. Cynthia Hurd, Susie Jackson, \nEthel Lee Lance, Depayne Middleton-Doctor, Tywanza Sanders, Daniel \nSimmons, Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, Myra Thompson, Felicia Sanders and \nher 5-year-old granddaughter, Polly Sheppard, and my friend, the \nReverend Clementa Pinckney, had gathered together for a Bible study at \nMother Emanuel.\n  Among them was a young man who was new to Emanuel--a young man they \nwelcomed into their presence with God's love. While they did not and \ncould not possibly see the darkness in his heart, they showed him the \nloving nature of their own hearts--so much so that he later told police \nthat he almost, almost did not go through with this vicious, vile \nattack because everyone was so nice to him. But, tragically, almost was \nnot enough.\n  In an instant, the horrors unleashed by this young man changed South \nCarolina forever. I remember getting a phone call about 9 o'clock p.m. \non that Wednesday night from one of my friends at the Sheriff's office \nabout the shooting at Mother Emanuel. Reports continued to come in, and \nso I texted my friend, Clementa Pinckney, hoping that he would respond \nand tell me what was going on at the church.\n  I am looking at my texts from June 17, 2015, at 10:31 p.m. I asked \nhim: Are you and your parishioners OK? It was met with silence--silence \nthat is still deafening, silence that I will never forget.\n  He should have been able to text back. He should have been able to go \nhome and see his family, raise his daughters. He should have been able \nto have gone on and finished his work as a State senator in the \nstatehouse and to continue spreading God's love. As we people of faith \nknow, sometimes things simply don't go as they are planned. But as the \nfamilies of the Emanuel nine showed you, God had a plan.\n  Within 48 hours, these men and women set the tone for my grieving \ncity, my grieving State, and my grieving Nation. On Friday morning, \nabout 36 hours later, looking into the killer's eyes, they said to the \nkiller of their family members: ``I forgive you.''\n  Family member after family member, nine consecutive times, to the \nshock and the amazement of the world that was watching, said: ``I \nforgive you.'' Your life can be better in God's hands.\n  Those of us here today cannot even imagine how hard that must have \nbeen--how in their immense grief, these families chose to take this \nunique path. But they did. We as a nation, as a State, and certainly as \na city are forever thankful.\n  I am fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to talk to many and \nall of the families at some point. I continue to be amazed at their \ngrace, their dignity, and their righteousness. They have truly been the \nrock on which we all stand. In the days and weeks after the shooting, \nCharleston and South Carolina came together like never before. As the \nclergy and parishioners at Mother Emanuel said after the attack: \n``Wrong church, wrong people, wrong day.''\n  It was the wrong place to try and sow the seeds of discord. It was \nthe wrong people to try and break their faith and the wrong day to try \nand bring down the people of South Carolina.\n  Last summer, we saw chapters of history close and new ones open. \nWhile the debate over the Confederate flag may be the most widespread \nsymbol of Emanuel's aftermath, the actions and words of folks across \nCharleston and South Carolina are the most enduring.\n  Looking ahead, we have come so far, but we certainly still face many \nchallenges. It is going to take a lot of effort and strength to stand \ntogether in times of division. It is going to be hard sometimes in a \nworld that is too often so full of hate to know that we are still \ntaking steps forward, and it is going to require a continuing \nconversation on issues that are uncomfortable for some but necessary \nfor all.\n  So where are we headed from here? Three words show where I believe \nthat we, as a nation, are headed. These three words show where I \nbelieve we, as a nation, must head. They are simple words--words found \nin 1 Corinthians 13: faith, hope, and love. We saw these in abundance \nthroughout South Carolina over the past year, and they remain our final \ngoal.\n  As I head back to Charleston tonight, I will be thinking about the \nevents honoring the Emanuel nine tomorrow. I am certain there will be \ntears--lots of tears. There will be moments, as there have been in the \nlast few minutes, when it will be hard to speak, to truly show what all \nof this means to all of us, but the world will also see this from \nCharleston, SC: They will see that you can cannot destroy love with \nhate and that you cannot kill the spirit. We\n\n[[Page S4286]]\n\nhave not been torn down by this fury of hate, but instead we will \ncontinue to build a bridge, brick by brick, to a future without hate, a \nfuture filled with faith, hope, and love.\n  I will close by asking one more time, as I did a little more than a \nyear ago in this very same place for a moment of silence to remember \nCynthia Hurd, Susie Jackson, Ethel Lee Lance, Depayne Middleton-Doctor, \nTywanza Sanders, Daniel Simmons, Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, Myra \nThompson, and my good friend and former State Senator, the Reverend \nClementa Pinckney.\n  You are forever in our hearts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Scott for his \neloquent words on behalf of our State and the leadership he has \nprovided since this horrible tragedy a year ago.\n  What can I add? I will just remind people who might not remember why \nhe did it that his goal was to start a race war. Well, he failed \nmiserably. Quite the opposite happened in my State. I have never seen \nanything quite like it.\n  We have had our fair share of problems in South Carolina, and still \ndo, but churches all over the State were filled. Black, White, rich, \npoor--all came together to help each other. So this young man's dream \nof starting a race war was a miserable failure.\n  I am sure this guy who attacked the nightclub in Orlando wanted to \nbreak our will and try to get us to kowtow to a radical form of \nreligion. Well, you are not going to break a will. We will all stand \nbehind the folks in Orlando and come together as a nation as best we \ncan.\n  Senator Scott said it is hard to understand the hate that someone has \nto do what these two people did. What blows my mind is how someone can \ngo and sit in a Bible study for an hour, after being welcomed in off \nthe street to discuss the Word of God, and then get up and shoot the \npeople you have been praying with. I don't know how you get there. Only \nGod knows that. And what this man did in Orlando was beyond vicious.\n  Here is a question that I have asked myself a thousand times, and I \nam beginning to understand the answer: Why was it different in South \nCarolina? We have had shootings throughout the country where people \ntook to the streets. There were riots, sores were exposed, and scabs \nwere pulled off old wounds. What was it about South Carolina that was \ndifferent? I promise you that we are not a perfect people. I promise \nyou that under the right circumstances, what you saw in other places in \nthe country would have happened in South Carolina.\n  Here is the difference: We were all in such a state of shock that \nsomebody could come into a church and just randomly kill the people \nthey prayed with. It was hard to get our heads around the thought of \nsomebody being able to do that. But what woke us up was the way the \nfamilies behaved.\n  Senator Scott indicated that within 48 hours of the killing, there \nwas an arraignment of the accused, and all the family members appeared \nin court. Instead of taking to the streets and showing their \nfrustration with a system that I am sure can always be made better and \nis far from perfect, they decided to channel their grief into something \nconstructive, not destructive, and I promise you I could not have done \nthis. If this had been one of my family members, I know Lindsey Graham \nwell enough to know I could not have done this. I consider myself \nperson of faith but lacking when it comes to folks at Mother Emanuel \nAME Church. Nadine Collier, the daughter of Ethel Lance, who was 70 \nyears old, said the following, as her voice was breaking:\n\n       You took something very precious from me. I will never talk \n     to her again. I will never, ever hold her again. But I \n     forgive you. And have mercy on your soul.\n\n  That is what is different. That is why the people of South Carolina \nfollowed her lead. She and the victims touched our hearts. They \nappealed to our better nature and reminded us of what humanity is all \nabout. It is about love and forgiveness. Politicians--we can take all \nthe credit we want, but if these people had not done this, it would \nhave been a different result. I could have talked until I was blue in \nthe face. If people had chosen to be angry, there was no way in hell I \ncould have talked them into not being angry because they have every \nright to be angry. But because these people did what they did in open \ncourt, the rest of us followed behind and followed their lead.\n  A year later I am here to tell you that the reason South Carolina \nhandled this so well, in my view, is that the people in that church \nchartered a path for the rest of us, and we were smart enough to follow \ntheir lead. It would be nice if, in the future, when we get mad at each \nother here in this body and other places throughout the country over \nsomething maybe not as important as losing a loved one, we could slow \ndown for just a moment and try to imagine how things would be different \nif we could draw upon the example of the families of the fallen.\n  Look what we argue about. Look how we interact in America today over \nthings not quite as significant as having your loved one gunned down. \nIf you really want to honor what happened in South Carolina, as an \nindividual and a society, whenever you can, remember what the people in \nthat church did after losing their loved ones, and try to follow their \nlead. That would be the greatest respect you could pay to those \nfamilies and the greatest honor you could give to those who died for no \ngood reason.\n  I need to follow my own advice. There is no better feeling in the \nworld than being petty and thinking of a reason you were wronged. It \nfeels good. But every now and then I catch myself. I go back to last \nyear and wake up and realize that there is a better way.\n  To those who showed us that better way, I know your pain is as real \nas it was on the day this happened. I know you will never get over it, \nbut I hope you realize that your loved ones did not die in vain \nbecause, through their tragic deaths, you gave us--not just in South \nCarolina but throughout the world--the way forward. Whether we choose \nit or not is up to us. You have done all you could do and then some.\n  To the people of South Carolina: I am proud of the way we handled \nthis tragedy, but we have a long way to go. This weekend will be tough \nthroughout our State, and as we look back, let's make sure that we \nlearn from the past and apply it to the future. If we can take that \nlove and forgiveness and apply it in a constructive way to future \nproblems in South Carolina, then we will have honored these victims and \ntheir families. If we go back to our petty ways, they will have died \nfor nothing.\n  Here is my bet: South Carolina is never going to go back because the \npeople of Mother Emanuel AME Church showed us the way. It is up to us \nto follow them, and I will do my best to follow their lead.\n  To the people throughout the country who have been generous to this \nchurch, thank you for the dollars that have been raised. It is \nappreciated. Thank you for your prayers and the support you have given. \nIt was essential. You helped us in our time of greatest need.\n  On behalf of the people of South Carolina to the people of this great \nland, thank you for having us in your prayers and for your support and \nfor being there for us a year ago when we needed you the most.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                               PIPES Act\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, this week I was pleased that the Senate \nacted unanimously to pass a pipeline safety bill that will help ensure \nthe safety of our Nation's vast energy pipeline network.\n  The bipartisan bill, known as the PIPES Act of 2016, now heads to the \nPresident's desk to be signed into law. Safely transporting energy to \nour communities and businesses is a goal that we all share. It was \nencouraging to see my colleagues come together on both sides of the \naisle and on both sides of the Capitol, as well, to come up with a \nfinal product that will improve pipeline safety and oversight.\n  With more than 2.6 million miles of oil and gas pipelines across this \nNation, the energy industry must work together at all levels of \ngovernment in order to protect lives, communities, and our environment. \nPipelines can be one of the safest ways to move oil and gas products; \nhowever, we have seen\n\n[[Page S4287]]\n\ntruly devastating explosions and spills with pipelines, including in my \nhome State of Michigan. The cost to clean up an oil spill from a \npipeline break near Marshall, MI, into the Kalamazoo River has totaled \nover $1.2 billion. A similar spill in the Great Lakes would be \ndevastating to our economy, environment, and drinking water supply.\n  The transition to a clean energy economy is one of my top priorities, \nbut in the meantime, as we push this transition forward, we cannot \naccept that pipeline spills are simply the cost of doing business. Our \nsafety regulators must be equipped with the tools and equipment to \nbetter prevent pipeline accidents, protect public safety, and demand \naccountability when things invariably go wrong.\n  Our pipeline transportation system must be more transparent, and \ntechnology will continue to provide better insight into the pipeline \nnetwork without compromising national security and proprietary \ninformation. Our land, air, water, and wildlife must be safeguarded \nagainst leaks and spills. By enhancing safety standards, we can reduce \nwaste and cleanup costs while making sure we can proudly pass down a \nstrong outdoor heritage to the next generation. We can also create jobs \nfor our construction workers, pipefitters, steelworkers, and utility \nworkers as we upgrade pipelines and fit them with state-of-the-art \ntechnology.\n  The PIPES Act will make strides in these and many other areas. I was \nespecially focused on creating measures to safeguard against the \ncatastrophic consequences of an oil spill in our precious waterways, \nespecially the Great Lakes. Thanks to a provision I originally worked \non with my colleague Senator Stabenow, the entire Great Lakes Basin \nwill be designated as an unusually sensitive area. This will make any \npipeline that could spill in and around the Great Lakes area subject to \nhigher standards for operating safety. The bill also adds coastal \nbeaches and maritime coastal waters as areas that should be considered \nwhen making an ``unusually sensitive'' determination.\n\n  We also must recognize the unique regional challenges our Nation's \nfar-reaching pipeline network present. In Michigan, we get serious \nwinters. Lakes and rivers freeze, and even the Great Lakes end up under \nvery thick ice cover. To address these challenges, I worked to include \na provision requiring pipeline operators to prepare response plans that \naddress cleanup of an oilspill in ice-covered waters. The Coast Guard \nhas stated that it does not have the technology or the capacity for \nworst-case discharge cleanup under solid ice and that its response \nactivities are not adequate in ice-choked waters. We need to address \nthis problem now before a spill under ice-covered water happens.\n  Any oil pipeline that is deeper than 150 feet underwater will be \nrequired to undergo an inspection every year as a result of this bill. \nThis requirement would be especially relevant for pipelines running \nthrough the Great Lakes, especially the twin oil pipelines resting on \nthe lakebed in the Straits of Mackinac. The bill also establishes \nemergency order authority so that PHMSA can take quick action to ensure \nsafety when pipelines pose an imminent threat.\n  This bill goes beyond just addressing pipelines; it also directs the \nDepartment of Transportation to issue minimum safety standards for \nunderground natural gas storage facilities. The dangers of a leak from \nan underground storage facility was illustrated in a massive methane \nleak at a facility in California just a few short months ago which \nresulted in evacuations and an emergency declaration. These new \nstandards are especially important for my home State of Michigan \nbecause we have more underground natural gas storage facilities than \nalmost any other State in the Union.\n  Other sections of the PIPES Act encourage collaboration on research, \ndevelopment, mapping, and technology between Federal agencies, public \nstakeholders, and industry leaders. All of these constituencies were \nkey to providing input into this bill.\n  I would like to thank Senators Fischer, Booker, and Daines, and of \ncourse Chairman Thune and Ranking Member Nelson for their hard work on \nthe PIPES Act. The Energy and Commerce Committee and the Committee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure in the House were also instrumental \nin making changes and important improvements.\n  As we continue to move forward and find better ways to meet our \nenergy needs, it is my hope that we can learn from past catastrophes \nand prevent future ones before they ever occur.\n  The bipartisan PIPES Act can be a model for how we work together to \nimprove performance and raise our standards in the energy sector.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/16/senate-section/article/S4285-1"}, {"day": "16", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4287-S4288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOVERING MISSING CHILDREN ACT\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Recovering Missing \nChildren Act. This bill provides law enforcement with an important tool \nto help find missing or exploited children.\n  Each year more than 200,000 children are abducted by their parents or \nother close relatives, according to the National Center for Missing & \nExploited Children. In many of these cases, the IRS has information \nthat could aid law enforcement in locating a child who has been \nabducted by a family member.\n  A study by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration \nfound that in more than a third of the cases reviewed, the IRS has tax \nreturns on file which used the Social Security number of a missing \nchild. Of those, 46 percent had a new address on file, for a 13.4-\npercent total. However, the IRS cannot share this protected, \nconfidential information with law enforcement officials since the Tax \nCode prevents the IRS from sharing the information unless specifically \nauthorized as an exception to nondisclosure.\n  Senator Enzi and Senator Klobuchar and I have introduced bipartisan \nlegislation, the Recovering Missing Children Act, to aid in the \nrecovery of missing children by providing a new tool to help law \nenforcement officials locate missing children and their alleged \nabductors. The bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to permit the \ndisclosure of relevant tax information explicitly for the purpose of \naiding criminal investigations into missing or exploited children. \nSpecifically, the act ensures that select taxpayer information will \nonly be released to law enforcement officials as part of a legitimate \ninvestigation or a judicial proceeding under the orders of a Federal \njudge.\n  The act amends the law to allow for Federal law enforcement to share \ninformation on a limited basis with State and local law enforcement \nthat are part of the team directly involved in investigating and \nprosecuting such cases. Many investigations into missing and exploited \nchildren are conducted at the State and local level.\n  The act provides a commonsense fix that maintains an existing balance \nbetween taxpayer privacy and judicious release of information that will \nmake a meaningful difference to a child's safety. For the families who \nare affected, the reality that their child is missing is devastating. \nIf there is a step we can take to increase the likelihood that the \nmissing child will be returned home, then we have an obligation to act. \nThis is such a step.\n  I proudly have worked with both Senators Klobuchar and Enzi on this \nimportant issue since 2011, and I am glad to have the endorsement of \nboth the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children and the \nNational Association of Police Organizations.\n  If the provisions in this bill can bring one child back to their \nrightful families safe and sound, it is worth it. This will assist \nthose who have been searching and spending sleepless nights worried \nabout their missing children and do it in a way that doesn't undermine \nAmericans' privacy.\n  With that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 3209 and the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n\n[[Page S4288]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3209) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to permit the disclosure of certain tax return \n     information for the purpose of missing or exploited children \n     investigations.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. CASEY. I further ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a \nthird time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made \nand laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3209) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n  Mr. CASEY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate all who have worked \non this bill but particularly Senator Casey's leadership and Senator \nKlobuchar's leadership on this issue that just passed.\n  Here is a terrible thought: Every year, thousands of children are \nabducted and taken away from their homes. This bill provides new tools \nto connect missing and exploited children with their families, while \nalso respecting important and appropriate safeguards of taxpayer \nprivacy.\n  Senators Casey, Klobuchar, and I have worked together on this matter \nfor several years. We worked with outside groups such as the National \nCenter for Missing & Exploited Children and the National Association of \nPolice Organizations, and we are proud that both organizations have \nendorsed this legislation.\n  With new tools and better collaboration between Federal and State \nauthorities, law enforcement agencies can send a strong signal to those \nwho are perpetrating this type of crime. I hope this act will help law \nenforcement officials solve these cases more quickly for the benefit of \nthe youth who have been exploited.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues \nSenator Casey from Pennsylvania and Senator Enzi from Wyoming to speak \nin support of our bipartisan legislation, the Recovering Missing \nChildren Act, something we have been working on for so long.\n  I remember hearing about this in a Judiciary Committee hearing and \nlearning about the surprising number of cases that can be solved when \nthis information from the IRS is shared with law enforcement. It sounds \nalmost absurd that information is sitting in government files of where \na child who has been abducted is living, but in fact it is. Oftentimes \nthe abductor claims the child on taxes or has their address on their \ntaxes and it is as easy as looking at a file. A family can be reunited, \nand a child who wasn't supposed to be taken from their home can be \nbrought back to their home.\n  As my colleagues have noted, our bill would give law enforcement \nofficers important tools to solve some of the most heartbreaking cases. \nTo accomplish this, the bill will offer information sharing by Federal \nlaw enforcement officers on a limited basis. It was something we \ndiscussed at length in the Judiciary Committee, and I know we also \ndiscussed it in the Finance Committee with the State and local law \nenforcement officials who are involved in the investigation and \nprosecution of a case. Under current law, the IRS is barred from \nsharing its taxpayer information with local law enforcement, even \nthough in many cases the IRS actually has the location of the child. \nImagine a hardworking local police officer out trying to find a kid, \nlooking everywhere, following up on every lead, and our own government \nhas the information in their files. This is a narrow exception that \nallows this information to be shared.\n  As a former prosecutor, I know firsthand that returning missing \nchildren to their families is one of the most important tasks law \nenforcement officers have, and they need every resource available to do \ntheir job. The faster law enforcement can locate the child, the greater \nthe likelihood the child can be returned to their family unharmed, and \nthey can go on to live a normal life.\n  I do want to mention one person who has been someone I talk to about \nmissing and exploited children issues, and that is Patty Wetterling \nfrom the State of Minnesota. There was a horrible case in which her son \nJacob was abducted years and years ago and never found. She served as \nthe chair on the board of the missing and exploited children group. She \nhas done so much work nationally and locally. While we don't believe \nthis would have helped in Jacob's case, she did it for all those other \nchildren who are still out there. So this one is for you, Patty. Thank \nyou.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to offer my heartfelt condolences \nto the victims and the families of the terrorist attack in Orlando. As \na mother, my heart breaks for the parents of the victims. As an \nAmerican, I share in a profound sense of sorrow for the loss of \ninnocent life.\n  Many questions remain unanswered. Did the terrorist communicate with \nforeign terrorist groups? If so, how did they interact and what level \nof support or direction did they provide? What was his path to radical \nIslamism and what lessons can we learn to stop others on this path to \nviolence? Was his association with jihadist groups simply a superficial \none to mask deep personal hatred?\n  In the coming days, investigators will compile evidence to answer \nthese and many other questions. While there is much we do not know \nabout the attacks in Orlando, there are a few very important things we \ndo know. We know 49 people were killed, and 53 others were injured. We \nknow their families are suffering and we grieve with them. We know the \ngay community was specifically targeted. There is something else we \nknow. This attack was brought against innocent people.\n  While knowledge of the specific circumstances of this tragedy will \nhopefully help us improve our efforts to fight terrorism and \nradicalization, for the victims of this horrific attack--indeed, for \nmany Americans--such information can seem irrelevant. This is because \nthe attack is an assault on the age-old Western value of social \npluralism. These are American values--ones we hold dear. These are the \nprinciples which forbid violence on others, no matter how strongly you \nmay disagree with them. This is a basic conviction that unites \nAmericans.\n  We have many disagreements in our country. We have them in this \nChamber, we have them at work, and we have them around the dinner \ntable. Sometimes our words are harsh, sometimes our words are heated, \nbut we don't kill people who disagree with us. We protect their rights \nto think differently. This is a key part of our identity as Americans.\n  The attack in Orlando reminds us that we are in the middle of a \nglobal battle between two ways of life: one of open democracy and one \nof violent jihadism. Our way--the American way--values pluralism. It \npermits dissent from dominant social and political views. It protects \nthe freedom of expression and the freedom of religion. It defends our \nshared human dignity. In our society, the value of your life is not \ndetermined by your views. Here, your life has value because you exist. \nThat is good enough for us.\n  That is not good enough for radical Islam. Its followers do not \nbelieve these things. They impose uniformity and destroy dissent. For \nradical Islamists, there is no ``live and let live.''\n  Their ideology demands obedience. It allows only one way to live your \nlife\n\n[[Page S4289]]\n\nand demands that people who think differently, live differently, or \npray differently stop thinking, living, and praying as they do. Radical \nIslamism does not use words to get what it wants. We observe its \nmethods in Syria through ISIL. There, they stone women and throw men \nfrom buildings for violating their code.\n\n  This contempt for other cultures drives them to destroy historical \nartifacts and ancient holy sites. They are exterminating entire \ncommunities of people for practicing a different set of religious \nbeliefs, and they celebrate it. They are posting gruesome videos of \ntheir heinous acts online. They are using this combination of violence \nand twisted ideology as propaganda. They are seducing disaffected \nindividuals to join their perverse quest.\n  While the extent to which the Orlando shooter was influenced by this \nincitement is unclear, he clearly identified with ISIL's barbaric \nglorification of violence.\n  This is why we must unite to ensure ISIL's lasting defeat. Defeat on \nthe battlefield will greatly diminish the rhetorical power of their \ncalls to butcher, to pillage, and to defile.\n  However, responding to this terror is the shared responsibility of \nall Americans and not reserved only for the military or law \nenforcement. This was an assault on our belief in pluralism, an attack \nagainst each of us. We all have a role in the response. Our law \nenforcement and intelligence communities will no doubt lead the way, \nbut individual Americans can and should answer this attack.\n  I conclude with a call to action for every American, no matter where \nthey may be. Find someone with whom you deeply disagree and let them \nknow you value them. Seek that person out. Tell them you respect them \nfor who they are, regardless of your deeply held differences. We can do \nthis at work or at home, in the grocery store or at the doctor's \noffice. In our day-to-day lives, we can deliver a direct challenge to \nradical Islamists. By treating each other with dignity and respect, we \ncan play our part in responding to this tragedy.\n  Basic human rights, freedom of expression, freedom of religion, and \nfreedom of assembly are endowed to all of us. By asserting our value of \npluralism confidently, we can stand against the forces of hatred and \nintolerance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to recognize Marion Fletcher \nof Hot Springs, AR, as this week's Arkansan of the Week, for 53 years \nof service to agriculture education in Arkansas. Marion recently \nretired, and I would like to take a few moments to recognize his legacy \nand his impact.\n  Arkansas is a rural State, and for Arkansans agriculture isn't just \nan industry. It is a way of life. Over the last five decades, Marion \nhas been a fixture in the Arkansas agriculture community, serving in \ndozens of roles in countless organizations, impacting every person he \nmet.\n  To say he is passionate about agriculture education is an \nunderstatement. Since 1997, Marion worked as the State supervisor and \nprogram manager of agricultural education at the Arkansas Department of \nWorkforce Education, and before that he spent 30 years in numerous \nroles with the Arkansas Department of Education, Vocational and \nTechnical Education Division. He also had a 3-year stint as an ag\n\n[[Page S4291]]\n\ninstructor at Desha Central Schools. Locally, he has been a dedicated \nboard member of the Garland County Farm Bureau for over 30 years.\n  But Marion's service isn't just limited to Arkansas. He has also \nplayed an important role in the National FFA, where he has been a \nmember of the board of directors, served as national treasurer, and has \nbeen a part of various task and action force committees. To quote \nlongtime friend Keith Stokes, ``there is not a young person who went \nthrough the FFA program that was not influenced in a positive way by \nMr. Fletcher.''\n  His hard work hasn't gone unnoticed, and he was honored with the \nfirst-ever National FFA Advisor's Golden Owl Award. He has also \nreceived the FFA VIP Award, recognition in the Arkansas Agriculture \nHall of Fame, Arkansas's ``service to citizens'' award, and a litany of \nothers on a long list of well-deserved commendations.\n  The honors, distinctions, and accolades earned by Marion are endless. \nLike those before me, I am proud to honor Marion's work and legacy. He \nis an outstanding Arkansan, and our State agriculture industry is \nbetter because he committed his life to agriculture education.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the aftermath of the horrific tragedy in \nOrlando, Americans are understandably concerned about whether law \nenforcement and intelligence officials have the tools they need to keep \nour people safe. I share these concerns and have for quite some time.\n  In 2013, I proposed that the government be authorized to obtain \nphone, email, and other records immediately in emergency situations and \nthen after the fact come back for court review. That proposal I made in \n2013 became law as part of the USA FREEDOM Act--it is section 102 of \nthe USA FREEDOM Act--and as of today, that legislation I authored gives \nthe FBI more authority to move immediately when they believe it is \nessential to protect the safety and well-being of Americans and our \nfamilies.\n  I don't take a backseat to anybody when it comes to supporting \nefforts that are going to do everything possible to make Americans \nsafer in their communities. So right now--and this is so often the case \nafter a tragedy--when Americans want to be safer and they want their \nliberties, all too often proposals are advanced that in so many \ninstances don't do much of either.\n  It is for that reason that I have come to the floor to express my \nconcern about the sweeping surveillance amendment that was proposed \nthis morning by the senior Senator from Texas. In my view, it is \nimportant for colleagues to see that this proposal would dramatically \nand unnecessarily expand the government's ability to conduct \nsurveillance of Americans without court oversight.\n  In my judgment, it would not make our country any safer. The real \nimplications are that it could significantly undermine the \nconstitutional rights of law-abiding Americans, largely to save some \npaperwork for law enforcement officials.\n  As was described on the Senate floor this morning, this amendment \nwould authorize individual FBI field offices to demand Americans' email \nand Internet records simply by issuing what is called a national \nsecurity letter, which means there really is no court oversight \nwhatsoever.\n  This authority currently exists for phone records, and law \nenforcement officials have repeatedly suggested that it would be \nconvenient for email and Internet records to be collected in the same \nway. The FBI has not suggested that they are currently unable to obtain \nthese records in counterterror investigations. Law enforcement \nofficials have simply been arguing that it would be more convenient to \noperate without judicial oversight. I find this position very troubling \nbecause I don't see anything in the writings of the Founding Fathers \nthat says convenience alone should justify a dramatic erosion of the \nconstitutional rights of law-abiding Americans.\n  It is important to understand that this sweeping expansion of \nsurveillance authorities is not necessary. If FBI officials have reason \nto suspect an individual is connected to terrorism or espionage, they \nalready have the ability to access that person's email and Internet \nrecords by simply obtaining an order in the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court. These orders can be issued in secret and require \nrelatively little evidence. The FBI just needs to assert that the \nrecords are ``relevant to an investigation,'' and that is not difficult \nto do. But requiring the approval of an independent judge provides an \nimportant chapter against the abuse or misuse of this authority. By \ncontrast, national security letters are not reviewed by a judge unless \na company that receives one attempts to challenge it.\n  As I indicated earlier this afternoon, I appreciate the FBI's \ninterest in obtaining records about potential suspects quickly, but my \nview is that Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judges in the \ntypical situation are very capable of reviewing and approving requests \nfor court orders in a timely fashion, and that is why I made mention of \nit.\n  If the government thinks that there is an emergency situation and \nthat time is so critical, the government can use that section of the \nUSA FREEDOM Act that I authored, Section 102, to obtain records \nimmediately in an emergency situation and then go seek court review \nafter the fact.\n  As I indicated, I have been supportive of this for quite some time, \nbut I think giving the government the authority to move in emergency \nsituations is very different from giving the government substantial new \nsurveillance authority just because some officials don't like doing \npaperwork. If the FBI's own process for reviewing orders is too slow, \nthen the appropriate solution is administrative reforms, not a major \nexpansion of government surveillance authorities.\n  While this amendment would not apply to the text of emails, it would \nallow the FBI a wide variety of information, including records of whom \nindividuals exchange emails with and when, as well as individuals' log-\nin history, IP addresses, and Internet browsing history. This sort of \nsurveillance can clearly reveal an extensive amount of information \nabout individual Americans. Our Founding Fathers rightly argued that \nthese kinds of intrusive searchs ought to be approved by independent \njudges.\n  At this point, I believe it is worth noting that President George W. \nBush's administration reached the same conclusion that I have described \nthis afternoon. In November of 2008, the Justice Department's Office of \nLegal Counsel advised the FBI that national security letters could only \nbe used to obtain certain types of records, and this list did not \ninclude electronic communication records. The FBI has, unfortunately, \nnot adhered to this guidance and has at times continued to issue \nnational security letters for electronic communications records. A \nnumber of companies that have received these overly broad national \nsecurity letters have rightfully challenged them, as I have indicated, \nas improper. Broadening the national security letter statute to include \nelectronic communication transaction records would be a significant \nexpansion of warrantless surveillance authority.\n  Unfortunately, the government's track record with its existing \nnational security letter authorities includes a substantial amount of \nabuse and misuse. These problems were extensively documented by the \nJustice Department's inspector general in 2007, 2008, 2010, and 2014. \nIn my judgment, it would be reckless to expand this particular \nsurveillance authority when the government has so frequently failed to \nuse its existing authorities responsibly.\n  In 2013, President Obama's surveillance review group looked at the \nnational security letter statute. This group included a number of \ndistinguished national security leaders, including former White House \ncounterterrorism adviser Richard Clarke and former Acting CIA Director \nMike Morell. They determined--and I think\n\n[[Page S4292]]\n\nwhat is so noteworthy is that at a time when the President assembled \npractically an NBA All-Star team of counterterror leaders, this group \ndetermined that national security letter authority ought to be \nnarrowed, not expanded. They were making a judgment to counter to the \nsenior Senator from Texas, and they felt they ought to go the other way \nand be more cautious about how it is used.\n  These leading national security officials, the names of whom I have \njust given, stated in their report that national security letters have \nbeen, in their view, highly controversial and noted that there have \nbeen ``serious compliance issues on the part of the government.'' They \nconcluded the following: ``For all the well-established reasons for \nrequiring neutral and detached judges to decide when government \ninvestigators may invade an individual's privacy''--their words and not \nmine--``there is a strong argument that [national security letters] \nshould not be issued by the FBI.''\n  National security letters was what the description of the issue was \nall about. In the judgment of these experts, the government should seek \nthe approval of a judge the way our Founding Fathers intended.\n  I want it understood that I would strongly oppose the surveillance \namendment filed this morning. My view is that it would erode our core \nconstitutional rights without making our country safer.\n  All over the country right now, Americans are asking what can be done \nto make our country safer. This morning, for example, we had the CIA \nDirector, Mr. Brennan, in the Intelligence Committee, and I pointed out \nthat one of the things that help Americans be as safe as possible is \nstrong encryption for their smartphones. Those smartphones have \npeople's different transactions, such as medical and financial \ninformation. Their whole life is in those smartphones. If you weaken \nstrong encryption and require companies--as several of our colleagues \nwant to do--to build back doors into these digital products, Americans \nare going to be less safe.\n  For example, a number of the smartphones have a location tracker so \nparents can keep tabs on their youngster. Well, if you weaken \nencryption and weaken the location tracker, you are pretty much giving \na gift to pedophiles because it will be easy to track youngsters as a \nresult of weakening encryption.\n\n  We had a discussion about it this morning. The comment I was \nconcerned about in particular this morning was when I said ``Hey, if we \nweaken encryption in the United States, the reality is that terrorists, \nhackers, and others will go overseas, where there are hundreds of \nproducts with strong encryption,'' it was the view of the CIA Director \nthat that was ``theoretical.'' So I was forced to correct that later in \nthe course of the day to say that some of the leading experts in cyber \nsecurity said that this is not theoretical.\n  The reality is that there are hundreds of products overseas with \nstrong encryption. So think about that one. What we would be doing if \nwe weakened encryption is we would be adopting a policy that would \nleave our people less secure and their liberties more at risk right at \nthe time when they are saying, after the horrific tragedy in Orlando, \nthat they want better policies to promote their safety and make sure \ntheir liberties are kept.\n  This is a debate we are going to have in several forms. We will have \nthem in committee rooms and on the floor of the Senate. I just want it \nunderstood that the reason I am opposing what the senior Senator from \nTexas talked about today is that I think it flies right in the face of \nwhat I have described. It does nothing to make us safer, and it puts \nour liberties at risk, much as the distinguished panel that was put \ntogether by the President--all these outstanding counterterror \nofficials--said when they expressed concern about the whole future of \nnational security letters.\n  There is a way to do this right, and I would submit that is what we \ndid in Section 102 of the USA FREEDOM Act. It was something I had \ntalked about with the President on several occasions. I am willing to \nsay what I said but not what the President said.\n  I have repeatedly said to the government that if the government \ndoesn't have enough authority in emergency situations to protect the \nAmerican people, I will use my ability as a senior member of the \nIntelligence Committee to make sure they have that authority. We did \nthat in the USA FREEDOM Act. The government can move immediately to \ncollect phone and email records and then come back later to go through \nthe court review process. That is the kind of model we ought to use, \nnot what we heard about this morning from the senior Senator from Texas \nthat would expand government surveillance authority, put our liberties \nat risk, and not make our country safer.\n  I am sure this will be a topic of extensive discussion on the Senate \nfloor next week. I just wanted to take this opportunity to outline my \nviews on the topic.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/16/senate-section/article/S4291-1"}, {"day": "16", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4292-S4293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I am coming to the floor today to join so \nmany of my colleagues who have spoken over the last day to encourage \nbipartisan cooperation on commonsense legislation to address the gun \nviolence epidemic that plagues our Nation and my home State of \nDelaware. I want to thank my colleagues, Senators Murphy and \nBlumenthal, for their consistent and unwavering commitment in \naddressing this very real national crisis.\n  In the aftermath of the tragic mass shooting of Orlando, I have been \nfilled with many emotions, as have so many of my colleagues--grief for \nthe victims and their families, concern for the city of Orlando, grief \nfor the greater LGBTQ community across our Nation and world, anger \ntoward the perpetrator and the extremists who spread hatred, violence, \nand fear around the world, and a powerful, deep-seated frustration that \nour government, our Congress, this Senate, has not taken needed steps \nto keep dangerous and unstable individuals from getting access to guns. \nThe atrocity that took place at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, FL, was \nmore than just a cowardly act of terrorism and a despicable, violent \nrampage of hate against our LGBTQ brothers and sisters; it was also an \nattack on the very freedoms in our way of life. From the brave first \nresponders and law enforcement officers who rushed to the scene, to the \nhundreds, even thousands, of Floridians who lined up in the days since \nto donate blood, tragedies like these so often showcase the very best \nand worst of humanity in the same heartbreaking moment.\n  This mass shooting--the worst mass shooting in American history--\nshould force us to confront a number of powerful but unanswered \nquestions: Are we going to be a nation that celebrates our diversity or \none that stokes fear, division, and hatred? Are we going to engage the \nAmerican Muslim community in pursuing our shared goal of defeating the \nscourge of terrorism, or are we going to malign and alienate 1.6 \nbillion people from one of the world's great religions? Are we together \ngoing to pass commonsense safety measures addressing gun violence, or \nis this Senate, yet again, going to accept the status quo?\n  Our Nation, my State, my constituents, my neighbors, are crying out \nfor the Members of this body to have the courage of our convictions and \nto address this moment. Regardless of the Orlando attacker's intentions \nor his background, Congress must act to prevent known or suspected \nterrorists from having the unfettered ability to purchase high-powered \nmilitary grade weaponry. That means ensuring that we have a universal \nsystem of background checks when a firearm is purchased. It also means \nensuring that the U.S. Department of Justice gets notified when a known \nor suspected terrorist goes to buy a gun so that the Department can \ninvestigate or stop a transaction that might immediately endanger \ncitizens' lives.\n  Today an estimated 40 percent of all gun sales are sold by unlicensed \ndealers who are not required to conduct any\n\n[[Page S4293]]\n\ncriminal background checks under Federal law. In the aftermath of the \natrocity in Orlando, Deputy Attorney General Yates noted that the \nJustice Department ``would have liked to have known'' that Omar Mateen \nhad gone to purchase an assault rifle.\n  Our Constitution protects the fundamental individual right to bear \narms, but no freedom is absolute, and no one amendment can subvert all \nthe others. Orlando deserved to have the security of a functioning \nuniversal background check system that keeps guns out of the hands of \npeople known to be dangerous. So, too, do the people of my hometown of \nWilmington.\n  Earlier this week, late Tuesday night, in my hometown of Wilmington, \nless than a block away from a business owned by one of my treasured \nstaff members, four young teenagers, ages 12, 13, 15, and 16, were \nshot. The 15-year-old boy remains in critical condition in Christiana \nHospital. He was shot in the stomach, hand, and leg.\n  Earlier this week in Wilmington, a 15-year-old girl was shot during \nan argument at a party. There have been so many instances of gun \nviolence on the streets of my hometown in the weeks and months of this \nyear, last year, and the year before that we have become numb to it. We \nhave almost lost count of them. Yet this daily carnage continues in my \nhometown and in towns all across this country.\n  Orlando deserves the amount of attention it has received as one of \nthe worst mass American atrocities occurring in history. Yet we cannot \nforget the week-in and week-out tragedies where one, two, and three \nindividuals are shot in what now seems to be, sadly, routine gun \nviolence all across this country.\n  We have heard in speeches given by my colleagues about incidents all \nover our country. From Orlando to San Bernardino to Newtown, from \nWilmington to Chicago to Los Angeles, Americans fall victim to gun \nviolence each and every day. It doesn't have to be this way.\n  Americans are 25 times more likely to be murdered with a gun than \npeople in any other developed country. We can and we must do more to \nprevent senseless acts of gun violence.\n  So today, this week, we mourn the lives taken from us too soon in \nOrlando, and I mourn and many of my neighbors and constituents mourn \nthe lives lost in Wilmington. But we all pray that the families and \nfriends grieving the loss of their loved ones will find strength and \npurpose in the days to come and will bring encouragement from actions \nby this Senate.\n  Tragedies like these don't just draw our attention, don't just hold \nour gaze, and don't just break our hearts; they also challenge our \nvalues as a nation. In response to the atrocities in Orlando, America's \nmessage to the world must not be one of fear and anger and isolation as \nsome propose. Instead, I think we can and should take action to protect \nall of our citizens of any ethnicity, any faith, and any sexual \norientation with commonsense gun legislation. I am encouraged to know \nthere have been filed bills that this body will take up and act upon \nnext week and that my colleagues, Senators Murphy and Feinstein, have \nbeen able to submit for consideration by this body--bills relating to \nbackground checks and to closing the terror gap that I look forward to \nsupporting next week when we return.\n  I would like to thank all of my colleagues of both parties who have \nadvanced proposals or have come to the floor to participate in an \nimportant effort to show the people across the country that we can work \nacross the aisle, that we can listen to each other, and that we can, I \nhope, legislate.\n  I specifically thank my colleague Senator Murphy for his discipline, \nhis engagement, and his work in an important filibuster to show the \npeople of our country that we are listening, we are paying attention, \nwe are working, and we will soon take action.\n  With that, I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/16/senate-section/article/S4292-1"}, {"day": "16", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4293-S4294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING MARY D. FERGUSON\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to share with my colleagues the \nvery sad news that Mary D. Ferguson, a legendary Kentucky journalist \nand a good friend of mine, has passed away. She departed this life last \nThursday, June 9, in the town of Hopkinsville, KY, at the age of 82. \nShe will be remembered and greatly missed by her family, many friends, \nand journalists throughout the Commonwealth.\n  Mary was a pioneer as a female journalist in an era when women were \nnot expected to enter that profession, but she did not let that deter \nher from doing what she had dreamed of since childhood. She got her \nfirst job in journalism when she was a freshman in college, working as \nthe society editor at the Clarksville Leaf-Chronicle.\n  She also served as the news director for a Hopkinsville radio \nstation, WHOP, before being hired as a reporter by the Kentucky New Era \nin 1962. There she remained for more than 50 years--as a reporter, \ncolumnist, and eventually as an unofficial historian for the region and \nfount of institutional knowledge for the newspaper. By the time she \npassed away, of course, she had been working there since before most of \nher coworkers were born.\n  Mary touched the lives of thousands in Kentucky and beyond with her \nwork for the New Era. Her stories gave voice to the people of her \ncommunity, and she brought events of the world home for her readers. In \ncovering events at Fort Campbell, KY, she wrote about Presidents \nspanning from Lyndon Johnson to George W. Bush. She covered \ngubernatorial inaugurations, crime, the courts, elections, and the \narts.\n  I got to know Mary back when I was first elected to statewide office. \nShe interviewed me and was a part of editorial board meetings, which I \nfrequently held with the New Era. Mary was a rarity in the fact that \nshe was one of the few journalists who leaned Republican, although she \nalways kept her reporting balanced. I certainly appreciated her support \nand encouragement throughout the years and grew to have great \nadmiration and respect for this woman who was not afraid to chart her \nown path.\n  Mary was the heart of the New Era newspaper and will be deeply missed \nby her colleagues and the hundreds of journalists who passed through \nthat publication's offices over the five decades of her tenure. The \npaper established in 2005 the Mary D. Ferguson Award, given annually to \nthe employee most committed to the quality of the newspaper. That \ntradition will continue after her death.\n  Kentucky has lost one of its leading lights in journalism, and I have \nlost a friend. Elaine and I want to express our deepest condolences to \nMary's family. She is survived by her husband, retired Kentucky State \nPolice Trooper Russell Ferguson, her daughter Lee Ellen Ferguson Fish, \nand two grandchildren. Along with the Hopkinsville community, we stand \nby the Ferguson family and support them in their time of grief.\n  The newspaper Mary Ferguson wrote for for 54 years, the New Era, \npublished a remarkable article detailing her life and career. I ask \nunanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Kentucky New Era, June 10, 2016]\n\n         Trailblazing Journalist, Mary D. Ferguson, Dies at 82\n\n                         (By Jennifer P. Brown)\n\n       Hopkinsville, KY.--Mary D. Ferguson, a Kentucky New Era \n     staff writer and columnist who covered stories about farmers, \n     housewives, Army generals, American presidents and much more \n     in a career lasting more than 50 years, died Thursday morning \n     at a Hopkinsville nursing home. She was 82.\n       A native of Trenton and longtime resident of Pembroke Road, \n     she lived just a few miles from the newspaper. She is \n     survived by her husband, retired Kentucky State Police \n     Trooper Russell Ferguson, and their daughter, Lee Ellen \n     Ferguson Fish.\n       Ferguson was a trailblazer for women in news reporting.\n       A 1952 graduate of Trenton High School in Todd County, she \n     moved to Clarksville when she started college at Austin Peay \n     State University. In the spring of her freshman year, she \n     applied for the society editor's job at the Clarksville Leaf-\n     Chronicle newspaper\n\n[[Page S4294]]\n\n     and was hired on the spot. Years later, she said she was \n     shocked to get the job, but she stayed with the newspaper \n     until a year after she graduated.\n       She then became the news director for WHOP. Walking from \n     store to store in downtown Hopkinsville, she delivered the \n     radio station's daily Shell-O-Gram, a promotional flyer for \n     Shell Oil that featured news headlines of the day. The radio \n     station, which was on South Virginia Street, had a mobile \n     unit set up in a station wagon, and Ferguson also broadcast \n     live stories from the field.\n       The New Era hired her on February 5, 1962, to cover crime, \n     courts and Fort Campbell. She was the first female reporter \n     in the newsroom.\n       Although the paper's owners had recruited her, it took a \n     while for the men in the newsroom to accept Ferguson. \n     Reminiscing last fall about her start at the New Era, she \n     remembered how her news judgment and writing style were \n     frequently criticized early on. Things began to shift in her \n     favor one day when a local judge publicly praised one of her \n     stories.\n       Ferguson was on a first-name basis with several commanding \n     generals, and their family members, at Fort Campbell. She \n     also covered Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson, Jimmy Carter, \n     Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. \n     Bush at Fort Campbell or nearby communities. She filed \n     stories from the inaugurations of two Kentucky governors, \n     Edward T. ``Ned'' Breathitt and Louie B. Nunn.\n       She loved the arts and was granted a back-stage interview \n     with the opera singer Marian Anderson at Fish University in \n     Nashville. Ferguson was so overcome with appreciation that \n     she broke down and cried as she approached the celebrity.\n       As a general assignment reporter, Ferguson wrote a wide \n     range of stories, including murder investigations, businesses \n     opening and closing, fatal crashes, hospital expansions, \n     lawsuits, tobacco auctions, elections, floods, fires, high \n     school graduations, concerts and the deaths of many friends.\n       Ferguson was among the New Era reporting team that covered \n     the aftermath of the Gander, Newfoundland, crash in December \n     1985 that killed 248 soldiers headed back to Fort Campbell \n     after a six-month deployment to the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt. \n     She was at Fort Campbell the day President Ronald Reagan and \n     first lady Nancy Reagan came to the post to console the \n     families.\n       She rejected the idea of ever retiring, although she did \n     eventually scale back her hours and devoted her time mainly \n     to writing daily obituaries and a popular human-interest \n     column that ran on Saturdays. Even when cancer treatments \n     made it difficult for her to type, she continued to dictate a \n     weekly column to another staff member.\n       She was rare among journalists with a career spanning more \n     than 60 years at two newspapers and the radio station.\n       No one working in the New Era's newsroom today had been \n     born when Ferguson started working for the paper at its old \n     offices in downtown Hopkinsville. She experienced numerous \n     changes in the newspaper industry. She gave up her typewriter \n     for computers but never really accepted the internet as a \n     useful tool.\n       New Era Publisher Taylor Hayes said he thought of Ferguson \n     as the newspaper's ``matriarch.'' Employees counted on her \n     frank opinion and advice.\n       ``This classy lady provided such a footing to our company, \n     particularly in the newsroom, and her absence cannot be \n     easily grasped,'' Hayes said. ``She was a rock.''\n       Ferguson drove a red Cadillac, voted Republican, loved big \n     friendly dogs, fed bread to fat squirrels in her yard, \n     laughed often, cooked like a pro and remembered names and old \n     tales that others forgot. She missed restaurants like \n     Charlie's Steakhouse and Bartholomew's when they closed. She \n     was partial to the Whistle Stop's chocolate glazed doughnuts. \n     Sushi and egg rolls were not her thing.\n       She wore tailored dresses, cardigan sweaters, high heels \n     and pearls to work. When the newsroom eventually went smoke-\n     free, she took her cigarette breaks wearing a mink coat on \n     the newspaper's loading dock, where she was likely to collect \n     a few story ideas from the pressmen or a truck driver.\n       While the newsroom became younger and increasingly reliant \n     on the internet, she packed her desk drawers with old city \n     directories, history books and paper files. She could put her \n     hands on a photograph of an old general before a young editor \n     could even begin the search on Google.\n       No one covering news in Hopkinsville today--not at the \n     newspaper and not at any of the radio stations--could match \n     her institutional knowledge of people and events that shaped \n     southern Pennyrile communities over the past 80 years.\n       ``There are a rare class of people who, when they come into \n     your life, however it may be, you just feel lucky to have \n     known them,'' Editor Eli Pace said. ``Mary D. was tough as \n     nails, classy beyond description and just wonderful--and I \n     was lucky.''\n       She was opinionated too. Once, when a new editor announced \n     that the New Era would begin re-running obituaries every time \n     the newspaper or a funeral home made a mistake because \n     readers liked to clip them out for family records, Ferguson \n     snapped, ``What are we, a newspaper or a scrapbook company?''\n       Ferguson, who sometimes prayed for friends and co-workers \n     from her front porch swing in the evening, believed that her \n     best writing at the New Era came in a Christmas Eve column \n     she wrote about her father's dairy barn.\n       The column included this: ``My memories were born in a \n     stable located on a hill just north of Trenton near the Todd-\n     Christian county line.

Mr. President, for the past 3 years, David Medine has \nserved as chairman of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, \nPCLOB--the first chairman finally to be confirmed after Congress \nreestablished the PCLOB as an independent agency and strengthened its \nauthority. Under his leadership, the PCLOB has worked diligently to \nreview surveillance programs and make recommendations to protect \nindividual privacy and civil liberties. Mr. Medine recently announced \nthat he will be leaving government service to join a nonprofit \norganization that serves low-income and disadvantaged individuals. He \nwill be missed.\n  Mr. Medine was confirmed at a critical time, just a month before the \nfirst Snowden revelations in June 2013. In response to reports that the \nNSA had been collecting Americans' phone records in bulk for years \nunder section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, he guided the PCLOB's work in \nreviewing that program and releasing a comprehensive report in January \n2014. The recommendations in that landmark report included ending the \nbulk collection of Americans' phone records, installing an amicus at \nthe FISA Court, and instituting a number of other privacy protections. \nMany of these recommendations were subsequently enacted into law in the \nbipartisan USA FREEDOM Act of 2015.\n  Under Mr. Medine's leadership, the PCLOB also released a detailed \nunclassified report in July 2014 on surveillance conducted pursuant to \nsection 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which is \nslated to expire at the end of next year. This report includes a \nvaluable unclassified explanation of the implementation of section 702. \nThese reports and Mr. Medine's related testimony before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee have been tremendously beneficial to Congress and \nthe American people in examining government surveillance programs.\n  Mr. Medine's public service spans more than 20 years. Over the course \nof his career, he has earned a reputation as a thoughtful and well-\nrespected authority on privacy and data security issues. I commend Mr. \nMedine for his dedicated public service and efforts to protect the \nprivacy and civil liberties of the American people, and I wish him well \nin this new chapter.\n  (At the request of Mr. Burr, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/16/senate-section/article/S4294-1"}, {"day": "16", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n Mr. RUBIO.

Mr. President, I wish to enter into a colloquy with my \ncolleague from Arizona.\n  The National Defense Authorization Act which the Senate passed this \nweek is the most critical piece of legislation for our national \nsecurity that we debate each year, and I thank my colleague from \nArizona, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, for his hard \nwork on this legislation.\n  One important provision that should be in the final NDAA is the \nelevation of\n\n[[Page S4295]]\n\nCyber Command. Cyber warfare is taking place every day. It is a domain \nof war that our Nation must dominate just as we do on land, at sea, and \nin the air. At the rate electronic warfare is growing, I believe \nelevating Cyber Command to a combatant command is vital to ensuring \nthat the United States is fully prepared for cyber warfare and has \nunparalleled capabilities in that domain.\n  Does my colleague from Arizona feel the same?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I strongly agree with my friend from \nMontana.\n  Elevating Cyber Command is one of the most critical pieces to \nensuring our Nation is at the forefront of the rising threats abroad. \nEarlier this year in the Armed Services Committee, I held a hearing on \nCyber Command. I was told by the commander of Cyber Command, ADM Mike \nRodgers, that this elevation would make them faster, generating better \nmission outcomes. These are the individuals we have leading the fight \nagainst ISIS on the newly established online battlefield--better \nmission outcomes is something we need.\n  At a time when we are also debating what the entire combatant command \nstructure should look like, one thing is clear: Cyber is growing, and \nits command structure needs to grow as well. I look forward to ensuring \nthis debate is settled in conference and Cyber Command is elevated to a \ncombatant command.\n  Does my colleague from Montana agree?\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I do share my colleague from Arizona's \ncommitment to elevate Cyber Command to a combatant command in \nconference. The House NDAA includes a provision to elevate Cyber \nCommand, and I stand with eight bipartisan Members of the Senate, \nincluding my colleague from Arizona, who support this effort. It is \nparamount that the final fiscal year 2017 NDAA that goes to the \nPresident's desk includes this provision.\n  Can my colleague from Arizona further describe the value that \nelevating Cyber Command would bring?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, for years, our enemies have been setting \nthe norms of behavior in cyber space while the White House sat idly by \nhoping the problem will fix itself. With the elevation of Cyber \nCommand, we are able to ensure we set ourselves on the right course for \nthis new form of warfare. And we will do it without creating a hollow \nforce. Just as it would be unacceptable to send a soldier to battle \nwithout a rifle, it is unacceptable to deprive our cyber forces the \nbasic tools they need to execute their missions. We must remain \ncommitted to ensuring Cyber Command has the authority, the funding, and \nthe tools it needs to succeed.\n  I look forward to the continued work on this issue with my colleague \nfrom Montana and to working in conference to ensure this elevation. I \nunderstand my colleague from Montana has ensured the Defense \nappropriations legislation complements our efforts in cyber command.\n  Can you elaborate on your efforts?\n  Mr. DAINES. My colleague from Arizona is correct. My provisions in \nthe Defense appropriations legislation states that the Department of \nDefense has the funding needed to elevate Cyber Command to a combatant \ncommand this year. We cannot wait for our enemies to outmaneuver us on \nthis new battlefield. Elevating Cyber Command to a combatant command is \none of the best ways we can ensure our troops have the authority they \nneed to succeed.\n  I want to thank my colleague from Arizona for his commitment to a \ncontinued effort on the elevation of Cyber Command and thank him for \nhis continued hard work on behalf of the men and women of our Armed \nForces.\n  (At the request of Mr. Durbin, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/16/senate-section/article/S4294-3"}, {"day": "16", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask consent to have printed in \nthe Record an article from June 15, 2016, in the Huffington Post, \nregarding the Orlando shooting and the urgent need for the Senate to \ntake action on gun control.\n  The material follows:\n\n                  [The Huffington Post, June 15, 2016]\n\n      On Gun Violence--Let's Come Together and Stop the Heartbreak\n\n   (By Senator Barbara Boxer, Ranking Member, Senate Environment and \n                        Public Works Committee)\n\n       Columbine. Virginia Tech. Fort Hood. Tucson. Aurora. \n     Newtown. Navy Yard. Isla Vista. Charleston. Umpqua. Colorado \n     Springs. San Bernardino.\n       And now Orlando is etched into the list of places in \n     America that have been forever scarred by gun violence.\n       In the aftermath of each of these deadly mass shootings, we \n     express our horror, our prayers for the victims and \n     survivors, our condolences, our thanks to the courageous \n     first responders--and of course, we must and we should. But \n     words are not enough.\n       After the horrific tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School \n     four years ago, I was convinced that Congress would finally \n     take action to address that epidemic of gun violence that \n     kills more than 30,000 Americans every year. But only four \n     Republicans were willing to join with 51 Democrats and \n     independents, and so commonsense gun safety legislation was \n     once more derailed.\n       That's why I am so proud that Senator Chris Murphy--joined \n     by his Connecticut colleague, Senator Richard Blumenthal--\n     took to the Senate floor with a simple message: Enough is \n     enough. The Senate must address this issue with a vote.\n       We may not be able to prevent every tragedy, but there is \n     so much we can do to save lives and protect our communities. \n     And we can do it while still protecting the Second Amendment. \n     We should start by taking these six commonsense steps right \n     now:\n       We can pass legislation to prevent a suspected terrorist \n     from buying firearms or explosives.\n       We can pass legislation to keep military-style weapons off \n     our streets. These are weapons of war, and they do not belong \n     in our communities.\n       We can expand background checks--an idea supported by \n     almost 90 percent of the American people and a majority of \n     NRA members--which will help keep guns out of the hands of \n     criminals and the mentally ill.\n       We can pass the Gun Violence Intervention Act, which would \n     allow families to go to court to seek a ``gun violence \n     prevention order'' to temporarily stop someone who poses a \n     threat to themselves or others from purchasing or possessing \n     a gun.\n       We can increase funding for the Urban Area Security \n     Initiative (UASI), an important grant program that helps \n     communities plan how best to prevent and respond to acts of \n     terrorism.\n       We can protect our children by investing in the \n     Comprehensive School Safety Initiative, which helps schools \n     develop school safety plans and provide critical safety \n     training to school personnel.\n       We need a layered defense to protect our communities from \n     criminals and terrorists who want to inflict mass casualties, \n     and that is what these proposals would provide.\n       We know that tough gun safety laws work. We have seen it in \n     other countries, like Australia. And we have seen it in my \n     state of California which--after passing sensible laws--saw a \n     56 percent drop in gun violence between 1993 and 2010, \n     according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n       People deserve to feel safe in their communities. They \n     deserve to feel safe at work, at school, at a shopping mall, \n     at a movie theater, at a health clinic, at a night club.\n       As elected officials, we take an oath to protect and defend \n     the American people. Right now, we are failing at our most \n     basic task--keeping our children and our families safe from \n     harm.\n       It isn't enough for us to keep lamenting these tragedies. \n     The people of Orlando, San Bernardino, Isla Vista, Newtown \n     and so many other communities want more than words. They want \n     action. And they want it now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/16/senate-section/article/S4295-1"}, {"day": "16", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4295-S4296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. BENNY GOODEN\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Fort Smith \nSchool District superintendent Dr. Benny Gooden, who will retire at the \nend of June after a lifetime of dedication to education.\n  Dr. Gooden has led the Fort Smith School District since 1986, and in \nthose 30 years, he has proven himself to be a driving force in \neducation at the local, State, and national level.\n  He made a career out of helping students and creating a solid \neducation, to pave the way for a successful future for them. During his \n50 years in education, he always put students first and fought to \nensure the community created opportunities in their best interest.\n  Dr. Gooden has remarked to the School Superintendents Association \nthat his best professional day was when Fort Smith voters approved a 20 \npercent tax increase to guarantee the district's financial stability.\n  He has been recognized for his career as a school administrator \nearning the American Association of School Administrators' Arkansas \nSuperintendent\n\n[[Page S4296]]\n\nof the Year award and was ranked in the top 100 Outstanding School \nAdministrators in North America by Executive Educator magazine. He was \nnamed Administrator of the Year by the Arkansas PTA in 1995, received \nthe Phoebe Apperson Hearst Outstanding Educator award from the National \nPTA in 1999, and a year later was the recipient of the Dr. Dan \nPilkington Award by the Arkansas School Boards Association. These \naccolades are all well deserved.\n  Dr. Gooden is actively engaged in the legislative process at the \nState and national levels on behalf of education. He has served as a \nmember of the Executive Committee of the American Association of School \nAdministrators and served as the organization's president from 2012-\n2103. Dr. Gooden has served his community, State, and Nation in a \nremarkable way in pursuit of better education opportunities for \nArkansas students.\n  He has been a resource for me over the years to keep up with the \nneeds and challenges of our education system. Whether pursuing \nopportunities for students of diverse backgrounds, cheering the \naccomplishments of adult education graduates, or paving the way for \nadvanced technology in the classroom, Dr. Gooden's dedication to the \nyoung people of Fort Smith has made a positive impact on the community. \nBecause of this, Fort Smith will continue to benefit from Dr. Gooden's \nwork long after his retirement.\n  I congratulate Dr. Gooden for his outstanding achievements in his \ncareer and thank him for his dedication to education, students and the \ncommunity. I appreciate his friendship and enjoyed supporting his \nefforts to improve education. I wish him all the best in retirement and \nknow that his wife Martha and the rest of his family will enjoy the \nopportunity to spend more time with him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/16/senate-section/article/S4295-2"}, {"day": "16", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JIM ROWLAND\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Fort Smith \nSchool District athletics director Jim Rowland who will retire in June \nafter serving the school district for over half a century. Rowland's \ndedication to education and athletics in Fort Smith is nearly \nunprecedented.\n  Jim Rowland has been involved in Fort Smith's school district since \n1963. He began work at Darby Junior High School as the head coach for \ntrack and football. In 1966, Rowland became an assistant coach to the \nfootball team at Northside High School and, in 1970, was named head \ncoach at crosstown rival, Southside High School.\n  After a successful coaching career, Coach Rowland moved to the \nadministrative sector becoming assistant principal in 1982 at Southside \nHigh School. Nine years later, Coach Rowland assumed the role of \nathletics director for Fort Smith Public School District.\n  Under his watch, both Northside and Southside High School won a \ncombined six State championships in football--more than any other \nschool district in the 7A classification.\n  During Rowland's time as athletics director, he oversaw an extensive \ngrowth in athletics. Under his leadership, both Northside and Southside \nHigh school won State championships in track, volleyball, bowling, and \ngolf.\n  His passion helped improve athletics in Fort Smith to a level not \nseen before. In 2009, Fort Smith School Board, in a unanimous vote, \nrenamed Southside High School's stadium, Jim Rowland Stadium as thank \nyou for his services.\n  I congratulate Coach Rowland for his outstanding achievements in \nathletics and education. I thank him for his service to the Fort Smith \nSchool District and the countless students he impacted, including me. I \nwas on the Darby Rangers football team in eighth grade when he started \nhis coaching career in Fort Smith, and I was a member of the Northside \nGrizzlies when he became an assistant coach at the high school. Coach \nRowland was a role model and one of the most positive influences in my \nlife, as well as so many others.\n  His efforts to foster growth in the district and enhance athletics in \nFort Smith have become reality. I greatly appreciate his commitment to \nthe schools and athletic programs, his guidance and friendship, and I \nwish him continued success in all of his endeavors. Fort Smith is \nfortunate to have had someone with his passion and dedication to the \nschools.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/16/senate-section/article/S4296-1"}, {"day": "16", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO FRANCES DOLEZAL\n\n Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, on January 9, 1915, the Dolezal \nfamily scurried around a humble homestead in Hingham, MT. The house had \nno heat, no plumbing, and no modern conveniences to combat the bitter \nMontana cold. Jerry and Grace Dolezal had just welcomed a brand-new \nbaby girl--Frances. Her brother Bob Dolezal says, ``My father used to \nsay, she was so small, she could have worn a ring as a bracelet.'' \nFrances was a premature breach birth, and the family took turns \nhuddling around her crib, a small dresser drawer, refilling a hot water \nbottle each hour to keep the newborn warm. Frances would survive that \nnight and many more. She celebrated her 101st birthday this last \nJanuary.\n  I would like to take this time to recognize and honor her service to-\nour-country and her contribution to the children of Montana. We are the \nland of the free because of the brave, and as we continue to face \nforeign and domestic threats I am humbled by the service men and women \nwho have protected and served. In 1942 the United States faced a \nshortage of military personnel due to World War II. In an effort to \nfill the void, the Women Accepted for Emergency Volunteer Service \nprogram, or WAVES, was created and allowed women to enlist in the U.S. \nNavy.\n  After her brother George Dolezal survived the attack on Pearl Harbor, \nFrances was anxious to do her part and graciously enlisted in July of \n1943. She was stationed on Terminal Island in San Pedro, CA, for the \nnext 2 years, serving as a second class aviation machinist mate, \npreparing airplanes before they were shipped overseas.\n  When the war ended, Frances returned to Montana and earned her \nbachelor's degree in education from the Western Montana College of \nEducation, now University of Montana Western, in Dillon. Frances would \ngo on to be a first grade teacher and serve the communities of Cutbank, \nMalta, Havre, Zortman, Ledger and Browning for over 25 years.\n  Frances was a tough teacher but fair. In Browning, where class \nattendance was low, Frances created an innovative cotton ball calendar \ntactic to motivate class participation. Her classes held the highest \nattendance rates and many of her schoolchildren would exit first grade \nwith third grade reading levels. Her brother Bob says: ``Her ability to \nmotivate little ones was what I was always impressed with. She \ninstilled in them to never quit; keep trying until you can succeed.''\n  On Frances' 100th birthday she was showered with letters, cards, and \ngifts from her former students. One student, now a successful \nbusinessman in Billings, MT, made it a priority to be in attendance for \nthe celebration. The young man thanked Frances and said that, among all \nof his teachers and college professors, Mrs. Ordway was his favorite.\n  In an effort to ensure all female World War II veterans receive their \nWorld War II service medals, Frances was recently honored by the \nMontana American Legion in Chinook, MT. Frances was pinned with her \nWorld War II Victory Medal in honor of her service from 1943 to 1945.\n  It is stories like Frances's, the Dolezal family, and numerous others \nthat remind us of the importance of preserving these stories through \nefforts like the Veterans History Project. Though many people may never \nknow her name, Montanans and Americans owe her our appreciation. Thank \nyou, Frances, for your patriotism and commitment to the education of \nyoung Montana minds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/16/senate-section/article/S4296-2"}, {"day": "16", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4296-S4297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO CHRISTINA ARAGON\n\n Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I would like to call your attention \nto Christina Aragon, a recent graduate of Billings Senior High School. \nWhile in high school, Christina competed in track and field, \ngymnastics, was an active member of the National Honors Society and \nconcert band, and was named the Gatorade Montana Track and Field \nathlete of the year in 2015. Christina is the youngest daughter of \nChuck and Kathy Argon and is running her way into the record books.\n  Christina, known as Teeny by friends and family, is a remarkable \ntrack and\n\n[[Page S4297]]\n\nfield athlete whose events include the 400m, 800m, 1500m, 1600m, and \nthe 3,200m. Over the course of her high school career, Christina earned \nnine State champion titles; three of those titles were earned while \nrunning with a broken elbow.\n  On June 5, Christina attended the Payton Jordan Invitational at \nStanford and completed the 1500m in 4:11.24. Competing in a packed race \nwith multiple professionally sponsored runners, this 18-year-old \nsurprised everyone in attendance. On June 12, at the Portland Track \nFestival, Christina defied expectations yet again and set a national \nrecord of 4:09.27, becoming the third fastest 1500m high schooler in \nhistory, while simultaneously qualifying for the Olympic time trials. \nThis weekend, she will compete in the Brooks PR Invitational in Renton, \nWA, where she holds the record for the 800m at 2:04.00. Christina will \nalso attend the Olympic time trials in Oregon on July 1, 2016.\n  Christina represents the youngest of the Aragon track and field \nlegacy. Her father was the first Notre Dame runner to break the 4-\nminute mile in 1981. Her mother competed in her third Olympic time \ntrial in 2004, and her older sisters, Danielle and Alexa, hold multiple \nState champion titles and run together as All-Americans at Notre Dame. \nChristina will attend Stanford University this fall and continue her \ntrack and field career.\n  When asked about the Olympic time trials, Christina commented, ``I'm \nobviously going to be pretty nervous, but I'm just going to try to \nchannel that nervousness into more excitement because that's just an \nawesome opportunity and I'm really lucky to be able to have that so I'm \njust going to go out there and have fun and run fast, hopefully.''\n  William Shakespeare wrote, ``Though she be but little, she is \nfierce,'' a quote that I feel resonates all too well with this \ndetermined and fearsome young lady. I ask that you join me in wishing \nChristina the best of luck in the coming weeks. I have no doubt that \nshe will continue to make her family and Montana proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/16/senate-section/article/S4296-3"}, {"day": "16", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO BRENDA KADRMAS\n\n Mr. DAINES.

STEPHEN WELLS\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Dr. \nStephen Wells for his service with the Desert Research Institute, or \nDRI, after being a significant team member for 16 years. It gives me \ngreat pleasure to recognize his years of hard work and commitment to \nmaking this institute the best it can be.\n  Dr. Wells earned his master's degree and doctorate in geology from \nthe University of Cincinnati in Ohio. He later served as a professor of \ngeomorphology and chair of the graduate program in the Department of \nEarth Sciences at the University of California, Riverside, jumpstarting \nhis academic career. In 1976, he joined the University of New Mexico, \nserving as chair of the Department of Geology from 1989 to 1991. In \nboth roles, Dr. Wells built internationally recognized research and \ngraduate programs and enrolled 34 students into the programs.\n  Beginning in 1995, Dr. Wells began his lengthy tenure with the DRI as \nexecutive director of the Quaternary Sciences Center. Throughout the \nnext 16 years, he worked diligently to climb the ladder and became \npresident of DRI, one of the world's largest multidisciplinary \nenvironmental research organizations, located in our great State. The \ninstitute has 500 scientists, technologists, students, and other staff \nworking to further develop nationally recognized research. Dr. Wells \nled the institute with three core divisions and four interdisciplinary \nscience centers, which serve Nevada and regions across the globe with \ninnovative research. Dr. Wells also helped to build the institute to a \n$50 million per year operation, compared to the $23.8 million in 1998. \nResidents across the State are fortunate to have had someone of such \ndedication working on behalf of the institute.\n  During his time in Nevada, he emerged as a true leader within our \ncommunity. Dr. Wells served as a graduate faculty member in the \nhydrological sciences program and the Department of Geological Sciences \nat the University of Nevada, Reno. He also served as a board member of \nthe Economic Development Authority of Western Nevada and the Nevada \nDevelopment Authority. In addition, he spearheaded various initiatives \nin unmanned aircraft systems technology, as well as helping position \nNevada as a frontrunner in advanced technologies. I have worked with \nhim personally on various Nevada priorities and am thankful to have had \nhim as an ally in these initiatives.\n  Dr. Wells has received three national awards in recognition of his \nwork: the Geological Society of America Kirk Bryan Award, the Gladys \nCole Award, and the Geological Society of America Farouk El-Baz Award. \nThese accolades are a tremendous honor, and without a doubt, Dr. Wells' \nwork warrants this recognition.\n  I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in thanking Dr. Wells \nfor his dedication to DRI throughout the past 16 years. He exemplifies \nthe highest standards of leadership and service and should be proud of \nhis meaningful career. I wish him well in all of his future endeavors \nand in his new role with the New Mexico Institute of Mining and \nTechnology.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/16/senate-section/article/S4297-3"}, {"day": "16", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4297-S4298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO AMBER PARSONS\n\n Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Amber \nParsons, an outstanding and accomplished young woman from Wheeling, WV.\n  Amber, a recent graduate of Wheeling Park High School, graduated in \nMay with honors and with an outstanding 4.0 GPA. She has received \nnumerous Presidential Award Scholarships because of her outstanding \neffort and hard work and also attended the Global Youth Leadership \nConference last summer with individuals from more than 30 countries.\n  The Global Youth Leadership Summit is both an academic and \nprofessional opportunity for young men and women to not only enhance \ntheir academic abilities, but grow personally and professionally as \nwell. The summit immerses students in various cultures and gives them \nthe opportunity to interact with policy officials, lobbyists, \njournalists, and other industry leaders. It is a wonderful opportunity \nfor young men and women to learn and grow on a professional and \npersonal level.\n  Amber is the only individual ever from West Virginia to be selected \nto attend this prestigious conference. While being selected from 3,700 \napplicants is an accomplishment in itself, she was also selected to \nreturn again this year. Less than 10 percent of previous attendees are \nasked to return, and Amber was included in that small percentage.\n  Aside from her outstanding academic work, Amber also helped to \nestablish\n\n[[Page S4298]]\n\nSt. Baldrick's Day in Wheeling, a premiere childhood cancer research \nfundraiser that is prominent throughout the State and has been for 13 \nyears.\n  Alongside all of her accomplishments, Amber also enjoys performing in \nstage productions and has performed in several, including ``Scrooge,'' \n``Footloose'' among others.\n  Amber Parsons is not only an outstanding student, but an accomplished \nindividual as well. Being a member of National Honor Society, \ngraduating from Wheeling Park with honors, and being selected to attend \nthe Global Youth Leadership Summit, I am extremely proud of this young \nwoman for representing my State of West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/16/senate-section/article/S4297-4"}, {"day": "16", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LANSING ROTARY CLUB\n\n Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \nLansing Rotary Club's centennial. For 100 years, the Lansing Rotary has \nbeen a cornerstone of fellowship and service for those in the greater \nLansing community. Throughout that time, it has remained committed to \nthe core value of all Rotarians, ``Service Above Self,'' by enhancing \nthe quality of life of the City's residents and helping shape business \nleaders into community leaders.\n  Founded on May 29, 1916, the Lansing Rotary was the 232nd club in the \nworld and the seventh in Michigan. Its commitment to service was \ndemonstrated almost immediately; within the first 6 months, the club \ncontributed funds to help erect a barrier at a dangerous curve on \nOkemos Road, generated enthusiastic support for a citywide vote to \nestablish municipal garbage collection for Lansing residents, donated \nfootballs to the poorly equipped Lansing Boys Industrial School, and \nbegan the tradition of hosting annual Christmas parties for children in \nneed.\n  What truly thrust Lansing Rotary into the spotlight was its \norganizing of the Cabaret Charity Ball in 1917. Created to pay for the \npaving of the road connecting Lansing and East Lansing, the State \nJournal called the Ball, ``easily the most talked of social event in \nthe history of the city . . . it will be the marking of the growth of \nLansing from a little city to the ways and habits of larger and more \nprogressive cities.'' In a remarkable display for a club still less \nthan a year old, the ball attracted hundreds of attendees and funded \nthe paving of the road known today as Michigan Avenue, the road that \nleads directly to Michigan's Capitol building.\n  Like many rotary clubs around the world, Lansing Rotary gained a \nreputation for its emphasis on providing unique services. Continuing \nthe main trend of its work during that immensely successful first year, \nLansing Rotarians became best known for their efforts in assisting \ndisadvantaged children. In the decades that followed, the club \npurchased a 12-acre campsite and donated it to Boy Scouts; established \nan educational loan fund to send young people to college; created a \ndental program for children and youth; donated $10,000 for the \nestablishment of Camp Ingham, a facility for troubled boys between the \nages of 14 and 17; and, in 2002, it contributed $100,000 to Lansing's \nHelping Other People Excel, HOPE, scholarship program for Lansing at-\nrisk youth.\n  Today Lansing Rotary boasts a membership of nearly 300 and continues \nto fulfill its mission of ``Service Above Self.'' Since its \nestablishment 100 years ago, it has donated millions of dollars to \nLansing-based organizations and continues to give through annual grants \nto organizations like the Greater Lansing Food Bank, the Mother Teresa \nHouse, and Lifetech Academy, Michigan's cyber school. Moreover, it \nprovides similar services internationally, including grants for small \nprojects in the Philippines, India, and Mexico, and larger projects \nlike the construction of a school in Sri Lanka after the tsunami. \nThrough its generous service to Lansing and helping shape business \nleaders and community leaders alike, Lansing Rotary is truly a pillar \nof mid-Michigan\n  I am honored to ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing the \nLansing Rotary Club's 100th anniversary and its service to the greater \nlansing community. As the organization moves into the future, I am \nconfident it will continue to demonstrate the same high standard it set \nso profoundly 100 years ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/16/senate-section/article/S4298-1"}, {"day": "16", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/16/senate-section/article/S4298-2"}, {"day": "16", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/16/senate-section/article/S4298-3"}, {"day": "16", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  At 2:20 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 2276.

SENSE OF CONGRESS WITH RESPECT TO INTERNATIONAL DATA \n                   PRIVACY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) When the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Public \n     Law 99-508; 100 Stat. 1848) (in this section referred to as \n     ``ECPA'') was enacted in 1986, no one could have envisioned \n     the globalization of the Internet and electronic \n     communications.\n       (2) Today, multinational companies serve their customers \n     around the world by storing and transferring data through a \n     complex network of global data centers.\n       (3) Because ECPA never contemplated the global networks \n     that technology companies operate today, ECPA presents unique \n     challenges for a number of industries that increasingly face \n     a conflict between Federal law in the United States and the \n     laws of other countries. For example, when a technology \n     company receives a demand from a Federal law enforcement \n     agency to turn over data on behalf of foreign customers, that \n     company is forced to make a difficult decision: either comply \n     with the demand and satisfy Federal law or risk violating the \n     privacy laws of the host country. The same is true in reverse \n     because when foreign governments compel global providers to \n     disclose information, even information about the citizens of \n     those governments, Federal law in the United States sometimes \n     prohibits the providers from complying.\n       (4) Modernizing ECPA to better reflect the truly global \n     nature of global technology will--\n       (A) better serve the interests of law enforcement, both in \n     the United States and abroad;\n       (B) protect individual privacy; and\n       (C) promote innovation and the free flow of information.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Federal Government--\n       (1) must safeguard data throughout the world from \n     unauthorized access by law enforcement agencies; and\n       (2) should--\n       (A) require law enforcement agencies in the United States \n     to obtain a warrant for all electronic content;\n       (B) create a clear international legal framework that \n     provides law enforcement agencies with an efficient process \n     to obtain information while--\n       (i) protecting the privacy of all individuals; and\n       (ii) respecting the laws of other countries; and\n       (C) strengthen the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty process \n     by providing greater efficiency, accessibility, transparency, \n     and accountability.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4748.

SENSE OF CONGRESS WITH RESPECT TO WILLFUL \n                   INFRINGEMENT IN PATENT CASES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) On June 13, 2016, the Supreme Court of the United \n     States held in Halo Electronics, Inc. v. Pulse Electronics, \n     Inc. (in this section referred to as ``Halo''), that the 2-\n     part test for awarding enhanced damages under section 284 of \n     title 35, United States Code, as articulated in In re Seagate \n     Technology, LLC, 497 F.3d 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (en banc) (in \n     this section referred to as ``Seagate''), was inconsistent \n     with the intent of that section.\n       (2) In 2011, when Congress enacted Public Law 112-29, the \n     standard articulated by the Federal Circuit for willful \n     infringement under Seagate was the established judicial \n     interpretation of section 284 of title 35, United States \n     Code, with respect to awarding enhanced damages in a patent \n     case. The legislative history of section 284 after Seagate \n     was decided shows that Congress was well aware of the Seagate \n     standard and explored the impact of Seagate on the issue of \n     enhanced damages.\n       (3) Ultimately, Congress did not substantively amend \n     section 284 of title 35, United States Code, knowing that no \n     action from Congress would be required to ensure that the \n     standard established in Seagate would remain in place and \n     continue to govern the enhancement analysis under that \n     section.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Seagate standard has governed and continues to \n     govern the enhanced damages analysis under section 284 of \n     title 35, United States Code; and\n       (2) this intent of Congress should be considered in any \n     decisions interpreting that section.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4749.

The victims were targeted because of who \n     they were, whom they loved, or whom they associated with.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is time to end discrimination against LGBT \n     individuals and stand against the culture of hatred and \n     prejudice that such discrimination allows;\n       (2) it is incumbent on policymakers to ensure that LGBT \n     individuals benefit from the full protection of the civil \n     rights laws of the Nation; and\n       (3) Congress commits to take every action necessary to make \n     certain that all people of the United States are treated and \n     protected equally under the law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4763.

Mr. President, I come here with a solemn message today, \nand I come here remembering a Republican colleague who served in this \nbody for 12 years--George Voinovich.\n  George was a former Governor of Ohio and a former mayor of Cleveland. \nI think, in his time, he was county auditor. He was Lieutenant \nGovernor, I believe, and mayor of Cleveland. He was the chairman of the \nNational League of Cities. As a two-term Governor of Ohio, he was also \nchairman of\n\n[[Page S4324]]\n\nthe National Governors Association. I had the privilege of serving as \nhis vice chairman and, later on, as his successor, as the chairman of \nthe NGA.\n  Then George came here. He was elected in 1998, and he took office \nhere in the Senate in 1999. He served for two terms and is, I am sure, \nremembered by everybody who served with him as smart, kind, principled, \nhard-working, and straight-talking. He was everything an elected \nofficial should be and could be.\n  He and I went to Ohio State together but not at the same time. He was \nin law school and a year or two older than me. I was an undergraduate, \nand so I never got to know him at that point in time. But we shared a \nlot of bonds. I got to know his family well, his wife Janet. She and my \nwife Martha, as we were Governors together, were spouses together and \nwere very good and close friends.\n  I liked George. You know sometimes when you meet someone and you just \nlike them right away? I don't believe anybody in Ohio history ever won \nall 84 counties, and with something like almost two-thirds of the vote. \nHe did that. That was in 2004. I think in 2006, I won every county in \nDelaware. We have three. He has 80 or so counties. I would joke with \nhim: Well, we both won every county in our State. It was a little \nharder for him.\n  He impacted this place, as I think relatively few people do. We \nserved together on the Environment and Public Works Committee. We \nserved together on the committee that was initially called Governmental \nAffairs and later Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. He was \none of the leaders in each of those committees.\n  George was one of those people who had the courage to keep out of \nstep when everyone else was marching to the wrong tune. As a \nRepublican, at a time when we had a Republican President--and by 2007 \nthe war in Iraq was not going well--he very bravely, within his own \ncaucus, called on President George W. Bush to begin a phased withdrawal \nof our troops. He basically said the Iraqis ought to be able to do a \nlittle more for themselves, fend for themselves. We will help them, but \nthey should do more for themselves.\n  He was one who believed we needed to match revenues with \nexpenditures, and he was a guy who really knew how to squeeze a dime. \nHe was very fiscally very responsible. He was a big believer that \nStates should be fiscally responsible--and cities. He became mayor of \nCleveland when they were basically bankrupt. He helped guide them back \nto prosperity and helped to rekindle the economy there and helped to \nfoster an extremely strong economy. That is how he won every single \ncounty in Ohio.\n  George was a guy who would actually vote against a tax break when he \nthought it wasn't fiscally responsible to do, if it would further erode \nour revenue base and enlarge our budget deficit. He was a very \ncourageous--very courageous--elected official and someone you just \nliked.\n  You know sometimes you meet people and it is all about them? Well, it \nwas never all about George. He was a guy who had every reason to be \npompous and proud and everything, but he was not that way at all. How \ndo I describe him? He had the heart of a servant. He understood that \nhis job was to serve, not be served. He was humble, not haughty. He \ncame from a humble background and never had a lot of money--he and his \nwife Janet--until the day he died.\n  George died in his sleep earlier this week, almost at the age of 80, \njust 2 days before my wife and I were supposed to have dinner with him \nand his wife here in Washington, and with other friends, to celebrate \nhis impending 80th birthday.\n  I said earlier that George had the courage to keep out of step when \neveryone else was marching to the wrong tune. How do I say this? When \nfaced with the dilemma of maybe voting with his caucus or voting with \nthe President on something he just thought was wrong, he was amazingly \nbrave. He would say: What is the right thing to do? I heard him say \nthis more than a few times, as Governor, chairman of the National \nGovernors Association, and here. He would say: What is the right thing \nto do? He wouldn't say: What is the easy thing to do? What is the \nexpedient thing to do? But what is the right thing to do?\n  He was a person of deep faith. We have a Bible study group that meets \nhere every Thursday, just upstairs, not far from this floor. There are \nabout seven or eight of us, who, I like to say, need the most help. It \nis Democrats and Republicans. It is not just all one religion or the \nother. It is a meeting he came to just about every Thursday. He was a \nperson of deep faith.\n  George felt that the most important rule of law for us to follow, \nregardless of what religion we were--whether Protestant or Catholic or \nJewish or Muslim or Hindu or Buddhist--they all have some version of \nthe golden rule. Even Confucius in China had something like the golden \nrule 2,500 years ago, which goes something like this: Don't do to \nothers what you don't want to have done to you. But George was really \nthe embodiment of the golden rule: Treat other people like you want to \nbe treated.\n  He had a temper, but, frankly, he lost it when he should have. He \nlost it when he should have.\n  Today we had a roundtable, and the roundtable included someone from \nthe Government Accountability Office. Every 2 years, as the Presiding \nOfficer knows, GAO puts out a high-risk list. I describe it as high-\nrisk ways of wasting taxpayer money. They lay out all these different \nthings that should be done in agencies and that, if done, would not \nonly provide better service for citizens of this country but also do so \nin a more cost-effective way.\n  George was always really interested in how we get better results with \nless money. He was always interested in that.\n  At this roundtable today, when we convened it, I said: Let's hold \nthis roundtable today with the Government Accountability Office and \nwith representatives from across the Federal Government who are working \nto get off GAO's high-risk list. In order to do that, you have to \nfigure out how to address the concerns raised by GAO and their reviews \nof agency operations. We talked about some of the areas where Senator \nGeorge Voinovich worked--in one case with Senator Danny Akaka from \nHawaii--to address a number of areas of expenditures and practices that \nneeded to be addressed.\n  Subsequent to the roundtable, I left there and came here to the \nCapitol Building and went to the office of the President pro tempore, \nSenator Orrin Hatch, where he was signing a document relating to the \nadoption of legislation the Presiding Officer and I and others had \nworked on, which is focused on how we do a better job in this country \nwhen we transition from one administration--this President, the current \nadministration, President Obama--to the next administration. How do we \ndo that in a way that we just don't drop the ball and get further \nbehind, stop making progress in particular areas, and undermine our \nnational security? How do we transition in smarter ways?\n  That legislation has been named after two people--in honor of two \npeople. One is Senator Ted Kaufman, who was Joe Biden's successor here. \nTed was our Senator here for 2 years following Joe's departure to \nbecome Vice President and before Chris Coons was elected and joined us \nhere in the Senate. During the 2 years Ted Kaufman was our Senator from \nDelaware, one of the pieces of legislation he offered was to make \npossible better transitions, more effective transitions, and smoother \ntransitions from one administration to the other.\n  Another person who had thought about that a whole lot was a fellow \nnamed Mike Leavitt, former Governor of Utah and later a Cabinet \nSecretary in George W. Bush's administration, and a friend of mine. I \nsucceeded George Voinovich as chairman of the National Governors \nAssociation, and Mike Leavitt was the vice chairman, and he then became \nthe chairman. We were all very close friends and colleagues then and \nright up until George's death.\n  But we went over, literally, to the President pro tempore's office \nand signed the documentation. We had Senator Kaufman there, Governor \nLeavitt there, and we remembered George Voinovich, because when the \nfirst version of that legislation was passed, Ted Kaufman was the \nDemocratic lead and George Voinovich was the Republican lead.\n  That is just one of dozens of examples where he provided leadership \nfor\n\n[[Page S4325]]\n\nthis country, as he did for Ohio in the roles he held there.\n  I really loved George Voinovich. I just loved the guy. I think when \nwe think of leaders, sometimes people in leadership positions say to \nothers: Do as I say. George actually said: Do as I do. He was a big \nbeliever in leading by example.\n  The other thing I loved and respected about him was that he was very \ntenacious. We have all met people who could have done something, gotten \nsomething done, and been somebody, and they gave up. They gave up. \nGeorge never gave up. He was one of those people who, when he knew he \nwas right and he was sure he was right, he never gave up.\n  Tomorrow, people from all over Ohio--actually from around the \ncountry--will gather in Cleveland not far from the home where George \nand Janet and their family were raised and where they lived for many \nyears--where Janet still lives. It will be sad, but there will also be \na sense of joy. There are probably not many good ways to die--but to \ndie at the age of almost 80 and to die in your sleep without pain and \nsuffering, and to have a legacy of wonderful children--children any of \nus would be proud to call our own--and a bunch of grandchildren--the \nsame thing, whom any of us would be proud to call our own. That is a \ngreat legacy if you just stopped right there. But the legacy goes well \nbeyond that in terms of the way Ohio is governed today by Governor John \nKasich, who is another close friend.\n  John Kasich and I came to the House together in 1983, and I am \ndelighted he has had the opportunity to serve as Governor there--a \nworthy successor to George Voinovich. Frankly, I might add--and I will \nprobably get in trouble with my caucus for saying this--he would have \nbeen a great nominee for our friends in the Republican Party. But \napparently that is not in the cards.\n  So I won't go on much further, but when people say bad things about \nelected officials or unkind things about elected officials, I think it \nis too bad they didn't know the Presiding Officer and they didn't know \nGeorge Voinovich, because they wouldn't feel that way if they knew him \nor had any idea of his commitment and his dedication and his sacrifice \nand his leadership.\n  I will close with this. A fellow who used to serve here was a fellow \nnamed Alan Simpson. He was a Senator from Wyoming. We remembered him \ntoday because he was the coauthor of the Bowles-Simpson plan, the \nfiscally responsible deficit reduction plan of probably about 6 or 7 \nyears ago. It was established by President Obama. It was a good roadmap \nthen, and I still think it is a good roadmap today. Alan Simpson was \nthe Republican part of that, in tandem with Erskine Bowles.\n  Alan Simpson used to say a lot of very funny things. He was probably \nas humorous as anybody who ever served here, but he also said some \nserious things here too, and one of them reminds me of George \nVoinovich. Senator Alan Simpson used to talk about integrity, and he \nwould say: Integrity--if you have it, nothing else matters. Integrity--\nif you don't have it, nothing else matters. Think about \nthat. Integrity, if you have it, nothing else matters. Integrity, if \nyou don't have it, nothing else matters. George Voinovich did not have \na partisan bone in his body, but he had a world of integrity--just a \nworld of integrity inside that body of his.\n\n  The other thing I would say, I like to think that as important as \nintegrity is--and it is--the other thing that is as critically \nimportant for the success of any organization, whether it is a State or \ncounty or business or school, this body, the most important ingredient \nfor the success of that entity, any of them, is leadership, principled \nleadership, committed leadership, enlightened leadership, and George \nVoinovich embodied those.\n  So to the people of Delaware who supported--not Delaware. Delaware is \na little town just north of Columbus, OH. When I was a student at Ohio \nState, I used to think Delaware was a town just north of Columbus. I \nlater found out it was a whole State. When I got out of the Navy, I \nmoved there. They were good enough to let me serve in a couple \ndifferent capacities, including here.\n  The people of Ohio were smart to elect him and smart to share him \nwith us. We were just blessed that they did that, really blessed that \nthey did that.\n  I felt the presence of George Voinovich today at our roundtable \nworking on the issues he loved. I felt his presence at the signing \nceremony in the President pro tempore's office, when we signed into law \nthe transition legislation he originally cosponsored a number of years \nago with Senator Ted Kaufman, and I feel his presence here today, and \nit is a good presence. While we mourn his loss and his death, we just \nappreciate so much his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/16/senate-section/article/S4323-7"}, {"day": "16", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          9/11 MEMORIAL MUSEUM\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, on a totally different subject, my wife \nand I had the opportunity to go to New York last Saturday. We were \ninvited up by our oldest son to visit with him and his roommate. We \nvisited the 9/11 Memorial Museum. For anybody who has a chance to go to \nNew York City and visit that memorial, I urge that they do that. It was \na walk back in time to 9/11 and the horrors of that day and the days \nand the weeks that followed, but out of that terrible disaster, our \ncountry came together.\n  Our country came together in rather remarkable ways. Instead of \npointing fingers at each other, we decided to join hands and work \ntogether under the leadership of George W. Bush, and we created a 9/11 \nCommission, chaired by Republican Tom King of New Jersey and cochaired \nby Lee Hamilton, Congressman from Indiana, former chair of the House \nForeign Relations Committee. It was a bipartisan Commission. There were \n9 or 11 people. They went to work. They had a great staff, and they \nworked for months to drill down on what went wrong, what led to 9/11--\nthat catastrophe and how could it happen--and came up with a whole host \nof recommendations. I think there were about 40 recommendations. They \nwere unanimous. They adopted them unanimously and gave them to us. They \ncame before us and came before our committee, the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs, and we adopted about 80 percent of them pretty \nmuch unanimously. It was a time that rather than us being divided as a \ncountry, it was a time we came together on the heels of a terrible \ndisaster.\n  When I look at the political back and forth that seems to flow out of \nthe tragedy in Orlando and I compare that with what existed when we \nlost maybe 60 times as many lives 15 years ago, I would hope we would \nremember, as a people--I hope those of us who serve in this body and \nthose who would like to lead our country will remember the words right \nover the Presiding Officer's head. I don't know a lot of Latin, but the \nLatin words inscribed over the chair where the Presiding Officer sits, \n``E pluribus unum,'' from many, one. From many, one. We are strong when \nwe are united, and we need to be united just as we were 15 years ago. \nWe need to be united as a nation today. George Voinovich, if he were \nhere, would remind us of that. Since he is not, I wanted to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/16/senate-section/article/S4325-1"}, {"day": "16", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 11 A.M.
