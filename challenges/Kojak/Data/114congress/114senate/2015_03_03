Mr. President, later this morning, the Israeli Prime \nMinister Benjamin Netanyahu will deliver an important address to \nCongress. Members of both parties extend a warm welcome to him.\n  This leader is a great friend of our country, and his visit comes at \na critical moment in the relations between our countries.\n  The Prime Minister's address coincides with an increasingly \naggressive Iranian campaign to expand its sphere of influence across \nthe Middle East. It represents a threat to both of our countries, it \nrepresents a threat to moderate Sunni allies, and it represents a \nthreat to the international community at large.\n  That is why Prime Minister Netanyahu is here today. He is ideally \nsuited to explain the multitude of challenges this presents--including \nthe threat of an Iran with nuclear weapons capability--and how our \ncountries can address them jointly.\n  So we are glad the Prime Minister is here with us today. We will be \nlistening closely to what he has to say.\n  I hope the Obama administration will be listening, too, because this \nvisit isn't about personalities, it is about doing what is best for \nboth of our countries, and here some context is important.\n  As it has been since its founding, Israel is in a constant state of \nexistential crisis. It is continuously threatened by terrorists, such \nas Hezbollah and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, who work every day to \nsee a democratic Israel destroyed. Israel's leaders wake every morning \nknowing that with just one wrong decision, it could be their last in an \nopen and tolerant democracy. That is the frame through which the \nIsraelis approach their national security policy.\n  Here is the frame the Obama administration uses: It formulates policy \nwith two objectives in mind--fulfilling political campaign promises \nmade back in 2008 and pursuing politically expedient solutions to \nwhatever stands in the way of the first objective. We can see the basis \nfor tension right there.\n  For me, there are two bookends that define President Obama's foreign \npolicy.\n  The Executive orders that attempted to close Guantanamo without a \ncredible plan for what to do with its detainees, and to essentially end \nour ability to capture, detain, and interrogate terrorists, regardless \nof the threats that remain for our country, represent one bookend.\n  The President's push to withdraw all combat forces from Iraq and \nAfghanistan by the end of his term, regardless of the threats posed by \nthe Taliban or the senior leadership of Al Qaeda, represents the other \nbookend.\n  The politics-above-policy approach mystifies allies such as Israel. \nYou can see it in many other decisions too--for instance, the \nPresident's failure to negotiate an agreement with Iraq for a residual \nmilitary force that may have prevented the assault by ISIL. Instead, as \nthreats from Al Qaeda and affiliated groups metastasized, the President \nfocused on unwinding or reversing past policies through Executive \norder. Uprisings in North Africa and the broader Middle East resulted \nin additional ungoverned space in Syria, Libya, and Yemen. The capital \nof Yemen is now occupied by the Houthi militia, and the Yemenis are no \nmore ready to detain the terrorists at Guantanamo today than they were \nin 2009.\n  What has the President's response to all this been? To draw down our \nconventional forces and capabilities.\n\n[[Page S1224]]\n\n  Even as China and Russia have grown more belligerent, the President \nsees no need to reverse the harmful damage of the defense cuts he has \ninsisted upon. He sees no need to rebuild our conventional and nuclear \nforces.\n  He sees no need to accept that leaving behind residual forces in Iraq \nand Afghanistan represents an effective means by which to preserve the \nstrategic gains we have made over the years, through tremendous \nsacrifice.\n  The President has always assumed the role of Commander in Chief with \ngreat reluctance. That is particularly true of his dealings with Iran. \nFor years, Iran has continued to enrich uranium. For years, Iran has \nrefused to come clean to the IAEA. But ending Iran's nuclear weapons \nprogram has never fit neatly between the administration's policy \nbookends.\n  The President believed he could extend a hand of friendship and bring \nthe Supreme Leader to the table. Even though that approach failed, the \nPresident now seems determined to conclude an agreement with Iran that \nwould leave it with a threshold nuclear capability. It is an agreement \nthat could allow Iran to retain thousands of centrifuges, master the \nnuclear fuel cycle, advance ballistic missile research and testing, and \nkeep secret any possible military dimensions of nuclear development \nthat have already occurred.\n  The administration has pursued these negotiations not as part of an \noverall strategy to end Iran's nuclear program, but as a stand-alone \nmatter of litigation where a settlement must be reached. This \nnegotiation should not be about getting the best deal that the Iranians \nwill agree to, it should be about the strategic objective of ending \nIran's nuclear weapons program. To do this, the administration must be \ncommitted to using force if negotiations fail.\n  The strategic ambiguity of leaving ``all options on the table'' has \nnever been convincing, and the administration refused to work with \nCongress on developing a sanctions and declaratory military response \nshould negotiations fail. It is unlikely that this Congress could be \nconvinced to lift sanctions absent a complete disclosure on the part of \nthe Iranians of all previous research conducted in pursuit of a nuclear \ndevice.\n  And this gets back to the differences between the perspective of the \nIsraeli government concerning Iran's nuclear capability and those of \nthe Obama administration.\n  Iran is pursuing full spectrum warfighting capabilities to wage war \nagainst Israel, the United States, and our Sunni allies in the region.\n  Iran is developing cyber capabilities to harass and harm its \nadversaries, ballistic missile capabilities, and conventional \ncapabilities to deny United States warships access to the Persian Gulf.\n  Iran remains a state sponsor of terror.\n  Tehran also continues to push ever deeper into Iraq.\n  In its fight within Iraq, Iran's proxy Shia militias have gained \nvaluable combat experience on the ground to add to the terrorist \ntactics of employing IEDs that were perfected against United States \nforces. The withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq not only led to the \nabandonment of the Sunni tribes which had allied with us in Anbar \nProvince, it led to a greater reliance upon the Iranians by the Baghdad \ngovernment.\n  The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Qods Force are \nexpanding their command and control and combat capabilities in Iraq and \nSyria and gaining valuable warfighting lessons.\n  The Qods force and Hezbollah are mastering an expeditionary fighting \ncapability that should concern Israel, the United States, and our Sunni \nallies. The Iranians are natural allies of the Houthi militias in \nYemen.\n  Setting aside the nuclear program, from a perspective of strategy, \nthe Iranians are advancing across the region in all other aspects of \nwarfighting. All of this has occurred while sanctions have been in \nplace and the price of oil has declined.\n  From the perspective of any Israeli Prime Minister, Iran's advances \nhave occurred while the terrorist presence in the Sinai has grown, the \nNusrah front and ISIL are present in Syria, and Libya has become a \nterrorist training ground.\n  Because the administration has all but conceded the Iranian nuclear \nenrichment capability, Israel has grown more isolated. It has come to \nunderstand that it may have to act alone. Yet rather than ending Iran's \nnuclear weapons program, President Obama's objective seems to be to \ndefer any decision about the use of force to one of his successors. \nThat may be politically expedient, but it is inconsistent with the \nnational security requirements of Israel.\n  I say all this to underline the importance of the Prime Minister's \naddress this morning.\n  We have seen the results of a politics-above-all foreign policy now \nfor several years: It leaves our Nation strategically weaker, and will \nmake challenges faced by the President's successor all the more \ndifficult.\n  Israel has seen this too. Israel knows it may well be the first to \nsuffer if the Obama White House makes another flawed political \ndecision, but Americans should understand it is not just Israel that \nneeds to worry. We should be concerned by a nuclear Iran. The whole \nworld should be concerned by a nuclear Iran, and the Prime Minister is \ngoing to help explain why that is. For Israel's sake and ours, I for \none am very glad he is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/03/senate-section/article/S1224-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last December, rightfully, the National \nLabor Relations Board voted to make important changes to union election \nprocedures. Their rule changes are good for workers and businesses. \nThey modernize the election process and help prevent delays and \nfrivolous litigation.\n  I am sure there are some businesses that oppose this, but I haven't \nfound them. This is simply a problem that has been engendered by the \nRepublicans in the Senate. They are trying to roll back these reforms \ninstead of supporting the rights of workers. The reforms they made are \nso basic, such as using email and using other processes such as a fax \nmachine and using the employers' records, not the unions' records.\n  Later this afternoon the Senate will consider a Republican-introduced \nresolution of disapproval which seeks to undo the NLRB's rules changes. \nThis is yet another sad reminder of how little regard Republicans have \nfor the American worker.\n  Last year we saw Republicans vote against an increase in the minimum \nwage, as well as legislation that would ensure American women get the \nsame pay for doing the same work as men. Republicans in Congress I \ndon't think get it.\n  We are in this building, in this Chamber, to help the American people \nand want to work to make sure businesses are prosperous, but we also \ncan't lose sight of the fact that workers are what makes the businesses \nprofitable.\n  So if you are for American workers and the families they support, \nthen prove it with your vote on this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/03/senate-section/article/S1224-4", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1224-S1225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am here this morning to engage in a \ncolloquy with the good Senator from South Carolina. We will be joined \nby the Senators from New Hampshire and Kentucky and perhaps the Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  The purpose of the colloquy is to welcome Prime Minister Netanyahu \nthis morning--who will be speaking in front of Congress--and to talk \nabout why it is so important he is joining us today.\n  In a few moments we will hear remarks from Israeli Prime Minister \nBenjamin Netanyahu in the House Chamber and welcome him to Congress to \naffirm the friendship between the people of the United States and the \npeople of Israel and to assess the threats facing our two democracies.\n  Actually, today's speech is not unusual. This is the 115th time that \na foreign leader has addressed a joint session of Congress. This is the \nseventh time an Israeli Prime Minister will address a joint session of \nCongress. It is Prime Minister Netanyahu's third address to Congress.\n  It is not surprising we are hearing from the leader of our ally, \nIsrael. Israel is a democracy in a neighborhood of authoritarian \ngovernments. Prime Minister Netanyahu speaks the language of freedom \nwith us today. There can be no doubt of his passion on behalf of the \npeople he represents and that makes us take his message very seriously.\n  So this joint session is not unusual nor surprising, but that does \nnot mean that it is unimportant. In fact, today's speech is profoundly \nimportant. The partnership between the United States and Israel is \ncritical for the security of the Middle East and the world. We need a \nstrong U.S.-Israeli partnership to stop Iran from developing a nuclear \nweapon. We need a strong U.S.-Israeli partnership to stand against the \nextremism that is ripping apart nations across the Middle East. We need \na strong U.S.-Israeli partnership to demonstrate the value of \ndemocracy, human rights, and the rule of law for societies that are no \nlonger satisfied with dictatorships.\n  For all of these reasons it is good to have Prime Minister Netanyahu \nhere today. It is good to reaffirm the bond between Israelis and \nAmericans, and it is good to join hands again with an ally to stand \nagainst tyranny and extremism. I look forward to hearing from the Prime \nMinister because views directly from Israel are extremely important.\n  Since its birth in 1948, Israel has faced one security threat after \nanother. Israel's strength and vitality in the face of these threats \nare a testament to the ability of its people and its leaders to head \noff threats to security before they become impossible to overcome. \nThere is no substitute for the Israeli view of security in the Middle \nEast and the Iranian threat in particular.\n  So today represents an important moment to learn how Israel sees its \nown security and understand the next steps for the U.S.-Israeli \npartnership.\n  I now turn to my colleague from South Carolina and ask for his \ncomments about this important speech from the Prime Minister of Israel \ntoday.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate being on the floor with the \nSenator from North Dakota who has been very involved in trying to \nsecure America against a variety of threats.\n  I will get to the heart of the matter. Some people feel the Prime \nMinister should not be here at this time because in a couple weeks \nthere will be an election in Israel. They have a parliamentary system. \nThey do things differently--they vote for parties, not people--and they \nare having a real contest over there about who should be in charge and \nwhat coalitions will lead Israel.\n  I have a very simple comment: That is for Israelis to decide. They \ndecide who they want to run their country. They can vote for the party \nor groups of people who they think best represent their view of Israel. \nThat is their business, not mine. My business is to try to find out \nwhat is best for America when it comes to defending our Nation. That is \nwhy all of us are on the floor today.\n  I don't think I can adequately do my job if I don't hear from the \nPrime Minister of Israel, if he is willing to talk to me. Some people \nmay be able to do that. God bless you.\n  If someone feels as though now is the time to boycott this speech, if \nthey want to send a message about politics in Israel, be my guest. I am \ngoing to be at this speech to try to learn what to do regarding America \nand Israel concerning the nuclear threat.\n  Why do I think it is important for me to be there? I can't think of a \nbetter voice to tell me what would happen in the region if we get a bad \ndeal with the Iranians.\n  Israel is in the crosshairs of the Iranian ayatollahs--has been for \ndecades--threatening to destroy the State of Israel. I want to hear \nfrom the people on the ground, Israel in particular, as to what a good \ndeal would look like and what a bad deal would look like. I want to \nhear from the Prime Minister of Israel the consequences of a bad deal.\n  As to me, I do not trust this administration to negotiate a good \ndeal, but maybe I am wrong; and the best way to find out is for \nCongress to look at the deal. If it is a good deal, I will vote for it, \nbecause the Arabs and Israelis will tell us if this is something we can \nlive with. At the end of the day a good deal is a blessing for the \nworld, and a bad deal is a nightmare.\n  (Mr. COTTON assumed the Chair.)\n  So to the good Senator from North Dakota, I not only welcome the \nPrime Minister of Israel to speak to Congress, I am looking forward to \nit, because I hope to learn something that would make me a better \nSenator regarding our own national security. The only thing I can tell \nthe American people without any hesitation--ISIL is a threat to us, a \nthreat to the region. They are the most barbaric terrorist organization \nroaming the globe today. They represent a direct threat to our \nhomeland. But the threat they represent is a distant second to Iran \nhaving a nuclear weapon. That ought to tell you a lot about how I feel. \nIf I can watch TV, as you do every night, and see what ISIL is doing to \nChristians and others throughout the region and say that is secondary \nto Iran, I hope that means something. It means a lot to me. Because if \nIranians get a nuclear weapon, then every Arab in the region who can \nafford one is going to get a nuclear weapon, and we are on our way to \nArmageddon.\n  North Korea in the making is what I worry about. The same people who \nare negotiating this deal were negotiating the North Korean deal. \nCongress was absent. Now it is time for Congress to be involved and say \nwhether this is a good deal. I have legislation with Senator Corker and \nsix Democrats and six Republicans asking that Congress review any deal, \nand I would be curious to see what the Prime Minister thinks about \nthat.\n  So in summary, this would be the most important decision we make as a \nbody, how to deal with the Iranian nuclear threat. This will be the \nmost important issue I will deal with as a U.S. Senator, and I have \nbeen here almost 20 years. The consequence of a bad deal is an absolute \nnightmare.\n  If you were to relieve the sanctions tomorrow and gave the Iranians \nthe money they were due under sanction relief, do you think they would \nbuild schools and hospitals or would they continue to pour money into \ntheir\n\n[[Page S1226]]\n\nmilitary to disrupt the region and continue to build ICBMs? As I speak, \nwithout a nuclear weapon Iran is leading an offensive today in Iraq. \nAnd I know the Presiding Officer of the Senate was a ranger, an \ninfantryman in Iraq. Could you ever imagine in your wildest dreams that \nthe Iraqi security forces are marrying up with Shia militia and \nSuleimani, the head of the Revolutionary Guard is on the ground in Iraq \nleading the efforts, and we are sitting on the sidelines? You talk \nabout a screwed-up foreign policy.\n  Are we going to let eight guys negotiate with Iran--the people who \nbrought you Iraq and Syria and the mess you see in the region? You feel \ngood enough about them doing a deal with the Iranians that you don't \neven look at the deal yourself? This is beyond screwed up, and the \nworst is yet to come. A bad deal. But, maybe the best is yet to come, a \ngood deal. I don't know. But I want to hear what Israel believes a good \ndeal would look like. And if you don't want to hear that, then, boy, we \nare on different planets as to the consequences of what is going on in \nthe world today.\n  With that, I would ask a question to the Senator from New Hampshire, \nwho has been watching the Iranian behavior on the ground throughout the \nMiddle East and the missile program in particular, and ask her what are \nher concerns about Iran with extra money coming into the coffers in \nsanction relief?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank the Senator from North Dakota and the Senator \nfrom South Carolina.\n  As I look at where we are right now--first of all, our support for \nIsrael and our friendship with Israel--this has been a very strong \nbipartisan issue, and it is an issue that rightly crosses party lines \nbecause we share the same values, the relationship is very important, \nwe share technology, we share intelligence, and we share the concern \nthat we do not want the world's worst regime to obtain the world's most \ndestructive weapon, and that is the Iranian regime.\n  So I want to welcome Prime Minister Netanyahu to the Congress and \nvery much listen to what he has to say, because he comes to us in a \nvery important time where the administration is negotiating a potential \nagreement with Iran. What we want most of all is that that agreement \nwill end Iran's nuclear program and be a real, verifiable, transparent \nagreement, because a good agreement is a blessing, a bad agreement is a \nnightmare. We have to hear from the Prime Minister of Israel, and I \nlook forward to hearing what he has to say today about what a good \nagreement looks like.\n  But make no mistake about why we must stop the Iranian regime from \nhaving a nuclear weapon. Because what they are doing around the world \nright now--they are the largest State sponsor of terrorism in the \nworld. They have essentially destabilized the Government of Yemen \nthrough their support of the Houthis there. They have been supporting \nHezbollah, a terrorist organization. They have been helping the Assad \nregime murder its own people. They have been participating in cyber \nattacks against our interests. This is a regime that has said they want \nto wipe Israel off the map. I can understand--and I want to hear from \nthe Prime Minister of Israel--why the people of Israel would say \n``never again'' when they hear those words.\n  But make no mistake, this is not just about the security of Israel; \nthis is about our security in the United States of America. They have \ncalled us ``the great Satan,'' and this is an issue that represents a \nthreat to our core national security interests, to allow state-\nsponsored terrorism to obtain the most destructive weapon in the world. \nThat is a danger we cannot afford in our country. It is one of concern. \nIt is important that we share with our strong ally, Israel. We need to \ndo everything we can in this Congress on a bipartisan basis to ensure \nthat never happens. That is why I am honored to be a sponsor of \nbipartisan legislation that would give the Congress a say on this very \nimportant issue, because we worked together to put together some of the \ntoughest sanctions that actually brought the Iranians to the \nnegotiating table. We should not lift the sanctions that have been put \ntogether on a bipartisan basis without ensuring that this is a good \nagreement that will end their nuclear program. When I say end it, I \ndon't mean end it for a decade, I mean end it permanently, because Iran \nhas been engaged in terrorist activity for longer than a decade. So \nthis is something we have to make sure is a transparent, verifiable \nagreement.\n  I would also add we cannot have a situation where we have a splitup. \nThere has been a discussion about a year breakout period in this \nagreement. I would like to hear what the Prime Minister thinks about \nthat, because my concern about that is this will lead to the situation \nmy colleague from South Carolina talked about, where we have a Sunni-\nShia nuclear arms race in the Middle East, where everyone seeks to \nenrich uranium and to have a breakout period. That results in more \nproliferation of nuclear weapons in a way that makes the world less \nsafe and endangers the United States of America.\n  So today we welcome Prime Minister Netanyahu. I very much look \nforward to listening carefully to what he has to say. This is a \nbipartisan issue. This is about the security of the United States of \nAmerica. This is obviously about our strong friendship with Israel. We \nare aligned in ensuring that Iran does not have a nuclear weapon and \nensuring that we work together to stop their support of terrorism \naround the world, that we work together to end their ICBM program, \nwhich the estimates are they could hit the east coast of the United \nStates of America by 2015 if they continue on this path. This is about \nus, this is about our relationship with Israel, and I very much look \nforward to hearing the Prime Minister today.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I wish to thank our colleague from New \nHampshire and I would like to return to the Senator from South Carolina \nand pose a question.\n  I have been a supporter of the strong sanctions the Senator put in \nplace with the Kirk-Menendez legislation the Senator from South \nCarolina was very involved with. During these negotiations those \nsanctions have been relaxed by the administration, which I think is of \ngreat concern. I think the biggest deterrent to Iran pursuing a nuclear \nweapon is the sanctions we put in place with our allies.\n  So now as the administration negotiates this agreement, my colleague \nfrom South Carolina and others on a bipartisan basis have put forward \nlegislation requiring that that agreement would come to this body for \nan up-or-down vote. I would like him to describe that effort and why it \nis so important and why the speech today with the Prime Minister goes \nto the heart of that very important matter.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I think the legislation the Senator from North Dakota \ndescribed is the most important thing we will do this year. The \nsanctions against Iran, congressionally created, were 100 to 0. Every \nMember of the Senate believed the Iranians needed to be sanctioned for \nthe mischief they have created and for their nuclear ambitions to stop \ntheir march toward a nuclear weapon.\n  The administration objected, but 100 Members of this body voted for \nthose sanctions. If there is a deal with the Iranians, and I hope there \nis a good deal, the diplomatic solution to this problem is preferred by \neveryone. It is a simple concept. Before the sanctions Congress created \ncan be lifted, Congress has to look at the deal and have a say. Under \nthe 1, 2, 3 sections of the Atomic Energy Act there is a provision that \nallows for Congress to approve commercial nuclear deals between the \nUnited States and another country when nuclear technology is shared. We \nhave done that 24 times, but Congress had to approve nuclear deals \nbetween the United States and other nations, including Russia, China, \nArgentina, and that rogue country called Canada. I can't imagine \nwanting to look at a deal with Canada but not wanting to take a look at \na deal with Iran.\n  This bipartisan legislation is very simple. Any deal negotiated with \nthe P5+1 will come to the Senate and the House to be disapproved--not \napproved. Now I did that to accommodate my Democratic colleagues. There \nis concern that with 54 Republicans that we hate Obama so much we would \njust reject the deal because we don't like him. Well, I am not in that \ncamp. I don't like President Obama's foreign policy, but I hope I am \nsmart enough to understand that a good deal is a blessing. I\n\n[[Page S1227]]\n\nwould like to think I have some track record of doing what I think is \nbest for the country. So if it is a good deal, Israel and the Arabs \nwill tell us, and I will gladly vote to approve it. But the construct, \nI say to Senator Hoeven, is that to disapprove the deal, you have to \nget 60 votes. That means some Democratic colleagues have to join with \nRepublicans to say this is not good enough, go back and try again. It \nis not that we want to end negotiations; we don't want to legitimize an \nindustrial-strength nuclear program that is on the verge of a breakout \nsuch as North Korea in the making. We are not going to sit on the \nsidelines where a deal is negotiated where they have thousands of \ncentrifuges and the only thing between them and a nuclear breakout is \nthe United Nations. That did not work well in North Korea. We are not \ngoing to do that again.\n  So we are going to look at the deal. I think every Senator should \nwant to look at the deal, and it allows your constituents to have a \nsay. Not one person is having any input regarding the P5+1 talks. But \nif it comes back to the Congress, you have a person you can call. You \ncan pick up the phone and call your Member of the House and Senate. You \ncan say something about the deal because you are affected. It is not \njust Israel that is in the crosshairs of these people, it is us, the \nUnited States.\n  I worry they would share the technology with a terrorist organization \nand it would work its way here. Name one weapon they developed that \nthey haven't shared with terrorists. This bipartisan approach is sound. \nIt is consistent with what we have done 24 different times with other \nnations, and I hope we can have an overwhelming vote here soon.\n  Do your best job. Let us look at it. If it is a good deal, we will \nvote yes, and if it is a bad deal we will vote no, and try harder to \nget another deal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority's time has expired.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds to \nwrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I wish to thank my colleagues from South Carolina and New \nHampshire. This is a bipartisan effort to join with the administration, \nand on a matter of this importance I believe Congress must be involved. \nSo, again, we appeal to our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nto join with us on this effort.\n  I will conclude by saying we look forward very much to having the \nPrime Minister speak to us this morning.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/03/senate-section/article/S1227-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, at 11 a.m. this morning there will be a \nhistoric joint session of Congress. Usually a leader from some other \ncountry speaking at a joint session of Congress doesn't make history. \nIt has happened over 100 times. I have attended many of those during \nthe time I have served in the House and the Senate. What is historic \nabout this session is that it was called unilaterally by the Republican \nSpeaker of the House, John Boehner. Usually and consistently, joint \nsessions of Congress have been called on a bipartisan basis and in most \ncases involve the administration and executive branch. In this case \nSpeaker Boehner made history his own way by saying he would announce a \njoint session of Congress welcoming the Prime Minister of Israel.\n  I also checked with the Senate Historian, and it turns out there is \nanother piece of history being made today. He can find no precedent \nwhere Members of Congress came forward from both the House and the \nSenate and announced publicly they would not attend a joint session of \nCongress, and that has happened today.\n  That is a personal and private decision by each Member of Congress as \nto whether they wish to attend the joint session this morning. I am \ngoing to attend it primarily because of my respect for the State of \nIsrael and the fact that throughout my public career in the House and \nSenate, I have valued the bipartisan support of Israel which I found in \nboth the House and the Senate.\n  I am proud that it was President Harry Truman--a Democrat--who was \nthe first Executive in the world to recognize the nation of Israel. I \nam proud that throughout history Democratic and Republican Presidents \nalike have supported the State of Israel, and I have tried to do the \nsame as a Member of the U.S. House and Senate.\n  This meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu comes at an awkward \nmoment. He is 2 weeks away from a national election in Israel. Some \nhave questioned the timing of this. I will not raise that question \nbecause I don't know the political scene in Israel. I don't know if \nthis visit helps him or hurts him, but it is, in fact, 2 weeks away \nfrom this important election.\n  What we all agree on, I hope, both Democrats and Republicans, is one \nstarting point: A nuclear Iran is unacceptable. We have to do \neverything we can to stop that possibility because it would invite an \narms race in the Middle East--many other countries would race to become \nnuclear powers, and that would be destabilizing--and also because we \nknow the agenda of Iran. It has been engaged in terrorist activities \nthroughout the Middle East and around the world. Putting a nuclear \nweapon in the hands of a country that is dedicated to terrorism is the \nkind of concern that I hope all of us share when we look to the future.\n  As Democrats and Republicans gather for the joint session, we are in \ncommon purpose: to stop the development of a nuclear Iran. What \ntroubles me greatly is the criticisms I have heard on this floor and in \nthe past week or two about the Obama administration and this issue. \nPresident Obama has made it clear from the start that he is opposed to \nhaving a nuclearized Iran. In fact, it was President Obama, using his \npower as President, who has really brought together the sanctions \nregime that is working to bring Iran to the negotiating table. He \ndidn't do it alone, as one of my colleagues from South Carolina noted. \nThere were times when Congress wanted to push harder than the \nPresident. But we have to concede the obvious: Were it not for the \nPresident's dogged determination, we would not have this alliance, this \ncoalition imposing sanctions on Iran today that have made a difference \nand brought Iran to the negotiating table. Give President Obama credit \nfor that. Whether it is Prime Minister Netanyahu or the Republicans, \nwho are generally critical of the President, at least acknowledge the \nobvious. The President made his position clear that he opposes a \nnuclear Iran, and he made it clear that he would put his resources and \nenergy into building a coalition to stop that possibility.\n  Secondly, it is this President's leadership which has created the \nIron Dome defense--the missile defense--which has protected Israel. \nThat has been a very effective defense mechanism. I know that as \nchairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, we appropriated \nhundreds of millions of dollars for that protection. President Obama \ninitiated--if not initiated, was an early supporter of this effort and \nhas funded it throughout his Presidency, and now it has kept Israel \nsafe. I hope the Republicans and Prime Minister Netanyahu will give the \nadministration credit for that effort to keep their nation safe.\n  I will also say about negotiations that here is the reality: We have \ncountries around the world joining us in a regime to impose sanctions \non Iran in order to bring Iran to the negotiating table, and they are \nthere. The negotiations are at a delicate moment--literally weeks away \nfrom seeing whether we can move forward. I hope they are successful. \nThe President has said at best there is a 50/50 chance of success. It \nis just that challenging. But let's consider what the alternative will \nbe if negotiations fail.\n\n[[Page S1228]]\n\n  First, if we can reach an agreement, we have to verify it. We can't \ntake the word of Iran. We need to make certain that when they promise \nthey will destroy certain equipment, they will not go forward in \ndeveloping a nuclear weapon, we can verify that. Without verification, \nthe agreement is worthless, and the President has said as much.\n  Let's assume the worst case: Either the negotiations break down or \nthe verification proves Iran did not negotiate in good faith. What then \nis the alternative? Well, if the coalition that imposed the sanctions \nbelieves we made good-faith efforts to bring Iran to a peaceful place \nand they failed, then we can continue the sanctions regime and put more \npressure on them to move forward to a good solution. But if there is a \nfeeling among our coalition that we have not negotiated in good faith, \nthat we didn't make an honest effort to find common ground with Iran \nthat avoids nuclearizing, we could lose the sanctions regime, and then \nit would become next to impossible to put the pressure on Iran to make \nthem change.\n  What the President is trying to do is to achieve through negotiations \na peaceful end to this global challenge and secondly to make sure the \nsanctions regime--the countries that have joined us, P5+1 and others--\nwill continue to believe we are operating in good faith and continue to \nsupport us. The alternative is to allow Iran to develop a nuclear \nweapon. That is unthinkable. If it starts to occur, there will be a \nmilitary response, and it will be deadly. I don't know the scope or \nnature of it. There is no way to guess. But we understand what it would \nmean if military action is taken against Iran because of the \ndevelopment of these nuclear weapons.\n  Let me also say that I am considering and reviewing the so-called \nCorker-Menendez proposal that the Congress will review any agreement \nthat is reached with the Iranians. I have not reached a decision yet \nbecause I think it raises a serious and important question of policy \nand the Constitution. We know that if we are dealing with a treaty, it \nis up to the Senate to step forward and approve such a treaty. But this \nis not a treaty; this is in the nature of an agreement. We have had \nnuclear arms agreements in the past that were not subject to \ncongressional approval. We have had agreements on the environment and \nother issues that were not subject to congressional approval. I need to \nlook and review carefully whether the Corker-Menendez legislation that \nhas been proposed is a reasonable assertion of congressional authority.\n  I will also add that it is obvious--and I wish to state it because it \nwas raised as a question in the earlier comments--any congressionally \nimposed sanctions will require congressional action to suspend them. \nUltimately, Congress has the last word on sanctions we have put into \nlaw. I don't think there is any question about that. Those sanctions \nimposed by the executive branch the President may remove or change by \nExecutive order should he choose, but the congressional authority to \ncontinue sanctions or even propose new ones is not diminished by any \nagreement which is reached by the President.\n  Earlier I listened to the majority leader as he came to the floor and \nspoke about a number of issues. I would like to address one of the \nissues he raised in criticism of the President. He criticized the \nPresident for proposing the closure of Guantanamo as a prison for those \nwho we suspect are engaged in terrorism. The President's position on \nthis has been very clear, and I have supported it for two reasons. \nFirst, we know Guantanamo has become a symbol around the world--a \nsymbol which has been used against the United States when they want to \nrecruit terrorists to attack our country. I think Guantanamo has \noutlived its usefulness and should be closed.\n  The second point is one that is very obvious. We have over 300 \nconvicted terrorists currently serving their time in the existing \nFederal prison system. In Federal prisons across this Nation, including \nmy State of Illinois, we have convicted terrorists who are reporting to \ntheir cells every day and are no threat to the community at large. They \nare being handled in a professional, thoughtful way by the men and \nwomen who work for the Bureau of Prisons, and there has never been any \nquestion as to whether the terrorists in this system are somehow a \nthreat to this country. In fact, they are well contained and have been \nfor a long time.\n  The alternative at Guantanamo is one that even fiscal conservatives \nought to think about twice. We are currently spending up to $3 million \nper Guantanamo prisoner each year to incarcerate them--almost $3 \nmillion a prisoner. What does it cost to keep the most dangerous \nprisoners in the Federal prison system in the maximum security prisons? \nNo more than $60,000 a year--$60,000 to keep them in the Federal prison \nsystem and $3 million to keep them in Guantanamo. It is 50 times the \ncost, if my calculations are correct. That suggests to me a horrible \nwaste of money--money that could be better spent to keep America safe \nrather than maintain this symbol of Guantanamo.\n  Secondly, an argument was made by the majority leader earlier that we \nmade the mistake of bringing our troops home from Iraq and Afghanistan. \nI disagree. This notion of a permanent army of occupation by the United \nStates in the Middle East is certainly not one that I welcome. We need \nto encourage those countries--Iraq and Afghanistan--to develop their \nown capacity to protect their own countries. The United States can be \nhelpful. We can provide support. But ultimately we have to call on \nthese countries to step forward and to defend themselves with our \nsupport so long as they are fighting the forces of terrorism.\n  I see my colleague Senator Menendez is on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I appreciate my distinguished colleague \nyielding some time to me.\n  I rise in anticipation of the speech of our ally and our partner, \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, to the soon-to-be joint \nmeeting of Congress.\n  I agree with many of my colleagues that the political timing of the \nPrime Minister's speech to the Congress is a challenging one and one \nthat didn't derive itself under the best of circumstances. But I also \nthink very clearly that it is important to listen to what the elected \nleader of the people of Israel--the one true democracy in the Middle \nEast, a major trading partner of the United States, a major security \nally of the United States, and the one country most likely to be voting \nwith us in common cause in international forums--has to say.\n  There is a history here that I think drives the leader of the Jewish \npeople to the circumstances in which he feels so passionately about the \nsecurity of his country. If you traveled to Israel, as I have, and I \nthink many Members here have as well, here is a country in which you \ncan go from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem on a good day in 45 minutes. It is a \ncountry which--if you fly its width, it would take just a couple of \nminutes. It is a country which has its back to the sea and which is \nsurrounded by neighbors who, generally speaking, are hostile. It is a \ncountry whose people have a history in which there are those who have \nsought to annihilate them. Maybe we cannot fathom those challenges, but \nthose are the challenges of the people of Israel. So when you have an \nissue such as Iran's march toward nuclear weapons, you have an \nunderstanding of why the people of Israel have a concern for the \nexistential threat that Iran, if it achieves nuclear weapons, is \nultimately capable of creating.\n  I have worked as hard as anyone else. As a matter of fact, I started \nmy focus on Iran when I was in the House of Representatives and found \nout that the United States was sending voluntary contributions to the \nInternational Atomic Energy Administration beyond our membership dues \nto do what? To create operational capacity of the Bushehr nuclear \nfacility--not in the national interest and security of the United \nStates, not in the interest of our ally, the State of Israel, and I led \na drive to stop those voluntary contributions.\n  Since then--it has been almost 20 years now--I have been following \nIran's march toward nuclear power, not for peaceful purposes--because, \nlet's be honest, a country that has one of the\n\n[[Page S1229]]\n\nworld's largest oil and other reserves doesn't need nuclear power for \ndomestic consumption, and because of what we clearly believe was the \nmilitarization of its efforts at Parchin that, in fact, there were \npurposes that were not benign.\n  We all hope for a deal. Although today when Foreign Minister Zarif \nsaid in response to President Obama's comments that 10 years should be \nthe minimum timeframe for a deal, he--Foreign Minister Zarif--said that \nis unacceptable, illogical, and excessive, that is a problem.\n  So I look forward to listening to what the Prime Minister has to say \nabout the challenge to all of us--our national security and to Israel's \nnational security--and to understand all of the dimensions, historical \nand otherwise, so we can conclude and make our own judgments. If Prime \nMinister Cameron can come here and lobby the Congress on sanctions, \nwhich is fine with me, then I think it is also fair to listen to what \nthe Prime Minister of Israel has to say, and I look forward to hearing \nwhat he has to say.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/03/senate-section/article/S1229-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will now report the joint \nresolution.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 8) providing for \n     congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United \n     States Code, of the rule submitted by the National Labor \n     Relations Board relating to representation case procedures.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to the Congressional Review Act, \nthere will now be up to 10 hours for debate, equally divided between \nthose favoring and those opposing the joint resolution.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to \ndiscuss the Congressional Review Act resolution that Senator McConnell, \nthe Republican leader, Senator Enzi, the Senator from Wyoming, and I \nhave filed to stop a new National Labor Relations Board rule. Last \nDecember, the National Labor Relations Board issued a\n\n[[Page S1230]]\n\nfinal rule that shortened the time between when pro-union organizers \nask an employer for a secret ballot election and when that election \nactually takes place.\n  I refer to this as the ``ambush election rule,'' because it forces a \nunion election before an employer has the chance to figure out what is \ngoing on. Even worse, it jeopardizes employees' privacy by requiring \nemployers to turn over employees' personal information, including email \naddresses, phone numbers, shift hours, and locations to union \norganizers.\n  This action by the National Labor Relations Board, which increasingly \nhas become a union advocate instead of umpiring disputes between \nemployees and employers, has attracted enormous attention across this \ncountry. I have letters from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the \nCoalition for a Democratic Workplace, the National Council of Chain \nRestaurants, the National Retail Federation, the Retail Industry \nLeaders Association, Associated Builders and Contractors, the American \nLodging and Hotel Association, HR Policy Association, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the Society for Human Resource \nManagement, the Associated General Contractors of America--173 total \norganizations that have registered their deep concern about this ambush \nelection rule.\n  Senator Enzi is already on the floor. He has for many years fought \nthis battle. We want the American people to understand why the ambush \nelection rule is such a bad idea, why it is so unfair to employers, \nforcing them to have a union election before they can figure out what \nis going on. For the same reason, it is unfair to employees. Employees \nhave to vote in a union election before they have a chance to hear both \nsides.\n  Here is how the procedure will work. If a majority of the Senate \napproves this resolution, it will then go to the House for a vote. If \nit passes both chambers, the President can veto the resolution. It will \ntake two-thirds of the Senate to override that veto.\n  If the NLRB's new rule is disapproved, the Board cannot issue a \nsubstantially similar rule without congressional approval. The question \nI would ask is: What is the rush? What is the problem here? Today, more \nthan 95 percent of union elections occur within 56 days of the petition \nfiling. But under this new rule, elections could take place in as few \nas 11 days. This rule will harm employers and employees alike. If you \nare an employer that is ambushed by that 11-day election, here is how \nit works. On day 1, you get a faxed copy of an election petition that \nhas been filed at your local NLRB regional office stating that 30 \npercent of your employees support a union.\n  The union may have already been quietly trying to organize for months \nwithout your knowledge. Your employees have only been able to hear the \nunion's point of view. By day 2 or 3, you must publicly post an \nelection notice in your workplace. If you communicate to your employees \nelectronically, you have to publish the notice online as well. By noon \non day 7 you must file with the NLRB what is called a statement of \nposition. This is a comprehensive document in which an employer sets \nout legal positions and claims in writing. Under the NLRB's new rule, \nyou waive your rights to use any legal arguments not raised in this \ndocument. So it should be pretty obvious that by day 7 you will have to \nhave a lawyer on hand. You probably need that lawyer on hand on day 2, \nand hopefully on day 1, because if you make any mistakes in the lead-up \nto the election, the NLRB might set aside the result and order a rerun \nelection. Worse, if a bigger mistake is made, it could require an \nemployer to automatically bargain with the union.\n  Now think about the real world. At our hearing before the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, a representative of the \nNational Federation of Independent Businesses testified. She said there \nare 350,000 independent business owners in the NFIB, with an average of \n10 employees. So you have small businesses all over America. They do \nnot sit around with labor lawyers; they do not have money to hire labor \nlawyers. They are expected to know in a day or two exactly what to do \nabout a complicated petition before the NLRB because of this ambush \nelection rule that could cause the election to happen within 11 days.\n  On day 7, you must also present the union and the NLRB with a list of \nprospective voters as well as their job classifications, shifts, and \nwork locations.\n  Now if you are a business with five, six, seven, eight employees, you \nare going to be spending your time working on this union matter. Your \ncustomers might want your services. They might want on-time deliveries. \nAll of a sudden, you are running around trying to find a labor lawyer, \ntrying to avoid making mistakes, so you can deal with this ambush \nelection.\n  On day 8, a pre-election hearing is held at the NLRB regional office \nand an election day is set. By day 10, the employer must present the \nunion with a list of employee names, personal email addresses, personal \ncell phone numbers, and home addresses. You have to hand this \ninformation over, even if the employees object.\n  Day 11 is the earliest day on which the NLRB can conduct the election \nunder the new rule. The union has the power to postpone an election by \nan additional 10 days, but the employer has no corresponding power. The \nunion has ambushed the employer and has the power to postpone the \nelection, but the employer has no similar right.\n  Under this new NLRB rule, before the hearing on day 8, an employer \nwill have less than 1 week to do the following things:\n  Figure out what an election petition is. For most of those hundreds \nof thousands of small businesses with five, six, eight employees, they \nmight have no idea what it is.\n  Find legal representation. Finding a lawyer is not just a matter of \nlooking in a phone book, it is a matter of finding a lawyer with whom \nyou are comfortable, whom you trust, and whom you know has some \nability. That may take a while, particularly if you are not a large \ncompany and you are not accustomed to labor relations litigation.\n  Determine legal positions on the relevant issues--learning what \nstatements and actions the law permits and prohibits.\n  Communicate with employees about the decision they are making.\n  Correct any misstatements and falsehoods that employees may be \nhearing from union organizers.\n  As I mentioned earlier, making even the slightest mistake in the \nlead-up to an election can result in the NLRB setting aside the results \nand ordering a rerun election, or worse, when a bigger mistake is made, \nthe Board could require an employer to automatically bargain with the \nunion.\n  But it is the employees who stand to lose the most under the new \nrule. First, some of the employees may know what is going on before the \nunion files its notice of an election. But all of the employees do not \nhave a chance to hear both sides of the issue in an ambush election.\n  Second, because of the ambush, employees may have only heard half the \nstory. Only 4.3 percent of union elections occur more than 56 days \nafter the petition is filed. The current median number of days between \nthe filing of an election is 38 days. These figures are well within the \nNLRB's own goals for timely elections.\n  The unions won 64 percent of elections in 2013. In recent years the \nunion win rate has actually been going up. What is the rush? Why is 38 \ndays too long? It is well within the NLRB's own goals and unions are \nwinning more elections than they lose.\n  Let's turn to 1959, when a former Member of this body, Senator John \nF. Kennedy, warned against rushing employees into elections in a debate \nover amendments to the National Labor Relations Act. This is what he \nsaid:\n\n       There should be at least a 30-day interval between the \n     request for an election and the holding of the election in \n     which both parties can present their viewpoints.\n\n  Senator John F. Kennedy, April 21, 1959.\n  If Senator Kennedy thought 30 days was approximately right, if 38 \ndays is the mean today, and if that is within the NLRB's own goals, why \nthe rush? Why the push for an ambush election? Why have an election \nthat can be set in 11 days before employers and employees know what is \ngoing on?\n  When a workplace is unionized, especially in a State that has no \nright-to-\n\n[[Page S1231]]\n\nwork law, employees have dues money taken out of every paycheck whether \nthey like it or not. They lose the ability to deal directly with their \nemployers to address concerns or ask for a promotion or a raise. \nInstead, employees have to work through the union. Important \nconsiderations, such as which of their fellow employees will be \nincluded in a bargaining unit, will no longer be determined before the \nelection. As the two dissenting members of the NLRB put it when this \nrule was decided: Employees will be asked to ``vote now, understand \nlater.''\n  I wish to emphasize what the employees are losing, in addition to the \nopportunity to fully understand the election before them. Employees are \nlosing their privacy, because the rule requires employers to hand over \nemployees' personal email addresses, cell phone numbers, shift hours \nand locations, job classifications, even if the employees have made \nclear they do not want to be contacted by union organizers.\n  Some on the other side say: It is the modern age. But I would say \nthat in the modern age our privacy is assaulted from every side. We \nshould be even more careful about rushing an election and releasing \npersonal information. Employers should not have to hand over employees' \npersonal email address, cell phone numbers, shift locations, and job \nclassifications just because a petition is filed by 30 percent of the \nemployees. Many employees may have no interest in creating a union.\n  This rule appears to be a solution in search of a problem. It is \nclear to see it is wrong, and that is why Senators Enzi, McConnell, and \nI are asking the Senate to disapprove it today and prohibit the NLRB \nfrom issuing any similar rule.\n  I will come back to the floor during our debate time to talk about \nhow this rule is part of the National Labor Relations Board's attempt \nto become more advocate than umpire. That is the reason Senator \nMcConnell and I have introduced legislation that would change the \nNational Labor Relations Board back from an advocate to an umpire by \ndoing three things. First, it would end partisan advocacy by creating a \nsix-member board of three Republicans and three Democrats where a \nmajority would require both sides to find middle ground. Second, the \nlegislation would rein in the general counsel. Businesses and unions \nwould be able to challenge complaints filed by the general counsel in \nFederal district court. Third, it would encourage timely decisions. \nEither party in a case before the Board may appeal to the Federal court \nof appeals if the Board fails to reach a decision within 1 year.\n  When I come back to the floor I will also talk about the joint \nemployer standard and the NLRB's decision to destroy more than 700,000 \nAmerican franchise businesses. These men and women operate health \nclubs, barbershops, auto parts shops, childcare centers, neighborhood \nrestaurants, music stores, cleaning services, and much more.\n  Combine the attack on franchises with the ambush election rule and an \nNLRB decision allowing micro-unions--where unions target small units in \na large company--and we see there is a consistent trend by unions and \ntheir friends in the NLRB to tip the balance in ways never intended by \nthe creators of the National Labor Relations Act.\n  The National Labor Relations Board is supposed to be an umpire, not \nan advocate. If there ever was an example of unfairness and tipping the \nbalance in a single direction, it would be the ambush election rule. \nThe rule allows union organizers to ambush an unsuspecting company and \nforce an election in 11 days--before the employer and its employees \nhave time to figure out what is going on.\n  In conclusion, I think Senator Kennedy's advice is good advice to \nfollow. Much has changed since 1959, but fairness, balance, and giving \neveryone a chance to have an opportunity to know what is going on have \nnot. Senator Kennedy thought 30 days was about right, and 38 days is \nthe mean today. This ambush election rule would reduce it to 11.\n  That is the wrong thing to do, and I hope the majority in the Senate \nagrees with me on that. I hope the House agrees with us on that. I hope \nthe President will agree with us on that. If he vetoes it, as he has \nsaid today he will, then I hope a majority of both parties will speak \nup for employers and employees in the United States and say no ambush \nelections for us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I believe that real long-term economic \ngrowth is built from the middle out, not from the top down, and our \ngovernment has a role to play in investing in working families, making \nsure they have the opportunity to work hard and succeed and offering a \nhand up to those who want to climb the economic ladder and provide a \nbetter life for themselves and their families. Our government and our \neconomy should be working for all families, not just the wealthiest \nfew.\n  Thankfully, we have had the opportunity to put some policies into \nplace over the past few years that have pulled our economy back from \nthe brink and have started moving us in the right direction. We are not \nthere yet, but across the country businesses have now added almost 12 \nmillion new jobs over 59 straight months of job growth, including \nalmost 1 million manufacturing jobs. The unemployment rate is now under \n6 percent. Health care costs are growing at their lowest rate in almost \n50 years, while millions more families have access to affordable \ncoverage. The Federal budget deficit has been reduced by more than two-\nthirds since President Obama took office. Although some Republicans are \nnow threatening to bring this back, we have been able to move away from \nthe constant tea party-driven crisis and uncertainty that was \ndestroying jobs and holding our economy back.\n  We are headed in a good direction, and I am proud of the policies we \nfought for that helped us get here, but we have a whole lot more to do. \nOver the past few decades, working families have seen their incomes \nstagnate while the cost of living and health care and education has \ncontinued to go up. For most workers, wages have stayed flat or have \nfallen over the past five decades. According to the National Employment \nLaw Project, from 2009 to 2013 hourly wages declined by 3.4 percent. \nDuring that time low- and mid-wage workers experienced greater declines \nthan higher wage workers. That means that across our country today too \nmany families are struggling to make ends meet on rock-bottom wages and \npoor working conditions on the job.\n  While the middle class's share of America's prosperity is at an \nalltime low, the biggest corporations have posted record profits. \nCongress should be working on ways to build an economy that works for \nall of our families, not just those at the top. Unfortunately, once \nagain, instead of standing up for workers, my Republican colleagues are \nrushing to the defense of the biggest corporations that have an \ninterest in keeping wages low and denying workers a voice to improve \ntheir workplace.\n  Workers have a right to decide whether they want union \nrepresentation. To ensure they are able to exercise that right, the \nNational Labor Relations Board--or the NLRB--helps to make sure workers \nhave a fair up-or-down vote.\n  Unfortunately, too often big corporations take advantage of loopholes \nin the current election process to delay a vote on union \nrepresentation. Unnecessary litigation and excessive delays threaten \nthe rights of workers who want to have a free and fair election. In too \nmany cases big corporations take advantage of every possible \nopportunity and wasteful legal hurdle--sometimes on small \ntechnicalities--just to delay a vote.\n  Sometimes the confrontation and hostility during the election process \ncan be extreme. A study from the Center for Economic and Policy \nResearch found that among workers who openly advocate for a union \nduring an election campaign one in five is fired. Bureaucratic delays \nmake the problem worse. Another study--this one from UC Berkeley--found \nthe longer the delay before an election, the more likely the NLRB will \ncharge employers with attempts to tamper with the vote.\n  What is clear from that research is that delays only create more \nbarriers that deny workers their right to organize a union. The NLRB \nwas absolutely\n\n[[Page S1232]]\n\nright to carry out its mission to review and streamline its election \nprocess and to bring down those barriers for workers to get a fair vote \nbecause it is clear the current system is outdated and vulnerable to \nabuse.\n  As I have mentioned, the current election process is overburdened by \nunnecessary and wasteful litigation which drags out elections and puts \nworkers' rights on hold. Not only that, the election process for one \nregion of the country can be substantially different from another \nregion, and that adds to inefficiencies and a lot of confusion.\n  Workers have the right to vote on union representation in elections \nthat are efficient and free from unnecessary delays and wasteful stall \ntactics. So after a very rigorous review process, in December of last \nyear, the NLRB made reforms to their election procedures. These updates \nwill make modest but important changes to modernize and streamline the \nprocess. They will reduce unnecessary litigation on issues that will \nnot affect the outcome of the election. The new reforms will bring the \nelection process into the 21st century by letting employers and unions \nfile forms electronically. They will allow the use of more modern forms \nof communication to employees through their cell phones and their \nemails.\n  It is important to note that in many regions the NLRB has already \nadopted some of these much needed reforms to the election process, so \nwe know this can work. These reforms will simply standardized the best \npractices for the election process across regions, which will help all \nsides--all sides--know what to expect during the process to promote \nuniformity and predictability.\n  These changes aren't just good for the workers, but they are good for \nemployers by streamlining the process when workers file a petition to \nhave an election on whether to join a union, and the reforms will make \nsure all sides have the information they need.\n  I have laid out the improvements the new reforms will make, but let's \ntalk about what these guidelines will not do. The new process does not \nrequire elections to be held within any specific timeframe. I want to \nrepeat that because it is important. Contrary to what some of our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle are arguing, these new \nguidelines do not require elections to be held within any specific \ntimeframe. Not only that, but this rule does not in any way prevent \ncompanies from communicating their views about unionization. Employers \nare able to communicate extensively with their employees about union \nissues, and these reforms do nothing to stop that. Employers would \nstill be able to talk with their workers about what a union would mean \nfor their company.\n  The reforms simply make some commonsense updates to create a fair \nopportunity for workers to decide if they want union representation, \nbut some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle take great \noffense to these modest changes. Instead of standing up for workers \nacross the country who are struggling with stagnant wages and poor \nworking conditions, Republicans have chosen to challenge these \ncommonsense reforms with a resolution of disapproval, and that is why \nwe are here today.\n  Instead of talking about how to create jobs and help working families \nwho are struggling, Republicans would rather roll back workers' rights \nto gain a voice at the bargaining table. The Republicans' attempt to \nstop this rule through a resolution would have major consequences for \nbusinesses, for unions, and workers who want a fair election process.\n  Passing the resolution would not only prevent the NLRB from \nimplementing these commonsense reforms, but this resolution would take \nthe drastic step of also preventing the NLRB from adopting any similar \nelection rules in the future. So the outdated election process that \nleads today to frivolous litigation and delays would remain frozen in \ntime without further congressional action.\n  Let us be clear. This rule is simply about reducing unnecessary \nlitigation and allowing the use of cell phones and email. I have heard \nsome of my colleagues call this frontier justice. Everyone else calls \nit the 21st century.\n  By law workers have the right to join a union so they can have a \nvoice in the workplace. That is not an ambush, it is their right. It is \nguaranteed by the National Labor Relations Act and by the First \nAmendment of our Constitution. So when workers want to vote on whether \nto form a union, they aren't looking for special treatment, they are \nsimply trying to exercise their basic right. We, as a nation, should \nnot turn our back on empowering workers through collective bargaining, \nespecially because that is the very thing that has helped so many \nworkers climb into the middle class. Workers having a seat at the \nbargaining table is very critical to America's middle class. When more \nworkers can stand up for their rights or wage increases or making sure \ntheir workplaces are safer or they have access to health care, those \nthings get better for them.\n\n  In short, Americans are better able to share in the economic \nprosperity they have earned through their hard work. It is no \ncoincidence that when union membership was at its peak in the middle of \nthe last century, America's middle class grew strong. Collective \nbargaining is what gave workers the power to increase their wages. \nUnions helped workers get the training they needed to build their \nskills so they could advance on the job. They helped to make sure men \nand women had safe work places, and through collective bargaining \naccess to health care rose. Workers shared in our country's prosperity. \nAll of those benefits strengthen economic security for the middle class \nand for those working hard to get there.\n  In Congress, we need to continue to work to expand economic security \nfor more families. That should be our mission, to help move our country \nforward. This resolution would simply be a step backward. So instead of \nattacking workers who just want a voice in the workplace, I hope my \ncolleagues will reject this resolution. Instead, I really hope \nRepublicans will join with Democrats and work with us to protect \nworkers rights and increase wages and grow our Nation's middle class. I \ntruly hope we can break through the gridlock and work together on \npolicies that create jobs, expand our economic security, and generate a \nvery broad-based economic growth for our workers and our families, not \njust for the wealthiest few.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to object to another \nadministrative overreach. As I travel the country and Wyoming, that is \nwhat I hear about--the way this administration keeps overreaching. \nFortunately, there is a mechanism for us to object to the overreach; it \nis the Congressional Review Act. Very seldom can it be used. This is \none of those instances where it can. When it is published as a final \nrule, we have an opportunity to circulate a petition. If we get enough \nsignatures on it, we can have what we are having today, which is 10 \nhours of debate, with a vote up or down on whether that rule is what \nCongress intended--not what the administration intended but what \nCongress intended.\n  Unfortunately, when this rule was written, there was a provision that \nit went to the President. The President doesn't assign rules. Congress \nassigns rules, so Congress ought to have the final voice on whether a \nrule is appropriate. We don't. But we have a chance to voice it because \nwe are going to get 10 hours of debate to talk about this proposed rule \nby the National Labor Relations Board--a totally appointed board, not \nan elected board, three Democrats, two Republicans. If this were as \nmodest a change as we just heard, there would have been some common \nground that would have brought one or both of the Republicans along. \nThat has been a thing of the National Labor Relations Board in the past \nbut not anymore. Now the Republican members of this National Labor \nRelations Board are ambushed as well, and we come up with what we call \nthe ambush elections rule.\n  So I rise to encourage my colleagues to support the Congressional \nReview Act resolution of disapproval of the National Labor Relations \nBoard ambush elections rule. I again thank my friend Senator Alexander, \nthe chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, \nfor leading this resolution. Oversight of Federal agencies is one of \nthe most important duties of a committee chair, and I appreciate his \nwork and the way he goes about it.\n\n[[Page S1233]]\n\n  The National Labor Relations Board has proposed a rule that would \ndrastically alter the way union elections are held.\n  A union election is one of the most significant decisions employees \nwill have to decide at their workplace. It fundamentally alters their \nrelationship with their employer, with the men and women they work with \nevery day, and with the community. A union election means that small \nbusiness employers have to meet unfamiliar and complicated legal \nobligations, with serious consequences for failing to meet deadlines, \nfile specific documents, or assert their rights in the process.\n  The current process for holding union elections is both fair and \ntimely. It ensures that businesses and employers have the necessary \ntime to fully meet their legal requirements. It gives employees time to \neducate themselves about what unionization will mean for them and their \nfamilies and to investigate the union that would be representing them \nto ensure that it is consistent with their values and priorities.\n  Under the current process, the average time between when an election \npetition is filed and ballots are cast is only 38 days. That is under 6 \nweeks. And more than 95 percent of union elections are held within 2 \nmonths of an election petition.\n  The rule the National Labor Relations Board is pushing would squeeze \nunion elections into as few as 11 days. No, it doesn't require 11 days; \nit can shorten the time to as few as 11 days. That is just 11 days for \nemployees to learn about the union that would have overwhelming \ninfluence on the future of their work conditions and to learn about \nwhat unionization would mean in their workplace and what dues they \nwould have to pay. That is 11 days for employers to learn about their \nrights and requirements during the election, to collect information \nabout employees that must be submitted, to draw up the final documents, \nto ensure that they haven't missed anything, and to make their position \nclear to their employees--all that while running their business. It is \nnot enough time. The smaller the business, the more critical it is.\n  It is important to point out that a union that wants to organize in \nthe workplace isn't subjected to that timeline at all. A union can \nstart its campaign months in advance, maybe even years. Professional \nunion organizers can start making their pitch long before they intend \nto petition for an election. Organizers have plenty of time to figure \nout which employees are union supporters and which employees might be \non the fence but could be convinced. A union can take its time to \ncreate a narrative and build its case to workers, and it can do so \nwithout the business ever knowing. And then when the union decides the \ntime is right, it can petition for the election when it is most \nadvantageous for the union.\n  This is why we call it the ambush election rule--because if this rule \ngoes into effect, after a union has had months to build its case in its \nfavor, a business will only have a few days to respond. That is only a \nfew days to figure out what union officials have told employees; to \ndetermine if there are any misstatements, falsehoods, or misconceptions \nthat need to be addressed in what employees have been told; to make the \nemployer's position clear and answer any questions employees might \nhave; and to meet all their legal obligations under the union election \nprocess. But it is not so simple because under the rules, employers \nmust follow specific guidelines about what they can and cannot say and \neven who can say it.\n  I don't know any entrepreneurs who started a business because they \nwere excited about understanding the ins and outs of the National Labor \nRelations Act. That is why it is important to maintain the current \nsystem, which includes sufficient time for employers to study election \nprocedures, understand their legal requirements, and ensure they are \nmeeting their obligations to their employees. The National Labor \nRelations Board's rule will deny employers the necessary time to do \ntheir due diligence.\n  This would be especially true for small businesses that don't have \nin-house lawyers or human resources departments. Small businesses are \nthe backbone of our economy, and staying competitive means that small \nbusiness owners have to take on a whole range of responsibilities. They \nhave to be accountants. They have to be janitors. They have to play \ndozens of different roles every day to keep their business going. The \nrule we are debating today would mean they would suddenly have to \nbecome labor lawyers too.\n  Most small business owners are not familiar with the complex business \nlaws that determine what they can and cannot do during a union \nelection. They might not know that if they make certain statements or \ntake certain actions, the National Labor Relations Board can impose a \nbargaining obligation on them even without a secret ballot election. \nLet me repeat that. They might not know that if they make certain \nstatements or take certain actions, the National Labor Relations Board \ncan impose a bargaining obligation on them without a secret ballot \nelection. They might not know that they have certain rights but that \nthey have to exercise those rights at a certain point in the process or \nthey forfeit them.\n  Under the current system, they have time to learn. More importantly, \nthey have time to work with their employees and even with the union \norganizers. One of the ways the current system succeeds is that it \nallows businesses, employees, and unions that would want to hold an \nelection to work together through the election process. Many of the \nunion elections that happen in less than the 38-day average are able to \nmove forward so quickly because all sides can come to an agreement on \nthe issues, efficiently resolve any disagreements, and hold an election \nwithout any holdup. Businesses have enough time to understand the \nprocess, and that allows them to work cooperatively. If a business can \nbe confident that it doesn't need to file unnecessary paperwork or hold \nunnecessary meetings, it can move forward without unnecessary delays. \nThat won't be the case under the new rule where businesses--especially \nsmall businesses--don't have the time to get comfortable enough with \nthe process. And I predict that the number of elections where unions \nand businesses can work cooperatively to hold elections more \nefficiently will fall significantly.\n  Under the new rule, a small business is going to have two options--\neither go into an election blind and hope they don't make any mistakes \nand hope everything comes out OK or take every precaution, hold every \nhearing, and fully exercise every right to make sure they don't miss \nanything important.\n  I believe small business owners want to work in good faith with \nunions through this process, but the ambush election rule is going to \nmake it harder for them to do that. Efficient elections are better for \neveryone. Businesses can get back to work faster, unions can hold an \nelection sooner, and employees get a fair and timely vote. But this \nrule is going to make it harder for that to be the case.\n  The National Labor Relations Board says it is making this rule \nbecause the process needs to be streamlined and updated. But what the \nBoard is doing in a very partisan way simply doesn't make sense in \nlight of the fact that the average time for a union election is 38 \ndays--which means many elections happen sooner than that--and that \nnearly all elections are completed in less than 2 months.\n  The Board says these rules are meant to address problems with some \nelections that have been held up for months or years. That would really \naffect these mean numbers, so that can't be much of the case. If that \nis the case, why did they write a rule that is going to undermine a \nsystem that already provides for timely elections and gives businesses \nthe time they need to work cooperatively with unions? When an agency \nmakes a rule, it is supposed to be solving a specific problem, and that \nrule is supposed to be targeted at fixing this problem. In this case, \nNLRB's rule has not targeted the problem they want to fix. What is \nworse, this rule is going to undermine a system that meets the needs of \nbusinesses, unions, and employees in all but a handful of cases.\n  This rule doesn't make sense, and the way the Board is pushing this \nrule doesn't fit with how labor laws should be updated and improved. \nThe National Labor Relations Act is a carefully balanced law that \nhasn't been changed very often. When changes have been made, it has \nbeen the result of careful\n\n[[Page S1234]]\n\nnegotiation, input from stakeholders, and thoughtful debate. \nUnfortunately, it looks as though the only stakeholders in the room \nwhen the Board wrote this ambush elections rule were the unions.\n  The Board also says that its rule is intended to update the elections \nprocess to account for new technology, such as email and cell phones. \nUnfortunately, the rule fails to take into account the key concerns \nabout data privacy and security that we face today. It undermines \nemployees' privacy at a time when identity theft, computer crimes, and \ncyber security are serious issues.\n  Under current law, an employer is required to turn over employees' \nnames and addresses within 7 days once an election is set. The proposed \nrule would not only expand the type of personal information that must \nbe turned over, but would require that information be handed over to \nthe union within 2 days. The expanded information the Board wants \nemployers to give to the unions includes all personal home phone \nnumbers, all cell phone numbers, and all email addresses that the \nemployer has on file. It would also require work location, shift \ninformation, and employment classification. All of that can be used to \nharass the employee whether they want to be contacted or not, whether \nthey want information or not.\n  Now keep in mind that under the new rule, the question about which \nworkers are eligible to unionize or to participate in the vote isn't \ndetermined until after the election. What? They are not going to know \nwhich workers are eligible to unionize or to participate in the vote \nuntil after the election. That is a strange rule. The ambush election \nrule would require employees to hand over personal information on their \nemployees to unions without confirming which employees should or should \nnot be on that list. That is part of the process that gets left out.\n  The purpose of requiring the information, of course, is so the union \norganizers can come to your home, call you whenever they want, email \nyou, find you after work and intercept you before or after your shift. \nThere is no time limit to how many times union organizers can contact \nyou or at what time. There is no opt-out for employees who simply don't \nwant to be contacted. That could turn into a serious invasion of \nprivacy for any employee, but for an employee who isn't eligible to \nparticipate in the election but has his or her information turned over \nto the union anyway, that is a serious breach of privacy.\n  I think it is important to point out how this rule undermines \nemployee privacy, particularly when we frequently hear about news of \ndata breaches, stolen credit card numbers, and identity theft. \nProtecting personal information is not something that can be taken \nlightly. Union elections can be very intense, an emotional experience \nfor employees, employers, and union organizers alike. The last thing \nthis rule should do is create a situation where an employee's personal \ninformation is used as a tool for harassment or intimidation.\n  The National Labor Relations Board is supposed to be an impartial \nbody that hears cases, weighs the facts, and makes fair, unbiased \ndecisions according to the law. Although the Board's decisions set \nprecedents that determine how labor laws are applied going forward, it \nhas not traditionally been a rulemaking agency. It has issued only a \nsmall number of rules, especially compared to other departments and \nagencies. Unfortunately, the Board has gone too far with the ambush \nelections rule. It has taken upon itself to impose new regulations that \nwould hurt businesses, undermine a sensitive process that has already \nprovided fair and timely elections, give up employee privacy, and bend \ncarefully balanced labor laws in favor of the unions. Congress needs to \ntell the National Labor Relations Board this rule is out of bounds.\n  The Congressional Review Act gives Congress a tool to rein in \nagencies that use the Federal rulemaking process in ways Congress never \nintended. When an agency goes beyond what Congress has authorized or \ntries to issue regulations that would be harmful, the Congressional \nReview Act ensures that Congress can intervene and hopefully prevent \nthat rule from going into effect. Congressional Review Act resolutions \ncan't be held up by the usual procedural delay tactics, although today \nwe saw a historic event. For the first time the Congressional Review \nAct had to have a cloture motion for it. That is privileged, so the \ncloture motion only required 51, but I have done several of these, and \nthat is the first time I ever remember having to do a cloture motion. \nThat is a filibuster. That is a delay on an inevitable discussion of \nthe actions taken by a board.\n  So at the end of the day the Senate has to vote. That is important \nbecause it means Congress's oversight responsibilities over executive \nbranch overreach has a real and immediate effect when we use the \nCongressional Review Act. But it goes further than that, because the \nCongressional Review Act also says once Congress has disapproved a \nrule, it cannot be reissued by the agency. That is important in this \ncase, because this isn't the first time the National Labor Relations \nBoard has issued this rule. The rule we are debating today is nearly \nidentical to the rule the Board proposed in 2012, which was overturned \nby the courts because the Board failed to follow its own procedures \nwhen it issued the rule.\n  We need to pass this Congressional Review Act resolution, not just to \nroll back the National Labor Relations Board's unnecessary and harmful \nrule, but to make it clear to the Board that Congress has the final \nword on this rule and any other rule, and that the issue is closed.\n  It will also be a lesson to other boards and agencies proposing rules \nwithout finding common ground, without looking at some of the common \nsense, and without looking out for the hard-working taxpayers.\n  The Board has already issued this rule twice, and we should make sure \nthis is the last time. Congress should make it clear that unnecessary \nregulations that hurt small business and undermine the fair and timely \nelections process are nonstarters.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution of disapproval. \nWe need to remind the National Labor Relations Board and other boards \nand agencies that their duty is to consider the facts of specific \ncases, to treat parties in those cases fairly, and to make impartial \ndecisions according to the law. The Board's role is not to try to stack \nthe system against one side or tip the scales in favor of the other, \nwhich is what this rule does. This rule makes it harder for businesses \nto meet their obligations in good faith. It denies employees the time \nthey need to be able to make informed decisions, and it undermines the \nfair and timely process for union elections that is currently in place.\n  As you heard a number of times, John F. Kennedy, when he was a Member \nof the Senate, said 30 days was a pretty good time. Moving it down to \n11 days--I don't think he would approve of that.\n  This is one of the most important votes on labor issues we will have \nthis year, and I urge my colleagues to put a stop to this burdensome \nrule.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe time be equally allocated to the two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Flake pertaining to the introduction of S. 638 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, on a separate topic, I would like to urge \nmy colleagues to support S.J. Res. 8, the joint resolution of \ndisapproval under the Congressional Review Act of the National Labor \nRelations Board's final rule regarding union representation election \nprocedures.\n  As we heard today, it is often called the ambush election rule. It \ngained its namesake because it shortens the time between when a union \nfiles a petition for an election and the holding of that election.\n  As a cosponsor of this resolution and a signer of the discharge \npetition to bring it before us for consideration, I believe this rule \nneeds to be stopped before it takes effect on April 14.\n\n[[Page S1235]]\n\n  According to NLRB data for the last 10 years, the median time before \nthe union election was 38 days. This proposed rule could shorten that \ntimeframe to as few as 11 days. The rule gives employers only 7 days to \nfind legal counsel and appear before an NLRB regional office at a \npreelection hearing. Prior to that hearing, the employer must file a \nStatement of Position, which raises any and all legal challenges they \nmay use later on. This is particularly burdensome for small businesses \nthat typically don't have inhouse legal counsel. They have little time \nto get advice on what is permitted during this process.\n  There are also privacy issues with this rule's requirement that \nemployers must hand over employees' personal information--including \ncellphone numbers, personal email addresses, shift times, and \nlocations--to unions. With more than 95 percent of these elections \noccurring in less than 2 months, it is hard to understand why this \nonerous ambush election rule is even necessary.\n  Instead of burdening small businesses with complicated legal work and \nincreased regulations, this administration and the NLRB should be \nfocusing their efforts on increasing job growth and improving the \neconomy.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution of disapproval.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FLAKE.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Affordable Care Act\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, tomorrow morning the Supreme Court is going \nto hear oral arguments in King v. Burwell. The Supreme Court's ruling \ncould have sweeping consequences for the well-being of millions of \nAmericans and for our Nation's entire health care system.\n  The issue at hand is whether Americans who receive the opportunity to \nbuy quality health insurance, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, can \nget assistance in paying for that care. The law gives our States a \nchoice. Our States can design and manage an insurance exchange on their \nown or they can allow their citizens to shop on a federally run \nexchange. Furthermore, the law created tax credits to help Americans \nafford the cost of health insurance.\n  Thirty-six States took the Federal option. Eighty-seven percent of \nthe people who signed up in those States get some measure of assistance \nso as to better afford coverage. However, the petitioners in King v. \nBurwell argue that those Americans should be denied any assistance.\n  In my view, the answer is simple. Let's help those who are in need. \nLet's not go back to that time in America when health care was for the \nhealthy and for the wealthy.\n  If one flips on C-SPAN and listens to the Congress debate and \nquestion the administration, one might hear something wildly different. \nSome Members of Congress seem to be rooting for Americans to lose their \nsubsidies and consequently their access to affordable health coverage. \nIn fact, Members of Congress have filed briefs with the Supreme Court \nmaking essentially that argument. At the same time, they have asked how \nthe Obama administration would clean up the aftermath. To me, that is \nlike pouring gasoline on a fire and then indignantly demanding that \nsomebody else go put it out.\n  There is no question the law's implementation has at times been a \nchallenge. That is true of all major legislation. It is clear there \nought to be bipartisan interest in continuing to improve the law. But \nthe reality has been what we have had is a wornout, 6-year-old fight \nover the Affordable Care Act. The act's core purpose, which has been \nclear from the outset, is to help as many of our people get affordable, \nhigh-quality health insurance as possible, and the tax credits are \nabsolutely key to making that work. In this case, those tax credits are \nin question.\n  To make their argument, the King petitioners scoured the text of the \nlaw and plucked out one obscure phrase buried in the text. That phrase \nis ``established by the State,'' relating to how the tax credits are \ncalculated. According to the petitioners, those four words--that one \nsmall phrase--is enough to put millions of Americans in danger of \nlosing their health insurance. The petitioners are arguing, against \ncommon sense and the actual text and intent of the Affordable Care Act, \nthat the intent was supposed to deprive millions of struggling families \nand individuals of affordable health care coverage.\n  In my view, this should not be a difficult case for our Supreme Court \nto decide. Looking at the law itself, the text is clear. To cite some \nexamples, when a State declines to establish an exchange, the Federal \nGovernment is directed to fill in and establish ``such exchange.'' This \nmakes sure insurance coverage and tax credits become available to any \n``applicable taxpayer,'' regardless of where that taxpayer might live. \nFurthermore, the information used to calculate the subsidies is \ngathered from everybody who buys an insurance plan. That would be \nunnecessary if Americans in only some States were eligible for the tax \ncredits.\n  On top of that, it is a firmly established principle of statutory \nconstruction that when interpreting a provision of a law, a court \nshould read the provision in context, not in isolation. It should \nconsider how the part fits into the whole. As the Supreme Court has \nsaid, it is a ``fundamental canon of statutory construction that the \nwords of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to \ntheir place in the overall statutory scheme.''\n  Here, looking at the overall statutory scheme, in my view there is \nonly one plausible explanation. States have the option of establishing \nexchanges. If they decline, the Federal Government will establish an \nexchange for them. It was written that way so everyone who needs \nassistance and meets the relevant qualifications can receive that \nassistance. In my view, we just can't reach any other conclusion. \nWithout the broadest possible access to health insurance--and financial \nassistance for those who need it--the system would simply be at risk.\n  The interpretation made by the petitioners makes absolutely no sense \nin the context of the overall statutory approach. It would contradict \nthe fundamental purpose of the Affordable Care Act which, as stated in \nthe title, is to provide ``quality, affordable health care for all \nAmericans.''\n  Finally, a statute should be interpreted under the assumption that as \nthe Court has said: ``Congress . . . does not . . . hide elephants in \nmouseholes.'' Congress does not slip major rules, which have huge \nramifications, into obscure corners of the law. In this case, Congress \nwould not slip a major rule denying tax credits to millions--what would \nin effect be a poison pill--the Congress would not slip that deep into \na line that simply defines the term ``coverage month.''\n  Furthermore, there is no evidence in the legislative history to \nsupport what I consider to be a warped reading of the law by the \npetitioners. If the Congress intended for the tax credits to help only \nsome Americans, the Congress would have said that. The issue would have \ncome up in committee hearings and markups and press conferences or in \ndebates in the Senate or in the other body. It would have been \nreflected in fact sheets and in press releases that were made available \nto the public. It would have come up in committee reports that \naccompanied the bill's long journey through the Congress. It never did, \nnot even once. The only way to get to the petitioners' view is by \ncherry-picking and contorting a four-word phrase.\n  Look at the long record of analysis provided by the trusted \nnonpartisan\n\n[[Page S1236]]\n\nstaffs of the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on \nTaxation. We rely on them. They are bipartisan. They are nonpartisan. \nIt was their job to do the math, to score the bills and figure out \nexactly what the economic impacts would be. In every analysis and in \nevery communication the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation had with the Congress, they correctly presumed \nthat tax credits would be available to all who qualified. The tables \nand reports prepared by the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation are all online. So what I have said can be backed \nup, and anyone can read those materials.\n  In my view, the petitioner's argument in this case is weak and the \ntext of the law and congressional intent is clear. But, still, the \nwrong decision could make quality health insurance suddenly \nunaffordable for millions of Americans from one end of the country to \nthe other. The negative effects of that ruling would radiate throughout \nour health care system. Recent studies of this case have suggested that \nthe cost of insurance could soar upward for more than 7 million \nAmericans. Only those most in danger of needing serious medical \nassistance would remain insured. The cost of insurance premiums, \nparticularly in the individual market, would skyrocket for all. As a \nresult, a crisis that would begin with 7 million people could grow to \naffect 8, 9 or 10 million and perhaps even more. In my view, it would \nsend our country back to those dark days when health care in America \nwas for the healthy and the wealthy. That is what the Affordable Care \nAct is intended to prevent. That is not what the American people want.\n  The Federal Government, independent health care organizations, and \nthose whose insurance is at stake all agree--the tax credits are meant \nfor all. Even America's Health Insurance Plans, the trade association \nrepresenting the Nation's largest insurers, takes that view. It wrote \nin a brief filed with the Court that eliminating the subsidies ``would \nleave consumers in those states with a more unstable market and far \nhigher costs than if the ACA had not been enacted. . . . ''\n  The only groups that argue otherwise are essentially political \npartisans that want to see the Affordable Care Act brought down at any \ncost. These arguments, in my view, are baseless, and they pose a \nserious danger to the health of millions of Americans--those in our \ncountry who went far too long without access to quality, affordable \nhealth care and who have it now with the Affordable Care Act.\n  I strongly hope the Supreme Court will take a conservative approach \nin its ruling--a conservative approach--and reject the challenge to the \nlaw. Then Congress can get on with the important business of bringing \nboth sides together to improve the law where it needs to be improved \nand address the other important needs of America's health care system.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose this resolution \nwhich would overturn modest but vitally important updates to the \nprocess that enables workers to exercise their rights to join a labor \nunion. Today's attack on the NLRB's rule to modernize its election \nprocess is misplaced and misguided.\n  Today middle-class families are struggling with wages that aren't \nkeeping up with expenses, while large corporations make record profits, \nand those at the top are doing better and better. But our economy \ndoesn't grow from the top down; it grows from the middle out. Our \neconomy is strongest when we have a thriving middle class with a strong \nvoice in the workplace.\n  That is why we should be talking about how to restore basic workplace \nfairness to middle-class Americans and to those aspiring to be in the \nmiddle class. To me, that means if you work full time, you shouldn't \nhave to live in poverty. It means making sure that moms and dads don't \nhave to choose between keeping their jobs and taking a few hours to \ntake their sick child to the doctor. Those are the things we should be \nfocusing on. In fact, if we want to accomplish those things, we need to \nstrengthen the voices of regular Americans in the workplace. The NLRB \nrepresentation rule takes a small but important step toward \nstrengthening those voices. That is why the resolution before us today \nis not only misplaced, it is also misguided. This resolution would do \nthe opposite of empowering workers.\n  The purpose of this resolution is to block rules that will modernize \na broken election process. Because that election process is broken, it \nis preventing workers from exercising a basic right they are supposed \nto have in the workplace--the right to have a seat at the bargaining \ntable.\n  Too often, loopholes are being exploited to prevent workers from \nhaving the freedom to decide whether they want to form a union. Today, \n35 percent of the time that workers file a petition for a union \nelection, they never even get to have an election. The 10 percent of \nlitigated cases that this rule targets for reform take over 6 months on \naverage to get to an election, and some elections can be delayed for \nyears. That is why workers need this rule to ensure a fair, effective \nprocess that is free of excessive delays.\n  Some of the updates in the rule simply standardize best practices \nthat are already used in some parts of the country. For example, in \nsome regions of the country hearings are regularly scheduled to be held \n7 days after the petition is filed and petitions are accepted by fax. \nAlso, under the representation rule workers and companies can file \ndocuments electronically, bringing the process up to date with 21st-\ncentury technologies. It also increases transparency in the election \nprocess. Everyone involved--from workers petitioning for an election, \nto companies, to the NLRB itself--has to provide information to the \nother parties earlier in the process and in more complete form.\n  Nothing in this rule will change an employer's right to express its \nsupport for or opposition to a union. Nothing in the rule will change \nan employer's ability to communicate with workers from their very first \nday on the job. If the employer opposes collective bargaining in the \nworkplace for better wages and working conditions, the company has the \nright to do that from the very beginning.\n  Modernizing and streamlining the process by which workers exercise \ntheir rights to join a union should not be controversial. Under the \nNational Labor Relations Act, our laws explicitly recognize the rights \nof employees to engage in collective bargaining through representatives \nof their own choosing. That is the law.\n  As a member of three unions myself, I have seen firsthand how \nimportant it is for workers to have a voice in their workplace. The \nevidence shows that being a member of a union can have a tremendous \nimpact on the lives of real people and their families. Workers covered \nby a collective bargaining agreement are paid more on average than \nthose not covered. Unionized workers are more likely to have health \ncare, retirement benefits, and paid leave benefits than other workers.\n  So, again, the changes made by the election rule are just commonsense \nupdates that will support these important objectives. I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose this resolution so that these commonsense reforms \nwill be able to ensure a fairer election process for everyone.\n  I yield to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Minnesota for \nhis outstanding remarks.\n  I want to rise to make one thing clear in this debate. My friends on \nthe other side of the aisle once again have taken up the cause of \nspecial interests at the expense of hard-working Americans. Once again \nthey are using their new majority in the Senate to find ways to keep \nthe rules rigged against American workers.\n  Let's look at this. The bottom line is very simple. Middle-class \nincomes are declining. One of the main reasons middle-class incomes are \ndeclining is the decline of unions. That is what just about everybody \nwho studies it says.\n\n[[Page S1237]]\n\nWe are now 11 percent unionized. We were 30 percent, private sector \nonly 6 percent. The bottom line is we had a lot of poor Americans in \nthe 1920s.\n\n  Laws that were enacted by this Congress allowed unions to organize \nand workers, through collective bargaining, were able to gain some of \nthe wealth from their labor. We had broad prosperity as America was \nunionized in the 1950s and 1960s and 1970s and 1980s. What happened was \nthat corporate America learned how to both prevent new unions from \noccurring in new industries and breaking old unions.\n  As a result now, middle-class incomes are declining. Our colleagues \non the other side of the aisle, once again, they talk they want to help \nthe middle class, but in all the obvious ways to help the middle \nclass--and unions do, whether the management likes it or not, they \nmanage to give the workers more money--they do not walk the walk.\n  These NLRB changes are simple. There have not been substantial \nupdates to the NLRB election process since the 1970s. The new changes \npull the process into the 21st century, letting unions and employers \nfile electronically and using modern forms of communications such as \ncell phones. Our colleagues are opposed to this. They want to undo it. \nMy God, the changes will modernize union elections, prevent delays, \nreduce frivolous litigation, something even the Republican Board \nmembers on the NLRB supported in principle in their dissent.\n  Right now big corporations can use delays in labor elections to try \nand take advantage to postpone and even deny workers' rights to vote. \nThis is what my friends on the other side of the aisle are rising up \nagainst: workers whose incomes are declining trying to get a little \nmore money when corporate profits are at a record. The other side says, \nnope, side with the corporate profits over middle-class wages. That is \nwhat they are saying. That has been the theme in this Congress. It is \ngoing to continue to be the theme.\n  We will make it clear to the American people who is on their side. \nThe congressional review process on these changes allowing employers \nand unions to file forms electronically, and we have to invoke this \nunique process, streamlining the process so workers are not kicked \naround with an army of lawyers?\n  It is disappointing that my friends across the aisle have made such a \nmountain out of a molehill with these rules. At the beginning of this \nCongress, I was hopeful my colleagues were ready to join us and go to \nwork for working families who have experienced a lost decade of \neconomic advancement, whose real wages have declined.\n  In an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal this year Leaders McConnell \nand Boehner said one of the their primary goals was helping struggling \nmiddle-class Americans who are clearly frustrated by a lack of \nopportunity and a stagnation of wages. If their only answer is to \nreduce regulations on corporations, lower corporate taxes, lower the \ntaxes of the wealthy, and that is going to help the middle class, I \nhave news for them, that is not going to fly.\n  I feel in my heart deeply that the decline of middle-class wages is a \ndecline of America. I feel we have to do something about it, but we \ncertainly should not regress. My colleagues, with this motion, it will \nmake it harder for the middle class to grow wages, make it easier to \nsay even a larger share of productivity goes to capital and a smaller \nshare to labor, despite their rhetoric and despite the problems we \nface.\n  I see my dear friend from Tennessee. I hate to oppose him in such \nstrong language because I think he is a fine gentleman, but on this \nissue we disagree.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I wish to talk about protecting the \nmiddle class.\n  I am on the side of an economy that works for everyone and building a \nstronger middle class to bring opportunities to families across the \nNation.\n  What is an economy that works for everyone? It means that if you work \nhard and play by the rules, you deserve a fair shot at the American \ndream.\n  An economy that works for everyone also means giving workers the \nright to organize, negotiate, and exercise their rights under the law \nin a timely way. I believe this can be done in a way that also enables \nbusinesses to prosper and to create jobs.\n  Unions raise wages, improve working conditions, and ensure fair \ntreatment on the job. In many jobs they make the difference between \nliving in poverty and making ends meet or the difference between just \ngetting by and making enough to make a better life for a family. The \nright to unionize and collectively bargain helped grow the middle \nclass.\n  When workers are choosing whether to unionize or not, they need a \nprocess that is fair, predictable, and efficient. But unfair rules, lax \nenforcement, and insincere negotiating has crippled union organizing \nand threatened the middle-class lifestyle that was once the economic \npride of our country.\n  The main role of the National Labor Relations Board is to manage the \nrelations between unions, employees, and employers in the private \nsector. The primary functions of the Board are to prevent or resolve \nunfair labor practices and to supervise union elections so that they \nare done accurately and fairly.\n  Now, the NLRB has put out rules that make modest updates to the \nelection process that make sense in the 21st century. The rules would \neliminate needless delays that slow the election process to a halt and \nmodernize the process for sharing contact information to allow the use \nof email to communicate about the election.\n  But this and other commonsense updates are under attack in Congress. \nUnder this Congressional Review Act resolution, the whole rule would \nget tossed out. There is limited debate and there is no chance for \noffering amendments. Middle-class workers deserve better than this.\n  Currently, workers organize themselves by signing a document saying \nthey want to join a union. Once a majority of workers sign up, they can \nask their employers to be recognized as a union and collectively \nbargain for a contract.\n  However, some employers delay, delay, delay--refusing to recognize \nthe union and requiring workers to go through an intimidating antiunion \ncampaign that ends in an unfair election. Workers should be protected \nfrom these kinds of stall tactics and intimidation.\n  It is common sense that communication should be allowed to take place \nover email. These rules would allow for that. Documents should be \nallowed to be submitted electronically. These rules would allow for \nthat, too. This creates a more efficient process that benefits workers.\n  I want workers to make more money. When families have more money in \ntheir paychecks, it is good news for the middle class and it is good \nnews for our Nation's economy. When workers have a seat at the table, \nit means they have a better chance at getting the wages and the \nprotections at the workplace they deserve. I want to grow our middle \nclass by giving more workers this critical seat at the table. But they \nwon't get it if Congress pulls the chair out from underneath them by \nthrowing out this rule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I know we are in Democratic time \nright now. So if a Member of the other side shows up, I will sit down. \nI appreciate the courtesy of my colleagues on the other side allowing \nme to continue my remarks. I will not take more than 7 or 8 minutes.\n  My good friend from New York just spoke. We have worked together on a \nnumber of things. He talked about the middle class. I think he is right \nto talk about the middle class and the effect of the National Labor \nRelations Board on the middle class.\n  Let me give a little bit different perspective on it. My problem with \nthis NLRB is that it is not acting like an umpire between employers and \nemployees, it is acting like an advocate for the unions. It did so in \n2011 with the micro-union decision. It is doing so with the ambush \nelections rule, going against the advice of Senator John F. Kennedy in \n1959, who said 30 days seemed like a fair time to give employees to \nconsider whether to have a union.\n  They are ambushing employers--it's like riding through a canyon and \nsuddenly people start shooting at you. In just 11 days--we have \nhundreds of thousands of small businesses across the\n\n[[Page S1238]]\n\ncountry that are trying to work, sell their goods, make a living, \nimprove their status. That is the middle class we talked about.\n  Say you have five employees, say you are down in Maryville, TN, or \nWichita, KS, the last thing on your mind is a labor lawyer. Here comes \nan election in 11 days. Suddenly small businesses have to find and pay \na labor lawyer. They need legal advice at every step because in as few \nas 11 days they might have an election. There is no need to rush into \nan election that rapidly other than to give union organizers an \nopportunity to force a union election before the employer and its \nemployees know what is going on.\n  Let me give one more example of the assault on the middle class that \nI see from this NLRB and our friends on the other side. In every \ncommunity in America, there are lots of franchisees. These are the men \nand women who operate health clubs, barber shops, auto parts shops, \nchildcare centers, neighborhood restaurants, music stores, cleaning \nservices, and much more.\n  We had some franchisees testify before the labor committee the other \nday. These franchisees could have worked for a big corporation, but \nthey said: I would like to run my own business. Franchisees can own a \nRuby Tuesday's, a Rainbow Station, or an auto parts franchise. They own \nthat business. They run that business.\n  They use that brand name to help it succeed. They use brand names \nlike Planet Fitness, Merry Maids, or Panera Bread. They might work 12 \nhours a day serving customers, meeting a payroll, or cleaning. This is \nhard work, but 700,000 Americans do it because it is their way up the \neconomic ladder. It is their way to say: I have my own business. I do \nnot work for the big guys. I am a little guy working my way up.\n  Successful franchisees are one of the most important ways to climb \nthe economic ladder of success. Yet this NLRB, the same one that wants \nto have ambush elections, has a pending decision that would threaten \nfranchisees' very way of life. It is called the joint employer \nstandard, which since 1984 has required a business to hold direct \ncontrol over the terms and conditions of a worker's employment.\n  Through broad language, the NLRB is saying to McDonald's or Ruby \nTuesday's that they are part of the parent company, and anything they \ndo at their store has to be accepted by the parent company.\n  What are the consequences if that happens? The parent companies are \ngoing to say: We are not going to take that risk. We are going to own \nall of our stores. So we will own all of the Rainbow Stations. The \nparent company will own all of the McDonald's stores, or all of the \nRuby Tuesday's.\n  What will that do? That might protect the parent company because it \ncan hire a team of labor lawyers. It can instruct its employees what to \ndo and what not to do to avoid problems. But it takes away the middle-\nclass opportunity of moving up the economic ladder from these 700,000 \nfranchisees. That is what this NLRB is doing. The ambush election rule \nis nothing more than speeding up the time that it takes between when \npro-union organizers ask an employer for a secret ballot election, and \nwhen that election actually takes place.\n  Every step you take has to be perfect according or else you might \nhave to have a rerun election or be ordered to negotiate with the \nunion. That jeopardizes the fairness in our system. The National Labor \nRelations Act was intended to create an environment of balance and \nfairness among employers and employees. Senator Kennedy said in 1959 \nthat 30 days would be a reasonable amount of time between when a union \norganizer files a petition and when an election is held.\n  Senator McConnell and I have another bill to restore the balance in \nthe National Labor Relations Board. It is absolutely fair. The Board \nwould be three Democrats, three Republicans. If the general counsel's \ncomplaint is outside the law, the aggrieved party can take it to \nFederal court. If the NLRB takes longer than 1 year to decide a case, \neither party can take it to Federal court. That is fair. That is the \nkind of umpire we need in labor relations today. So this is about the \nmiddle class. This is about moving up the economic ladder. This is \nabout the kind of actions that give 700,000 Americans their franchise \nbusiness. This is about the hundreds of thousands of Americans, with 4, \n5, 6, 10, 15 employees, who do not need to be ambushed as they try to \nearn a living, pay their bills, sweep the floor, make a profit, pay \nemployees, and create the American dream.\n  The stakes are high. We are right to say let's return the National \nLabor Relations Board to an umpire.\n  Let us hope the House agrees. Let us hope the President agrees. It's \ntime to return fairness and balance to labor-management relations in \nthis country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, are we in a quorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I rise to speak and to commend the \nchairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, \nSenator Alexander, for this resolution that is on the floor to rescind \nand overturn the ambush election rule the NLRB has asked to go in \neffect on April 14. It is just dadgum wrong. It is a solution in search \nof a problem.\n  We don't have a problem in terms of labor relations. Ninety-five \npercent of all the elections for unionization take place within 56 \ndays. The median term is 38 days. That is 1\\1/2\\ months to 2 months. \nThat is all it takes. This would compress that period of time from the \naverage now of 38 days to 11 days.\n  Is 11 days enough time for a worker to get all the information they \nneed to find out whether they want to become unionized? No, it is not. \nIs it fair to an employer to give him only 11 days to defend himself \nagainst a union organization trying to take him to a union shop? No, it \nis not. Does it do anything for the middle class? No, it does not. This \nis a solution for an issue, as I said, that doesn't exist, a problem \nthat doesn't exist. It is time we stood up for American business and \nAmerican workers.\n  I ran a sub S corporation, which is a small business in Georgia. Most \neverybody thinks this is a big business issue. It is not; it is a small \nbusiness issue. It is a repeat effort by the NLRB to continue to meddle \nand tilt the playing field between labor and management.\n  Everybody knows that during the Industrial Revolution this country \noverlooked the worker. We had child labor, we had workers working too \nlong, and we didn't have good safety rules. We all know labor unions \ncame about because businesses failed to address their needs. But that \nwas 100 years ago. Today we have good labor law, we have fair labor \nlaw, and we have opportunities for people to be unionized if they want.\n  Of all the elections called in the last 2 years, 64.2 percent have \ngone to a unionized shop--64.2 percent. In other words, the law we have \nnow today works. It works for the worker and it works for the union. \nBut it doesn't work to compress that time period to 11 days. That would \ncause confusion, it would cause discord, it would cause a terrible \nburden on the employer and terrible pressure on the employee.\n  Included in the rule are, in my opinion, privacy violations by the \norganizers. It will require the company to turn over cell phone \nnumbers, private information and all of that, so the unions can harass \nthem to try to get them to sign a petition for a clarification and \ncertification. It is just downright wrong.\n  The chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \nis exactly right: This is an unfair rule. It has no place being passed \nand adopted. We have every right to rescind it, which I hope this \nSenate will do.\n  Let's remember who the middle class really is. Let's remember who \nsmall business really is. Let's remember why we have unions and why we \nhave a National Labor Relations Board. We have it for fair and \nequitable treatment of labor law. We don't have it to tilt the playing \nfield in favor of labor or in favor of management. We have it to be \nfair, so everybody gets a fair shake and a fair notice and a fair time \nto have their say.\n  So I rise to commend the chairman for his efforts and what he has \ndone. I support his effort and what he has done, and I hope the Members \nof the Senate will vote in favor of rescinding this rule before it goes \ninto effect. It would be a terrible one-two punch to have this rule go \ninto effect on April 14\n\n[[Page S1239]]\n\nand the IRS's tax day be April 15. That is too much punishment for one \nperiod of time. It is just not the right thing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, my Democratic colleagues and I come to \nthe floor all the time talking about how we grow a middle class, how we \nhelp middle-class families, and how we make sure we have a strong \neconomy because we have a strong middle class. Yet what we are seeing \non the floor right now is an effort by our Republican colleagues to \nfight to keep a system which is rigged against American workers being \nable to get a livable wage, to have a voice in the workplace.\n  We know what we ought to be doing is looking for every possible way \nto support those who are working hard every day, to have a wage that \nallows them to care for their family, to send their children to college \nand achieve the American dream. They should have a voice in the \nworkplace around safety issues, around other issues that are important \nfor working men and women. We have in front of us a National Labor \nRelations Board rule change that was made to basically modernize the \nsystem around employee elections so that people have a fair shot to \nhave their voice heard in the workplace.\n  It is pretty interesting to me that we are talking about simple \nchanges that allow the use of email communications or fax \ncommunications--not exactly radical things in the world we live in. \nWithout this modernization by the NLRB, we actually have a situation \nwhere people are denied the ability to communicate through email; to be \nable to talk about forming a union and communicate with each other \nthrough email, which is pretty crazy when you think about it. This \nparticular vote would stop folks from using email or faxes.\n  The NLRB rule change was to modernize the election process, to \neliminate certain paperwork hurdles that didn't make any sense, so an \nemployer could not delay the ability for folks to vote as to whether \nthey want to be part of a union. That is what is in front of us now.\n  What I wish was in front of us is the agenda we have been pushing, \nwhich is to actually strengthen the middle class. Instead, what we have \nin front of us is a vote about keeping the system rigged against \nAmerican workers. There is no mistake about it. A ``yes'' vote, which \neliminates this modernization process, is a vote to keep the system \nrigged against men and women who are working hard every day in the \nworkplace and who just want a fair shot to make it.\n  Interestingly, this only affects about 10 percent of union elections, \nbecause 90 percent of elections are done through agreement with \nemployers and employees. That is a testament to the fact that the \nmajority of folks can work together, if 90 percent of them are working \nout agreements.\n  What we really ought to be talking about on the floor is equal pay \nfor equal work and how we enforce that. I am stunned that we have the \nRepublican majority fighting to keep the system rigged against American \nworkers and then turning around and saying, well, we are not going to \npass laws that enforce equal pay for equal work, or we are not going to \npass laws that create a livable wage so people who are working are out \nof poverty, so that we reward work by having a livable wage. That is \nnot what is on the floor. What is on the floor is an effort to roll \nback the modernization of a process that would make sure the system is \nnot rigged against workers.\n  Why are we not talking about equal pay or raising the minimum wage or \ntalking about the cost of going to college? The majority of people \ntoday, who are playing by the rules, trying to do the right thing, \ntrying to get the skills they need to be responsible citizens and work \nin the workplace, come out of college buried in debt--buried in debt--\nbut we are not talking about that. We are not spending our time on \nthat.\n  We are not talking about protecting pensions earned by workers over a \nlifetime, who are counting on those to be protected. We are not talking \nabout how we strengthen and expand and guarantee Social Security for \nthe future, or any number of things we could be talking about. If we \njust made sure that equal pay for equal work wasn't a slogan but \nactually a reality of this country, we would jump-start the middle \nclass. We would jump-start the economy if women were earning dollar for \ndollar what men are earning. That alone, along with any number of other \nthings, affects middle-class families.\n  It is not about creating an economy by giving to those at the top and \nhaving it trickle down and hoping someday, somehow, it will affect the \nmajority of Americans. We believe you start with the middle, you grow \nthe economy from the middle out. It is a middle-class economy that \nlifts everyone up and addresses the strength of our country.\n  So I am very concerned that when we look at precious floor time and \nwhat the priorities are, we are debating a rollback on the \nmodernization of rules with the National Labor Relations Board that \nwill basically keep in place a rigged system. Without that \nmodernization it is just one more mark against workers who are trying \nto have a voice and are trying to lift themselves up and improve their \nwages and ability to be successful and be rewarded for their work.\n  There is a lot more we could and should be doing. We are going to \ncontinue to raise the issues that middle-class families care about. We \nare going to continue to fight for middle-class families every single \nday, and we are going to continue to oppose those who want to keep a \nrigged system against the middle class.\n  So I urge a ``no'' vote on this particular resolution, and hopefully \nwe can stand together and actually create jobs and a better standard of \nliving by doing those things that are going to help middle-class \nfamilies across America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, would you advise me what the time \nallotment now is for debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority controls the time from 5 until 6.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it is interesting, when we get on the \ntopic of unions, how we all come to this with such a different point of \nview. I come to it as a person who grew up in a household where every \nmember of my family was a member of a union. My father and mother, who \neach had eighth grade educations, belonged to railroad unions in East \nSt. Louis, IL. Because of that, there was bargaining for their wages \nand benefits--which I didn't understand as a kid, but I do now--that \nresulted in the quality of life we enjoy in our family. We weren't \nwealthy, but we were comfortable. I never went hungry, and I thought we \nlived a pretty good life. Mom and dad were hard workers. If you were a \nhard worker in those days and had the benefit of union representation, \nyou could make a decent living. And we did.\n  If we study history, we will find that is what has gone on in \nAmerica. Primarily after World War II, we saw two things happening: a \nrise in unionism--people who belonged to organized unions--and a rise \nin the middle class. In other words, employees who were able to bargain \nfor their wages and benefits and retirement ended up with enough money \nto raise their families and to build the middle class in America.\n  In that period from post-World War II until the 1960s, the United \nStates really took its place on the map in terms of our position in the \neconomy. Exactly the opposite has been true since. Unionism--those who \nbelong to organized unions--has been going down in most sectors except \nfor government employment, and we have also seen a decline in the \nmiddle class. I don't think that is a coincidence; I think that is an \nindication that when workers do not have a voice in the workplace, they \nlose that bargaining ability to get a just wage, a good wage, a living \nwage, and the benefits that should come with it.\n  The irony is that American workers are still the best in the world. \nIf we\n\n[[Page S1240]]\n\njust look at the issue of productivity of American workers, there is no \nreason for us to apologize. Our workers know how to create profit for \nthe people they work for. Sadly, though, when it comes to this, we \ndon't find that the companies that employ them reward their \nproductivity with more wages and benefits. They don't. As a result, \nworkers are working harder, making more profits for their company than \never, and yet they aren't seeing any real growth in their wages.\n  So there comes a time when workers should have the power to make a \nchoice in their lives, and that is when they decide whether they want \nrepresentation--an election to form a union where they work. That is \nwhat this bill is all about.\n  The National Labor Relations Board came up with a process that said: \nIf you are going to have an election in the workplace so that workers \ncan decide whether they want to belong to a union, let's at least make \nit fair, make sure that employers and employees and the unions have \nenough information. They can tell the workers their point of view, and \nthe workers can decide.\n  I come to the floor today in support of the National Labor Relations \nBoard's rule for modernizing and streamlining the election process for \nthe workers. There is a wide divergence of opinions on both sides of \nthe aisle here in terms of the value of unions. I value them. Some do \nnot. But I think the ability of workers to organize and bargain \ncollectively is about the only way to level the playing field and to \ncreate a growing middle class, which we need in America.\n  Last December the National Labor Relations Board came up with a rule, \nafter a long process, to modernize the election process--the first time \nin almost 50 years. Fifty years ago they wrote the rules, and they \nsaid: You know, there are a few things that have changed in 50 years.\n  Here is what they said: The rule moves preelection problems, such as \nthe 25-day waiting period and review, and consolidates options for \ndelay and appeal into a single appeals process. In a nod to modern \ncommunications, the rule says employers and unions can file election \npetitions electronically rather than by fax or mail. This does not \nstrike me as radical thinking. Think of all the things we do \nelectronically today, from paying our bills each month, to \ncommunicating with one another, to gathering information. Bringing this \nto the labor situation, the choice of a union, is certainly not \nradical. And it requires employers to provide unions with the \nemployees' personal email and phone numbers in addition to the existing \nrequirement for names and addresses--personal email and phone numbers. \nWhen is the last time you filled out an application on the Internet \nwhen they didn't ask you for your email address or your phone number? \nIt is routine, and we want to make this routine part of the process for \nunions and employers to get in contact with employees.\n  Republicans have called this an ``ambush rule.'' They say it deprives \nemployers of the time they need to explain why the worker should vote \nagainst a union. They also claim the rule limits an employer's ability \nto pursue adequate representation. But that is not a fair claim. Union \nelections are only triggered when 30 percent of the workers sign a \npetition favoring an election. Almost one out of three needs to sign it \nsaying: We want an election. Employers talk to their employees all the \ntime when the employees are being asked whether they want to sign up to \nbe part of the 30 percent, so the employers have constant access in the \nworkplace. And employers can still require workers to meet one-on-one \nwith supervisors, and about two-thirds of the employers actually do \nthat. Nine out of 10 employers require workers to watch anti-union \nvideos before an election. The new rule doesn't change that at all.\n  Under the new rule employers have time to talk to their workers; they \njust have fewer options to delay the actual election. It looks to me as \nif it is an advantage to employers going in, and the changes by the \nNLRB are really not that substantial.\n  Last year at this time workers at the Rock River Academy and \nResidential Center in Rockford, IL, wanted to form a union. Rock River \nprovides mental health and educational services for young girls with \nemotional disabilities. The workers didn't like the working conditions \nin the workplace, the short staffing and stagnant wages. They wanted to \nwork together to address these problems and to do a better job. They \nquickly signed up a majority of their coworkers and filed a petition \nwith the NLRB office in Peoria. From the outset, the workers felt the \nemployers at the facility were trying to do everything they could to \nstop this election. The delay in finalizing a union gave the \nresidential center time to wage an aggressive anti-union campaign.\n  There was a hearing eventually at the NLRB, but it was nearly 3 weeks \nafter the petition was filed. On the first day the employer's attorneys \nclaimed that all the workers at the residential center were \nnonprofessional, even though they included registered nurses, licensed \nspecial education teachers, and licensed therapists and social workers. \nThe following day they reversed their position and argued that all the \nemployees at the facility should be considered professional--this was \nthe next day--even though many employees lacked a college degree. That \nstretched the hearing out for 4 days. When it comes to these elections, \ndelay is really the tool that is used to stop a final decision.\n  The regional director at the NLRB ruled in favor of the union's \nposition and ordered an election held 82 days after the petition was \nfiled in which more than a majority of the workers said they wanted an \nelection. Eighty-two days later they actually got an election. During \nthat time the employer hired two anti-union consultants to wage an \nanti-union campaign that included threats and interrogation and even \nthe installation of a video surveillance system to monitor employees at \nall times throughout the workplace. Pro-union workers saw their hours \ncut, while non-union workers were given all the overtime they wanted. \nWorst of all, the employer terminated or laid off six employees in what \nthey believe was retaliation.\n  Despite the delays and discomfort the employers created, a slim \nmajority of employees still voted to form the union. But the employer \ncontinues to raise objections and intimidate the workers. Is that \nreally what we want to see--the majority of the workers want the \nelection, it takes 82 days to have the election, and then the \nrecriminations and problems that follow? It doesn't seem as if this is \nworkplace democracy, the way it was designed.\n  So I support this NLRB rule, and I am going to vote no on the efforts \non the other side of the aisle to overturn it. This brings the election \nprocess into the 21st century and lets employers and unions communicate \nwith employees. It doesn't encourage or discourage unionization; that \nis still up to the workers.\n  Some Republicans take offense to these changes and call it an ambush. \nInstead of standing up for workers, they have chosen to challenge these \ncommonsense reforms. This rule is about reducing unnecessary delay and \nlitigation and giving the workers the last word. That is what we are \nsupposed to do.\n  This case in Illinois isn't unique. In some extreme cases, workers \nhave been forced to wait 13 years for the simple right to organize. In \nmany others, the delays have eventually led do a situation in which \nthere was never a vote. Fifty-eight percent of workers want \nrepresentation in their workplace, but the delays and challenges to the \nelection process through NLRB discourage organizing.\n  These proposed changes by themselves neither encourage nor discourage \nunions. The proposed rule will apply the same way to workers attempting \nto decertify a union as it does to workers trying to form a union. The \nonly real impact of the rule changes is, after 50 years, to recognize \nthe existence of email and telephones, for goodness' sake. That is \nconsidered radical business by some on the other side of the aisle, but \nfor most it is just common sense.\n  So oppose this effort to overturn this NLRB rule. Give the workers a \nchance to vote one way or the other on whether they want a union.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. SCOTT. Madam President, we are here today because the NLRB has \nonce\n\n[[Page S1241]]\n\nagain overstepped the line. I am not sure it is a red line, but I do \nknow this--that the Board has become a hyperpartisan, pro-union entity, \nand that does not benefit the American people.\n  We saw it in my home State of South Carolina, in my hometown of North \nCharleston, when the NLRB and the IAM attempted to destroy what was at \nthe time 1,100 jobs at Boeing. Boeing represents more than 8,000 jobs \nin North Charleston because of the success of South Carolina's pro-\nbusiness, pro-employee--I want to emphasize ``pro-employee''--\nenvironment. But the NLRB and the President simply decided that didn't \nfit their tastes. So after more than a year, when we saw the NLRB's \ngeneral counsel joke about destroying the American economy and call \nMembers of Congress names, they finally relented when they realized \nSouth Carolina and the American people would not stand for it.\n  But since then, the NLRB has continued to push policies loved by \nunion bosses, even though it was created to be an unbiased arbiter. So \ntoday we are taking a very rare step--invoking the Congressional Review \nAct--because the NLRB decided to do union bosses one more favor.\n  The ambush elections rule, which the Board has now finalized, will \nallow as few as 10 days to pass between employees filing a petition to \nunionize and a vote occurring. This rule is perhaps the most pro-Big \nLabor action taken by the current administration, which is quite a fete \nfor this administration. Ambush elections hurt the ability of employees \nto make a well-informed choice on joining a union as it gives limited \ntime to hear both sides of the debate. The rule also requires \nunprecedented amounts of employees' personal information to be given to \nunion representatives, such as personal cell phone numbers and email \naddresses. The NLRB is also now placing burdensome requirements on \nemployers that unions do not have to follow themselves, providing an \nunfair advantage to union organizers.\n  In South Carolina we have seen the potential ramifications that come \nas a result of a widely partisan NLRB, and this rule simply reinforces \nthe fact that the Board must return to acting as the neutral arbiter it \nwas intended to be. But since that does not seem likely anytime soon, \nas my friends on the left resist efforts that Senator Alexander and I \nand others have introduced to reform the Board, we find ourselves here \ntoday.\n  I will leave you with just a few quotes. One is from Brian Hayes:\n\n       The principal purpose for this radical manipulation of our \n     election process is to minimize, or rather, to effectively \n     eviscerate an employer's legitimate opportunity to express \n     its views about collective bargaining.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to disapprove of the ambush elections \nrule and return workplace decisions to employees--not to Big Labor and \na partisan administration.\n  Just a few weeks ago we had a hearing in the HELP Committee. \nSometimes when we have this conversation about what is good for \nemployees versus what is good for employers, we find a way of taking \nthese two groups of folks and trying to put them in competing \ncategories. I asked a very simple question at one of the hearings, and \nI wish to take a few minutes to walk through what we are expecting of \nemployers as we engage in this new process of ambush elections. I think \nwe will see very clearly why we call them ambush elections.\n  For the last 13 or 14 years, before entering Congress, I was a small \nbusiness owner, an entrepreneur. I thought I had found the American \ndream. We were making a profit. We were moving forward. We were hiring \npeople. And now, as I think it through, if I were still in business \ntoday, what are we asking employers to do in as short a window as 10 \ndays?\n  With less than two dozen employees and no in-house legal counsel, I \nam expected in as few as 10 days to understand what an election \nposition is; to find a labor attorney in Charleston with NLRB \nexperience, and hopefully, NLRB expertise; to learn what can and cannot \nbe said to employees; to figure out which employees are eligible to \nvote; to submit to the union names of eligible employees, their \naddresses, personal emails, their cell phone numbers, their work \nlocation, shift information, employee classifications; and to ensure \nall legal arguments are raised at this point in time so that I do not \nwaive my right to use those arguments in the future. All of this must \nbe done with amazing haste and great precision.\n  Meanwhile, the clock is ticking. The clock is ticking on my right to \ntalk with my employees before an election. My business is being \nneglected. Bear in mind that employers and entrepreneurs start \nbusinesses so that we can actually accomplish a task, not necessarily \nto defend ourselves in this process. So while we are neglecting our \nbusiness and incurring substantial legal costs, I have to ask myself \none very simple question--and I think many people are going to ask \nthemselves the same exact question--and it is simply this: How does \nthis lead to a fair election for any employee or any employer? It seems \nto me that it simply cannot and it will not.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n            The Israeli Prime Minister's Address To Congress\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, this morning we were fortunate enough to \nhear Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu address a joint meeting \nof Congress. I was disappointed the Vice President and a number of \nDemocratic Members of Congress chose not to attend this event. They \nmissed a powerful speech, and they missed an opportunity to demonstrate \nAmerica's commitment to our strongest ally, Israel.\n  In his speech before the American-Israeli Public Affairs Committee \nyesterday, Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke about Israel's alliance with \nthe United States to, as he put it, ``defend our common civilization \nagainst common threats.'' He spoke of ``values that unite us . . . \nvalues like liberty, equality, justice, tolerance, and compassion.'' \nThese are the values that unite us. They are the values both our \nNations are committed to defend. It is an area of the world where \nrespect for liberty and equality is often nonexistent. Israel stands up \nfor these most essential principles. America is proud to be her ally.\n  The Prime Minister spoke this morning about the dangers of a nuclear-\narmed Iran. I scarcely need to enumerate the reasons why Iran \npossessing a nuclear weapon is such a dangerous prospect.\n  First and foremost, Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism. That rather \nbureaucratic phrase obscures the full horror of what it signifies--that \nIran's Government helps advance the activities of those who have made \nviolence their mission and have kept millions of ordinary men, women, \nand children in the Middle East from living in stability and peace.\n  Iran has fomented hostility toward the State of Israel, and its \nleaders have publicly stated the desire to wipe the entire Nation of \nIsrael off the map. As Iran spreads violence and oppression abroad, it \nalso uses the same tactics against its people at home. Iran's \nGovernment is hostile to freedom of any kind, whether it be freedom of \nspeech or freedom of religion, and thousands of its own citizens have \nbeen tortured and imprisoned and executed for daring to stand up for \ntheir human rights. Keeping such a regime from developing a nuclear \nweapon must be a priority.\n  Unfortunately, since November of 2013, when the Obama administration \nfirst reached an interim nuclear agreement with Iran, all we have seen \nfrom these negotiations are delays and extensions while Iran has \nreceived an easing of sanctions. We hear it repeated that ``no deal is \nbetter than a bad deal.'' Yet while Israel has made it clear that an \nagreement which recognizes Iran's right to enrich uranium is \nunacceptable, our own administration has yet to clearly state what a \ngood deal would look like.\n  When the Senate made efforts to set out the parameters for an \nacceptable final agreement by introducing the bipartisan Nuclear Weapon \nFree Iran Act of 2015, which I cosponsored, the President announced \nthat he would veto such a bill without even waiting to see\n\n[[Page S1242]]\n\nwhat it would look like after being fully debated and amended.\n  Last week two of my colleagues introduced the Iran Nuclear Agreement \nReview Act of 2015, which would give Congress 60 days to approve or \ndisapprove any final agreement. It will be telling if the President \nthreatens to veto this bill as well. It is essential that any final \nagreement on Iran's nuclear capability be acceptable to the American \npeople, and congressional review is therefore indispensable.\n  I am eager to work with the White House and my colleagues across the \naisle to provide the American people and our allies abroad with the \nassurance that Iran will not be allowed to arm itself with a nuclear \nweapon. However, I am concerned that if the President continues his go-\nit-alone approach, Americans may not like the deal that emerges.\n\n\n                            King v. Burwell\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to pivot to an issue that is being considered \nover in the Supreme Court this week. Tomorrow the Supreme Court is \ngoing to hear oral arguments in the case of King v. Burwell, which \nchallenges the extension of ObamaCare subsidies to States with Federal \nexchanges.\n  The President's health care law states that individuals who enroll \nthrough ``an exchange established by the State'' are entitled to \nreceive subsidies to help with their premium payments.\n  ObamaCare architect Jonathan Gruber made it clear this was intended \nto give States an incentive to create their own exchanges. At an event \nin 2012, he told the audience:\n\n       [W]hat's important to remember politically about this is if \n     you're a state and you don't set up an exchange, that means \n     your citizens don't get their tax credits--but your citizens \n     still pay the taxes that support this bill.\n\n  That is from ObamaCare architect Jonathan Gruber back in 2012.\n  In the wake of the health care law's passage, however, States made it \nclear they were reluctant to take on the costs and burdens associated \nwith ObamaCare. More than two-thirds of the States declined to set up \ntheir own exchanges, and the Obama administration provided the \nsubsidies to those enrolled on Federal exchanges despite there being no \nauthority in the law for it to do so, and despite the concerns \nexpressed by members of the President's own administration who were \ndoubtful about the legality of such a move.\n  The administration's decision to push forward with the subsidies \ndespite the lack of legal authority could have serious consequences for \nmillions of Americans. If the Supreme Court finds the Obama \nadministration overstepped its authority, 5 million Americans could \nlose their ObamaCare subsidies.\n  I recently joined several of my colleagues in sending a letter to the \nhead of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Treasury \nSecretary to ask what the administration's plan is for dealing with the \naftermath of an unfavorable Supreme Court ruling. The administration's \nanswer: Nothing. That is right. Health and Human Services Secretary \nSylvia Mathews Burwell told us the administration has no administrative \nplans for what it would do in the event of an unfavorable decision by \nthe Supreme Court.\n  In fact, the administration declined to even warn Americans enrolling \nthis year of what could happen if the Supreme Court found the \nadministration was illegally providing subsidies.\n  Clearly the millions of Americans who could lose their health care \npremium subsidy, thanks to the administration's abuse of its authority, \nneed a solution, and Republicans have been working on solutions. The \njunior Senator from Nebraska has put forward a plan to use the 1985 \nCOBRA law to extend temporary health care assistance to these Americans \nfor 18 months.\n  Other Republicans--Senator Hatch from Utah, Senator Alexander from \nTennessee, Senator Barrasso from Wyoming--have offered their own plan \nwhich would also provide temporary financial assistance to affected \nAmericans while they recover from the loss of the subsidies.\n  The chairmen of the House Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce, and \nEducation and the Workforce Committees have released a roadmap for \nreplacing ObamaCare with market-based solutions. Their plan allows \nStates to opt out of many ObamaCare mandates while maintaining \nprotections for Americans. It would also make refundable tax credits \navailable to Americans who lost their subsidies.\n  All of these plans seek to replace the broken ObamaCare system with \nreal health care reform that would lower costs, expand access to care, \nand to put patients, not the government, in charge of their health care \ndecisions.\n  We don't need this court case to demonstrate that ObamaCare has been \na massive failure. We already had the unexpected tax bills, the higher \npremiums, the loss of doctors and hospitals, the health care plans \nAmericans were not allowed to keep, the law's negative effect on \nemployment, and I could go on and on.\n  This court case underscores what all the other law's problems have \ndemonstrated: ObamaCare is not fixing the health care challenges facing \nour country. If anything, it is making them worse. ObamaCare has been \ntried, and it has been found wanting. It is time to repeal this law and \nto replace it with health care reforms that will actually fix the \nproblems in our health care system and improve affordability and access \nfor all Americans. Five years of ObamaCare is long enough.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the National Labor \nRelations Board representation case procedures rule, which is set to go \ninto effect April 14.\n  This rule unfairly expedites union elections and squelches individual \nself-determination, democratic decisionmaking, and freedom of \nexpression. It is also a blatant attempt to circumvent Congress's \nlegitimate constitutional role in how--if at all--to reform the \nNational Labor Relations Act. It is a clear case of regulatory \noverreach, and it is an abuse of power.\n  The National Labor Relations Act seeks to create equity--or a ``level \nplaying field,'' so to speak--in labor relations. Now, I believe the \nNLRA is far from perfect. In fact, I have introduced multiple pieces of \nlegislation over the years to amend the NLRA. Nevertheless, any reform \nmust be openly debated and enacted by Congress, not decided \nunilaterally by an unaccountable bureaucracy.\n  I am concerned because this National Labor Relations Board case \nrepresentation rule clearly favors the unions. I am not anti-union. I \noppose this rule because I am a champion for both workers and \nbusinesses, for employee groups and the employer community. This rule \nhurts both. I oppose this rule not because I am against a worker's \nright to join a union but because this rule is detrimental to both \nemployers and employees.\n  The NLRA guarantees the right to engage in union activities. It also \nensures the right to refrain from such activities. This rule \ndramatically shortens the period of time that exists between a union \nfiling an election petition and the actual election. Shortening this \ntime period undermines an employer's ability to hold a lawful exchange \nwith its employees on whether to select union representation. It also \ndeprives workers of their right to receive key information from all \nsides, as the NLRB currently provides--a system that allows for a full \nand robust debate between unions, employees, and employers.\n  Moreover, there is simply no need for the rule.\n  Both businesses and workers deserve a process that is free of \nunnecessary delays. Nearly 95 percent of all elections take place \nwithin 2 months after a petition has been filed, and the unions have \nwon more than two-thirds of these elections during that time. No one \ncan claim that this process is fraught with unnecessary delays.\n  Unions favor this rule because it rigs the system by allowing them to \ncampaign without the employer's knowledge. While some argue that \nemployers are free to talk to their employees about unionization at any \ntime, employers are unable to rebut a union's\n\n[[Page S1243]]\n\nargument if they are unaware the arguments are even being made. This \nrule leaves employers with insufficient time to respond to a union's \narguments--and they know that. That is what is wrong with this \nlegislation. Once again, this hurts both the worker and the employer.\n  While my main objection to this rule is that it precludes workers and \nemployers from necessary and protected information sharing, I also \noppose the rule because it is likely to throw many elections into chaos \nand confusion.\n  Under this rule, voter eligibility would be deferred to postelection \nprocedures. Employees would be asked to vote on joining a union without \nknowing which employees will ultimately make up the bargaining unit. \nSimply put, unions are trying to win representation elections without \ndefining whom they are representing.\n  Furthermore, there are serious due process concerns surrounding the \ninitial hearing and Statement of Position requirements. It is \nparticularly burdensome to small employers to collect the required \ninformation following the filing of the petition in this drastically \nshortened timeframe.\n  Lastly, we cannot ignore that with this rule the NLRB is invading \nemployees' privacy and exposing them to potential identity theft by \nmandating that employers turn over employees' personal telephone \nnumbers and email addresses to the unions. That is outrageous. The rule \ntramples on workers' individual liberties by allowing unions to \nunfairly obtain an employee's private information.\n  The NLRB should be a neutral arbiter--an impartial overseer of the \nprocess--working to enforce the law, and to stop violations, and to \nintervene in attempts to sway benefit from one side or the other. It \nshould not be an advocate for organized labor. Rather than approaching \nthe situation from the neutral perspective, this rule makes a value \njudgment that favors unions based on false assumptions.\n  The NLRB should properly be safeguarding labor relations processes. I \nurge us all to support workers' personal liberties by providing them \nample opportunity to make up their own minds. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to support employers in preserving due process while \ncultivating constructive dialogue between businesses and workers.\n  I thank Senators Alexander and Enzi for leading this action under the \nCongressional Review Act. I am proud to stand with the majority of my \nSenate colleagues today in preventing the NLRB's abuse of regulatory \npower by supporting this resolution of disapproval.\n  I am well aware of these types of tactics by the union movement. I am \none of the few people in this body who was really raised in the union \nmovement, who actually learned a skilled trade, who actually worked as \na union member for 10 years in the building and construction trade \nunions as a metal lather.\n  I have to tell my colleagues that some of these people in the NLRB \nand others have been trying to get quickie elections through for a long \ntime, and of course, the purpose of it is to slant everything in their \nfavor, when they win a majority of the NLRB votes anyway. No, they just \nwant to win all of them without giving the employees the necessary \ninformation to be able to make wise decisions as to whether to join a \nunion, and then they cloud it up by making it almost impossible to know \nwhich part of the union or which methodology they are going to go into.\n  We have stopped quickie elections for years. We have had good \nDemocrats and good Republicans vote against quickie elections. It is \nnot fair to slant the system totally against employers, which is what \nthis bill will do.\n  Frankly, it is time we quit pulling these dirty tricks. It really \nnever ceases to amaze me. When Republicans appoint--and they are in the \nmajority--people to the NLRB, as a general rule, they try to make \nthings more fair. They try to look at both sides and be fair. When \nDemocrats do it--when Democratic Presidents do it--they try to pull \ntricks such as this that really are unworthy of the type of \nconsiderations that really are involved in these union elections. I \ndon't mind unions winning, but they ought to win fair and square. They \nshouldn't win because they stacked the deck against the businesses. \nThere are enough rules to give unions advantages in union elections as \nit is. But to have quickie elections so that the owner of the business \nor the owners of the business don't have a chance to answer the \nquestions that come up or even speak to their employees is just wrong. \nI am opposed to it, and I hope everybody in this Senate is opposed to \nit as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. DAINES. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Keystone XL Pipeline\n\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, the Keystone XL Pipeline means opportunity \nfor the American people. The President is standing in the way of jobs. \nHe is standing in the way of affordable energy. He is standing in the \nway of our Nation's energy security. His recent veto threat and now \ncarrying through with the veto sent a clear message that he is more \nconcerned with political games than increasing opportunity for the \nAmerican people.\n  We are here today to send a strong message that this fight is far \nfrom over.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline is a lifeline for many Montana communities. \nIn fact, the Keystone Pipeline enters the United States through \nMontana, and that is why I will keep fighting to get this project \nmoving forward.\n  In fact, in our State of Montana alone, the Keystone Pipeline means \n$80 million to Montana counties and schools per year. Now, $16 million \nper year of that goes directly to our Montana university systems. This \nis how we continue to fund our infrastructure, our schools, and our \nteachers.\n\n  A couple of weeks ago I got a call from Rion Miles. He is the \nbusiness manager for the Operating Engineers Local 400 in Montana. He \ntold me the Keystone XL Pipeline will create 300 good-paying jobs for \nhis union members in Montana alone. Like most Montanans, Ryan is \nscratching his head. He doesn't understand why the President is \nstanding in the way of these good-paying union jobs.\n  A while back, I was in my pickup traveling in eastern Montana in the \ntown of Glasgow. I stopped by the NorVal Co-Op. This co-op supplies \nelectricity to a few thousand Montana families in northeast Montana. \nThey told me over a cup of coffee that morning that they will keep \nelectric rates flat for the next 10 years if the Keystone Pipeline is \napproved. Why is that? That is because the NorVal Co-Op is supplying \nthe electricity to a couple of the pump stations on the Keystone \nPipeline. That extra volume of electricity will help keep costs down \nfor everybody.\n  I asked: What happens if the Keystone Pipeline is not approved? They \nsaid electric rates would go up about 40 percent over the next 10 \nyears. That is nearly $500 a year of increase per family. These are \nhardworking Montana families living month to month. These are senior \ncitizens living on fixed incomes, where we can hold their utility \nrates, electric rates flat for the next 10 years by passing the \nKeystone Pipeline bill.\n  What about North American energy independence? Up to 830,000 barrels \na day of oil will be transported through this pipeline. Contrary to \nwhat the President has said, 100,000 barrels a day from the Bakken, \nwhich is shared between North Dakota and Montana, will be put into that \npipeline close to Baker, Montana.\n  The President was just given four Pinocchios by the Washington Post \nyesterday for claiming that the Keystone Pipeline bypassed the United \nStates.\n  I would like to have the President come to Montana. I will pick him \nup in Billings, and we will drive in my pickup. I will show him where \nthe proposed siting is for the Baker onramp where 100,000 barrels a day \nof made-in-Montana and made-in-North Dakota oil will enter the Keystone \nPipeline. The people of Montana and the people in the Bakken region \nknow the President's claim is absolutely false.\n  With gas dropping under two bucks a gallon where I am from, that has \nbeen a welcomed change for many, many hard-working Montana families. \nWhy are gas prices dropping? It is because we are seeing more made-in-\nAmerica\n\n[[Page S1244]]\n\nenergy. Again, this lowering in gas prices will result in approximately \n$750 a year of savings for the average American household. That is a \ngood thing. But rather than hitting pause on our energy production, it \nis time to encourage it.\n  Just this morning we were reminded by Israeli Prime Minister \nNetanyahu that we are living in an increasingly dangerous world. Our \nenergy security isn't just about jobs and low energy prices. It is \ndirectly tied to our national security. Whether it is ISIS, whether it \nis Boko Haram in Nigeria and Chad, whether it is the Russian aggression \nin Eastern Europe or the growing threat of a nuclear Iran, it is \nvitally important we move forward with more made-in-America energy \nbecause many of these regions that are filled with turmoil supply much \nof the world's oil and natural gas.\n  I remember just a year ago when we were having some challenges and we \nlooked at the numbers of what is going on in Ukraine. Nearly 40 percent \nof the natural gas that is supplied in Europe comes through pipelines \ngoing through Ukraine. Thankfully, as the United States becomes the \nworld's largest oil producer this year, surpassing both Russia and \nSaudi Arabia, these are positive steps forward towards a more secure \nfuture for our children and grandchildren. We need more made-in-America \nenergy, not more made-in-the-Middle East oil. The Keystone Pipeline \nwill help us do just that.\n  Looking forward, the President's veto isn't the end. This week we \nwill vote to override the President's veto. I hope we can get three or \nfour more Senators onboard for this veto vote, and we can do it in the \nSenate. I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. It was \nencouraging to see a good bipartisan vote in the Senate and in the \nHouse in support of the Keystone Pipeline. Let's stand together, and \nlet's stand with the American people and override the President's \nshortsighted veto. Regardless of the vote, the fight is not over.\n  This week the President himself said he would make a final decision \non this pipeline. I hope he does. You realize it took the Canadians \njust 7 months to approve the Keystone Pipeline--7 months. It has now \ntaken our President over 6 years without approving the pipeline. We \nmust keep the pressure on this administration. We must continue to \nfight for American jobs, American opportunity, American energy \nindependence, and low energy prices.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/03/senate-section/article/S1244-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       REMEMBERING MINNIE MINOSO\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on Sunday, America lost a baseball legend \nwhen Saturino Orestes Armas Minoso Arrieta passed away. We knew him as \nthe Cuban Comet, as Mr. White Sox, as the heart and soul of Chicago \nbaseball on the South Side, and a beacon of hope for Cuban athletes \neverywhere. It is with great sorrow that Chicago loses its South Side \nWhite Sox champion only days after the North Side Cubs lost their \nchampion, Ernie Banks.\n  Before Minnie was Major League Baseball's first black Latino star, he \nwas the son of a sugarcane plantation worker in Perico, Cuba. He \nstarted his professional baseball career in Cuba, playing for $2 a game \nwith the Ambrosia Candy team in Havana for the 1943 season. He also \nworked in the company garage for $8 a week. But within a couple of \nyears, he made it to Havana's Marianao team, making $150 a month, which \nsoon became $200 a month to keep him from moving even more quickly in \nhis career.\n  By 1946, Minnie's talent couldn't be kept away from bigger leagues. \nHe signed a $300 deal to play for the New York Cubans of the Negro \nNational League. Minnie played third base for the Cubans, batted .294, \nplayed in the All-Star Game, and helped them win the pennant. They \nwould beat the Cleveland Buckeyes in the World Series.\n  The Cleveland Indians hired Minoso in 1949, but the Indians barely \nused him. He spent the next 2 years in the minor leagues. In 1951, the \nIndians made a three-team trade with the White Sox and Philadelphia \nPhillies, and Minnie arrived in Chicago.\n  Minnie Minoso was the first Black player to wear a Chicago White Sox \nuniform. His first at-bat was a home run. That first year, the fans \ngave him his own day, and he was selected for the All-Star Game. He \ndrove opponents mad with his ability to get on base and steal bases. He \nunabashedly crowded the plate and was hit by a pitch 192 times--just so \nhe could steal second.\n  Minnie Minoso played 12 seasons with the White Sox over five decades. \nThe seven-time All-Star was The Sporting News Rookie of the Year in \n1951, he won three Gold Gloves in left field, and finished in the top \nfour in American League MVP four times. His number was retired in 1983. \nMinnie had a wonderful career. He is one of two players ever to appear \nin a major league game in five decades. During the 1950's, two players \nhad 100 homeruns, 100 stolen bases, and batted .300. Those two were the \nlegendary Willie Mays and Minnie Minoso.\n  But his life was bigger than numbers. He brought optimism to all \nthose around him. Nothing made him happier than when the White Sox won \nthe World Series in 2005 with fellow Cubans Jose Conteras and Orlando \nHernandez playing pivotal roles.\n  Minnie Minoso was a great treasure to Chicago. He used to cruise the \nChicago streets in his big car with a White Sox flag flying and his dog \nJewel on the front seat. Through all the decades he spent in Chicago, \nhe helped make the town, the White Sox, and the sport of baseball a joy \nfor thousands of fans. He will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/03/senate-section/article/S1244-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1244-S1245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today the House adopted the Department \nof Homeland Security funding bill without poison pill riders. The bill \npassed the Senate on Friday, and will fund the Department of Homeland \nSecurity through September 30, 2015--the end of fiscal year 2015.\n  I am glad Congress finally put partisanship aside and funded the \nsecurity of the American people. And, I want to thank all those who \nprotect our country, from the Coast Guard to the Secret Service, to \ncyber security professionals and intelligence analysts. Your funds are \nsecure.\n  The mission of the Department of Homeland Security is to protect \nAmerica from terrorism and help communities respond to all threats, \nincluding those from terrorists and natural disasters. This is a good \nbill and there was no disagreement on the funding. In December, working \nwith Senator Coats and Senator Landrieu, and our House colleagues, we \nagreed that vital funding for the Department of Homeland Security would \ntotal $46 billion--over $1 billion more than a continuing funding \nresolution.\n  I am glad this responsible bill to fund the mission of the Department \nof Homeland Security and its employees is heading to the President's \ndesk. DHS employees are on the job every day. The Coast Guard is \nliterally breaking ice to keep the economy flowing. The Secret Service \nis protecting the President and fighting credit card fraud. Border \nPatrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are securing our \nborders and enforcing our immigration laws. The Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency is preparing for and responding to disasters, \nincluding hurricanes and blizzards. There are cyber warriors securing \nour networks. And through grant programs the funding supports State and \nlocal law enforcement, fire fighters, and EMS. Now, after 5 months, we \nhave done our job to put the resources into the hands of the workers \nwho defend America.\n  It is my hope that with passage of the homeland security funding \nbill, Congress can end the era of divisive shutdown politics. The \nmillions of men and women serving in our military and the civil \nservice, who work every day to make this a better Nation, deserve \nrespect and the resources to do their jobs.\n  Looking ahead, I look forward to working across the aisle and across \nthe dome to debate and complete all 12 fiscal year 2016 appropriations \nbills in an orderly way, without poison pill riders.\n\n[[Page S1245]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/03/senate-section/article/S1245-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. NELSON.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nrecognize a great friend and gifted wordsmith, Dan Hammer, who is \nretiring after a long and distinguished career in public service.\n  Born and raised in San Jose, Dan attended UC Santa Cruz before moving \nto Boston to manage an antiwar printing press. He returned to the San \nFrancisco Bay area soon afterwards, where he cut his editing teeth as a \ntypesetter for Rolling Stone magazine.\n  I first crossed paths with Dan during my 1992 Senate campaign. Dan \nstopped by my San Diego campaign office after work one day, and his \nimmense talents immediately caught the attention of my local campaign \nmanager. Dan quickly became one of my hardest working volunteers, doing \neverything from writing memos and news advisories to helping manage my \npublic events. After I won the election, I knew I had to have Dan on my \nteam. Although it took some convincing, he joined my San Diego district \noffice in 1994.\n  Dan has held many positions in my offices over the years. As a San \nDiego-based field representative, he served as my eyes and ears on the \nground, keeping me apprised of critical issues in southern California. \nAs my deputy press secretary based out of my Washington, DC office, Dan \nworked many late nights writing press releases and staffing me at \nevents. As my constituent communications director, Dan moved my entire \nlegislative correspondence operation from DC to southern California, \nmanaging the full operation with discipline and precision. Under his \nleadership, my legislative correspondence team answers 200,000 letters \nand emails every month, and he uses his exceptional communications \nskills every day to share my work with the constituents I serve. \nThrough it all, he has helped teach a generation of young staffers how \nto effectively communicate about the most important issues and ideas of \nour time.\n  Outside of work, Dan selflessly gives his time to the causes he \nbelieves in. Whether volunteering with environmental organizations like \nthe Planning and Conservation League, working for other elected \nofficials including Congresswoman Susan Davis, or joining the U.S. \nCoast Guard Auxiliary, Dan has always been dedicated to making his \ncommunity a better place to live.\n  For more than 20 years, Dan has been a trusted ally, advisor, and \nfriend. As he begins his retirement and embarks on the next exciting \nchapter of his life, I send him, his wife Shelley, and their entire \nfamily my best wishes, deep affection, and abiding gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/03/senate-section/article/S1245-3", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nCONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE \nORDER 13660 ON MARCH 6, 2014, AS MODIFIED BY THE ORDER OF DECEMBER 19, \n                  2014, WITH RESPECT TO UKRAINE--PM 8\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

A bill to establish the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta National \nHeritage Area; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself and Senator \nBoxer to introduce legislation to establish a National Heritage Area in \nthe California Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. This legislation will \ncreate the first Heritage Area in California.\n  This bill was first introduced in 2011 and has been the subject of \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee hearings in both the 112th and \n113th Congresses. Since then, the Delta Protection Commission has \ncompleted a feasibility study, as required, and endorsed the \nlegislation. Additionally, the National Park Service has confirmed that \nthe study is consistent with the agency's interim National Heritage \nArea Feasibility Study Guidelines.\n  I was pleased to have had the opportunity to work with Senator Boxer, \nRepresentative John Garamendi, and the County Supervisors from the five \nDelta Counties to develop this legislation and look forward to \ncontinuing to partner with them as well as local, State and Federal \nagencies to care for and improve the Delta.\n  This bill will establish the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta as a \nNational Heritage Area. The purpose of the heritage area is to conserve \nand protect the Delta, its communities, its resources, and its history.\n  The Delta Protection Commission, created by California law and \nresponsible to the citizens of the Delta and California, will manage \nthe Heritage Area. It will ensure an open and public process, working \nwith all levels of Federal, State, and local government, tribes, local \nstakeholders, and private property owners as it develops and implements \nthe management plan for the Heritage Area. The bill authorizes $10 \nmillion in Federal assistance over the next 15 years to provide \ntechnical assistance and matching grants to local governments and \nnonprofit organizations to implement the management plan to conserve \nand protect the delta's natural, historical and cultural resources.\n  It is also important to understand what this legislation will not do. \nIt will not affect water rights. It will not affect water contracts. It \nwill not affect private property. It will not affect fishing or \nhunting.\n  Nothing in this bill gives any governmental agency any more \nregulatory power than it already has, nor does it take away regulatory \nfrom agencies that have it.\n  In short, this bill does not affect water rights or water contracts, \nnor does it impose any additional responsibilities on local government \nor residents. Instead, it authorizes Federal assistance to a local \nprocess already required by State law that will elevate the Delta, \nproviding a means to conserve and protect its valued communities, \nresources, and history.\n  The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is the largest estuary on the West \nCoast. It is the most extensive inland delta in the world, and a unique \nnational treasure.\n  Today, it is a labyrinth of sloughs, wetlands, and deepwater channels \nthat connect the waters of the high Sierra mountain streams to the \nPacific Ocean through the San Francisco Bay. Its approximately 60 \nislands are protected by 1,100 miles of levees, and are home to \n3,500,000 residents, including 2,500 family farmers. The Delta and its \nfarmers produce some of the highest quality specialty crops in the \nUnited States.\n  The Delta offers recreational opportunities to the two million \nCalifornians who visit the area each year for boating, fishing, \nhunting, visiting historic sites, and viewing wildlife. It provides \nhabitat for more than 750 species of plants and wildlife. These include \nsand hill cranes that migrate to the Delta wetland from places as far \naway as Siberia. The Delta also provides habitat for 55 species of \nfish, including Chinook salmon, some as large as 60 pounds, that return \neach year to travel through the Delta to spawn in the tributaries.\n  These same waterways also channel fresh water to the Federal and \nState-owned pumps in the South Delta that provide water to 23 million \nCalifornians and three million acres of irrigated agricultural land \nelsewhere in the State.\n  Before the Delta was reclaimed for farmland in the 19th Century, the \nDelta flooded regularly with snow melt each spring, and provided the \nrich environment that, by 1492, supported the\n\n[[Page S1251]]\n\nlargest settlement of Native Americans in North America.\n  The Delta was the gateway to the gold fields in 1849, after which \nChinese workers built hundreds of miles of levees throughout the \nwaterways of the Delta to make its rich peat soils available for \nfarming and to control flooding.\n  Japanese, Italians, German, Portuguese, Dutch, Greeks, South Asians \nand other immigrants began the farming legacy, and developed \ntechnologies specifically adapted to the unique environment, including \nthe Caterpillar Tractor, which later contributed to agriculture and \ntransportation internationally.\n  Delta communities created a river culture befitting their dependence \non water transport, a culture which has attracted the attention of \nauthors from Mark Twain and Jack London to Joan Didion.\n  The National Heritage Area designation for the Sacramento-San Joaquin \nDelta will help local governments develop and implement a plan for a \nsustainable future by providing federal recognition, technical \nassistance and small amounts of funding to a community-based process \nalready underway.\n  Through the Delta Heritage Area, local communities and citizens will \npartner with Federal, State and local governments to collaboratively \nwork to promote conservation, community revitalization, and economic \ndevelopment projects.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 630\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to exempt National Forest System land in the State of \nAlaska from the Roadless Area Conservation Rule; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, rise today to introduce legislation \nthat I have cosponsored for a number of years, that will remedy the \nproblems that have been created by this administration's decision to \napply the, Inventoried, Roadless Area Conservation Rule to Alaska, \nespecially in Southeast Alaska's Tongass National Forest, and also in \nthe Chugach National Forest of Southcentral Alaska. I am joined today \nin introducing that bill by my Alaska colleague Senator Dan Sullivan.\n  Back in 2001 the Clinton administration promulgated the Nationwide \nInventoried Area Roadless Conservation Rule. Initially the rule did not \ncover the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, which has been the subject \nof congressional review and special legislation twice in the past 35 \nyears, first in the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act in \n1980, which reduced the allowable timber harvest in\n\n[[Page S1253]]\n\nthe 16.9-million acre forest from nearly 1 billion board feet a year to \na 450 million board foot harvest level, and later by the Tongass Timber \nReform Act of 1990, which further reduced the allowable harvest level \nto 267 million board feet annually. Congress in 1980 created 5.75 \nmillion acres of wilderness by creating 14 wilderness areas in the \nforest, and in 1990 further reduced the lands available for timber \nharvesting by creating five additional wilderness areas totaling \n296,000 acres and 12 Land Unit Designation 11 areas of 727,700 acres \nthat increased the protected acreages in the Tongass to more than 6.4 \nmillion. With the passage of the Sealaska lands bill in 2014, total \nprotected acreage in the Tongass has risen to 6.55 million acres.\n  Lands classified for potential timber production have been \ndrastically reduced since the 1980 Act's passage. In the Tongass Land \nManagement Plans, TLPM, crafted after ANILCA's passage, 13.3 million \nacres of the forest, nearly 80 percent, have been restricted from \nresource development. Of the 9.5 million acres of commercial timber \nlands in the Tongass only 3.4 million were open for development after \n1980 and only 800,000, including previously logged areas, were \npermitted/planned for harvest over a prospective 100-year timber \nrotation, harvesting limited to about 8,250 acres a year--4 percent of \nthe total land area. That included about 400,000 ``new'' acres of new \ntimber lands over a century on top of the roughly 425,000 acres \nharvested since modern timber activities in Southeast Alaska began in \nthe 1950's and allowed in part for reentry in the future. Since passage \nof the Tongass Timber Reform Act, and since imposition of the \nInventoried Roadless Rule, potential harvesting has dropped even \nfurther.\n  The 2001 Inventoried Roadless Areas in the Tongass include 9.5 \nmillion acres, 57 percent of the entire forest, while 5.4 million \nacres, 99 percent, of the Chugach National Forest in Southcentral \nAlaska were placed in protected status. In the Tongass 7.4 million \nacres are in the highest protected status of inventoried roadless \nmeaning that not only can't roads be built for forestry, but that \naccess is not allowed for other uses such as renewable energy \ndevelopment. Overall, between the Inventoried Roadless Rule and other \nland protections, fewer than 176,000 acres of ``new'' timber lands are \nplanned for harvest over the next 100 years, cutting the allowable sale \nquantity below 267 mmbf. The drop in employment in the region has been \nchilling. According to the Forest Service, total direct timber sector \nemployment fell from a high of 3,543 average annual employees in 1990 \nto 402 in 2007, Tongass employment in logging and sawmilling has \ndeclined from 409 in 2001, the first year of the roadless rule, to 114 \nby 2007. The drop off in timber activity would actually be higher \nexcept the State of Alaska, to the degree that it could, increased \nState timber sales. In 2002, for example, 73 percent of all timber cut \nin Southeast came from Federal forest lands, while by 2007 the \npercentage stood at barely half coming from Federal lands.\n  Without changes in the roadless rule to allow some additional timber \nharvest areas and other energy and mineral development, no more than \nabout 3 percent of the Nation's largest forest will ever be developed \nand Southeast Alaska will be forced to depend solely on fisheries and \ntourism as economic engines, potentially returning the region to its \nimpoverished economy of the 1940s.\n  Today I am introducing legislation to simply exempt Alaska from the \nInventoried Roadless Rule. That will not permit economic development on \nall 9.5 million acres of IRA lands in the Tongass or many of the lands \nin the Chugach. They will continue to be protected by the terms of the \nnational forest plans for both forests. What it will do is permit land \nplanners the flexibility to propose more rational land planning \ndecisions in the future. It would allow the Forest Service the ability \nto permit road and electric transmission lines to be placed to tap the \nregion's huge hydroelectric potential--there being 300 megawatts of \nhydropower available from known sites, if distribution lines can be \nbuilt at reasonable cost to get the power to markets.\n  Adding some timber back to the timber base would allow a timber \nindustry to again help the region's economy. But that would not harm \nthe environment and wildlife. Already of the 537,451 acres of \nproductive old-growth, POG, trees left in the Tongass, 437,000 are in \npermanent conservation areas--81 percent.\n  The roadless rule may make sense in the contiguous states since there \nare at least some roads and utility lines that cross those States' \nnational forests. In Southeast Alaska, however, there is no \ntransportation network except a marine ferry system, and no permitted \nelectrical transmission system. It simply made no sense in 2001 for the \nInventoried Roadless Rules to apply to Alaska. The rule is not needed \nsince by existing plans and regulations, even without IRA's, 96 percent \nof the Tongass will remain protected. An exemption from the rule will \nsimply allow Alaskans an opportunity to make thoughtful decisions on \ndevelopment in a region 18 times larger than the state of Delaware, but \nwith 1,300 miles of road in the entire region, 1/10 of the road miles \nof tiny Delaware.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FLAKE (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Lee, Mr. Crapo, Mr. \n        Cornyn, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. Vitter):\n  S. 638. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act with respect to exceptional \nevent demonstrations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I thought I would rise to discuss \nlegislation designed to address the bureaucratic overreach in the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's air regulations.\n  Since I last introduced these bills in June of 2014, EPA's failures \nin this area have become even more glaring. At present, air regulations \nare stifling to both businesses and private citizens, and they are \nnegatively impacting our economy.\n  Let me say from the outset, we all want clean air. We are always in \nfavor of protecting the environment and the air we breathe. I think we \nare not in favor of an EPA that places real regulations over common \nsense.\n  Today I am introducing S. 638, S. 639, and S. 640, the CLEER Act, the \nORDEAL Act, and the Agency PAYGO for greenhouse gases.\n  The CLEER Act eases the regulatory burden on States, including desert \nStates such as Arizona that are home to so-called exceptional events \nsuch as dust storms.\n  Dust storms in Arizona are not caused by man. They are naturally \noccurring events, just like tornadoes or blizzards in other parts of \nthe country. When these dust storms occur in Arizona, they can cause a \nspike in the dust, or the PM-10 level. This is nothing the State can \ncontrol. Yet this blip can cause Arizona and other affected States to \nfall out of compliance with Federal air quality standards. Again, this \nis through no fault of their own. It can lead to a loss of \ntransportation dollars, even from the Federal Government.\n  Thanks to EPA rules, States end up wasting vast amounts of manpower, \ncountless work hours, and lots of taxpayer dollars on reviews and \nappeals for events they cannot control or avoid.\n  For example, the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, the \nMaricopa Air Quality Department, and the Maricopa Association of \nGovernments in 2011 and 2012 spent $675,000 and 790 staff hours just to \nprove a spike in PM-10 levels was caused by a dust storm, not \npollution.\n  These EPA reviews are arbitrary, cumbersome, and costly. They lack an \nappeals process that further defies common sense. The EPA has \ncontinually assured me it would issue a rule to help ease the burdens \non States, all the States that have to weather forces of nature such as \nthis. Yet despite these promises, the EPA has continued to backtrack \nand shift deadlines, and to date has not issued a workable proposed \nrule.\n  My legislation on the CLEER Act would require the EPA to move forward \nwith a rulemaking, and it would require decisions on such events be \nbased on a preponderance of evidence, and will accord deference to \nStates' own findings of when such events happen.\n  It would also require the EPA to review the States' exceptional-event \ndocumentation within a reasonable time period of 90 days instead of \ndragging\n\n[[Page S1254]]\n\nout the process. Part of the cost is due to the fact that the EPA drags \nout the process. These practical fixes will alleviate the undue \nhardship States are having to deal with and when we have to deal with \nthe effects of these natural events.\n  Secondly, the ORDEAL Act is an attempt to overhaul the EPA's \nunnecessary ozone standard reduction until 2018. When the EPA reduced \npermitted ozone standards in 2008, counties across the country that \nwere in nonattainment were forced to enact expensive and complicated \ncompliance plans.\n  Relying on a dubious scientific basis, the EPA has proposed lowering \nthe ozone emissions standards even further to 65 parts per billion, \nwhile accepting comments on lowering it to 60 parts per billion. By \nsome estimates, this proposal to lower the ozone level may be the most \nexpensive regulation in EPA history--and that is saying something--\ncosting as much as $1.7 trillion. Lowering ozone standards from 75 \nparts per billion to 65 parts per billion will cost a whopping $140 \nbillion annually. Yet EPA's own science advisers disagree on the very \nbasis upon which this regulation is built.\n  The ORDEAL Act will stop shaky facts and assumptions from being used \nas a basis for long-term public policy, and will give States the \nflexibility and the time to implement their own innovative and \nproactive measures.\n  The bill would also extend air quality standards reviews, including \nozone, to a 10-year timeline instead of the current 5 years.\n  Third, Agency PAYGO. This administration has set its sights on \nreducing carbon emissions, most recently putting draconian regulations \non existing powerplants, despite the inevitable job losses and spikes \nin energy costs. It has placed a mandate on Arizona to reduce 52 \npercent of its carbon emissions by 2030. This is unattainable, unless \nArizonans are forced to greatly reduce their standard of living.\n  The Agency PAYGO Act I am introducing would simply give the EPA a \ntaste of its own medicine by requiring the Agency to offset the Federal \ncost of any greenhouse gas rules to an equivalent reduction in Agency \nspending. If the EPA proceeds without offsetting these costs from its \nown budget, the final greenhouse gas rule must be approved by Congress, \nsimply saying if you cannot do this as an offset within your own \nbudget, bring it to Congress and let's approve it. This bill \nspecifically forbids the EPA from denying costs to Federal agencies by \npassing on costs to the Federal agency's ratepayers.

Res. 94\n\n       Whereas a competitive global economy requires workers \n     trained in skilled professions;\n       Whereas according to a report by the National Association \n     of Manufacturers, 80 percent of respondents indicated a \n     moderate to severe shortage of qualified skilled production \n     employees, including front-line workers, such as machinists, \n     operators, craft workers, distributors, and technicians;\n       Whereas career and technical education is a tried and true \n     solution to ensure that competitive skilled workers are \n     ready, willing, and capable of holding jobs in high-wage, \n     high-skill, and in-demand career fields, such as science, \n     technology, engineering, and mathematics (commonly known as \n     ``STEM'') disciplines, nursing, allied health, construction, \n     information technology, energy sustainability, and many other \n     fields that are vital to keeping the United States \n     competitive in the global economy;\n       Whereas career and technical education helps the United \n     States meet the very real and immediate challenges of \n     economic development, student achievement, and global \n     competitiveness;\n       Whereas 14,000,000 students are enrolled in career and \n     technical education, which exists in every State and includes \n     programs in nearly 1,300 public high schools and 1,700 2-year \n     colleges;\n       Whereas 10 of the 20 fastest growing occupations in the \n     United States require an associate's degree or a lesser \n     credential, 13 of the 20 occupations in the United States \n     with the greatest number of projected new jobs require on-\n     the-job training and an associate's degree or certificate, \n     and nearly all occupations in the United States require real-\n     world skills that can be mastered through career and \n     technical education;\n       Whereas career and technical education matches \n     employability skills with workforce demand and provides \n     relevant academic and technical coursework leading to \n     industry-recognized credentials for secondary, postsecondary, \n     and adult learners;\n       Whereas career and technical education affords students the \n     opportunity to gain the knowledge, skills, and credentials \n     needed to secure careers in growing, high-demand fields;\n       Whereas secondary school students participating in career \n     and technical education are significantly more likely than \n     students not participating in career and technical education \n     to report that they had developed skills during high school \n     in problem solving, project completion, research, \n     mathematics, applying to colleges, work-related contexts, \n     communication, time management, and critical thinking;\n       Whereas students at schools with highly integrated rigorous \n     academic and career and technical education programs have \n     significantly higher achievement in reading, mathematics, and \n     science than students at schools with less integrated \n     programs; and\n       Whereas the Association for Career and Technical Education \n     has designated February as ``Career and Technical Education \n     Month'' to celebrate career and technical education across \n     the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of Career and Technical \n     Education Month;\n       (2) recognizes the importance of career and technical \n     education in preparing a well-educated and skilled workforce \n     in the United States; and\n       (3) encourages educators, counselors, and administrators to \n     promote career and technical education as an option for \n     students.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/03/senate-section/article/S1254-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1254-S1255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 95--DESIGNATING MARCH 3, 2015, AS ``WORLD WILDLIFE \n                                 DAY''\n\n  Mr. COONS (for himself and Mr. Inhofe) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Res. 94) supporting the goals and ideals \n     of Career and Technical Education Month.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, the key to America's continued success lies \nin improving our Nation's educational system. Career and technical \neducation, CTE, programs are a critical component to every student's \neducation, creating diverse pathways into further education and \ncareers. Today, these programs serve 94 percent of all high school \nstudents and 12 million postsecondary students. In both rural and urban \ncommunities, CTE plays a vital role in building student engagement, \ncontinuing our Nation's economic competitiveness, and building the \nskills of our workforce to meet and adapt to the needs of the 21st \ncentury.\n  Further, approximately 30 percent of jobs by 2018 will require some \ncollege or a 2-year associates degree, a need that can be met by \nimproved access to CTE programs. By increasing these opportunities to \nobtain postsecondary skills training and meaningful credentials, CTE \nequitably distributes economic opportunity to all students who are \nwilling to work for it. According to the U.S. Department of Education's \nOffice for Career, Technical and Adult Education, the average high \nschool graduation rate for students concentrating in CTE programs is 93 \npercent, compared with the national average of 80 percent.\n  This is why today, with my Senate CTE Caucus cochairs Senator \nPortman, Senator Baldwin, and Senator Isakson and other colleagues in \nthe Senate, I am submitting a bipartisan resolution to designate \nFebruary as Career and Technical Education, CTE, Month. CTE Month \nprovides a chance for students and educators alike to learn more about \nthe educational opportunities available in their communities, and to \nbecome more engaged in their studies today so they can plan for their \nfuture.\n  Our Nation's economic competitiveness relies on the skill of the \nAmerican workforce and its ability to meet and adapt to the 21st \ncentury economy. By formally recognizing CTE Month through this \nresolution, it is our hope that we can build support in Washington and \nacross the country for strengthening access to and expanding CTE \nprograms.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 94) was agreed to. The preamble was agreed \nto.\n  (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/03/senate-section/article/S1256-3", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1256-S1257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the National Labor \nRelations Board and the reforms that have been proposed in the new \nrule. I rise first of all to provide by way of a predicate or \nbackground what happened in 1935 when the National Labor Relations Act \nwas passed. There is a lot to talk about in that act, but just like \nwhen a major piece of legislation passes, we have findings that \nundergird the statute itself.\n  I will not go through all of those today, but I think some of the \nlanguage in there is especially appropriate for what we are talking \nabout. The findings and summary spoke to the benefits of collective \nbargaining--the benefits of organizing and collectively bargaining, and \nasserted at one point very early in the statute, in the findings, the \nfirst couple of paragraphs of the findings that experience--I am \nparaphrasing this but I will get to specific words in a moment.\n  But experience has shown that collective bargaining and organizing--\nand these are the exact words--``safeguards commerce from injury, \nimpairment or interruption.'' It goes on to talk about why it was \nbetter--why they believed it was better to pass a statute to resolve \nlabor-management disputes instead of the old way, which was constant \nconflict, conflict fighting, in some cases even violence.\n  So we did the right thing in 1935 as a country. We have had some \nhistory since then to draw from. The National Labor Relations Board, of \ncourse, is the entity that gives meaning to what we intend when we pass \nlaws such as the National Labor Relations Act.\n  Now we are having a dispute here in this body and in the other body \nas well about what these rules ought to be. What are the rules that \ngovern the National Labor Relations Board, but in particular, what are \nthe rules that govern elections?\n  With all of the challenges we are facing in the country right now--\nthe middle class has nowhere near recovered from the last--the great \nrecession. Wages have been declining over a generation, or at least not \nincreasing at the level that costs have been increasing.\n  So with all of that pressure on families, you could think this could \nbe an area of common ground, but it is not. With all of those \nchallenges facing middle-class families, it is disappointing that \nRepublicans in the Senate have chosen to focus on rolling back the \nNational Labor Relation's Board modest and commonsense reforms, to help \nworkers get a seat at the table, so they can increase their wages and \ntheir economic security.\n  Democrats are fighting to increase wages and we are also fighting for \neconomic security, at the same time Republicans seem to be constantly \nfighting to increase corporate profits while making workers pay the \nprice. All of us, whether we are Democrats or Republicans, should be \ncoming together to expand workers' voices at the table and not \nattacking workers' right to collectively bargain.\n  We are talking about something fundamental here, the opportunity to \nhave\n\n[[Page S1258]]\n\nan election in a workplace, and the benefits that flow from that. That \nis really about empowering workers. I believe that is one of the \nreasons why we passed the National Labor Relations Act, not just to \nhave a board that can settle disputes, but to actually empower workers \nin ways they have not been empowered up to that point in our history.\n  Empowering workers is an important part of building a stronger \neconomy that works not just for those individual workers in that \nworksite, but in an economy that works for all families, not just the \nwealthiest few. When the workers have a seat at the bargaining table, \nour economy prospers and the middle class thrives. I have always \nbelieved that if we did not have unions and collective bargaining and \norganizing since World War II and even since the 1930s, we would have a \nmuch less robust middle class. Some people believe there would not be a \nmiddle case. But I am at least willing to assert that the right to \norganize and collectively bargain is not just good for that worker and \nhis or her family, but it is also good for the economy as well.\n\n  Those workers are the ones who drive the economy, not just the work \nthey do, but the expenditures they make on behalf of their family. So \neven though workers are more productive in the United States than ever \nbefore, workers are still struggling with those stagnant wages. Today \nthe middle class accounts for the smallest share of the Nation's income \nsince World War II. Hard to believe that the middle class has been so \ndevastated.\n  We know from our history that when workers have a voice in the \nworkplace through collective bargaining, wages increase, workplace \nsafety improves, and workers have increased retirement and health \nsecurity. All of those benefits have helped grow America's middle \nclass. Labor unions helped workers share in that economic prosperity \nthat they have helped to create through their own hard work.\n  One of the great moments I have had as a Senator from Pennsylvania is \nwhen you go to a manufacturing plant and they take you on a tour. I am \nsure the Presiding Officer has done this a number of times. They take \nyou on the tour not just to show how they are producing something, how \nthey manufacture something, they are making something, but they are \nalso very proud of the way they interact with and relate to and work \nwith their employees. They go out of their way to point to a bulletin \nboard or point to a data point in their record to say we have very few \ninjuries, or zero injuries in a certain point of time. They take great \npride in that because they know that if they have fewer injuries, they \nare going to be more productive. If they have fewer injuries, they are \ngoing to have employees who can produce on their behalf.\n  One of the reasons they have fewer injuries over time in our economy \nand in those businesses is because workers have rights. Workers have \nrights they did not have in the early part of the 1900s. So we know \nfrom our history that this works, this process of making sure workers \nhave a seat at the table.\n  Now let's go to the National Labor Relations Board, their election \nreforms. These particular reforms make modest but, I would argue, very \nimportant updates to both modernize and streamline the election \nprocess, to prevent delays and reduce litigation. The current system is \nvulnerable to litigation that will drag out for a long period of time, \ndrag out the election process and put workers' rights on hold.\n  Those reforms will reduce unnecessary litigation that is not relevant \nto the outcome of the election. In the past, employers and unions had \nto send information about the election process to the Post Office, \nwhich would cost time and money. The new rule brings this election \nprocess into the 21st century--which is 15 years old now--by letting \nemployers and unions file forms electronically.\n  I think that is the least that can happen. You would think in this \nera we are living in, when everything that is done--most everything is \ndone electronically, in banking and in other industries, that at a \nminimum we should have information transmitted about an election--\nsomething valuable in a workplace. We hold elections with great regard \nand we believe in the sanctity of elections. So the least we could do \nis make sure those workers have the benefits of something that would \ntransmit the information electronically. Sending that information in \nthat fashion makes all of the sense in the world.\n  The rule also allows the use of modern forms of communications \nthrough cell phones and emails. That is not asking too much, to be able \nto transmit information to prepare workers for an election by the use \nof email or cell phones.\n  The reforms are commonsense steps to make sure the NLRB, the Board, \nis using its taxpayer dollars efficiently and effectively.\n  These changes, as I referred to earlier, are not just good for \nworkers, they also help businesses by streamlining the whole process, \nthe elections process in this case. Right now the election process \nvaries from region to region. Streamlining the process will provide \ncertainty for both employers and workers themselves. The new rule \nallows businesses and unions to file forms electronically, as I \nmentioned, instead of using postage. This will save everyone time and \nmoney. So modernizing--this is what we are talking about here--\nmodernizing election rules allows businesses and unions to use these \nbasic forms of communications in a way that promotes common sense.\n  The rule will at long last level the playing field for small \nbusinesses. Right now the biggest corporations can exploit the system \nwith long and costly litigation to deny workers, if they choose to do \nthat, a fair up-or-down vote on joining a union. By making the election \nprocess more consistent and transparent, the Board's reforms level the \nplaying field for the smaller businesses that already play fair.\n  The NLRB, the Board itself, the representation rule, are in need of \nkind of basic updates. There have not been substantial updates to this \nNLRB election process since the 1970s. Today that leads to \ninefficiencies and delays. Right now big corporations take advantage of \nthose inefficiencies to postpone and even deny workers the right to \nvote on union representation.\n  Often, in the face of employer tactics, workers give up hope. In \nfact, one in three will never even get to have an election. That is not \nsomething the National Labor Relations Act intended. I do not think \nthat is what anyone intended when it comes to these elections or the \npossibility of an election. So these amendments, these updates, these \nmodernization reforms help restore balance and fairness to the election \nprocess. I am perplexed why this is the subject of so much controversy, \nbecause these are basic reforms to help people exercise their right to \nvote in the workplace, which is consistent with our values, consistent \nwith our history, and also consistent with our efforts not just to move \nthat worker and his or her family forward, and their business forward, \nbut also to move the American economy and the middle class forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today with strong \nsupport of the National Labor Relations Board's new effort to make \nworkplace union elections more efficient and more effective. I come to \nthe floor today in opposition to Republican efforts to preserve a \nbroken system. Today, instead of raising minimum wages for millions of \nstruggling families, or letting people refinance their student loans, \nor making sure women get equal pay for equal work, instead of \nimplementing policies that strengthen the middle class, Republicans are \npressing a bill to stop a government agency from modernizing its \nprocedures because it might help--yes, help--American workers.\n  Coming out of the Great Depression, America's labor unions helped \nbuild America's strong middle class. For half a century, as union \nmembership went up, America's median family income went up. You know, \nthat was true for families whether they were part of a union or not. As \nour country got richer, our families got richer. As our families got \nricher, our country got richer.\n  Since 1935, Congress has required the National Labor Relations Board \nto oversee the workplace elections in which workers decide whether to \nbe represented by a union. According to NLRB data, more than 90 percent \nof\n\n[[Page S1259]]\n\ntime this works out just fine. For most of the cases that make it to an \nelection, employees and employers agree about the process and an \nelection is held without a dispute. Done.\n  But in the remaining handful of cases, the rules on how to resolve \nthese concerns have turned into a mess. Over time, a hodgepodge of \ndifferent rules for resolving these dispute has emerged in each of the \ncountry's 26 NLRB regions. To fix this, the NLRB recently finalized one \nnational set of rules that sets out clear procedures for resolving \nthese issues. In other words, the NLRB is trying to make dispute \nresolution clearer, more efficient, and more consistent from region to \nregion.\n  Trying to make government work better should not be controversial. \nBut it is controversial. Why? Because some employers simply oppose \nunion votes altogether. They do not want the NLRB to work. They do not \nwant union elections to happen at all. So they are lobbying against \nthose new rules, and congressional Republicans are standing up for \nthem, advancing a proposal to stop the NLRB from implementing its final \nrules and doing the job Congress gave it 80 years ago.\n  Republicans claim they were concerned about workers being able to \nambush their employers with workplace elections. That is just plain \nnonsense. Employers are always notified at the beginning of the \nelection process, and according to Caren Sencer, a top labor attorney \nwho testified a few weeks ago in the HELP Committee hearing, there is \nnothing--nothing--in the new rule that would stop an employer from \nhaving its relevant concerns heard and addressed prior to an election.\n  Let's be honest. The only ambush here is the Republican ambush on \nworkers' basic rights. According to a 2001 study from the Berkeley \nCenter for Labor Research and Education, long election delays \ncorrespond with higher rates of labor law violations. A delay gives any \nunion employer more time to retaliate against a union organizer, and to \nintimidate workers and delay work.\n  According to NLRB data, nearly one-third of the time when employees \nfile a petition to request an election, they never actually get one. \nEmployers who want to keep their workers out of a union prefer a \nbroken, inefficient system that gives them room to manipulate the \nprocess and to block workers from organizing. But that is not the law. \nThe NLRB doesn't answer to them. Federal law directs the NLRB to make \nsure election disputes can be resolved fairly between employers and \nemployees, and that is exactly what the NLRB is doing.\n\n  Throughout our history, powerful interests have tried to capture \nWashington and rig the system in their favor, but we didn't roll over. \nAt every turn, in every time of challenge, organized labor has been \nthere fighting on behalf of the American people. Labor was on the \nfrontlines to take children out of factories and to put them in \nschools. Labor was there to give meaning to the words ``consumer \nprotection'' by making our food and our medicine safe. Labor was there \nto fight for minimum wages in States across this country. In every \nfight to build opportunity in this country, in every fight to level the \nplaying field, in every fight for working families, labor has been on \nthe frontlines.\n  Powerful interests have attacked many of the basic foundations of \nthis country--the foundations that once built a strong middle class--\nand too many times those powerful interests have prevailed. So it comes \ndown to a question I have asked before: Whom does this Congress work \nfor? Republicans say government should keep on working for powerful \nCEOs who don't like unions and who have figured out how to exploit a \ntangled system. Republicans complain about government inefficiencies, \nbut then they introduce a bill that is specifically designed so a \nbroken, inefficient system will stay broken and inefficient, even when \nwe know how to fix it.\n  Well, we weren't sent here just to represent CEOs who don't like \nunions. We were sent here to support working people who just want a \nfighting chance to level the playing field. I urge my colleagues to \nvote against this Republican resolution and let the NLRB do its job.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I come to the floor to express my \ndisappointment that the majority leader is asking to rule XIV the \nbipartisan Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act.\n  I must ask the majority leader, what happened? Where is the \nbipartisanship part? Where is the bipartisanship that we have expressed \nand that I expressed this morning on the floor and last night at AIPAC? \nI ask again, what happened to putting aside political posturing and \npartisanship? What happened to the majority leader's pledge in January \nto ``decentralize power in the Senate'' and ``open up the legislative \nprocess''?\n  \"We need to return to regular order,'' he said. I agree with him. \nLet's do it. Let's return to regular order.\n  Frankly, this is not what was intended, and it is certainly against \nmy better judgment, against procedure, against any understanding we \nmight have had to take the politics out of our effort to establish \ncongressional oversight of any nuclear agreement with Iran. I am more \nthan disappointed; I am pretty outraged.\n  I said last night and again this morning that I join Chairman Corker \nand Senators Graham, Kaine, Donnelly, Heitkamp, King, Nelson, Ayotte, \nRubio, McCain, and Risch in introducing bipartisan oversight \nlegislation to ensure that Congress has a chance to review the deal \nbefore it goes into effect and to oversee its compliance after it goes \ninto effect. And now, putting any bipartisanship aside, we are back to \npolitics as usual. The only way to make this work is to work together.\n  The provisions of the bill itself are good ones. It would require the \nPresident to submit an agreement to Congress within 5 days of reaching \nit. It would give Congress 60 days to consider the agreement before \nsanctions relief could be provided. It would outline consequences \nshould Congress decide to disapprove the agreement. And in terms of \noversight, it would require information on potential breaches to be \npromptly reported to Congress, along with a comprehensive report every \n180 days of any Iranian action inconsistent with the agreement. It \nwould require a report every 90 days from the President on Iran's \ncompliance, informing us of any actions that might advance Iran's \nnuclear weapons program, that it has not supported or financed or \ncarried out any acts of terrorism, and that any sanctions relief is \nboth appropriate and proportionate to Iran's efforts under the \nagreement. Of course, it would have here in the Senate a 60-vote \nthreshold, so that means it would have to be a bipartisan \ndetermination.\n  We in good faith agreed to introduce this legislation and take it \nthrough the committee process and to the floor so that Congress--which \nwas responsible for bringing Iran to the table in the first place to \nnegotiate--would have a role in reviewing the agreement before it goes \ninto effect, whether to provide sanctions relief, and overseeing \nimplementation and Iranian compliance after it goes into effect \nbecause, as I said last night, a deal cannot be built on trust alone. \nNow, I was talking about Iran; I did not know that I was talking about \nour deal to pass a bipartisan review act.\n  So let me conclude. I can't imagine why the majority leader would \nseek to short-circuit the process, unless the goals are political \nrather than substantive. And I regret to say these actions make clear \nan intention that isn't substantive, that it is political. On a day \nthat has been defined by serious discourse about Iran's illicit nuclear \nweapons program, at a moment when legislators contemplate the most \nserious national security issue of our time, I am disappointed that the \nleader has chosen to proceed outside of regular order. By bringing the \nCorker-Menendez legislation directly to the floor for debate, the \nmajority leader is singlehandedly undermining our bipartisan efforts.\n  Nobody in Congress has worked harder on this issue, and I certainly \ndon't take a backseat to anyone in pursuing\n\n[[Page S1260]]\n\nIran's nuclear weapons program and standing up for Israel, but I \nsincerely hope that we can restore regular order and that this bill can \nbe fully considered by all the members of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee in due time.\n  Finally, there is no emergency. This deal--if there is one--won't be \nconcluded until the summer, so there is plenty of time to wait until \nMarch 24, find out whether we have a deal, and then act to be able to \nbe in a posture to opine on that deal and to deal with it accordingly. \nThere is no reason to accelerate this process in this way, to go \noutside of regular order, bypass the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, and come directly to the floor.\n  I know I cannot object to the rule XIV process under the rules, but I \nsay to my colleagues, if this is the process, then I will have no \nchoice but to use my voice and my vote against any motion to proceed. I \nhope that is not the case. I have worked too hard to get to this \nmoment. But if that is the way we are going to proceed, then I will \ncertainly have to vote against proceeding at that time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise to oppose S.J. Res. 8, a misguided \nresolution that targets workers' right to organize and hurts working \nfamilies in Hawaii and around the country.\n  Union election rules haven't been updated since the 1970s. The \nNational Labor Relations Board--or NLRB--is trying to bring union \nelection rules into the 21st century, but today's Senate resolution \nwill block the NLRB's commonsense updates.\n  The right to organize is a crucial part of our democracy. Unions have \nhelped build the middle class in Hawaii and nationwide. It is \ndisappointing that instead of working to create jobs or help the middle \nclass get ahead, today we are debating whether to make it harder to \njoin a union.\n  Workers wishing to join a union already face many barriers. For \nexample, companies have significant opportunities to make their case to \nemployees about why they should oppose a union. Meanwhile, unions are \nnot allowed to visit the worksite to make their case for joining a \nunion, and they do not have access to modern contact information such \nas emails and cell phone numbers--unbelievable as that may sound--to \ncontact workers.\n  In addition, companies can delay union elections with what amounts to \nfrivolous litigation and appeal after appeal. Nationwide, in contested \ncases workers already have to wait an average of 4 months to vote \nwhether to join a union.\n  While most employers in Hawaii want to support their workers, there \nhave been those rare cases of companies exploiting the current system \nto prevent workers from having a voice in the workplace.\n  Let me share a situation that happened in Hawaii where workers had \nnot been given a raise in 6 years. They asked a local union for help in \norganizing their union. In the runup to the union elections, the \nworkers were forced to attend one-on-one or group meetings on work time \nwhere their management could convince workers to vote against the \nunion. This company hired a private security firm and posted security \nguards outside the voting area during the vote. Workers felt \nintimidated.\n  The company appealed election results and NLRB rulings over and over \nagain, adding delay after delay and revote after revote. In July 2005, \n40 months after a petition was first filed to hold an election, the \nNLRB finally certified a union for the workers. Still, the company \ncontinued to offer appeal after appeal of the election results and even \nfired 31 union supporters in 2007. Finally, at the end of 2012, 10 \nyears later, the certified union reached its first union contract.\n  Remember, I noted that where most workplaces are organized, things \nare done in 4 months. That is not always the case. The NLRB's updated \nunion election rules would help reduce this kind of intimidation and \ndelay, which happens all too often, and would allow organizers to \ncontact workers by email and cell phone. It is pretty astounding that \nwe had to have a rule change in order to make this kind of commonsense \nchange available to organizers--which, by the way, this resolution \nwhich I ask my colleagues to vote against disallows.\n  The rule will make it easier for small businesses to follow labor \nelection laws. Currently, big corporations can use expensive lawyers to \nlitigate and prevent union elections, while small businesses don't have \nthose kinds of resources.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting these modest, \ncommonsense updates to NLRB rules and voting no on the resolution. \nLet's stand with working men and women in this country and support the \nmiddle class.\n  I want to end with a quote from one of our labor organizers and \nleaders in Hawaii, Hawaii Laborers' business manager Peter Ganaban. In \na recent piece in Pacific Business News, Mr. Ganaban explained that \n``Hawaii's union climate is an extension of our local culture of \nhelping each other and caring for our communities.''\n  Allowing workers a fair choice and a fair chance to join a union is \nthe least we can do for our workers in the middle class.\n  I yield my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am here for the main purpose of \nvigorously opposing S.J. Res. 8, and to support the National Labor \nRelations Board's recent rule to modernize the process that workers use \nif they decide they want to form a union and bargain collectively.\n  The new NLRB rule makes modest but highly important changes to \nimprove the overall consistency and efficiency of the election process, \nallowing workers to vote for or against the creation of a union in a \nfair and timely way. This rule is long overdue, and in Connecticut I \nhave seen--and in my personal experience with the NLRB--how important \nit is.\n  As I go around Connecticut, I consistently hear of problems when \nworkers seek to gain representation to form a union. It is cumbersome, \ncostly, time consuming, and is prone to needless delays. It involves \nneedless litigation, and it creates uncertainty for all involved. This \nrule change--this new rule--is not only good for working men and women, \nit is also good for businesses by reducing--and in some cases \neliminating--the cost, time, and uncertainty that are aggravating and \nexpensive. It is a small step toward a level playing field and a \nguarantee that companies respect workers' rights to organize and gain \nthe benefits of union membership.\n  Very simply, here is what the rule does: It removes obstacles to \nforming unions and requires businesses to postpone litigation over \nmember eligibility issues until after workers join a union.\n\n[[Page S1261]]\n\nIt cuts down on lengthy litigation that could cause union formation to \ndrag on for a year or more. It modernizes the election process. And, \nvery importantly, it allows for the electronic filing and transmission \nof petitions for union elections. Believe it or not, previously all of \nit had been done by fax or mail--not exactly the latest or least \nexpensive technology--and it ensures that unions and employees have \nenough information about each other so they can communicate in advance \nof the election.\n  It streamlines the NLRB's procedures, and with all due respect to the \nNLRB, what is needed there is practices that are uniform throughout the \nregional offices so that organizers can better interact with the \nagency. Its effect is not only on unions and businesses but also on the \nNLRB in speeding and streamlining and improving the way it works.\n  Its effects are seen in other areas too. The opponents of this \nmeasure forget to mention that these new rules apply equally to both \nelections seeking to certify a union and elections to decertify a \nunion. These more efficient procedures will help not only workers who \nwant to choose a union, it will help workers who want to get rid of an \nexisting union. It is a level playing field, fairness, efficiency, less \ncost, and less time.\n  The rule still gives employers the opportunity to inform workers \nabout the drawbacks of having a union so that workers have a fair \nopportunity to decide if they want union representation. This is the \nepitome of fair and balanced and more efficient kinds of rules.\n  The people in this body know that the simple fact is--and folks \nacross America know it--the majority of American workers want \nrepresentation. Fifty-three percent of workers want a union in their \nworkplace, but because of the broken election process, fewer than 7 \npercent of workers are represented. That is a stark fact. As Ronald \nReagan said, ``Facts are stubborn things.'' Thirty-five percent of the \ntime that workers file a petition for a union election, they never even \nget to an election.\n  The current election process is full of delays and costs, and \nunfortunately in many cases litigation gives way to outright \ndiscrimination.\n  According to a 2011 University of California-Berkeley study, the \nlonger the delay between the filing of a petition and the election \ndate, the more likely it is that the NLRB will issue complaints \ncharging employers with illegal activity. In other words, basically the \nelection process is drawn out and leads to growing dissatisfaction and \ncontempt and thereby damages everyone.\n  This rule is a necessity and will have a real impact on real people. \nIn Connecticut, I have spoken to people and heard the stories of \nindividuals who have been deprived or inhibited in exercising their \nright to vote in the election process. This process is broken.\n  The new NLRB will prevent frivolous litigation from delaying an \nelection. I have spoken to workers who wanted the election to be held \non a date that was beyond the allowed waiting period. They told me that \nthey were told if they didn't back down, the employer would ``make sure \nthe process would be lengthy and difficult.''\n  The new rule will itself push back on intimidation. In the face of \nthese kinds of tactics, some have persevered, but only through \ntremendous resolve. They triumphed in a seriously flawed and failed \nNLRB election process.\n  In short, these rules are an important step in the right direction. \nThey provide for free choice that is fair and will protect both sides. \nThey will reduce costs and time and litigation.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this measure as ill-conceived and ill-\nconsidered, and I hope we will preserve the NLRB's new rule.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/03/senate-section/article/S1261-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
