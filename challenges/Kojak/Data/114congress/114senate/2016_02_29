Madam President, there is an epidemic sweeping across \nour Nation, ripping through communities, tearing families apart, \nstriking at the vulnerable--even babies who have yet to take their \nfirst breath. The prescription opioid and heroin epidemic does not \ndiscriminate by demographic or socioeconomic status, by age or by \ngender. It touches parents and children, neighbors and coworkers in all \n50 States. It is ending lives at recordbreaking rates, and it is \ngetting worse. Deaths from opioids have surged by 200 percent over the \nlast decade and a half alone. In my home State of Kentucky, drug \noverdoses continue to outpace the number of fatalities from traffic \naccidents.\n  This is an issue we have been combating for some time, and we have \nmade some important strides along the way, but there is a lot more to \ndo. This week we have an opportunity to take an important step forward. \nOne of the most painful aspects of this epidemic, as I mentioned, is \nthe increasing number of infants who are born dependent on opioids such \nas prescription pain killers and heroin. These children start their \nlives suffering from drug dependence, which is nearly as hard to \nimagine as it is heartbreaking.\n  Last year, I sponsored a bipartisan measure designed to help address \nthis specific issue. I appreciate the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, \nMr. Casey, for working across the aisle with me to advance the \nProtecting Our Infants Act through Congress, and I am proud to say it \nwas signed into law just a few months ago. It is an example of one of \nthe many steps we have already begun to take as we address this \nepidemic.\n  We took another step forward last week when the Senate voted to \nconfirm a new FDA Commissioner. I have been very clear that the FDA \nmust take a stronger approach in regard to this epidemic and its \nprevention efforts, which is why I appreciated Dr. Califf's expressed \nvision for positive change at the agency. I voted for his nomination \nlast week, but as I told him, he should know that we will continue to \nensure oversight over his agency's response going forward.\n  This week, we have another opportunity to take a step forward--an \nimportant step forward. Before us today is bipartisan legislation that \nwould help combat the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic at every \nlevel. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, is the \nproduct of a lot of hard work and bipartisan work by a number of \nSenators.\n  I would like to recognize the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nthe Senator from Iowa, and the ranking member, the Senator from \nVermont, for acting swiftly to pass this bill through committee on a \nvoice vote. I appreciate the assistance and cooperation of other \nleaders on this important issue, such as the chairman of the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions and the ranking member from \nthe State of Washington.\n  I also want to thank the sponsors of this bill, the junior Senators \nfrom Ohio, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island, and the senior Senator from \nMinnesota. These leaders understand the toll this epidemic is taking on \nour communities. They have studied the issue closely in their home \nStates, and\n\n[[Page S1064]]\n\nthey have worked with Senators from across the aisle to advance this \nlegislation through the legislative process. It is thanks to their hard \nwork that we are debating this bipartisan bill today.\n  The junior Senator from Ohio has called CARA the only bipartisan \nlegislation that includes a comprehensive and evidence-based approach \nto help communities combat this epidemic. It would strengthen \nprescription drug monitoring programs, it would improve treatment \ninitiatives, it would expand prevention and education, and it would \ngive law enforcement more of the tools it needs to fight back against \nthis epidemic.\n  It is no wonder this bipartisan legislation is supported by more than \n130 national anti-drug groups. In a recent letter, they noted the only \nway to ``stop and reverse current trends'' was with a comprehensive \napproach, such as that included in the Comprehensive Addiction and \nRecovery Act of 2015, that leverages evidence-based law enforcement and \nhealth care services, including treatment.\n  So this bill takes the kind of comprehensive approach that is needed \nand at the same time, as these groups also noted in their letter, ``the \ncost of the bill is kept low'' with ``no impact on mandatory \nspending.''\n  I ask colleagues to join with us in working to pass this bipartisan \nauthorization bill. We will also have opportunities through the \nappropriations process this spring to continue important funding, just \nas we did last year. Indeed, just a few months ago we appropriated $400 \nmillion to opioid-specific programs--nearly one-third more than what \nthe Senate appropriated the preceding year--and we understand that all \n$400 million of those funds still remains available to be spent today. \nThat is right. All $400 million remains available to be spent.\n  I sincerely hope our friends across the aisle will join us in \nsupporting this legislation to address our national crisis. This is an \nimportant bill for each of us in this Chamber, and I look forward to \ntaking action today to get us closer to seeing it become law. I have \ntalked about the urgency and the multifaceted complexity associated \nwith this epidemic, and I want to underline the hard work being done in \nthe Senate to address it.\n  The chairs of the Judiciary Committee and the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee, whom I recognized earlier, have been \nlooking at ways to both improve law enforcement tools and increase \neducation and awareness respectively. The chair of the Committee on \nFinance has, as his committee explored in a hearing last week, been \nfocused on how this issue affects our child welfare system. And of \ncourse, we again recognize the cooperation of Members of both parties--\nchairs and ranking members and a bipartisan list of sponsors on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  Working together across the aisle--with State and local governments, \nagencies and law enforcement--we can help end this crisis once and for \nall. I look forward to taking the next step toward that objective later \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/senate-section/article/S1064-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, ``History won't forget this misstep by \nGrassley,'' this poster says. ``History won't forget this misstep by \nGrassley.'' That is from the Burlington Hawk Eye, Iowa's oldest \nnewspaper. That is what they said. It is the headline from the oldest \nnewspaper, as I indicated--the Burlington Hawk Eye.\n  The misstep referenced here is the unprecedented statement by the \nsenior Senator from Iowa and the Republican leader to deny the \nPresident the right to fill the current Supreme Court vacancy. The \narticle ends with this declaration:\n\n       A few weeks back, when the longest-tenured U.S. Senator \n     from Iowa passed a vote that gave him the record of most \n     consecutive votes in the Senate, we lauded his service to us. \n     We noted in casting votes on matters before the Senate, he \n     was doing what Iowans elected him to do. We gave Grassley an \n     attaboy for that. We take it back.\n\n  ``We take it back.'' That is a blistering statement, a revealing \nstatement, a substantive statement. ``We take it back.''\n  There is a lesson that Senator Grassley and my Republican colleagues \nshould learn from this editorial. By refusing to give President Obama's \nSupreme Court nominee a meeting, a hearing or a vote, they are \nabandoning the oath of office they swore when they became Senators. \nThis abdication of their constitutional responsibilities will epitomize \ntheir work as Senators. Whatever they may have accomplished during \ntheir careers will be secondary to their decision to place electoral \npolitics over their job.\n  Remember that our job here is to vote. That is what we swore to do--\nto follow the Constitution. And the Constitution couldn't be clearer on \nthis issue. So the stakes should even be higher for Senator Grassley \nand the other Republican Senators. Why? Because as chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Grassley presides over one of the most \nimportant and prestigious committees in the entire Senate. This has \nbeen the case for 200 years--200 years.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee was established 200 years ago. In \n1816, it was one of the original 11 standing committees. Twenty decades \nhave passed. That is how long the committee has been in operation. \nThroughout history, Judiciary Committee chairs have traditionally \nwielded immense power--from President Martin Van Buren, when he was in \nthe Senate, to Senator Ted Kennedy, Senator Arlen Specter, and Senator \nJoe Biden.\n  Judiciary Committee chairmen have historically prized their \nindependence and guarded it at all costs from being manhandled for \npartisan purposes. It was so independent, in fact, that past chairmen \nhave stood firm in the face of opposition from Presidents and Senate \nleadership.\n  At crucial times in American history, the Senate and the Nation have \nlooked to the Judiciary Committee to do the right thing. During the \nCivil War, Chairman Lyman Trumbull of Illinois and his committee \nauthored the Thirteenth Amendment. The Thirteenth Amendment abolished \nslavery during the Civil War. We know that during that period of time \nthere was great consternation as to what should be done. Even the great \nPresident Lincoln had trouble deciding what should be done during the \nearly days of the Civil War.\n  In 1889, Chairman George Hoar of Massachusetts and his committee \ndrafted the Sherman Antitrust Act, refusing to give in to the special \ninterests of Carnegie, Vanderbilt, and the Rockefeller monopolies. That \nwas big-time independence.\n  In 1937, Chairman Henry Ashurst from Arizona, who was born in \nWinnemucca, NV, led his committee in standing firm against President \nFranklin D. Roosevelt's attempt to pack the Supreme Court. Chairman \nAshurst was a Democrat, just like President Roosevelt. Yet Ashurst and \nhis committee maintained their independence, even against the wishes of \nSenate Majority Leader Alben Barkley, a longtime Senator who became \nVice President later. Imagine that. He was the Senate majority leader. \nHe was from Kentucky. Imagine that Judiciary Committee chair standing \nup to a majority leader from Kentucky.\n\n  The accomplishments of these powerful chairmen and many others are \nthe historic models against which the senior Senator from Iowa will be \nmeasured. If he keeps his current obstruction, history will not be kind \nto his tenure as chairman of the committee. As of today, the chairman \nhas yielded his committee's long-held authority and independence to the \nRepublican leader for the sole purpose of weakening President Obama, of \nweakening the Presidency of the United States, and obstructing the \nSenate's work.\n  The chairman has turned the impartial reputation of the Judiciary \nCommittee into an extension of the Trump campaign. Just last month \nChairman Grassley spoke at a rally for Donald Trump in Iowa. At that \nrally, the chairman said:\n\n       We've had this trend going this way, away from the basic \n     principles that established our government. And so we have an \n     opportunity, once again, to make America great again.\n\n\n[[Page S1065]]\n\n\n  Before I close, let's remember what he said: ``We've had this trend \ngoing this way, away from the basic principles that established our \ngovernment.''\n  My friend from Iowa would do well to look at his own committee as it \ntrends away from--again, the quote, ``away from the basic principles \nthat established our government.'' That is what the Senator from Iowa \nsaid at the Trump rally.\n  Even now, he and his committee are wasting millions in taxpayer \ndollars developing partisan opposition research on Secretary Clinton. \nIt has been going on for many months, more than a year, including \nasking for maternity leave records for staffers and time sheets from \nher office--just basic staff people. For months, Senator Grassley \nblocked the confirmation of vital State Department officials, even \ncareer Foreign Service officers who are here, so we could give them a \nraise after their valiant service all around the world. He held that \nup, and people couldn't understand it. It had nothing to do with \nSecretary Clinton. He did it as a way to weaken the Presidency of \nPresident Obama. What he has done is damage U.S. diplomacy worldwide.\n  Election day is more than 8 months away, but it is affecting nearly \nevery action taken by the Grassley Judiciary Committee. There is much \nmore at stake than Senator Grassley's reputation. When the committee's \nindependence is threatened by partisan politics, the future of this \ninstitution hangs in the balance, and when the Senate is undermined, \nour democracy is undermined. Future generations will suffer irreparably \nif the Senator from Iowa continues to do the bidding of the Republican \nleader and the Donald Trumps of the new Republican Party.\n  Senator Grassley and I have worked together for three decades. I \nserved a couple terms in the House. Then I came here. My seat was way \nback there. When I gave my maiden speech, my first speech, I talked \nabout the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, an idea I had in the House and I \ncouldn't get past first base.\n  Presiding in the Senate that day was Senator David Pryor from \nArkansas, who was chairman of the subcommittee on the Internal Revenue \nService. Senator Grassley was also listening. They both contacted me. \nIn fact, I received a note from Senator Pryor and a call from Senator \nGrassley saying: I like that legislation. I will work to help you. And \nthey did, and we got that passed. So I have nothing personal against \nSenator Grassley. I like him. He helped me pass something that was \nlandmark legislation as a brandnew freshman Senator, but today, as a \nU.S. Senator, I have a duty to speak when the Republican Senate refuses \nto follow its constitutional obligations to provide advice and consent \non the President's Supreme Court nomination.\n  As a Senator, I have a duty to demand that the Judiciary Committee \nconsiders important judicial nominees, especially--especially--someone \nto fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. As Senate Judiciary chair, the \nsenior Senator from Iowa has a job to do. I repeat, my criticism is not \npersonal. It is professional and it is substantive.\n  The senior Senator from Iowa outlined that job himself when he \nassumed the chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee. When he took over \nas chairman, he promised Republicans would ``restore the Senate to the \ndeliberative body that the founders intended.'' Listen to that. That is \nwhat he said, to ``restore the Senate to the deliberative body that the \nfounders intended.'' That is a quote.\n  Another quote. He said he took the responsibility of ``vetting of \nnominees for lifetime appointments to the federal judiciary very \nseriously.''\n  The senior Senator from Iowa is failing this commitment that he made \nto himself. He made it. He made the commitment to ``restore the Senate \nto the deliberative body that the founders intended.'' The Founders are \nthe people who wrote the Constitution. He is the first chair of this \nimportant committee to take the unprecedented step of refusing to meet, \nconduct hearings or hold a vote on a Supreme Court nomination. He is \nfollowing the Republican leader's call to refuse the President's \nnominee a meeting, a hearing or a vote. The senior Senator from Iowa, \nof all people, should know how important a vote is.\n  My friend has a lot of rollcall votes, 7,545 consecutive votes as of \ntoday, but what good are 7,500 consecutive votes if you simply sweep \nthe votes you don't like to take under the rug? It taints this \nachievement. If he doesn't like President Obama's nominee, then he \ndoesn't have to vote for the nominee, but don't run from a hard vote. \nDon't hide. What good is a chairmanship if it is just a rubberstamp for \npartisan politics? What good is a chairmanship if it is used to weaken \nthe Senate and disrupt our Constitution's system of checks and \nbalances? And that is what it does.\n  Last week the Des Moines Register published an open letter from one \nof Senator Grassley's former employees. It was stunning. He worked in \nthe Senate. This man's words capture what is at stake:\n\n       The institution of the Senate has managed to perform its \n     constitutional obligations for well over 200 years. Every \n     single nominee for the Supreme Court that has not withdrawn \n     from consideration has received a vote within 125 days. \n     Today, I feel nothing but shame for the fact that my senator, \n     my former friend, will be bringing that unbroken history to \n     an end.\n\n  That was the headline last week in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's \nlargest newspaper.\n  I hope the chairman of the Judiciary Committee doesn't continue down \nthis path. It will not benefit him, his committee, the Senate, the \nState of Iowa or this great country. Instead, he should follow the \nexamples of his predecessors and give President Obama's Supreme Court \nnominee a meeting, a hearing, and a vote. He simply should do his job. \nIf he doesn't, history will never forget this unprecedented misstep. \nHistory will never forget this misstep by Senator Grassley.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I ask the Chair to announce the business for the \nday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/senate-section/article/S1065-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, as we are all sadly aware, the United \nStates is experiencing an epidemic of drug overdose deaths. The \nstatistics are just startling. Since 2000, the rate of deaths from drug \noverdoses has increased 137 percent, including a 200-percent increase \nin overdose deaths attributed to the use of opioids.\n  West Virginia has the unfortunate distinction of leading the Nation \nin drug-related overdose deaths--more than twice the national average. \nAs I travel across the State, I hear constantly about the devastation \ncaused by this epidemic. West Virginia communities are grappling with \nthe seriousness and pain of addiction. No family or community--mine \nincluded--is immune from this pain.\n  As one of my constituents put it, ``We must give our young people a \nreason not to start using something that robs them of everything they \nhave.''\n  Other West Virginians have bravely shared their family's stories of \naddiction's pain with me. In the powerful words of one of my \nconstituents, ``It only takes a few seconds to use drugs--but a \nlifetime to fight.''\n  Drug addiction is a diseases that knows no boundaries, and West \nVirginia is certainly not alone in this fight. My colleagues in the \nSenate--including, I am sure, the Acting President pro tempore--return \neach week with similar stories. No matter our political party, we \nshould all agree on one thing, we must act to change these horrifying \nstatistics and to save lives.\n  Some steps have already been taken to address this drug epidemic. The \nappropriations bill we passed last December included funding to expand \nprevention efforts. It included improved data collection and new \ntreatment services, training for our servicemembers who\n\n[[Page S1066]]\n\nare battling addiction, and training for the first responders who are \nresponding to these drug overdoses.\n  Today we hope to begin debate on the Comprehensive Addiction and \nRecovery Act. I thank my colleagues Senator Portman, Senator Ayotte, \nand Senator Whitehouse for their leadership on this important \nlegislation.\n  This bipartisan bill, known as CARA, addresses the opioid epidemic by \nexpanding prevention and education. It also promotes the resources \nneeded for treatment and recovery. It includes reforms to help law \nenforcement respond to the drug epidemic, and it supports long-term \nrecovery efforts--which, as we see in my State of West Virginia, we \ndon't have enough treatment options, particularly in the long-term \nrecovery area.\n  The legislation also expands the availability of naloxone, a \nlifesaving drug that helps to reverse the effects of an overdose, and \nwe are also creating disposal sites for unwanted prescriptions.\n  CARA provides resources for treatment alternatives to incarceration, \nsuch as the successful and expanding drug court programs that operate \nin West Virginia and many other States. We just had a graduation the \nother day with some great success stories included in that from the \ndrug court. According to the Beckley Register Herald, counties with \ndrug courts have already seen cost savings and deep declines of \nrecidivism rates among graduates.\n  CARA also provides a provision to improve treatment programs for \npregnant women and mothers who have substance abuse disorder. Another \nstartling statistic is the number of babies born with neonatal \nabstinence syndrome that has increased fivefold from the years 2000 to \nthe year 2012.\n  Last fall, I introduced the Improving Treatment for Pregnant and \nPostpartum Women Act, with Senators Ayotte, Whitehouse, and Klobuchar. \nThe CARA act provides a provision that could play a critical role in \npreventing neonatal abstinence syndrome and getting treatment to \npregnant women and new mothers.\n  Also, last fall I worked with Senator Markey and others to help \nrestore drug take-back days and keep medications out of the wrong \nhands. We all probably have some medication in our own medicine chests \nthat are no longer necessary and that we don't need to have. It might \nhave been for a family member. It is time to clean out those medicine \nchests. I participated in last year's program in Charleston, WV, and \nwas pleased to see the overwhelming response. CARA focuses on the \nprograms that work and will streamline efforts across multiple Federal \nagencies.\n  In order to further address the needs of our communities, I am \nworking on several bipartisan amendments on this bill. These amendments \ninclude solutions to improve prescribing practices and prevent \noverprescribing. Too many stories of addiction start with patients \ntaking painkillers after a minor surgery or a minor injury.\n  That is why I am pleased to be working with Senator Gillibrand on an \neffort that would require clear CDC guidelines for prescribing opioids \nfor acute pain--a tooth extraction, maybe a broken arm, something that \ndoesn't last forever, but the pain is acute in the beginning but fades \nrather quickly.\n  I also am pleased to be working with Senator Warren on an amendment \nthat allows doctors to partially fill certain opioid prescriptions. \nThese will reduce the number of unused painkillers sitting in our \nmedicine cabinets and help to prevent future cases of drug abuse and \naddiction.\n  In order to reduce the number of overdose deaths, I am working with \nSenator Kaine to allow doctors to coprescribe the lifesaving drug \nnaloxone when they prescribe an opioid. This would make naloxone more \nwidely available in Federal health care settings, such as community \nhealth centers, VA clinics, and DOD facilities. I am also focused on \ntackling one of the saddest realities of this epidemic.\n\n  In my State of West Virginia, babies born exposed to opioids during \npregnancy are approximately three times the national average. Every 25 \nminutes in this country a baby is born with addiction. Nationwide, this \ncondition has increased fivefold from the years 2000 to 2012.\n  This amendment will provide clear guidelines to encourage the \ncreation of residential pediatric recovery centers, like the wonderful \nLily's Place in Huntington, WV. I am pleased to be working with Senator \nKing from Maine and Congressman Evan Jenkins from West Virginia on this \neffort.\n  CARA represents a positive step forward in addressing the opioid \ncrisis. The four amendments that I have outlined, I believe, will \nstrengthen the bill. They would prevent addiction, promote recovery, \nand curb the scourge of drug addiction in my State and in others across \nthis country. There is much work ahead for all of us in this area. The \nactions we are hopefully taking here this week in Washington are simply \nfirst steps.\n  This bill builds on the tireless work being done at the State and \nlocal levels by communities, law enforcement, and health professionals \nall across this country. They are working together. By working \ntogether, we can change these statistics and stop more tragedies from \noccurring--stop the human tragedy of losing a loved one, of losing a \nmother or father.\n  I urge my colleagues to begin debate on CARA this evening and to \nsupport this important legislation. I am concerned we are in jeopardy \nof losing the next generation. So we have much work to do.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, as we have heard from the Senator from \nWest Virginia, this week the Senate will begin consideration of a \nbipartisan bill that targets an epidemic that is raging across the \ncountry, but apparently it is especially hard-hitting in places such as \nWest Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and the like. But this abuse of \nprescription painkillers and heroin is not just isolated to those \nareas, even though the leaders of this particular legislation come from \nplaces such as Minnesota, Rhode Island, Ohio, and New Hampshire. Sadly, \nTexas has been no exception.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that in Texas \nopioid-related drug deaths have increased by 30 percent since 2002. \nHouston is widely recognized by the DEA and law enforcement officials \nas a key hub for the trafficking of illicit prescription drugs. In \nSouth Texas, right next to the U.S.-Mexico border, the transnational \ncriminal organizations are exploiting our porous border to import \nincreasingly large amounts of hard narcotics like heroin, which \nultimately wreaks havoc in towns and cities across America.\n  In 2014 alone, drug cartels successfully smuggled more than 250,000 \npounds of heroin across our borders and into the United States at a \nstreet value of approximately $25 billion. These are the same criminals \nwho traffic in human beings, including young girls and boys. These are \nthe same people who traffic in illegal immigrants. These are the same \npeople who traffic in illegal drugs. Indeed, this has become such big \nbusiness and the network so large that these transnational criminal \norganizations are basically in on everything and anything that will \nmake them money, including transporting these terrible drugs like \nheroin across the border.\n  As we all know and have heard, this epidemic destroys families, it \nincreases the crime rate, and it robs millions of Americans of their \nfuture. As I mentioned a moment ago, thousands are dying every year. \nThat is why the bill we are voting on this afternoon, called the \nComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, is so important. It will help \ngive families and law enforcement additional resources to beat drug \naddiction through proven treatment programs. I am proud to cosponsor \nthe legislation.\n  The reason we have been able to move this bill forward so far--and it \npassed unanimously out of the Senate Judiciary Committee 2 weeks ago--\nis because it reflects bipartisan input as well as bipartisan concern \nwith this epidemic.\n  As I mentioned earlier, I wish to particularly recognize the junior \nSenators from Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Ohio--Senators \nWhitehouse, Portman, and Ayotte--for their laserlike focus on this \nlegislation and making sure that it is at the top of our list of things \nwe need to do this legislative session. By highlighting how bad the \nproblem is in our country and providing legislation to address it, they\n\n[[Page S1067]]\n\nare helping us attack this epidemic head-on.\n  I must say that while so far this legislation has moved forward on a \nstrong bipartisan basis, there are some signals on the horizon that \nindicate some potential trouble. At a press conference after the \nJudiciary Committee unanimously passed the bill, several of our friends \non the other side of the aisle were explicit. They said that if the \nSenate did not add hundreds of millions of dollars in duplicative \nfunding, they might withhold their support.\n  This legislation is an authorization bill, and it does not \nappropriate funds. Our friends across the aisle know that if an \nappropriation is added to this legislation, particularly if it is \nduplicative, it causes a number of problems. First of all, a spending \nbill can't originate here in the Senate. So it raises a so-called blue-\nslip problem. But perhaps just as importantly, this is not an orderly \nprocess by which we determine what is actually needed and to make sure \nthat we are appropriating money in a fiscally responsible sort of way.\n  I don't have to remind the Acting President pro tempore or anybody \nelse who is listening that we have a $19 trillion debt in our country, \nand recklessly throwing money at a problem rather than carefully \ntargeting it in a fiscally responsible way is simply irresponsible.\n  It seems to be part of the message: Give us what we want or we might \nhijack a bipartisan bill that would literally save lives. I hope I am \nwrong, and I hope the signals on the horizon don't prove to ultimately \nbe true. But it does seem like this is part of a new political \nstrategy.\n  Earlier this month, we know that our Democrat colleagues blocked a \nbipartisan Energy bill from moving forward on an unrelated issue--\nsomething on which Senator Murkowski has shown the patience of Job, \ntrying to work through this process so we can get back on the Energy \nbill rather than having it hijacked by an extraneous subject that could \nwell and should well be handled in a different way, certainly \nseparately.\n  This is not the way the Senate gets anything accomplished. As I have \nsaid before, playing political games with important issues like \nfighting drug addiction is what lost our friends the majority in 2014. \nI urge the Democratic leadership to listen to those in their own caucus \nwho have worked alongside Republicans in a responsible fashion to draft \nand put forward this bill that is so clearly needed in this country.\n  This afternoon I hope we will move forward on the Comprehensive \nAddiction and Recovery Act. I hope we will consider it and consider \namendments that are being offered in good faith on both sides to try to \nimprove the legislation. But what we should not do is allow anyone to \nhijack this important legislation for partisan purposes. I think we \nshould restrain ourselves from any impulse to do so. It happened, \nunfortunately, on the bipartisan Energy bill. It has been threatened on \nthis legislation. But my hope is that cooler heads will prevail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2015, also known as the \nCARA Act. Our country is facing a prescription drug epidemic, and today \nis a good step toward addressing this crisis. This is a crisis I have \nbeen dealing with since my days as Governor of the great State of West \nVirginia.\n  Opioid abuse is not only ravaging my State, it is ravaging the \ncountry. Drug overdose deaths have soared by more than 700 percent \nsince 1999. We lost 600 West Virginians to opioids last year alone. But \nour State is not unique; every day in our country, 51 Americans die \nfrom opioid abuse, and since 1999 we have lost almost 200,000 Americans \nto prescription opioid abuse. Think about that. That is more people \nthan we have in any city in the State of West Virginia.\n  This bill is an important first step. First of all, it will authorize \n$77.9 million in grant funding for prevention and recovery efforts. It \nwill expand prevention and educational efforts--particularly aimed at \nteens, parents and other caretakers, and aging populations--to prevent \nthe abuse of opioids and heroin and to promote treatment and recovery. \nIt will expand the availability of naloxone to law enforcement agencies \nand other first responders to help in the reversal of overdoses to save \nlives. It will expand disposable sites for unwanted prescription \nmedications to keep them out of the hands of our children and \nadolescents. It will launch an evidence-based opioid and heroin \ntreatment and intervention program to expand best practices throughout \nthe country. It will also strengthen prescription drug monitoring \nprograms to help States monitor and track prescription drug diversion.\n  While this bill is a good start and addresses critical problems, \nthere is more that needs to be done. I will be offering several \namendments to improve the bill by changing the FDA's mission, providing \ngrants for consumer education, and requiring prescriber training.\n  I firmly believe we need cultural change at the FDA, and that is why \nI introduced Changing the Culture of the FDA Act. It simply does \nexactly what it says--it changes that culture. My amendment to CARA, \nbased on the Changing the Culture of the FDA Act, would amend the FDA's \nmission statement to include language that will require the agency to \ntake into account the public health impact of the Nation's opioid \nepidemic when approving and regulating opioid medications and will hold \nthe agency responsible for addressing the opioid epidemic. It is hard \nto believe that right now as all of these new drugs are coming to the \nmarket and all of these pharmaceutical manufacturers are producing this \nnew product, basically the mission statement has never taken into \naccount the impact of the opioid epidemic on the public's health in \nthis Nation. Now that we see it is truly an epidemic, we think this is \na much needed change, and hopefully it will be approved.\n  This builds on and solidifies the FDA's recently stated goal to \nfundamentally reexamine the risk-benefit calculations for opioids and \nensures that the agency considers the wider public health effects. We \nneed a change in the culture of the FDA, but we also need to make sure \nthe advocacy groups that fight this battle every day are armed with the \nresources they need to stem this tide.\n  I am also submitting an amendment that will establish consumer \neducation grants through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration to raise awareness about the risk of opioid addiction \nand overdose.\n  This epidemic is one that needs to be fought on all fronts, but most \nimportantly, we need to fight it on the frontlines with the \nprescribers, those people whom we trust to get the training they need. \nThat is why I will also submit an amendment that will require that \nmedical practitioners receive the needed training on the safe \nprescribing of opioids prior to renewing their DEA registration to \nprescribe controlled substances. If you talk to any of our medical \nphysicians throughout the country, they get very little training as far \nas the effects of these drugs, and we think it is well past time that \nthey get the needed education, as well as continuing education, so that \nwe can keep ahead of the prescriptions they are putting on the markets \nand basically keep them from harming people every day.\n  According to the National Institutes of Health, in 2012, more than \n250 million prescriptions were written in the United States for opioid \npainkillers. That equals one bottle of pain pills for every U.S. adult. \nCan you imagine one bottle of pain pills for every U.S. adult in this \ncountry? It is unbelievable. We are the most addictive Nation on Earth. \nFive percent of the population in the United States of America--there \nare 330 million of us and 700 billion humans on the planet Earth--\nconsumes 80 percent of the opioids in the world. It is just unheard of.\n  Until we ensure that every prescriber has a strong understanding of \nsafe opioid prescribing practices and the very great risk of opioid \naddiction, abuse, and overdose deaths, we will continue to see too many \npeople prescribed too many of these dangerous\n\n[[Page S1068]]\n\ndrugs which can lead them down a tragic path, and that is why we need \nto educate people.\n  There is one other subject I wanted to address, and I hope the FDA \nand this administration will look at it very seriously, and that is the \nprofessionals on advisory committees. When an opioid is coming to \nmarket, I believe and I believe a lot of Americans believe that this \ngoes through a review process. These professionals basically are \nlooking at this, and they make a recommendation as to whether this drug \nshould be on the market, the need for this drug, and the effect this \ndrug will have on people's lives. If they rule against this drug--and \nlet's say they have an 11-to-2 ruling, such as Zohydro did--then the \nrequest for that drug to come to market should have to come before \nCongress. The FDA--the director and the staff--needs to basically come \nand explain to Congress why this potent drug needs to come on the \nmarket when basically their advisory committee and those people who are \nthe professionals basically agree not to let it come to market.\n  This is a conversation that has to be had. We have to make sure we \nunderstand why we are putting all of these products on the market and \nthe effect they are going to have on the public. That is another topic \nwe hope to address also as this bill comes to the floor.\n  The bottom line is that I am pleased the Senate is working in a \nbipartisan manner. This is how we need to work to solve the major \nchallenges our country faces. By working in a bipartisan way, we will \nhave, as I understand, an open amendment process which is so needed and \ncritical to move this legislation through. I appreciate that.\n  I believe my amendments will strengthen this bill, but I also believe \nmore needs to be done. We must provide the critical resources needed to \nstem this tide. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nstrengthen this bill and to begin to address this crisis head-on.\n  This country has faced every crisis we have ever had, and we have \novercome it. This is one we haven't attempted. For some reason, it is a \nsilent killer--out of sight, out of mind. It will take all of us being \nAmericans and basically using our faith that we have that we can fix \nthese problems, to save Democrats, save Republicans, save Independents, \nand save everybody. This cannot be a partisan issue because I can tell \nmy colleagues that opiates and the addiction of opiates have no \npartisan home. It is truly bipartisan. It attacks us all.\n  I appreciate my colleagues, and I look forward to working with them \nto work through this important piece of legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/senate-section/article/S1068-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1068-S1069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WOMEN'S RIGHT TO HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, this week the Supreme Court--which is \nlacking a ninth Justice for the foreseeable future for reasons that \nmost of the American public doesn't understand since my fellow \nSenators--my Republican colleagues--simply refuse to do their job--will \nhear arguments on yet another case that threatens women's right to \nhealth care. The case the Supreme Court will hear on Wednesday--Whole \nWomen's Health v. Hellerstedt--originated in Texas, but, as all Supreme \nCourt cases do, this case has implications for the entire country. It \nis part of a sustained, coordinated attack on women's right to make \npersonal, private health care decisions for themselves. It is Big \nGovernment reaching into women's homes and bedrooms, getting between \nthe women and their health care providers, between the women and their \nreligious counselors; it is reaching into women's homes, telling women \nthat they no longer have the right to make personal, private health \ncare decisions for themselves and to access safe and affordable care.\n  If the Court rules in favor of the Texas law, which has closed health \nclinics across the State--imagine that. You are a legislator taking an \noath of office in Austin, TX, to do the best you can for your State, \nand you pass legislation that closes health clinics not for financial \nreasons but for ideological reasons. So if the Court rules in favor of \nthis Texas law, which, as I said, closes health clinics across the \nState, it will set a dangerous precedent that could lead to more clinic \nclosures across this country. My interest is especially Ohio. Ohio will \nbe weakened by this too.\n  These clinics are often the only place women and men have to turn for \ntheir basic health services. Most of the health care women are getting \nat these clinics has nothing to do with abortions, but it is the kind \nof care that women need in these clinics. Millions of women rely on \nPlanned Parenthood and other clinics like it for lifesaving screenings, \nfor testing, for preventive care, and for treatment.\n  In Ohio, Planned Parenthood centers provide health care services to \n100,000 men and women each year. Many of them have nowhere else to \nturn. Many of them are moderate-income women. Many of them are women \nworking two jobs. Many of them go to Planned Parenthood because, first, \nit gives good care; second, it takes care of them in kind, decent, \nempathetic ways; and third, it is what they can afford. They either \ncannot afford health care elsewhere or they live too far away to have \naccess to health care.\n  A new law in Ohio threatens that access. The bill was passed by the \nOhio Legislature and signed by Governor Kasich--that is Governor Kasich \nof Presidential primary fame, Presidential Republican debate fame. The \nbill, which was signed by Governor Kasich a week ago, will strip \nFederal funding not only from Planned Parenthood--why they would want \nto do that is all about ideology and playing to their far-right \npolitical base--will strip Federal funding not only from Planned \nParenthood but any health care facility that could be perceived as \n``promoting'' safe and legal abortion. But these health care clinics \nare mostly not about abortion; they are about providing health care to \nwomen--mostly to women. This includes health clinics that simply work \nwith other providers to refer women to other facilities so that women \ncan make decisions that should be between them and their doctors.\n  Now, I repeat, so many of my colleagues love to talk about Big \nGovernment, but when Big Government--mostly a bunch of privileged--if I \nmay, privileged, White men on the other side of the aisle, mostly--when \nthey want to inject themselves between women and their doctors, between \nwomen and their families, between women and their religious counselors, \nit strikes me as--let's just say hypocritical.\n  We are talking about a rule that is far, far more sweeping than just \ndefunding--that is what they like to say, ``defunding''--Planned \nParenthood.\n  If you are watching the Republican debates week after week, even when \nthey sound like food fights, which it did last week--when you are \nwatching these debates, you can see that whenever one of these White, \nprivileged men--candidates running for President and one other \nprivileged African-American man running for President on the Republican \nside--whenever they say ``defund Planned Parenthood,'' the crowd goes \nwild. They play to that base to defund Planned Parenthood, that base \nthat for whatever reason, with their ideological agenda, doesn't seem \nto care much about women's health.\n  Let's be clear. This isn't about defunding abortion. The Federal \nGovernment doesn't provide funding for abortion, period. I will say \nthat again. The Federal Government does not provide funding for \nabortion, period.\n  Health officials in Ohio--health officials that play it straight, \nwhich is 99-point-something percent of providers--real doctors, real \nhealth providers, real health care officials are scared that the new \nlaw could take funding away from local health departments, if we can \nimagine that. The director of public health policy in Columbus--the \nState's capital--told the Columbus Dispatch that the law would have a \n``significant impact'' on their department's ability to coordinate with \nhospitals and insurance companies.\n\n[[Page S1069]]\n\n  So stand back for a second and see what they are doing. A bunch of \nrightwing, privileged, mostly White men in the legislature have decided \nthat their political agenda trumps everything else, and they are \nwilling to follow their--so that they can play to their far-right base, \nthey are willing to jeopardize women's health. They are willing to go \nright up against what the Columbus Dispatch says--few papers in America \nare more conservative--when they talk about a significant impact on the \ndepartment's ability to coordinate with hospitals and insurance \ncompanies. Why would they do that? They do it because they are playing \nto this far-right base who votes overwhelmingly in primaries.\n  The director said that because the bill is so broadly written, ``we \nwouldn't be able to work with any hospital in our jurisdiction.''\n  This Ohio law explicitly targets critical health and health education \nservices for women. Don't take my word for it; all you have to do is \nread the bill. This chart shows that it prohibits Ohio clinics and \nhospitals from using Federal dollars--and I am quoting directly from \nthe bill--for any of the programs established by the Violence Against \nWomen Act, the Minority HIV/AIDS Initiative, the Infertility Prevention \nProject, the Personal Responsibility Education Program, and the Breast \nand Cervical Cancer Mortality Prevention Act. Think about that--the \nMortality Prevention Act. This bill prohibits Ohio clinics and \nhospitals from using Federal dollars to implement these laws.\n  It means no Federal dollars for the program administered by the \nAdministration for Children and Families in the Department of Health \nand Human Services to educate adolescents on abstinence and \ncontraception for the prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted \ndiseases. So this legislation that Governor Kasich signed that these \nprivileged, mostly White men in the State legislature--politically far \nto the right, the majority of the State legislature--the bill they \npassed and Governor Kasich signed would mean that we wouldn't be able \nto use the Federal dollars we have to educate adolescents on abstinence \nand contraception for the prevention of pregnancy and sexually \ntransmitted infections.\n  So what are they doing? The extremists on the other side are saying \nno Federal dollars for abortion. There aren't Federal dollars for \nabortion. But they are saying no Federal dollars to preach abstinence \nand to educate young people about abstinence and sexually transmitted \ndiseases. So what are they doing and why are they doing this to the \nwomen in Ohio?\n  This law bars women from accessing cancer screenings, fertility \nservices, AIDS prevention, and help coping with abuse and violence. Do \nthese far-right members of the legislature know no low-income or \nmoderate-income young women? Do they know no teenagers, no female \nteenagers and young male teenagers, too, who maybe could benefit from \nsome of these programs, including abstinence education, learning about \ncontraceptives, and learning about how sexually transmitted diseases \nare in fact transmitted?\n  I support a woman's right to make personal, private health care \ndecisions for herself with her doctor. But no matter your personal \nfeelings about abortion, surely we can agree--although the legislature \ncan't in my State--surely we can agree that cancer screenings and \nprograms that have helped bring Ohio's teen pregnancy and STD rates \ndown are a good thing.\n  I would say that Ohio right now--and this is embarrassing for me to \nsay on the Senate floor in front of colleagues--my State is 50th for \nBlack babies and infant mortality and 47th overall in infant mortality. \nWe are 47th overall, 50th for Black infant mortality.\n  The legislature underfunds public health, and they then undercut--\nbecause of this legislature's action with Governor Kasich's signature--\nthey undercut the Violence Against Women Act, they undercut minority \nHIV and AIDS education, they undercut the personal responsibility \neducation program, they undercut breast and cervical cancer mortality \nprevention, and they undercut infertility prevention projects. I just \ndon't get it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. A woman in New Carlisle wrote to me saying:\n\n       There was a time when I could not find full-time \n     employment, I did not have health insurance, and I also was \n     not eligible for any assistance from the government. My \n     husband and I were newly married and trying to build a \n     responsible life together.\n       I was 21. I had a family history of breast cancer and \n     ovarian cancer, so access to healthcare was crucial for me. \n     Planned Parenthood was the only place that would help me look \n     after my health and plan my own family and lifestyle in a way \n     that I could afford.\n\n  Another woman went on to say: ``Planned Parenthood made an \nimpoverished young woman feel safe and comfortable and valued.''\n  Another woman in Boardman, OH, wrote: ``Along with many other women, \nI was treated at Planned Parenthood, and I received a referral to a \nspecialist, which saved my reproduction.''\n  Another woman wrote saying that she had a child at 13 and gave up the \nchild for adoption. After that she made the choice to get educated \nabout family planning and birth control. She couldn't afford to go to a \nfamily doctor, so Planned Parenthood was where she turned to make sure \nshe never had to go through that experience again.\n  A young woman from Columbus told the Canton Repository newspaper that \nwhile she was speaking at the statehouse. Half of the lawmakers looked \nlike they were about to fall asleep. Many were looking at their cell \nphones. They didn't want to listen to a young, low-income woman talk \nabout her personal life and what Planned Parenthood meant to her.\n  What is happening is not all that different in Ohio than across the \ncountry. There is an organized attack on women's rights to make health \ncare decisions for themselves. It is not about health or safety. Look \nat these examples. It is about politicians thinking they know better \nthan women and their doctors. It is happening as we speak. These so-\ncalled TRAP laws in Ohio and in dozens of other States have created \ngaps in care that threaten women's ability to see the providers of \ntheir choice.\n  Health clinics in Texas have shut their doors. If the Supreme Court \nupholds the Texas law being challenged, the remaining clinics in the \nState may be forced to turn their patients away for good.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/senate-section/article/S1069-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1069-S1071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, in the last 2 minutes I would like to say \na few more words about the Supreme Court vacancy.\n  Four former U.S. attorneys from Ohio, Washington State, California, \nand Virginia published an op-ed that went around the country urging the \nSenate to promptly consider a Supreme Court nominee to replace Justice \nScalia.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the writings of \nthe former U.S. attorneys.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Steve Dettelbach, Jenny Durkan, Melinda Haag and Tim Heaphy \n     are Democratic former U.S. attorneys for, respectively, \n     Northern Ohio, Western Washington, Northern California and \n     Western Virginia. As former U.S. attorneys in diverse \n     districts that are home to more than 20 million Americans, we \n     urge that the president promptly nominate, and the Senate \n     promptly consider, a Supreme Court nominee to replace Justice \n     Antonin Scalia. Both the plain language of the Constitution \n     and plain truths regarding public safety and national \n     security demand that result.\n       For federal prosecutors, agents and criminal \n     investigations, a year is a lifetime. We have seen real \n     threats, whether it is the heroin epidemic or the threat of \n     ISIS recruitment, facing the people in our communities each \n     day.\n       While law enforcement stands ready to protect the public \n     from those threats, they need to know the rules of the road. \n     Uncertainty about those rules impedes their efforts. Just as \n     with the economy, uncertainty prevents good agents and \n     prosecutors from deciding on investigative strategies and \n     tactics, and making important charging decisions. The Supreme \n     Court is the ultimate arbiter of the hardest and most \n     important questions facing law enforcement and our nation.\n\n[[Page S1070]]\n\n       Even as we write today, unsettled legal questions regarding \n     search and seizure, digital privacy and federal sentencing \n     are either pending before the Supreme Court or headed there. \n     It is unfair and unsafe to expect good federal agents, police \n     and prosecutors to spend more than a year guessing whether \n     their actions will hold up in court. And it is just as unfair \n     to expect citizens whose rights and liberties are at stake to \n     wait for answers while their homes, emails, cell phones, \n     records and activities are investigated. Equally important, \n     as lawyers and former public officials committed to the \n     Constitution and the rule of law, it is incredible to us that \n     anyone who claims fidelity to those ideas can argue that \n     either the president or the Senate should not fulfill their \n     duties. And we should be clear on what those duties are. \n     Announcing ahead of time that the Senate will reject any \n     nominee, or refusing to hold fair hearings, does not fulfill \n     the Senate's duty to provide ``advice and consent'' on court \n     nominees. The ``advice'' called for in the Constitution does \n     not include, ``Just forget it, Mr. President.''\n       It is ironic that the arguments being made by those urging \n     a year-plus delay are precisely the types of arguments that \n     Scalia abhorred. They are based on politics and some vague \n     notions of Senate ``interpretations'' of the Constitution. As \n     U.S. attorneys we were constantly assessing the strength of \n     constitutional and other legal arguments. And there was no \n     more demanding jurist than Scalia when it came to supporting \n     those arguments with written law.\n       One argument is based on the ``Thurmond rule,'' named for \n     the former senator from South Carolina, which calls for no \n     confirmations in the final months of a president's term. But \n     this ``rule'' has never been applied to the Supreme Court and \n     it finds no home in the text of the Constitution. We would \n     all have bought tickets to see Scalia question a lawyer who \n     dared to raise an argument like that. Few things in the \n     Constitution seem as unambiguous as term length. The \n     president is elected for four years under Article II. There \n     is no clause diminishing the president's duties in the last \n     year, and as even Jeb Bush acknowledged, such notions are \n     dangerous.\n       Should the president stop fighting ISIS in his last year? \n     Should senators facing an election year not be allowed to \n     vote on judicial nominees so that the ``people can decide?'' \n     Certainly not. The people already did decide what would \n     happen from January 2013 to January 2017. They elected \n     President Obama. In both our communities and court system, we \n     don't have more than a year to blithely waste for political \n     reasons. The safety concerns and dangers are pressing, and \n     our leaders in the White House and the Senate do not have \n     built-in vacation time on our dime.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. I close just begging, urging, imploring, and beseeching my \ncolleagues on the Republican side to move forward on the Supreme Court \nnominee.\n  We have not had a Supreme Court vacancy for as long as a year since \nthe Civil War because we were at war in the 1860s. The average \nnomination process for confirming a Supreme Court nominee when there \nare 8 members of the Supreme Court is only about 6 weeks. The longest, \nJustice Thomas, took 99 days. The President of the United States is \nelected for 4 years--not a 3-year term. A 4-year term has 300-plus days \nin the term.\n  This Senator is disappointed--I will leave it at that--to hear that \nmy colleagues have said there will not be hearings. Then they said that \nnot only will there not be hearings for the President's nomination, \nthey will not even meet with a nominee. This Senator finds it rather \nshameful for an institution with this kind of heritage and this kind of \nreputation that we don't do better than that. I urge my colleagues to \ndo our jobs, do what we were elected to do, what we were sworn in to \ndo, and do what we are paid to do to bring this nominee--vote against \nthem if you like but bring up this nominee for real Senate \nconsideration.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank Senator Grassley for allowing me more \ntime.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Well, Madam President, it is another day and another \ntantrum from the minority leader, but it doesn't matter how much the \nminority leader jumps up and down or how much the minority leader \nstomps his feet, we aren't going to let liberals get away with denying \nthe American people an opportunity to be heard. Letting the American \npeople decide this question is a reasonable approach, it is a fair \napproach, and it is the historical approach. It is the approach the \nother side advocated when the shoe was on the other foot, and it is \nwhat the American people deserve.\n  They deserve an opportunity and responsibility that we do it right \ninstead of rushing to judgment. Voters deserve the right to be heard. \nThe American people want a reasonable justice, a person who will make \nthe right decisions.\n  As the American people continue voting during the Presidential \nelection, they face a choice: Do they want just another Justice who \nwill look to her heart and apply her own ethics and perspective when \ndeciding important constitutional questions that impact every American \nor do they want a Justice who, like Justice Scalia, adheres to the \nConstitution and the rule of law and decides cases based on wherever \nthe text takes him or her. We can't overstate how critical it is for \nthe American people to understand what is at stake in this debate.\n  Today take a little bit of time to discuss the impact that these two \ndifferent visions would have on everyday Americans. Many leading Court \nobservers believe that adding yet another liberal Justice to the Court \nwhose decisions are unmoored from the constitutional text would lead to \nmajor changes in the Court's jurisprudence. As a recent New York Times \narticle put it, adding another liberal to the Supreme Court ``would be \nthe most consequential ideological shift on the Court . . . creating a \nliberal majority that would almost certainly reshape American law and \nAmerican life.''\n  So it will impact all of us. According to the same article, a host of \nSupreme Court precedents on free speech, freedom of religion, the right \nto keep and bear arms, the death penalty, and abortion would be \noverturned. The article speculates that ``abortion rights would become \nmore secure, and gun rights less so. . . . First Amendment arguments in \ncases on campaign finance, public unions, and commercial speech would \nmeet a more skeptical reception.''\n  In that same article, one law school dean noted that with another \nliberal on the Court, ``the judicial debate over the fundamental \npossibility of ObamaCare would likely draw to an end.'' So let's \nconsider just a few of the Supreme Court precedents that would likely \nbe overturned with another liberal Justice on the Court.\n  First and foremost, it is our Second Amendment rights that would fall \nsquarely within the liberals' sights. The Heller decision, authored by \nJustice Scalia, recognized, based on the intent of the Framers, that \nthe Second Amendment guarantees an individual constitutional right to \ngun ownership.\n  Again, as one law professor noted in the New York Times, with another \nliberal in the Court, ``The five would narrow Heller to the point of \nirrelevancy.'' Another said: ``If we got a fifth liberal on the court, \nthe pendulum would swing pretty quickly on gun control. . . . I expect \nthat we'd see a major shift in the kind of gun control laws that get \napproved by the court.''\n  In other words, Heller and the individual constitutional rights it \nguarantees would be turned into a relic. It would be an ornament \nwithout any practical limiting effect on the government's infringement \nupon the constitutional right of an individual to have gun ownership. \nOnce this happens, all bets are off on the right to keep and bear arms.\n  Next, the First Amendment right of the American people to make their \nvoices heard would be drastically curtailed if the Court overturns \nCitizens United. In fact, as a University of Chicago Law School \nprofessor said in the New York Times, ``Citizens United is on every \nliberal's list of opinions that ought to go.''\n  Freedom of religion protections under the First Amendment wouldn't be \nfar behind. Another liberal Justice could allow the government to force \nAmericans to comply with laws that violate their deeply held religious \nviews. For example, a new Justice could provide the fifth vote to \noverturn the Hobby Lobby decision, which recognized the right of the \nowners of a closely held corporation to resist laws on religious \ngrounds, such as ObamaCare's contraception mandate.\n  Of course, we all know free speech protections are being eroded and \ndiluted in this country. On college campuses across the country, speech \nisn't being protected because of the speaker's viewpoint. Rather than \ndebate openly with opponents as Justice Scalia did, too many people \ntoday want to shut down debate and muzzle anybody who disagrees with \nthem.\n\n[[Page S1071]]\n\n  What other rights are at stake in this election? Incredibly important \nprecedents under the First Amendment's establishment clause would be at \nrisk. Of course, I am talking about Supreme Court cases allowing prayer \nat townhall meetings or permitting low-income parents to receive public \nschool vouchers to defray the cost of the child's private school, \nincluding religious schools. Of course, while yet another liberal \nJustice could read narrowly the First and Second Amendments that are in \nthe Constitution, he or she could read broadly those rights that are \nnot in the Constitution at all.\n  If yet another liberal is nominated to the Court, even reasonable \nrestrictions on abortion enacted into law through the democratic \nprocess would be swept away. Just a few years ago the Court upheld the \nban on partial birth abortion by a 5-to-4 vote in the case of Carhart. \nPartial birth abortion is a horrific practice that crushes an unborn \nbaby's skull, killing it while its head is still in the womb. It is one \nvery small step short of infanticide. If the American people elect a \nliberal during this Presidential election, and that President nominates \nanother liberal to replace Justice Scalia, we can all expect a \nconstitutional right to abortion on demand without limitation. In the \nwords of one law professor, ``At-risk precedents run from campaign \nfinance to commerce, from race to religion, and they include some \nsignature Scalia projects, such as the Second Amendment. . . . Some \nwould go quickly, like Citizens United, and some would go slower . . . \nbut they'll go.''\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent for 4 more minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That leads me to a broader point. There is more at \nstake than the results of any particular case as important as those \ncases are. The American people need to consider whether they want their \nnext Justice to decide cases based on the text of the Constitution as \nit was understood at the time it was adopted or whether Justices are \nfree to update the Constitution according to their own moral and \npolitical philosophies. Should Justices apply accepted legal principles \nthrough sound reasoning of new facts or should they do legal back flips \nto reach their desired public policy goals?\n\n  Of course, this second approach is not law. Instead, it is what \nJustice Scalia called ``legalistic argle-bargle'' and ``jiggery-\npokery.'' Justice Scalia knew the rule of law was a law of rules. The \nrule of law is not a law of whatever is in the Justice's heart. When a \nJustice believes, as President Obama does, that any time he views the \nConstitution as unclear, he can apply his own life experience and \nempathy for his or her favorite causes. The Justice has a clear \nincentive to think the Constitution is unclear, but a Justice isn't \nentitled to read those views into the Constitution and impose them on \nthe American people. Our Constitution sets up a Republic, not a \ngovernment by judiciary.\n  Unless the Constitution specifically prohibits the democratic process \nfrom reflecting the will of the people, the decisions are made by \nelected individuals who are accountable to the voters. The Supreme \nCourt plays a very important role in keeping the branches of the \nFederal Government within constitutional powers, keeping the Federal \nand State governments within their constitutional sphere, and it \nensures the government complies with the Bill of Rights. That is the \nbasis for its legitimacy.\n  When the Court reads the Constitution in ways that reflect the \nJustice's personal policy views rather than the text, it does not act \nlegitimately. Instead, it denies the people the legal right to govern \nthemselves. Justice Scalia understood this better than anyone. The more \nthe Court reaches out and grabs power it is not entitled to hold, the \nmore it legislates from the bench, the more decisions it robs from the \nAmerican people.\n  As a direct result, step-by-step and inch-by-inch, liberty is lost. \nAs John Adams observed, ``Liberty, once lost, is lost forever.''\n  Since the days of the Warren Court, this is what liberal Justices \nhave done. Under the guise of constitutional interpretation, they have \nimposed liberalism on the American people. They have done it on issues \nand in ways they couldn't achieve through the ballot box.\n  This is the decision facing the American people during this \nPresidential election. If the American people elect a liberal as their \nnext President, and he or she nominates a like-minded judge to replace \nJustice Scalia, liberalism will be imposed on the American people to a \ndegree this country has never before witnessed. I hope anyone who cares \nabout these important issues will take very serious note.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise to congratulate Nebraska's beef \nproducers for continuing to reach new areas of the world with our very \nhigh-quality American beef. Earlier this month it was announced that WR \nReserve, a beef-processing plant in Hastings, NE, will have the honor \nof delivering the first U.S. shipments to Israel in nearly 13 years. In \nDecember 2003, Israel was one of many countries to suspend imports of \nU.S. beef, following a confirmed case of BSE in the United States. \nBecause of this, America's beef producers have been unable to ship \ntheir products to this close friend and ally. However, during my visit \nto Israel last fall, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro asked me to \nbegin a dialogue with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and find a way \nto bring Nebraska beef to Israel. The Ambassador was especially \ninterested in serving that Nebraska beef at the Embassy's annual 4th of \nJuly celebration.\n  Over the last few months, I have worked with the USDA's Food Safety \nand Inspection Service and with officials at the Nebraska Department of \nAgriculture in a concerted effort to find a solution. I am extremely \npleased to inform this body that an agreement was achieved, the ban was \nlifted, and Nebraska will supply the first shipments of beef to Israel \nin over a decade.\n  Ambassador Shapiro was quick to praise this breakthrough, noting:\n\n       This agreement gives Israeli consumers access to the \n     world's highest-quality beef. At the same time, it creates \n     and supports jobs in the great state of Nebraska.\n\n  I couldn't agree with the Ambassador more. Israel is a critical ally \nof the United States, and I was pleased to work with the USDA and the \nIsraeli Government to supply the first American beef shipments to \nIsrael in over a decade.\n  Nebraska's beef producers are the best in the world, and this \nagreement is a testament to their tireless commitment to delivering \nsafe and high-quality beef to millions of dinner tables around the \nworld. In Nebraska, cattle outnumber people more than 3 to 1. With \nnearly $7.2 billion in annual cash receipts, our beef production is the \nlargest sector of the State's economy, and Nebraska leads the Nation in \nevery aspect of beef production. I would also like to note that this \nagreement shows that science-based trade can overcome myth and \nmisinformation.\n  By ending this ban, Israel becomes one of the last countries to \nreopen its market to U.S. beef and abide by international trade \nregulations. In doing so, this agreement reinforces the progress made \nby the U.S. beef industry to eliminate BSE-related trade restrictions.\n  I also join the Nebraska Agriculture Department director, Greg Ibach, \nin congratulating WR Reserve. Their hard work made this agreement \npossible after complying with a rigorous inspection process that \nincluded regular visits from the Israeli Government.\n  Prior to this agreement, according to the USDA, Israel imported beef \nproducts from other nations worth $405 million in 2014. Ninety-five \npercent of these imports originated in Latin America with smaller \nvolumes coming from Australia and the European Union.\n  Now the United States will have the opportunity to showcase our \nworld-famous beef to a new global market, and Nebraska is very proud to \nlead that charge. I was honored to work collaboratively with State, \nFederal, and international officials to ensure that Nebraska's beef \nproducers achieved those necessary approvals.\n\n[[Page S1072]]\n\n  I am proud to represent the people of Nebraska. Through this \nagreement, new markets are now open to Nebraska's producers, \nbusinesses, and to the communities that rely on them for economic \nprogress. I will continue to work to ensure Nebraska's beef producers \nhave the opportunity to do what they do best--feed the world.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, last month I came to the floor--in fact, \nI come to the floor just about every month--to highlight the great work \nbeing done by the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Last month I focused on the folks who work at FEMA, which is one of \n22 agencies that collectively make up the Department of Homeland \nSecurity--the newest, youngest Department in the Federal Government.\n  Just a few days before my speech, much of the east coast was \ninundated, as you may recall, by one of the largest snowstorms we have \nhad in a long time, and on that day FEMA was working around the clock \nto prepare for and respond to what could have been a much more \ndevastating storm. We were hit hard, but we would have been a lot worse \noff if not for the preparation and the training FEMA had done in not \njust the days, weeks, and months, but literally years ahead leading up \nto the storm in order to make us better prepared.\n  For more than a year now, I have come to the floor and I have focused \non a different agency within the Department of Homeland Security. It \nwill take about 2 years to knock them all out, but we are making some \nprogress, and I have done so to highlight the exemplary and important \nwork done by more than some 200,000 people who comprise the Department \nof Homeland Security. They work around the country, and they work \noutside our country--in Mexico, Central America, South America, Europe, \nand all over the place in order to make us safer in this country.\n  These men and women perform a wide range of vitally important work, \nand they do it every day. They inspect the fruit and vegetables that \narrive at our ports of entry, much like the Port of Wilmington in my \nState. It is the top banana port in the country. They patrol our \nborders, like the Border Patrol agents dealing with increased migration \nfrom Central America. They defend our computer networks in cyber space, \nresponding to a new and growing 21st-century threat. They keep our \nPresidents and Vice Presidents and their families and former Presidents \nand their families, as well as candidates for those positions, along \nwith visiting foreign dignitaries, safe from harm. They have a lot of \nwork to do.\n  The work of these DHS personnel deployed at the frontlines is made \npossible in part because of the dedicated work of the men and women \nbehind the scenes at the Department of Homeland Security's Management \nDirectorate. As my colleagues have often heard me say, management \nreally does matter. I will say it again: Management really does matter. \nAnd there are few places where that is more true than at the Department \nof Homeland Security.\n  The Management Directorate works to support the missions and \nemployees of all 22 component agencies which together comprise the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. They rent field offices, they buy \nessential equipment and vehicles, and they help to ensure that \nDepartment employees receive the paychecks and benefits they have \nworked for and earned. Within the Management Directorate, the Office of \nthe Chief Human Capital Officer works to ensure that the Department is \ndoing what is best for its employees, while providing the Department \nmanagers with the guidance and resources they need to help DHS take \ncare of their own.\n  One member of the Management Directorate is an especially committed \nfellow whose name is Phil Nowak. He is committed to DHS employees--his \nfellow colleagues. He is the Chief of Staff in the Office of the Chief \nHuman Capital Officer.\n  Phil grew up not in Iowa or Delaware, he grew up in San Francisco, \nnot far from where I served in the Navy for a while. He joined the U.S. \nCoast Guard right after college. After serving in the Coast Guard for \n20 years, he retired as a commander. I was once a commander--my \nfavorite rank. Both of us served and exchange salutes all the time, \nMadam President. But Phil retired as a commander in 2007 and joined the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency to help coordinate disaster \nresponse. In 2010 Phil moved to the Office of the Chief Human Capital \nOfficer, and in 2013 he took over as Chief of Staff.\n\n  As Chief of Staff, Phil supports the work of the Chief Human Capital \nOfficer in managing the workforce of the third largest Cabinet agency \nin our Federal Government--the third largest. With 22 component \nagencies and DHS employees stationed literally around the world, Phil \nand his team of 200 men and women certainly have their work cut out for \nthem. Supporting the Department employees and providing them with the \nresources they need to excel and grow in their work is critical to \nmaintaining a motivated, effective, and capable Department.\n  With some notable exceptions, we know many of the components of this \nrelatively young Department have struggled with employee morale almost \nfrom its inception. Each year the Partnership for Public Service \nreleases its ``Best Places to Work in the Federal Government'' survey, \nand each year the Department of Homeland Security ranks at or near the \nbottom of all the agencies when it comes to overall employee morale.\n  With Congress imposing shortsighted budget cuts across government, \nimposing pay freezes, and just last week threatening a shutdown of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security in the middle of our fight against \nISIS, it is no wonder that sometimes DHS employees feel unappreciated. \nWe probably would too. Despite these setbacks, leaders such as Phil \nNowak are working every day and every night to right the ship and \nimprove morale at DHS. And a bunch of us here in the Senate, Democrats \nand Republicans, are trying to be helpful in that regard.\n  In providing leadership and direction for human capital management \nfor the Department, Phil Nowak makes sure that the Department's efforts \nto improve morale translate to each of the 22 different component \nagencies of the Department of Homeland Security and are felt by each of \nits 240,000 employees. To help do this, Secretary Jeh Johnson has \ncreated what he calls a Unity of Effort Initiative to bring the \nDepartment of Homeland Security components together and make the \nDepartment greater than the sum of its parts. Phil leads one of the \nUnity of Effort Initiatives. It is called the Human Capital Leadership \nCouncil, which brings together human resources managers from across the \nDepartment. Through this coordination and other Unity of Effort \nInitiatives, Phil's team works hard to better ensure that the \nDepartment's 240,000 employees feel like part of a larger DHS family.\n  In such a large agency, with so many people with diverse talents and \nbackgrounds spread around the world, it is easy to focus on the broader \nmission and lose sight of the individuals who help the Department \nachieves its many missions, but Phil, I am happy to say, hasn't lost \nsight of them. Phil and his team do yeomen's work, and they focus on \nthe value that each and every employee adds to the Department's \nmission. It is fitting, then, that Phil's colleagues describe him as \ncaring deeply for them and for other employees throughout the \nDepartment. His commitment to them is clear, it is welcome, and it is \nunwavering.\n  In his own life, Phil values professional resilience, and in a job \nthat is sometimes overlooked, yet incredibly important, I think that is \na necessary trait. It is also a fitting quality for a runner, and Phil \nis an avid runner. I like to run, but this man, Madam President is the \nreal deal. He has completed both the Marine Corps Marathon and the JFK \n50 Mile ultra-marathon\n\n[[Page S1073]]\n\ntwice. I am not fit to carry his running shoes. When he isn't running, \nPhil is building or fixing something around the house, cheering on \nthose San Francisco 49ers and the San Francisco Giants--I hope it is \nnot when they are playing my Detroit Tigers--and spending time with his \nwife of 26 years, Cristy, and their three children, Sam, Elizabeth, and \nAndrew. We are grateful to them for sharing their husband and their \ndad.\n  Phil Nowak is just one example of the thousands of men and women at \nthe Department of Homeland Security who work behind the scenes every \nday to support their colleagues and make our country safer for all of \nus. Phil and his team focus on individuals, they bring together \ncomponents through a unity of effort, and they work tirelessly to \nimprove employee morale. Management really does matter, and without \nPhil and his colleagues at the Management Directorate, the Department's \nmission to protect our homeland would suffer.\n  To Phil Nowak and to his team in the Office of the Chief Human \nCapital Officer, to every other hard-working employee at the Department \nof Homeland Security and at the Directorate for Management, I want to \nsay a couple of words: Thank you. Let me say them again: Thank you.\n  This past week I was doing some traveling and going through some \nairports. We usually try to use the TSA precheck, which goes a little \nmore smoothly because people have been prescreened. At one place we \nwere flying out of, they advertised TSA precheck was open, but it \nwasn't, so we had to be regular, ordinary people. At each of those \nplaces, the folks at TSA--right there at the frontline trying to \nprotect us as we fly around the country, around the world in these \nairplanes--they were doing their job. It is a hard job, and I would say \nprobably a thankless job. Everyone wants to get through. They do not \nwant to take their shoes off or their belts off or have to take their \ntoiletries out. They want to get through there, get on the plane, and \ngo someplace, but not get harmed and arrive safely.\n  When I fly, a lot of times I will tell the folks at TSA who I am and \nthe committee I serve on just to let them know we appreciate the work \nthey do for all of us. Every now and then--including over the weekend--\na TSA officer will say to me: Nobody has ever thanked me before. How \nabout that. Nobody has ever thanked me before.\n  So I say: Well, let me thank you again. And keep doing your job well, \nand hopefully you will get a lot of thanks.\n  But to all the folks at DHS who are taking on a hard job and doing it \nwell, we thank you for what you do every day to protect our country, \nthe land of the free and the home of the brave. And may God bless you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/senate-section/article/S1073-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1073-S1074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, this is a day-night double header. That \nwas the day game, and what I want to do now is focus on the second half \nof the story as long as time will allow me to do that.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, I come from the State of Delaware. \nDelaware is noted for a number of things, and one of the things we are \nnoted for is that before any other State ratified the Constitution, we \ndid it. For 1 whole week, Delaware was the entire United States of \nAmerica. We opened it up and we let in Maryland and New Jersey and \nPennsylvania, ultimately Iowa and other States, and I think it has \nturned out pretty well most days. But we were the first to ratify the \nConstitution.\n  My family and I live in northern Delaware, and just up the road from \nus is Philadelphia. That is where the Constitution was first debated, \nand folks from throughout the 13 Colonies came and argued for and \nagainst different provisions and how we should set up the structure of \nour government. One of the hardest provisions they argued on and \ndebated was whether there should be a legislative branch at all, and if \nthere should be, should it just be unicameral--just one entity, one \nbody within that legislative branch--or should there be two. Should the \nnumber of votes and the power that States have be in accordance with \nthe size of their State, how many people they have, or how would they \nbalance things out.\n  Some of them worked out the Connecticut Compromise that said that \nevery State will have two Senators--the same number--and they will be \npart of the U.S. Senate, and the House of Representatives would be \ncomprised such that the more people who live in a State, the more \nRepresentatives they would have. That was the Connecticut Compromise. \nIt was worked out. It was maybe not a perfect compromise in the eyes of \nsome, but it enabled them to move forward, and most people think it is \nfair and reasonable.\n  Another really tough issue they wrestled with in those days was with \nrespect to the third branch of government. We have the executive and \nthe legislative and the judicial branch. The question was, What are the \njudges going to do, these Federal judges? How are they going to be \nappointed? Who is going to pick them? And if it is the Chief Executive \nOfficer, should the President be able to name by himself or herself who \nthe judges are going to be, the Federal judges and the Supreme Court \nJustices? Should it be left up to the Senate? Should it be left up to \nthe House of Representatives? Should it be a joint effort by the House \nand the Senate? Should there be some role for the President, the Chief \nExecutive, to play? How should it work out?\n  Time and again they voted on this issue at the Constitutional \nConvention in Philadelphia. Finally, after a number of votes that were \njust not successful--they couldn't come to a successful conclusion--\nthey actually called out for clergy to come in and called on Divine \nintervention to get over this issue on how to pick, how to select \nFederal judges. I don't know if it was Divine intervention, but at the \nend of the day the deal said: The President shall nominate--not \nappoint, not name, but shall nominate--folks to serve as Federal \njudges, including the Supreme Court, and the Senate would have an \nopportunity to provide advice and consent to the President.\n  We have argued a lot over the years about what advice and consent \nshould be, but it makes very clear that the President has a job to do \nwith respect to the naming of judges. I believe we have a job to do as \nwell.\n  About 300 yards from the tavern where the Constitution was first \nratified on December 1787 in Delaware, with one hand on the Bible I \nraised my other hand and took an oath to defend the Constitution as \nGovernor of Delaware. I had never thought very much about what kind of \nqualities I would look for in a judge.\n  With my Republican opponent in the Governor's race, a wonderful guy \nnamed B. Gary Scott, in 1992, we had 35 joint appearances together, \ndebates. In all those forums, no one ever asked: What quality would you \nlook for in the people you would nominate to be a supreme court justice \nfor the State of Delaware or a member of the court of chancery, which \nis a court that has a national and international role to play?\n  The superior court also hears not just Delaware cases but national \ncases as well. In all those forums, nobody ever asked me: What would \nyou consider? As it turned out, that was a very important part of my \njob. I am proud to say the Delaware judiciary is one of the highest \nregarded of any State judiciaries that we have. We have a very unusual \nsystem where there has to be an equal balance between Democrats and \nRepublicans on the judiciary. It is not a spoils system. If there is \none more Republican than a Democrat and there is a vacancy, you have to \nname a Democrat. That is the way the system works.\n  When I was Governor, we had a person who had been chancellor of the \ncourt of chancery, which is a high honor. He decided he was going to \nleave. So we had a vacancy to fill. I named a Republican. In that case, \nI actually had the flexibility to name a Democrat or Republican. I \nwanted to name the best person that I thought was interested in \nserving. The criteria I used in nominating people to serve on the \njudiciary in Delaware was that I wanted people who were really smart. I \nwanted to nominate folks who knew the law. I sought to nominate people \nwho embraced the Golden Rule, who treat other people the way they want \nto be treated, so that folks who came before them in a courtroom \nreceived\n\n[[Page S1074]]\n\nfair and equal treatment. I wanted to nominate people who worked hard. \nI wanted to nominate people who had good judgment. I sought to nominate \npeople who were able to make a decision. Sometimes people can have a \nlot of those qualities but have a hard time making a decision. I didn't \nwant to do that. I wanted to have people who could do all those things.\n  My hope is that this President will look at Democrats, Republicans, \nand Independents and find among them the man or woman who meets all \nthat criteria and more. That is the President's job.\n  I was up at the Detroit Auto Show. I know the Presiding Officer has a \nlot of assembly and supply operations in his State. Delaware used to, \nuntil fairly recently, build more cars and trucks per capita than any \nother State. So I care a lot about who is running GM and Chrysler. We \nlost both plants a few years ago when they went into bankruptcy. But I \nstill go back to the Detroit Auto Show most years to keep in touch with \nthe industry.\n  This last January, a month ago, I was in Detroit. It was the opening \nday of the Detroit Auto Show, with tens of thousands of people \nconverging on the Detroit Auto Show, going this way and that way to see \nthe different reviews and different vehicles, concept cars or new \nproduction vehicles that are going to be launched maybe later this \nyear.\n  During the afternoon, I was looking for a restroom. I found one and \nso did hundreds of other people--in and out of this one restroom. I \nnoticed an older gentleman who was a custodian standing with his cart, \nhis mop and bucket, and his broom, outside of the mass of humanity. I \nwalked in. In spite of all of those people, the place was remarkably \nclean.\n  I figured he was the janitor who had responsibility for this \nrestroom. When I came out, I said to him: I just want to say, sir, that \nthis is a really clean restroom. With all the different kinds of people \nyou have coming in and out of here, I don't know how you do it. I just \nwant to say thank you for doing your job really well.\n  He looked me in the eye and said: That is my job. He said: This is my \njob. And he said: I try to do my job well. He said: Everybody has a \njob, and everybody should try to do their job well.\n  I thought to myself: Wow, wow, what insight, what a message.\n  Under the Constitution, the President has a job. Apparently he is \nmoving--not with haste, but I think with dispatch--to try to meet his \nresponsibilities. I know we have had any number of times when \nPresidents have nominated Supreme Court Justices in a Presidential \nelection year. I know a dozen or more times it has happened. I think \nevery single time we had hearings for that nominee. There has been the \nopportunity to debate the nominee, question the nominee, meet with the \nnominee, debate here on the floor, and vote on the nomination up or \ndown. I don't know of any time when we have not done that, even when a \nnominee came to us during a Presidential election year.\n  I know we are in a crazy election season. It is still 8 months, 9 \nmonths before the election. But I hope that, at the end of the day, \njust like that janitor at the Detroit Auto Show intent on doing his \njob, the rest of us have the feeling that we have a job to do and that \nwe should be in town doing our job. We have that need. We have that \nresponsibility. I hope we will fulfill it.\n  (Mr. COATS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. President, the other thing I want to say is ``baseball.'' When \nthe Presiding Officer and I were House Members together, we used to \nplay baseball. We played in the congressional baseball game maybe 10 \nyears ago--me on the Democratic side, him on the Republican side. For a \nyear or two, I was almost selected as the most valuable Republican \nplayer--and I am a Democrat. So I wasn't always a great player, but I \ngave it my best.\n  I was in Florida for an event over the weekend, and last week in \nFlorida and Arizona something wonderful happened. What happened was \nthat spring training camps opened. Pitchers and catchers reported, and \nthen the full teams started to report. When they start the spring \ntraining games in a day or two--maybe tomorrow--teams will take the \nfield and they will take the field with nine players.\n  When Justice Roberts was going through his confirmation hearing \nbefore the Judiciary Committee, he was asked: What is the job of the \nSupreme Court? How would you describe it, in a simple way?\n  He said: Our job basically is to call balls and strikes.\n  When baseball teams take the field, they have nine players in nine \npositions. When the Supreme Court is in session, they have nine \njustices--or at least they did until the death of Justice Scalia. Just \nlike you can't have a baseball team take the field without the \nshortstop or without the catcher or even without the second baseman or \nthe center fielder and play well and do their job, at the end of the \nday, the Supreme Court is a team. They need nine--not players but nine \njustices--to be able to do their job well. Let's keep that in mind.\n  The last thing I would say is that the American people are frustrated \nwith us and our inability to get things done. Sometimes I can \nunderstand why they would feel that way. We have a great opportunity to \nget something done. I hope the President will nominate a terrific \ncandidate, and I hope our Republican friends will at least have the \ncourtesy of meeting with that man or woman, give him or her a chance to \npresent themselves and explain what they are about, have a hearing on \nthat person, and then give them the honor of a vote. I think they \ndeserve that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor for my friend from Vermont, the \nsenior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Leahy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/senate-section/article/S1074-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 5:30 \np.m. will be equally divided between the two managers or their \ndesignees.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the senior \nSenator from Delaware. We have plenty of time to get a nomination to \nthe Supreme Court from the President and to confirm a Justice, just as \nthis body has done 12 times in Presidential election years. I think \nprobably the most recent, of course, was when Democrats controlled the \nSenate and we confirmed unanimously President Reagan's nomination in an \nelection year, his final year in office. So it can easily be done. \nBesides, let us just do our job. We get paid to be here and to do our \njob. We ought to do it.\n  We also have the matter that each one of us has taken a very solemn \noath before God to uphold the Constitution. The Constitution says the \nPresident shall nominate and the Senate shall advise and consent. We \nought to do just what we all have solemnly sworn to do. I take my oath \nvery seriously. I hope other Senators do too.\n  Now, Mr. President, today the full Senate is going to begin a \ndiscussion about one of the most challenging public health crises of \nour time--addiction to prescription painkillers and other opioids. In \nmy home State of Vermont, there are few issues more pressing than \nopioid addiction. It is tearing apart families and communities--\nfamilies and communities I have known all my life.\n  In March 2008, nearly 8 years ago, when I was chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, I first held a hearing in Rutland, VT, about the \nchallenges this epidemic presents in rural parts of our country. In \nsubsequent field hearings, we learned about how communities like \nRutland, VT--a beautiful community--were constructively seeking ways to \nget ahead of addiction. But we also learned--and I think we knew\n\n[[Page S1075]]\n\nthis--that there are no easy answers, and we need a comprehensive \napproach. Education, prevention, and treatment are essential if we are \nto reverse the tide in this fight.\n  Vermont's all-hands-on-deck example serves as a model for other \nStates and communities across the Nation. In fact, just last week an \narticle in the Christian Science Monitor detailed how Vermont's \npioneering approach has been embraced well beyond Vermont's borders.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Christian Science \nMonitor article entitled ``How one state turned its `heroin crisis' \ninto a national lesson'' be printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  Opioid addiction is not a new issue. It is not new to me, and it is \nnot new to Vermont. But it is about time that the full Congress gave \nthis public health crisis the attention it deserves. The bill we begin \nto consider today, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or \nCARA, represents a positive step forward, and I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of it.\n  For decades, the knee-jerk response in Congress to those who \nstruggled with addiction was misguided. We embraced harsh and arbitrary \nmandatory minimums, we ignored effective treatment options, and we \npushed addicts further underground and away from recovery. Such \npolicies reflect a complete misunderstanding of the problem of \naddiction.\n  At my hearings and everywhere I went, we saw police officers, faith \ncommunities, educators, medical professionals, parents, and addicts \ncoming together, saying that no one group had the answer but the \ncommunity had to come together. Because we know addiction is a disease, \nwe know our tools for combating addiction must be the same as other \ndisease--a commitment to evidence-based education and proven techniques \nfor prevention, treatment, and recovery programs.\n  As one who has served in law enforcement, I know that law enforcement \nis an important element in a comprehensive approach. That is why I \nworked to include in this bill an authorization for funding to expand \nState-led anti-heroin task forces. But this legislation is important \nbecause it treats addiction as the public health crisis that it is. The \nbill authorizes a crucial program that I helped create that expands \naccess to medication-assisted treatment programs--programs that have \nbeen plagued by massive waiting lists. The clinic in Chittenden County, \nVT--that is the largest of our 14 counties--has seen its wait list \nlengthened to nearly a year. What happens when that wait list is long? \nSeveral people have overdosed and died while waiting for treatment. \nThose deaths were probably preventable. We shouldn't die waiting for \ntreatment. We have to do better.\n  The bill also recognizes the devastating impact that opioid abuse has \non rural communities. Just as in your State and every other State, we \nhave rural communities. Vermont is predominantly rural communities. My \nhome where my wife and I have lived since we got married is on a dirt \nroad. We know rural America. We know it has been hit hard by addiction. \nEmergency medical services in rural communities are often limited. I am \nglad that the bill we reported out of committee includes my provision \nto support our rural communities for the overdose reversal drug \nnaloxone.\n  Over the last decade, death rates from opioid overdoses have steadily \nclimbed across the country. But there is a real disparity between rural \ncommunities and major cities. We found the more rural a location, the \nhigher the death rate. Getting lifesaving drugs into more hands will \nsave lives across the country, especially in our rural communities that \nare among the hardest hit.\n  This is not a partisan issue. I thank Senator Whitehouse and Senator \nGrassley for working with me on this legislation in our Judiciary \nCommittee. I hope we will soon see its passage here in the Senate. But \none authorization bill by itself is not going to end addiction. It is \nnot going to end the deaths that we are seeing in rural America and in \nurban America.\n  We need a significant commitment of targeted funding to implement \nthis bill. Senator Shaheen's $600 million emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill provides those resources, and I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of that legislation, as well.\n  In your State, my State, and the other 48 States right now, we passed \nlarger emergency supplemental bills that addressed swine flu and Ebola. \nWe do not have Ebola in our country, but we passed an emergency \nsupplemental bill to address that. We need to address what we have \nright here within our country today. Swine flu and Ebola presented far, \nfar fewer dramatic health risks to our communities. We need to take \nthis challenge just as seriously.\n  The bill we are considering today has received strong bipartisan \nsupport and deservedly so. But I hope all the Senators supporting CARA \ntoday will also support Senator Shaheen's legislation. One goes hand in \nhand with the other. We need to authorize these advances in dealing \nwith the opioid crisis, but then we actually need to fund them.\n  We cannot pretend that solving a problem as large as opioid addiction \ncosts nothing. We have an opportunity to equip our communities with the \nsupport and resources they need to finally get ahead of addiction. \nPrograms will save lives. That is a worthy investment.\n  It is very easy to say we will pass a law to stop opioid addiction. \nWe can all feel good about voting for that. Who is going to vote for \nlegislation to say ``let us continue opioid addiction''? But if we do \nnot put the money in it, then, basically, we are saying we want to feel \ngood but we are not going to do anything for you.\n  We spend money worldwide. Some of it is for good causes, and some of \nit is totally wasted. Here we have a problem in the United States of \nAmerica, where our priorities are first and foremost to our country. If \nyou saw some of the people I heard in these hearings all over our \nbeautiful State, some of the families with whom I have talked across \ntheir kitchen tables, and a young woman who had been addicted and is \nnow helping to counsel others and the story she told, or if you saw a \nmovie or TV program, you would say it couldn't be that grim. Well, it \nwas. It is.\n  These people go across all income brackets, all brackets of \neducation. It is tearing apart parts of our communities across the \ncountry. Fortunately, we have had some very brave people stand up. I \nhope Senator Shaheen's appropriation goes through because, if it does \nnot, we are saying all the right things, as we should, except for one \nthing: We are not going to pay for it. This is too important to say the \ncheck is in the mail; just wait and wait. We can do better. We can do \nbetter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From The Christian Science Monitor, Feb. 23, 2016]\n\n    How One State Turned Its `Heroin Crisis' Into a National Lesson\n\n                       (By Gail Russell Chaddock)\n\n       Paths to Progress: Vermont's pioneering focus on treatment \n     amid an opioid crisis is being embraced by politicians of \n     both parties--well beyond the state.\n       America's opioid addiction crisis, now claiming 78 lives a \n     day, is sweeping aside party lines both at the state level \n     and even in famously gridlocked Washington.\n       The nation's governors, from deep-red Alabama to bluest-of-\n     the-blue Vermont, are moving rapidly to a strategy of \n     treating illegal drug users rather than jailing them.\n       It's a shift that runs deep in public opinion, as well. \n     Some two-thirds of Americans now typically say that they \n     prefer providing treatment to long prison sentences.\n       ``This is an area where I can get agreement from Bernie \n     Sanders and Mitch McConnell,'' President Obama said at a \n     White House meeting with governors on Monday. ``That doesn't \n     happen that often, but this is one. And it indicates the \n     severity of the issue.''\n       But the governors are, in fact, well ahead of Washington on \n     this issue--as they were on welfare reform in the 1990s and, \n     more recently, sentencing reform.\n       Gov. Peter Shumlin (D) of Vermont, a leader in the pivot \n     from prisons to treatment, says he got into the addiction \n     fight after talking to people in his state.\n       ``I found we were doing almost everything wrong,'' he told \n     a forum on opioid and heroin addiction at The Pew Charitable \n     Trusts in Washington on Friday.\n       The best hope is to get more people into treatment, he \n     said. And the best time to do that is ``when the blue lights \n     are flashing and the handcuffs are on.''\n       Vermont, like other states in the Northeast, is facing \n     severe opioid challenges. In 2014, Governor Shumlin devoted \n     his annual State of the State address entirely to\n\n[[Page S1076]]\n\n     Vermont's ``full-blown heroin crisis.'' Annual overdose \n     deaths from opioids had nearly doubled since 2004. The number \n     of people seeking treatment for opioid addiction had spiked \n     770 percent since 2000.\n\n\n                         what vermont has done\n\n       And so Vermont has taken a hard look at its approach. \n     Instead of jail, nonviolent offenders are given the option of \n     going into treatment. They start in one of the state's new \n     central clinics (hubs) and move on to a family doctor, \n     counselor, or therapist closer to home (spokes).\n       Vermont law also shields people seeking medical help for an \n     overdose from prosecution for manufacturing or selling drugs, \n     not just for minor crimes. It also was the first state to \n     legalize the sale of naloxone over the counter in \n     pharmacies--a drug aimed at reversing overdoses and saving \n     lives.\n       Other states have moved toward treatment instead of \n     incarceration, but Vermont has done it on a grander scale, \n     experts say.\n       ``You've seen some elected officials support legalizing \n     marijuana, some want to reform sentencing, some talk about \n     overdoses, but very few have tied all these together in a \n     comprehensive narrative,'' says Bill Piper, senior director \n     of national affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance in \n     Washington.\n       ``Vermont's governor is at the forefront, and what makes \n     him unique is that he's one of the few elected officials that \n     has connected the dots on the various issues,'' he adds.\n       As a pioneer state, Vermont has also identified some of the \n     limits of a treatment-centric strategy.\n       ``As you build out treatment, and particularly in rural \n     America, we can't get enough docs who are able to meet the \n     demand of our waiting lists,'' Shumlin told the president at \n     the White House meeting Monday.\n       But the most important issue, he told Mr. Obama, is to \n     ``come up with a more rational approach to prescribing \n     prescription drugs.''\n\n\n                     a bid to rein in prescriptions\n\n       Governors see legal prescriptions for drugs like OxyContin \n     as the gateway to heroin. ``Overprescribing of opioid \n     painkillers has fueled the nation's addiction crisis,'' \n     according to a report from the National Governors \n     Association's Health and Human Services Committee. In a bid \n     to rein in prescriptions, governors on that committee plan to \n     develop a list of protocols to present to the full membership \n     at the next NGA meeting in August.\n       ``The United States represents 5 percent of the world's \n     population and consumes 80 percent of the world's opioids,'' \n     said Gov. Charlie Baker (R) of Massachusetts, who chairs the \n     NGA's Health and Human Services Committee, on Saturday. \n     That's ``fundamentally flawed.''\n       When prescriptions are too hard to get--or too expensive--\n     addicts switch to heroin. ``Most of the heroin addicts we \n     treat started by using prescription opiates,'' says Brian \n     McAlister, author of ``Full Recovery'' and CEO of the Full \n     Recovery Wellness Center in Fairfield, N.J.\n       ``Some were prescribed by a doctor or dentist, others were \n     stolen from family or friends' medicine cabinets, and others \n     were purchased illegally just to party--but the party ends \n     very quickly. These drugs are highly addictive, and when the \n     supply runs out, the problems get worse.''\n\n\n                         at the national level\n\n       The prospect of politicians reining in pharmaceutical sales \n     is a stretch in the halls of Congress. In 1993, the GOP-\n     controlled Congress explicitly barred government from \n     negotiating lower drug prices with drug companies. Last year, \n     Big Pharma spent more than $235 million to influence policy \n     outcomes in Washington--the largest budget of any lobby group \n     in Washington.\n       Governors could set protocols on prescribing practices for \n     painkillers on their own, Shumlin told the president. ``But \n     it takes time,'' and ``it doesn't apply to all 50 states.'' \n     Instead, he asked Obama to ``consider a national approach \n     which simply says, for minor procedures, we're going to limit \n     this to 10 pills and after that you've got to come back for \n     more.''\n       ``To be candid, the docs, the AMA [American Medical \n     Association] are resistant to listening to politicians like \n     us talking about how many pills to prescribe. But is there \n     something you could do on a national level that would help us \n     get out of this tragic mess?'' he added. Obama answered, at \n     length, but in the end deferred to the states. ``A very \n     specific approach to working with the docs, the hospitals, \n     the providers so that they are not overprescribing'' can be \n     done at the national level, he said. ``But it is most \n     profitably done, I think, if we have bipartisan support from \n     the governors so that by the time it gets to the national \n     level, there is consensus and there's not a lot of politics \n     involved in it.''\n       In a recent blog, AMA president Steven Stack called the \n     opioid epidemic a ``defining moment'' for the profession. \n     ``Our nation is needlessly losing thousands of people to a \n     preventable epidemic, and we must take action for our \n     patients.''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

On this vote, the yeas are 89, the nays are 0.\n  Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, an historic epidemic of drug overdose \ndeaths is gripping our country. Over 47,000 Americans died from \noverdoses in 2014, an alltime high. Incredibly, that is more deaths \nthan resulted from either car crashes or gun violence.\n  Addiction to opioids, primarily prescription pain killers and heroin, \nis driving this epidemic. It is destroying lives, families, and \ncommunities. It is a crisis. And it demands action.\n\n[[Page S1077]]\n\n  Thankfully, the Senate can act this week, when we consider S. 524, \nthe Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA.\n  CARA is a bipartisan bill authored by two Democrats and two \nRepublicans--Senators Whitehouse, Portman, Klobuchar, and Ayotte.\n  These Senators have shown extraordinary leadership on this issue. \nThey deserve credit for crafting a bill that addresses many of the \ndifferent aspects of this epidemic, through evidence-based solutions \nand best practices. This is a complex crisis that requires a \nmultifaceted solution.\n  Over the past few months, I have worked hard with the bill's authors \nto refine it and move it through the Judiciary Committee. I am proud to \nsay that a few weeks ago it passed the committee on a voice vote, with \nno opposition.\n  CARA is only the latest bipartisan legislative accomplishment by the \nJudiciary Committee this Congress. We have had 21 bills pass the \nCommittee this Congress, all with bipartisan support. But there are a \nfew major bills that stand out.\n  Last April, the committee passed the Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act unanimously, 19-0. The bill enhances penalties for \nhuman trafficking and equips law enforcement with new tools to target \npredators who traffic innocent young people. The bill passed the Senate \n99-0 and was signed into law by the President.\n  In October, the committee passed the landmark Sentencing Reform and \nCorrections Act with a strong 15-5 bipartisan vote. My bill would \nrecalibrate prison sentences for certain drug offenders, target violent \ncriminals, and grant judges greater discretion at sentencing for lower-\nlevel drug crimes. I am working hard to build additional support for \nthe bill so that it can be taken up by the full Senate soon.\n  Then in December, the committee passed my Juvenile Justice and \nDelinquency Prevention Reauthorization Act, again without opposition. \nThe bill will ensure that at-risk youth are fairly and effectively \nserved by juvenile justice grant programs. Again, we are working hard \nto move this bill through the full Senate.\n  The bipartisan reforms enacted by each of these bills address real \nproblems that affect the lives of many people across the nation and in \nmy home state of Iowa. I am proud of the work we have done so far--but \nthere is a lot more to do.\n  And that brings me back to the heroin and prescription drug epidemic. \nIt isn't as bad in Iowa as it is in many areas of the country, but the \neastern part of my State has been hit hard recently.\n  The human cost of what is happening across so many of these \ncommunities is incalculable. Every life that is lost or changed forever \nby this epidemic is precious. Especially for many young people who fall \nvictim to addiction early in their lives, there is so much human \npotential at stake.\n  Many Iowans have heard the story of Kim Brown, a nurse from \nDavenport, and her son Andy. Andy was prescribed pain pills when he had \nsurgery at age 14. Whether it was connected to abuse of those pain \npills or not, he developed a drug problem as a teenager that he \ncouldn't shake. He overdosed on heroin a few times but survived. And \nfinally, at age 33, he died of an overdose, tragically leaving behind \ntwo young sons. Ms. Brown now speaks out around the State about the \nheroin epidemic.\n  Her story reflects a larger pattern. Over the last 20 years or so, \ndoctors have increasingly prescribed opioids to help their patients \nmanage pain. For many, these medicines have been the answer to their \nprayers. But for others, they have led to a nightmare of addiction.\n  According to numerous studies, prescription opioid addiction is a \nstrong risk factor for heroin addiction. In some cases, those addicted \nto painkillers turn to heroin to get a similar high, because recently, \nit has become cheaper and more easily available.\n  And as Ms. Brown's story reflects, this epidemic is a matter of life \nand death. In fact, nationally, heroin overdose deaths more than \ntripled from 2010 to 2014.\n  But Iowans are fighting back. Last year, with the assistance of a new \nFederal grant, the U.S. Attorney's office and the Cedar Rapids Police \nDepartment formed the Eastern Iowa Heroin Initiative.\n  This partnership is focused on stemming the tide of heroin abuse \nthrough enforcement, prevention and treatment. I have been invited to \nparticipate in a townhall with them to discuss the epidemic, and I plan \nto do so soon.\n  When I do, I want to tell them that the Senate has acted on this \ncrisis by passing CARA. CARA supports so many of the efforts to help \nstem the tide of addiction that are underway in Iowa and across the \ncountry.\n  As its name reflects, the bill addresses the epidemic \ncomprehensively, supporting prevention, education, treatment, recovery, \nand law enforcement.\n  CARA starts with prevention and education. It authorizes awareness \nand education campaigns, so that the public understands the dangers of \nbecoming addicted to prescription painkillers.\n  It creates a national task force to develop best prescribing \npractices, so that doctors don't expose their patients to unnecessary \nrisks of addiction.\n  The bill encourages the use of prescription drug monitoring programs \nlike Iowa's, which helps detect and deter ``doctor shopping'' behavior \nby addicts.\n  And the bill authorizes an expansion of the Federal initiative that \nallows patients to safely dispose of old or unused medications, so that \nthese drugs don't fall into the hands of young people, potentially \nleading to addiction.\n  In fact, along with a few other committee members, I helped start \nthis ``take back'' program in 2010 through the Secure and Responsible \nDrug Disposal Act. It has been a highly successful effort. Since 2010, \nover 2,700 tons of drugs have been collected from medicine cabinets and \ndisposed of safely. Iowa also has a similar ``take back'' program \nthat's expanding rapidly.\n  CARA also focuses on treatment and recovery. The bill authorizes \nprograms to provide first responders with training to use Naloxone, a \ndrug that can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose and directly \nsave lives. Naloxone was used hundreds of times by first responders in \nIowa in 2014.\n  Importantly, the bill provides that a set portion of Naloxone funding \ngo to rural areas, like much of Iowa that is being affected most \nacutely. This is critical when someone overdoses and isn't near a \nhospital.\n  The bill also authorizes an expansion of Drug Free Communities Act \ngrants to those areas that are most dramatically affected by the opioid \nepidemic. And it also authorizes funds for programs that encourage the \nuse of medication assisted treatment, provide community-based support \nfor those in recovery, and address the unique needs of pregnant and \npostpartum women who are addicted to opioids.\n  Finally, the bill also bolsters law enforcement efforts as well. \nAmazingly, in 2007, only 8 percent of State and local law enforcement \nofficials across the country identified heroin as the greatest drug \nthreat in their area. But by 2015, that number rose to 38 percent, more \nthan any other drug.\n  So the bill reauthorizes Federal funding for State task forces that \nspecifically address heroin trafficking.\n  I am also pleased that I was able to include in the bill a \nreauthorization of the funding for the methamphetamine law enforcement \ntask forces as well.\n  I held a Judiciary Committee field hearing in Des Moines last fall \nabout the ongoing meth problem across Iowa. And one thing the hearing \nmade clear is that our friends in State law enforcement need all the \nhelp we can give them on that front, too.\n  All in all, the bill authorizes about $78 million per year to address \nthis crisis.\n  It is no wonder that the bill is supported by a diverse range of \nstakeholders, including the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, \nthe Partnership for Drug-Free Kids, the National District Attorneys \nAssociation, the Major County Sheriffs' Association, the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General, and so many organizations in the \ntreatment and recovery communities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it this week, when the Senate has the \nopportunity to act to address this epidemic. We owe it to those, like \nKim Brown, who have lost sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, \ncoworkers and friends to act now.\n\n[[Page S1078]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, first I thank my colleague and chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley.\n  Many years ago I went to Iowa with Senator Grassley to set up an \nanti-drug coalition. We had done one in Ohio. I was the chair of that, \nand Chuck Grassley asked if I would come. This was probably 20 years \nago that Senator Grassley--and I was in the House.\n  We had a great visit. We had a couple of townhall meetings. Chuck \nGrassley is a guy who understands the issue, cares about it, and has \ndevoted a lot of time and resources to it in Iowa. The people of Iowa \nknow he is sincere about it because he has been on the ground setting \nup these coalitions and dealing with this issue.\n  Frankly, it is a little disappointing--probably to him and to me--to \nsee that some 20 years later we are still facing this issue now and \neven different issues. He mentioned methamphetamines. He mentioned, of \ncourse, the heroin and opiate addiction problems with prescription \ndrugs.\n  Twenty years ago it was more marijuana and cocaine, but I think the \nlesson we have all learned is these drugs will come and go in terms of \ntheir severity and their impact on our communities and our families, \nbut it is always going to be there, and we need to keep up the fight.\n  Right now we have an urgent problem. That urgent problem was outlined \nby Senator Grassley, but it is this growing use of opiates that leads \nto a horrible addiction. It has a grip on so many of our constituents, \nso many of our loved ones.\n  Over the weekend I had a townhall meeting. I asked--after we had \ntalked about taxes, trade, energy, and other issues--if people would \njust raise their hands if they had been affected by the heroin and \nprescription drug addiction problem. I said: Has anybody in your family \nand friends been affected? Half of the hands in the room went up.\n  Unfortunately, that is the reality of this situation. In Ohio last \nyear we lost almost 2,400 just to overdose deaths. That doesn't account \nfor the fact that so many people are being saved now by naloxone--which \nis something that is encouraged by our legislation and we will talk \nabout it in a second. Narcan is being used, but even those who survive \nthe overdoses, of course, are seeing their families broken apart, their \ncommunities devastated.\n  I talked to a prosecutor over the weekend in one of our more rural \ncounties, and he said: Rob, over 80 percent of our crime is directly \nrelated to this issue now, heroin and prescription drugs. Often it is \npeople committing crimes to pay for their habit.\n  The people who are the purveyors of these drugs have a business plan; \nthat is, to get you hooked with a relatively low cost at first and then \nyou need more and more to be able to feel the same high. It gets more \nexpensive to the point that it might go from $50 to $100 the first time \nto $1,000 or $1,500 a day by the end of your addiction. This is how \nhorrible it is and it leads to so many collateral consequences.\n  I am very pleased the Senate voted tonight to proceed to this \nlegislation called CARA, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. \nCARA is a Federal response to this issue. It is attempting to make the \nFederal Government a better partner with State and local governments, \nwith nonprofits, to be able to help to reverse this tide to deal with \nthis urgent problem in our communities. I would call it an epidemic. It \ncertainly is at epidemic levels in my State of Ohio. Sadly, we are the \ntop five in the country in terms of overdose deaths, but again it goes \nwell beyond just those deaths. There are so many people who are \naffected by it negatively and so many who have not been able to fulfill \ntheir God-given purpose because of this horrible addiction.\n  This legislation called CARA is bipartisan. It is comprehensive. As \nSenator Grassley said, he got it through the Judiciary Committee. I \nappreciate that. He got it through with something very extraordinary \naround here, which is a unanimous vote--meaning nobody objected. That \nnever happens around here. It just means that every Senator is \naddressing this issue back home, understands it, and wants to do \nsomething about it. This legislation is built on common sense, \nresearch, and experts from around the country who have come in.\n  I thank Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, who is the lead Democrat on this \nlegislation and my lead cosponsor. He and I are the coauthors of this \nlegislation. I also thank Senators Kelly Ayotte and Amy Klobuchar, who \nhave been terrific partners. Then there are 34 other bipartisan \ncosponsors. I thank them all for their support.\n  I am excited that if this bill can pass, it will pass in the House as \nwell because there is companion legislation. In fact, the House bill \nhas 88 cosponsors right now--also bipartisan. So the idea is to get \nthis bill passed, get it through the House, and have it signed into law \nby the President of the United States. It is urgent we do it.\n  This is a bill that not only has a lot of support on both sides of \nthe aisle, but--much more importantly to me--it has the support of \npeople all over the country who are experts in this field: doctors; \nthose in recovery; experts in prevention, treatment, and recovery; and \nlaw enforcement.\n  The legislation actually comes--I hope you can see on this chart, the \nwords are kind of small--but it comes from the last few years, putting \ntogether these experts from all around the country. We had five \ndifferent summit meetings in Washington, DC.\n  One was with the criminal justice system. We brought in experts from \nall around the country to talk about treatment and alternatives to \nincarceration. As you will see in this legislation, we have ways to \ndivert people from incarceration into treatment programs, which we \nthink is part of the way to solve this problem.\n  We then had one that focused on women, the special interests and \nneeds of women who are facing addiction and how to ensure they get into \ntreatment. As we will talk about later, this has a lot to do with one \nof the problems that is out there right now, which is more and more \nbabies who are born with addiction and having to take those babies \nthrough withdrawal. The care and compassion involved in that is truly \nimpressive, but that was a good forum for us. We had one on the science \nof addiction and addressing the consequences of addiction. There are a \nlot of good people around the country who understand the science of \nthis and what medication might work and what future medication might be \nbetter to deal with it.\n\n  We talked about youth drug prevention and developing communities of \nrecovery. This is a very important aspect of our legislation. We don't \njust talk about treatment, as important as that is, we talked about how \nyou divert people from getting into it in the first place through \nbetter prevention and education.\n  Finally, we had a forum on veterans focusing on substance abuse and \nPTSD and other issues. I recently visited one of our veterans courts in \nColumbus, OH, and saw the good work they are doing. Most people going \nthrough that court have mental health issues. Most also now have, \nsadly, opioid addiction issues, usually starting with prescription \ndrugs and moving to heroin.\n  As I said, there is strong bipartisan support for this legislation in \nthe House and the Senate. It is endorsed by more than 130 groups \nnationwide. By the way, those groups include some groups you might not \nexpect normally to be together on something such as this--the Fraternal \nOrder of Police, the American Society of Addiction Medicine, the Faces \nand Voices of Recovery, the Coalition for a Drug Free America, the \nChildren's Hospital Association, the National Association of Addiction \nTreatment Providers, the Partnership for Drug Free Kids, the American \nSociety of Addiction Medicine, the National Association of State \nAlcohol and Drug Abuse Directors, groups who are in all of our States, \nthe National Council for Behavioral Health, and, of course, the Major \nCounty Sheriffs' Association. So law enforcement, treatment, recovery, \neducation--everybody is coming together on this because we realize this \nis going to take that kind of comprehensive approach with all sectors \nof our community being involved and engaged.\n  CARA now has support not only of a lot of these groups from around \nthe country, but because of these groups--they helped us write a better \nbill.\n\n[[Page S1079]]\n\n  What does the bill do? Here are the basic elements of CARA:\n  First, with regard to prevention and education, it does establish new \ntask forces to develop better practices for prescribers simply because \nthere has been overprescribing, particularly of prescription drugs. \nThese narcotics have been overprescribed to the point that many people \nend up on heroin as a less expensive alternative to the prescription \ndrugs to which they have become addicted. The task force is an \ninteragency task force that is reporting back to the Congress on how to \ndevelop these best practices for the medical community.\n  The bill also establishes a national awareness campaign with regard \nto prevention and education. That is critical for us to get the word \nout. It has grants to local coalitions. This is in the Drug-Free \nCommunities Act area. The Drug-Free Communities Act goes back to the \n1990s. Since 1998 there has been $1.3 billion spent under the Drug-Free \nCommunities Act. I was the author of that in the House. It is good \nlegislation that helped create over 2,000 community coalitions around \nAmerica. I chaired ours in Cincinnati, OH, for 9 years and am still \nvery involved with it, and they do great work. But, again, we now have \nthis new issue, this new threat we must address. This helps with regard \nto specific grants where there is a high degree of opioid addiction and \nthe negative consequences of it, to be able to blend with the drug-free \ncommunity program.\n  Law enforcement. The bill provides for training for Narcan--what is \nknown as naloxone--for first responders to prevent overdoses. I think \neverybody in this Chamber has run into this back home. I went to a \nfirehouse recently because we had lost a brave firefighter in a house \nfire, and I went to talk to his shift about him and to thank them for \ntheir service. After talking to them about their fallen comrade, they \nwanted to talk about this issue. They told me: Rob, we are spending \nmore time administering Narcan than we are fighting fires these days. \nIn other words, they are going out and helping people who are having \noverdoses and are saving their lives.\n  A friend of mine who is a firefighter in Cincinnati told me just a \ncouple of weeks ago that he was responding to an overdose, saving \nsomeone in front of a house, when, in an entirely different group in \nthe back of the house, an overdose occurred.\n  In Toledo last week, there was a response by emergency medical \nservices to somebody who had hit a telephone pole. They found him with \na syringe in his arm. He had overdosed. While they were responding to \nhim, there were two other overdose calls in Toledo--one city in Ohio. \nThere were three at the same time. Two of the three were saved by \nNarcan. The third died.\n  Our folks in law enforcement and our first responders, our \nfirefighters, are doing a terrific job. They need help. They need more \nNarcan and more training to be sure they can continue to do what they \nare doing to prevent these overdoses. It is not the answer. Of course, \nthe answer is prevention, education, and better treatment. But in the \nmeantime, we have to provide them the help they need.\n  The law enforcement side also expands these drug prescription take-\nback programs. They work very well, as Senator Grassley said, in some \nof our States. We need to do more to expand those, and that is usually \ndone through our law enforcement communities.\n  It also authorizes a task force to combat heroin and \nmethamphetamines. These are the law enforcement task forces we talked \nabout earlier, which will help to coordinate Federal, State, and local \nlaw enforcement to deal with this issue.\n  On the treatment and recovery side, it expands medication assisted \ntreatment for opioid and heroin addiction. It creates diversion, \neducation, and treatment programs in the criminal justice system. We \ntalked about that earlier. That is so important.\n  I have been at roundtable discussions all around my State and at a \nnumber of treatment centers talking to recovering addicts about how \nthey got into the situation they are in and what advice they have. A \nyoung man told me a classic story. He had an injury. He started using \nprescription drugs. He got addicted. He needed money to buy these \nexpensive pain pills. He actually stole from a family member, and he \nended up in the law enforcement system and in jail. It was in jail that \nhe was told for the first time that it was actually cheaper to buy \nheroin. He got out and bought heroin and became a heroin addict. He is \nnow in treatment. He hit rock bottom, as he said, and I think it was \nbecause he had an overdose.\n  This is something where we need to figure out a better way to get \npeople diverted and use the criminal justice system to provide the \nincentive to get them into the right treatment program.\n  It also supports recovery for youth and building communities of \nrecovery, again focusing on our youth to get them to make the right \ndecisions but also steering our youth who are addicted into the \nrecovery they need. Sadly, this is now necessary in many of our high \nschools and in our colleges and universities.\n\n  It also establishes a task force to review some of the recovery and \ncollateral consequences. This is an interagency task force that is \ngoing to report back to us on what is truly working and what is not \nworking in order to do a deeper dive to ensure we are using this money \nmost effectively in order to make a difference.\n  It has treatment services for women and veterans included. This is a \nspecial interest of ours in this legislation--expanding treatment for \npregnant women who are struggling with addiction, again to avoid this \nhorrible situation where babies are born with an addiction.\n  It also supports care for our veterans. Our veterans right now can \nenter treatment, of course, following discharge with this legislation. \nThis is important. Our veterans have some special needs and special \ncircumstances--often trauma, PTSD, and other things related to their \naddiction. We find these veterans courts are incredibly helpful, to be \nable to have them surrounded by fellow veterans in order to make more \nprogress. That is in here as well.\n  Finally, the legislation incentivizes the States themselves to enact \ncomprehensive initiatives to address the opioid and heroin abuse \nproblem--the prescription drug monitoring program, for instance. This \nis very important. The Federal Government has a big role to play here. \nThink about it. If you are in one State and you are monitoring \nsomeone's prescription drug medications, knowing where they are going \nand how much they are getting to avoid overprescribing, if that person \ncrosses State lines, it is very difficult. So our legislation expands \non what can be done there to ensure that, for instance, my State of \nOhio knows whether someone has gone to Kentucky, West Virginia, \nPennsylvania, Indiana, or Michigan to get prescription drugs. So the \nprescription drug monitoring program will work better for every State.\n  Prevention and education on heroin abuses--this is to incentivize \nStates to do a better job on the prevention and education side and, of \ncourse, to prevent overdose and to improve drug treatment.\n  These are all aspects of this legislation. It is comprehensive \nbecause the problem is complex and requires a comprehensive approach.\n  Here are some statistics--we have already talked about some this \nevening--that are shocking. We know that 28,647 Americans died in the \nlast year for which we had data, which is 2014, from a drug overdose. \nThe 2015 numbers will be higher than that. That is roughly 120 \nAmericans dying every day.\n  There were 27,000 diagnosed cases of neonatal abstinence syndrome in \n2013, the last numbers we have. It is even worse this year. This means \nbabies were born with an addiction. A baby is born dependent on opioids \nevery 19 minutes in America. So while I am speaking today, there will \nbe another baby born who is addicted.\n  I have gone to hospitals in Cincinnati; in Lima, OH, to St. Rita's; \nto Rainbow Babies Children's Hospital in Cleveland, OH. They are \nincredible caregivers. My wife Jane was at Nationwide Children's \nHospital today, actually, on this very issue. These are babies who are \nso tiny, you can almost hold them in the palm of your hand. They need \ncaregivers to take them through a process where they go through \nwithdrawal. And we are not\n\n[[Page S1080]]\n\nsure what the long-term consequences are because we don't have the data \nyet because this is such a new issue. There has been a substantial \nincrease over the last several years. In Ohio, the same thing I said \nearlier--750 percent increase in the number of babies diagnosed with \nneonatal abstinence syndrome since 2004. There has been a 750-percent \nincrease in babies born addicted.\n  These are the issues this legislation gets at. Again, it does so in a \nway that is not just bipartisan, which is important, and not just House \nand Senate, which is important--the House has its own companion bill, \none the President will be able to sign into law--but most importantly, \nit is because of the input of people from all over this country, the \nexperts, people who are recovering themselves, and those who are most \naffected by this, that this legislation makes sense, and not just for \nmy State but for our country.\n  The Judiciary Committee had a number of good witnesses. One was a \nwoman named Tonda DaRe. Tonda DaRe is from Ohio. She had a daughter \nnamed Holly. On her 21st birthday, Holly, who had a bright future ahead \nof her--she was engaged to be married, and she had been very involved \nin her high school and active in sports--tried heroin for the first \ntime. She became addicted. She went into recovery, and unfortunately, \nas in many cases, she had a relapse. At age 23 her young life ended in \nan overdose.\n  Her mom, Tonda DaRe, set up an organization called Holly's Song of \nHope. She testified before the Judiciary Committee about the importance \nof her work--talking to other mothers and fathers and sons and \ndaughters about the devastating consequences of this heroin and \nprescription drug addiction. This legislation needs to be passed so \nthat we can help Tonda. She testified on behalf of this legislation \nbecause she has looked at it and knows it will make a difference in her \nlife and her community.\n  This is an urgent problem, as I said earlier. It is also one we have \na lot of bipartisan consensus around. There will be opportunities \nduring this debate to hear from a lot of different people on a lot of \ndifferent ideas on amendments to the legislation. That is good. It is \ngood to have a debate. But I hope my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle will keep focused on the importance of getting this done. It is \nimportant to get it done in terms of providing immediate help to our \ncommunities and also providing a structure to more effectively spend \nfunds this year--and yes, we have funds to spend this year that have \nbeen appropriated consistent with CARA--but also next year and the year \nafter and the year after. Some will support more resources, and that is \nfine. We need to have that debate. I myself think it is a priority, and \nwe should be providing the resources to be able to deal with this \nissue.\n  I would also urge my colleagues to ensure that we get this over the \nfinish line. It is too important. We can't play politics with it. This \nis one of those issues, again, like so few around here, that got out of \nthe committee without a single dissenting vote. We have done the right \nthing on a bipartisan basis to bring in the experts. We have a good \nsolution to an urgent problem we all face.\n  I am pleased with the vote tonight, and I urge my colleagues to have \na good debate on the floor. Let's get this done for the sake of Tonda \nDaRe and so many other mothers, fathers, and others out there who \ndeserve to have a little help in their fight against opioid addiction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I just want to congratulate the Senator \nfrom Ohio for his extraordinary leadership on this issue. This is an \nepidemic that affects us all, and he has definitely been at the fore in \nproviding exceptional leadership on this, and I want to commend him for \nthat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/senate-section/article/S1080-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1080-S1081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              BLACK HISTORY MONTH AND THE PULLMAN PORTERS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this year marks the 90th anniversary of \nhistorian and scholar Dr. Carter G. Woodson's launch of Negro History \nWeek--and is the 40th anniversary of the inaugural Black History Month. \nThis year, as Black History Month is coming to a close, I want to \ncelebrate by paying tribute to a Chicago neighborhood that has played a \nsignificant part in our country's African-American and labor history--\nthe Pullman Historical District.\n  One year ago this month, President Obama designated the South Side \nChicago's Pullman Historic District as the Nation's 406th national \npark. The Pullman National Historical Park has a special place in our \nNation's history. It has been the site of some major historical events. \nThe men and women of the Pullman community--the birthplace of the \nNation's first Black labor union--the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car \nPorters--helped shape our country as we know it today. By fighting for \nfair labor conditions in the 19th century, the Pullman workers advanced \nAmerica's civil rights movement.\n  In the 1890s, the Pullman community was the catalyst for the first \nindustrywide strike during one of the worst economic depressions our \nNation ever faced--and led to the creation of Labor Day as a national \nholiday. These railroad workers aren't always mentioned in the history \nbooks or picked to join the parades during Black History Month--but \nthey made history and deserve to be honored. One hundred and one years \nago, fearing that the history of African Americans was fading into \nobscurity, Dr. Carter G. Woodson founded the Association for the Study \nof Afro-American Life and History. His goal was to raise awareness of \nAfrican Americans' contributions to civilization. He believed that \ntruth could not be denied--and realized that past contributions by \nAfrican Americans needed to be documented and taught. He once said, \n``if a race had no recorded history, its achievements would be \nforgotten and, in time, claimed by other groups.'' I agree with Dr. \nWoodson--and so does the A. Philip Randolph Pullman Porter Museum in \nChicago.\n  Earlier this month, with the help of DePaul University, the A. Philip \nRandolph Pullman Porter Museum launched a new online registry that \ngives voice to the stories of Black railroad workers. By capturing \nstories from scholars and the relatives of these workers, we will \npreserve oral histories that otherwise might be lost to history. If you \nlisten to the oral histories, you will hear stories from people like \nTheodore Berrien, who worked as a Pullman porter from 1940 to 1969. \nBerrien worked on President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's funeral train \nfrom Georgia to Washington, DC. On the registry, Berrien's grandson \nsays: ``He spoke of how kind Mrs. Roosevelt was and thanked him for his \nservices during the trip.''\n  Or take Blaine McKinley Fitzgerald, who worked as a Pullman porter on \nthe Illinois Central and Louisville and Nashville railroads from 1920 \nto 1946--his relatives wrote: ``Blaine's major route was from \nBirmingham to New York. He also worked the Rose Bowl trips to \nCalifornia when Alabama was a major contingent.'' You will hear how \nBlaine raised a family of six children on his salary as a Pullman \nporter--all college educated--who became teachers, lawyers, and \nengineers. Blaine's story is just one of many examples of how the \nPullman porters helped build the African-American middle class in \nChicago.\n  But even as the African-American middle class expanded in Chicago and \nacross the country, the struggle for justice, equality, and equal \nopportunities for African Americans in this country has continued.\n  And the State of Illinois has played a significant role in that \nstruggle. Springfield, IL native President Abraham Lincoln led our \nNation through a war to save the Union, abolished slavery, and began \nthe work we continue today to end discrimination. In 1909, the \ncentennial of Lincoln's birth, 2,000 people gathered at a dazzling gala \nto honor the centennial of Lincoln's birth. Even though this was an \nevent celebrating the centennial of the President that helped abolish \nslavery--like most in America at that time, it was segregated.\n  The Chicago Tribune reported, that it ``is to be a lily white affair \nfrom start to finish.'' But across town, the Black community organized \nits own Lincoln centennial at the African\n\n[[Page S1081]]\n\nMethodist Episcopal Church. The Reverend L.H. Magee spoke at that \ngathering and noted the widespread feeling of hurt over the exclusion \nof people of color from the main Lincoln banquet. Reverend Magee made a \nprediction about the bicentennial of Lincoln's birth in 2009--100 years \nin the future: ``prejudice shall have been banished as a myth and \nrelegated to the dark days of Salem witchcraft.''\n  In many ways, his prediction was correct. We have come a long way to \nbanish discrimination in our communities--our legal system recognizes \nthat all men and women are created equal and should be free from \ndiscrimination in schools, housing, and employment. And in 2009, \nPresident Barack Obama, a former Illinois Senator, was sworn in as the \nfirst African-American President of the United States of America.\n  Pastor Magee had a vision of a new America, but he may not have \nimagined that bricks laid by the hands of slaves would make a home in \nour White House for a family of color. But, while progress has been \nmade, we cannot ignore that we still have more to do. When one in three \nAfrican-American men will go to prison in their lifetime, we have more \nto do. When the unemployment rate for African Americans are more than \ndouble the rate for Whites, we have more to do. And when efforts exist \nacross the country to make it harder to vote, rather than easier, we \nhave more to do. But it is when the climb is the steepest that we can \ncome together as Americans, to take the mountaintop once and for all.\n  This month, let's celebrate these achievements and honor Dr. Carter \nG. Woodson's legacy by remembering all the contributions of the \nextraordinary men and women of the civil rights movement--including the \nPullman porters. We have come a long way, but we still have work to do \nto fulfill the promise to make our Nation fairer and more equal and to \ndo what Lincoln called on us to do: ``nobly save . . . the last best \nhope of earth.''\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/senate-section/article/S1081-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL.

Mr. President, this month marks 5 years since Bahrainis of \nall backgrounds took to the streets in Manama in peaceful protest, \ncalling for reform in their country. As Senators have heard me recount \nhere before, the Government of Bahrain responded with violence and \nrepression, torture and retaliation. In response, the monarchy set up \nan independent commission: the so-called Bahrain Independent Commission \nof Inquiry, or BICI. And I say this is important to recall because many \nof the BICI's 26 specific, concrete recommendations remain unfulfilled \n5 years later.\n  That certainly isn't what the government of Bahrain wants you to \nbelieve. In fact, the regime's representatives continue to insist that \nthey have fully implemented all of the BICI recommendations. As they \ntell it, they have turned the page on that chapter of Bahrain's \nhistory.\n  But members of Bahrain's peaceful opposition feel trapped in a never-\nending story. Nongovernmental organizations like Americans for \nDemocracy and Human Rights in Bahrain, Amnesty International, Human \nRights First, Human Rights Watch, and the Project on Middle East \nDemocracy have all documented the regime's ongoing repression. The \nState Department's most recent annual human rights report for Bahrain \nstates that protestors face ``arbitrary deprivation of life,'' ``arrest \nand detention of protesters . . . occasionally leading to their \ntorture,'' and ``restrictions on civil liberties, including freedom of \nspeech, press, assembly association, and religion.'' And as some \ncolleagues know, the State Department could last\n\n[[Page S1082]]\n\ncertify that Bahrain had only fully implemented 5 of the 26 BICI \nrecommendations. That is a pretty far cry from full implementation.\n  As the son of a journalist, I want to take a minute to highlight one \nparticular aspect of the regime's repression: the crackdown on speech \nand expression. As recently as this month, a Bahraini court sentenced \nan internationally known photographer to serve jail time for \nparticipating in an unlicensed protest. The regime has similarly \ntargeted bloggers as well as prominent and award-winning \nphotojournalists for merely capturing Bahrain's ongoing unrest. And \njust this month, a Bahraini court sentenced a Sunni opposition leader \nto 1 year in prison for giving a political speech.\n  Despite these concerns, the Obama administration chose last year to \nresume selling or transferring certain arms to the Government of \nBahrain. I was one of the biggest proponents of the arms ban dating \nback to 2011, and I saw no reason to revisit the policy last year. In \nfact, I introduced the bipartisan BICI Accountability Act, legislation \nthat would block the administration's decision to overturn the weapons \nban until the State Department could certify that all 26 BICI \nrecommendations were fully implemented.\n  I am not here to make broad pronouncements about what the Government \nof Bahrain should look like--that is very much a conversation for \nBahrain's people and its rulers to have. But as President Obama said in \n2011, ``you can't have a real dialogue when parts of the peaceful \nopposition are in jail.'' For Bahrain to move forward, the government \nwill need to release the opposition leaders still languishing in its \nprisons.\n  The United States and Bahrain have ties that go back decades; our \ncountries are partners and allies. Indeed, I am not disappointed with \nthe Government of Bahrain despite our bilateral relationship; I am \ndisappointed with the Government of Bahrain because of our bilateral \nrelationship. The United States of America has an obligation, it \nstrikes me, to ask more of her friends and allies around the world. And \nwhen they falter or fail, the U.S. has a duty to help them live up to \ntheir potential. And of course, there is always the real danger that \ncontinued unrest or even greater instability could impact the safety of \nour soldiers in Bahrain or the future of the American presence there.\n  For these reasons, I speak out today against further oppression, and \nI call again for reconciliation and reform in Bahrain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/senate-section/article/S1082-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  HONORING SENIOR DEPUTY PATRICK DAILEY AND SENIOR DEPUTY MARK LOGSDON\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the tragic \ndeaths of two fellow Marylanders. Senior Deputy Patrick Dailey and \nSenior Deputy Mark Logsdon of the Harford County Sheriff's Office were \nkilled in the line of duty on February 10. I join the people of \nMaryland and law enforcement communities across the country in mourning \nthe loss of two dedicated public servants. The men and women of law \nenforcement put themselves at great risk to protect our communities. \nLaw enforcement officers are the embodiment of the rule of law. An \nattack on them is an attack on the rule of law itself.\n  The word ``hero'' does not do justice to the legacies of Senior \nDeputies Dailey and Logsdon. Both men served the people of Harford \nCounty with distinction. On his 16th birthday, Deputy Patrick Dailey \nbegan his career in public service by joining the Joppa-Magnolia \nVolunteer Fire Company. His two sons, Bryan and Tyler, are also members \nof Joppa-Magnolia Volunteer Fire Company. Deputy Dailey was a member of \nthe U.S. Marine Corps before joining the Harford County Sheriff's \nOffice where he would serve for 30 years.\n  On Christmas Eve 2002, Deputy Dailey saved the life of a teenager \ntraveling in an SUV that collided head on with a cement mixing truck. \nDeputy Dailey, a number of fellow sheriffs, and two civilians emptied \nsix fire extinguishers in an attempt to quell a fire that threated to \nengulf the vehicle and the unresponsive driver. Using only their bare \nhands and batons, the group managed to free the driver seconds before \nthe fire consumed the passenger compartment. The teen was able to thank \nhis rescuers 3 months later at the Harford County Sheriff's Office \nawards banquet.\n  Deputy Logsdon also served in the military before becoming a Harford \nCounty Sheriff. He was a member of the 115th Military Police Battalion \nand deployed to Iraq in 2003 with the Maryland National Guard.\n  Exactly 11 years before his death, Deputy Logsdon confronted a \nsuicidal man who was armed with a loaded shotgun. In a display of great \nbravery and at great risk to himself, Deputy Logsdon managed to talk \nthe man into surrendering his weapon. After the man was disarmed, \nDeputy Logsdon continued to help the man by transporting him to the \nhospital where he received medical care.\n  The deaths of Deputy Dailey and Deputy Logsdon represent a profound \nloss for the people of Maryland. In the days since the February 10 \nshooting, Marylanders across the State have responded with a \ngroundswell of support for the Dailey and Logsdon families, as well as \nthe Harford County Sheriff's office. I think that speaks to the \ncharacter of Marylanders and the esteem in which law enforcement \nofficers are held.\n  I would like to offer my most sincere thanks to other deputies who \nresponded to the call, the Abingdon and Joppa Magnolia Volunteer Fire \nDepartments, the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center, and \nUniversity of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Medical Center, all of whom \nadministered aide to both deputies. On behalf of my fellow U.S. \nSenators, I offer my deepest condolences to the Dailey and Logsdon \nfamilies as they navigate this difficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/senate-section/article/S1082-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1082-S1084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today, as I have every year since I \ncame to the Senate, in commemoration of Black History Month, to \nrecognize an individual who has made a considerable contribution to \nsociety and the African-American community.\n  Today, we honor the Reverend Dr. W. Wilson Goode, Sr., a trailblazing \nfigure whose public service and private works have touched lives in \nPennsylvania and around the country. Dr. Goode was born to tenant \nfarmers in North Carolina, rose to become the first African-American \nmayor of Philadelphia, and now runs a nationally renowned organization \ncalled Amachi that mentors children whose parents have been \nincarcerated. Wilson Goode's story is a story of faith and perseverance \nand also provides an appropriate backdrop this Black History Month to \ntalk about some of the barriers standing in the way of young people in \nthis country today.\n  Dr. Goode has dedicated his life after leaving elected public office \nto Amachi because, in his words, in these communities, ``the children \nwere invisible.'' This ethos--a commitment to serving those whom the \nBible calls ``the least of these''--has guided Dr. Goode's life and \ncareer since long before he helped organize Amachi. Empowering young \npeople to achieve their potential is personal for Dr. Goode, who had to \novercome a series of roadblocks himself growing up in the Jim Crow \nSouth.\n  Dr. Goode went to segregated lower schools in Northampton County, NC, \nand Greensville County, VA, before moving to Philadelphia at the age of \n16. He arrived in Philadelphia on the first Monday in January in 1954. \nThat same Monday 30 years later, this sharecroppers' son, who grew up \ndrinking from separate fountains and eating at separate counters, was \nsworn in as the first African-American mayor of Philadelphia. In the \nintervening years, Dr. Goode's career proved a testament to all that \ncan go right when young people are allowed a fair chance to succeed \nbased purely, as a great man once said, on the ``content of their \ncharacter.''\n  Dr. Goode graduated from John Bartram High School in Philadelphia in \n1957 and went on to earn a bachelor's degree from Morgan State \nUniversity, a master's degree from the University of Pennsylvania, and \na doctorate of ministry from Palmer Theological Seminary. He also \nserved as an officer in the U.S. Army for 2 years.\n  Along the way, Wilson Goode helped found the Black Political Forum, a \nPhiladelphia-based group that brought\n\n[[Page S1083]]\n\ntogether a coalition of Black community and business leaders to elect \nAfrican Americans to public office. The forum transformed the political \nlandscape in the city and Dr. Goode's career along with it.\n  Dr. Goode was later chosen as Pennsylvania's first Black member of \nthe Public Utilities Commission. In less than 6 months, he rose to \nbecome the first Black chairman of the PUC and soon thereafter was \nrecruited to become the managing director of the city of Philadelphia \nunder Mayor Bill Green in 1980. When Mayor Green did not seek \nreelection in 1983, Wilson Goode ran, won the election, and was sworn \nin as the first African-American mayor of Philadelphia on January 2, \n1984, exactly 30 years after he first set foot in the city.\n  During his two terms in office, Dr. Goode accomplished a great deal. \nHe worked to transform the city's skyline, helping businesses to grow \nand create jobs. He helped to level the playing field for minorities to \nwork in city government and minority-run businesses to win government \ncontracts. He created the Mayor's Commission on Literacy, which has now \nhelped over 550,000 Philadelphians get the skills they need to live \nproductive lives. He created the Philadelphia Anti-Graffiti Network, \nPAGN, and the Mural Arts Program, two pioneering programs to make \nPhiladelphia a nicer place to live and work.\n  And he always looked to help those who needed it most, whether \nthrough his consistent advocacy for AIDS support programming or through \nhis tireless efforts to reduce the number of homeless people living on \nthe streets. The latter goal still animates him today--he is the \nchairman and CEO of Self, Inc., a nonprofit dedicated to serving \nhomeless men and women.\n  Dr. Goode left the mayor's office after two terms in 1992, but his \ncommitment to public service remained. He went on to work as a Deputy \nAssistant Secretary of Education in the Clinton Administration. There, \nhe devoted himself to the task of improving our education system for 7 \nyears until a unique opportunity presented itself. John J. DiIulio, \nJr., President Bush's first director of the White House Office of \nFaith-Based and Community Initiatives, invited Dr. Goode to lead a \nmentoring organization that would later be called Amachi.\n  Amachi's model, which is based on DiIulio's research, is quite \nsimple: identify neighborhoods disproportionately impacted by \nincarceration and seek out children living in those neighborhoods to \nmentor. Amachi matches one mentor and one child for at least 1 hour, at \nleast once a week, for at least 1 year. The goals are equally simple: \nit is a success if, after a year, the kids improve their school \nattendance, their grades, their behavior, and their relationships with \nthe adults in their lives.\n  Part of the reason for Amachi's success is its simplicity. It makes \nsense. The real power of the Amachi philosophy comes from its inherent \nrecognition of how much young people can achieve with a consistently \npositive and loving mentoring presence in their lives. And young people \ngrowing up in communities impacted by over-incarceration, the invisible \nchildren that Dr. Goode takes the time to see, stand to benefit most.\n  Amachi now receives Federal, State, and private funding, but it has \nmodest roots. To find the first mentors, Dr. Goode walked around \nthroughout Philadelphia, neighborhood by neighborhood, to community \nchurches where he would recite neighborhood statistics on incarceration \nto local pastors. The terrible reality was that one in nine Black \nchildren has a parent in prison, compared to 1 in 57 white children--\none in nine. People of faith were interested in mentoring because two \nout of three families with an incarcerated member are unable to meet \ntheir basic needs and since 50 percent of the over 2.5 million children \nwith an incarcerated parent in this country are age 9 or younger.\n  These numbers motivated Wilson Goode to recruit his mentors and to \ntravel to prisons seeking parents whose kids he could help. This is \nwhat he means when he says he is ``on a rescue mission.'' Standing in \nfront of these prisoners, his message was simple: ``I am here on behalf \nof your children.''\n  And they believed him. He recruited 500 children his first year. \nMaybe they believed him in part because he could relate to these \nchallenges--his own father was sent to prison when he was a teenager. \nHis mother worked hard to make ends meet while Wilson Goode sought \nrefuge in his church and in God. He found it, and now he works to \nprovide the same refuge to young people in need.\n  Doctor Goode's story perfectly embodies the idea of Amachi. Amachi is \na West African word that means: ``who knows but what God has brought us \nthrough this child.'' Who knew that Dr. Goode, who grew up without \nelectricity, who saw his father imprisoned in his adolescence, who \ngazed up at the leadership in his city and saw no one who looked like \nhim, would be elected mayor of one of America's largest cities. ``Who \nknows but what God has brought us through this child.'' I have often \nsaid that every child is born with a light inside them, and it is our \nobligation to make sure that that light burns as brightly as the full \nmeasure of his or her potential. Dr. Goode's work with Amachi is a \ntestament to this idea.\n  But as we commemorate Black History Month, we must acknowledge that \nreality is unkind to this worthy aspiration for all our children: in \nthis country, nearly half of Black men are arrested by the time they \nhit their mid-20s, and Black men are six times more likely to be \nincarcerated than White men, a worse disparity than in the 1960s. This \nmeans that the bright shining light of potential for an African-\nAmerican child is too often extinguished by the darkness of a jail \ncell.\n  Looking at the system can be abstract and overwhelming--it is hard to \nsee a child's potential from 30,000 feet. So Dr. Goode works on the \nground--because he knows we have to break this cycle. Today Amachi-\nmodeled programs have helped over 300,000 children in more than 250 \ncities nationwide. Maybe this is what Dr. King meant when he talked \nabout ``dangerous unselfishness.'' Dr. Goode is up against an abstract \nand overwhelming system, but wields from the goodness of his heart the \npower to disrupt the status quo.\n  Dr. Goode has faith that, in the months and years to come, we will \nsee our criminal justice system reshaped to be fairer and more \neffective in targeting the people who pose the most danger to society. \nHe has faith that we will make progress in helping those released from \nprison more easily reintegrate into their communities. But as he often \nsays, ``no entry is the best reentry plan.'' So his work continues.\n  Every day Amachi-trained mentors work to help thousands of children \novercome the wide variety of challenges related to having a parent in \nprison or living in an area with a high rate of incarceration. In \naddition to the common financial struggles, these kids need help \nnavigating the relationship changes that often take place when a loved \none is sent to or returns from prison; or channeling powerful and \nconfusing emotions into constructive activities; or overcoming the \nstigma that comes with having an incarcerated parent. What began as a \nlocal partnership between faith-based organizations has expanded to \ninclude volunteer mentors from a variety of sources on a national \nscale.\n  All of this can be traced to Dr. Goode's deeply held belief that God \nhas a very special interest in how we treat our children and that \nhelping the children who need it most is God's work. His conviction has \nearned him great acclaim, whether through receiving the Civic Ventures \nPurpose Prize, the Philadelphia Inquirer's Citizen of the Year Award, \nor being honored by the White House as a Champion of Change.\n  But I imagine the biggest reward for Dr. Goode is knowing he has \ncreated something lasting that will benefit generations to come. There \nare more than 81,000 children with a parent in prison in Pennsylvania. \nHow many future doctors, lawyers or CEOs, preachers, teachers or \nPresidents may be among these children? They have infinite potential, \nand with God in his heart, the Reverend Dr. W. Wilson Goode, Sr., has \nstood alongside them.\n  On the Senate floor today, we express our profound gratitude for his \nservice on behalf of the children of Philadelphia, our Commonwealth and \nour country.\n  Thank you.\n\n[[Page S1084]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/senate-section/article/S1084-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                        50TH ANNIVERSARY OF NCIS\n\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, today I ask the Senate to join me in \nhonoring the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, or NCIS, as it \ncelebrates 50 years of service in support of the Department of the \nNavy, its military and civilian personnel, their families, and the \ncommunities in which they live. I am proud to add my voice to those who \napplaud the consistent and effectual work of this elite organization.\n  NCIS has deep roots in our military history, dating back to 1882, \nwhen Secretary of the Navy William H. Hunt established the Office of \nNaval Intelligence, or ONI, to collect technical information on the \nworld's major naval powers. Since that time, as the United States' role \nin the world evolved, the need for an elite and specialized \ninvestigative branch of ONI became apparent. The Naval Investigative \nService, now called NCIS, was born and has fulfilled a vital role in \nmitigating threats and protecting our Nation.\n  Since then, NCIS has played a vital role in investigating and \ndefeating threats to safety of our Navy and Marine Corps. The \norganization has grown to employ approximately 2,000 elite personnel \nand deploys to more than 150 locations around the globe. As such, the \norganization's broad, yet agile scope has enabled it to ensure the \nsafety of our brave men and women, wherever they are stationed. Their \nmissions have had such broad scope as deployment of special agents to \nVietnam, response to the USS Cole and the September 11 terror attacks, \nand establishment of the Multiple Threat Alert Center for the \nDepartment of the Navy. NCIS has executed their duties with distinction \nand poise under the most strenuous circumstances.\n  I congratulate NCIS on 50 years of success as a premier Federal law \nenforcement agency. We owe them a debt of gratitude for the elite work \nthey perform in service to our Nation, and I wish them continued \nsuccess for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/senate-section/article/S1084-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         RECOGNIZING THE NATIONAL FOOD AND BEVERAGE FOUNDATION\n\n Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, today I am honored to acknowledge \nthe National Food and Beverage Foundation, an institute based in New \nOrleans and one that portrays the distinctive culture of Louisiana \nthrough its food and drink.\n  Louisiana is known for many things: its bald cypress swamps, Mardi \nGras, and its delicious food. Louisiana's cuisine is as unique as the \npeople who make it. From beignets to etouffee and jambalaya to gumbo, \nfood is one of the many characteristics that make Louisiana culture so \nremarkable. The New Orleans branch of the National Food and Beverage \nFoundation, or NFBF celebrates that culture through education and is \nhome to the Southern Food and Beverage Museum, praised by CNN as one of \nthe top 11 food museums in the entire world.\n  The National Food and Beverage Foundation is a tremendous example of \na group of people using culinary practices to highlight Louisiana's \nculture while simultaneously enhancing the lives of the people around \nthem. The NFBF has dedicated $5 million for a project to develop one of \nNew Orleans' communities. The project is designed to reestablish \nsections of New Orleans as a hub of culinary commerce and aid the \ncommunity in reaching their economic potential. NFBF is also dedicated \nto education, as evidenced by the John & Bonnie Hospitality and \nCulinary Library, and to providing free cooking classes for children. \nThe library contains over 17,000 volumes and houses culinary and \nmixology literature from across the globe. The foundation's Culinary \nEntrepreneurship Program, a program that aids small businesses, \nrestaurant startups, and product manufacturers, helps young businesses \nget off the ground. This program and programs like them are invaluable \nto small businesses throughout Louisiana.\n  The National Food and Beverage Foundation celebrates and encourages \nLouisiana culture, but it also celebrates cultures through cuisine \nnationwide. The NFBF is rapidly expanding across the country; Pacific \nFood and Beverage is based in Los Angeles and celebrates the culture of \nfood and drink of the Pacific coast and the American West. \nSpecifically, Pacific Food and Beverage focuses on contributions made \nby immigrants who have shaped our Nation's cuisine. Knowing firsthand \nhow important food is to our culture, the preservation of culinary \npractices and history throughout our country is a crucial endeavor.\n  I want to thank the National Food and Beverage Foundation for all the \nwork it has done with communities in my State and throughout the Nation \nto preserve and enhance the idea of culture through culinary means. \nFrom free children's cooking classes that teach the heritage and \nnutritional aspects of healthy food, to the Culinary Entrepreneurship \nProgram, NFBF has made a tremendous contribution to Louisiana and the \nculture loved by so many. I am proud to have such a tremendous \ninitiative in my State, one that explores something so embedded in the \nLouisiana culture and gives back to the community while doing so. I \nwish the National Food and Beverage Foundation nothing but successes \nnow and in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/senate-section/article/S1084-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO DR.

Mr. President, I wish to honor two remarkable women, \nDr. Connie Adler and Elizabeth Ward Saxl, who are new inductees to the \nMaine Women's Hall of Fame. Through their induction, we celebrate the \ntremendous impact that these women have on their communities and on \nwomen throughout the State of Maine.\n  Dr. Connie Adler, from Woolwich, ME, currently serves as secretary of \nthe board of directors of Franklin Memorial Hospital in Farmington, as \nwell as on the boards of the Maine Health Access Foundation and Maine \nFamily Planning. During her illustrious career, she has played a \nleading role in the pursuit of reproductive rights and the prevention \nof domestic violence. She has also established programs to increase \naccess to health care for women living in rural and impoverished areas. \nConnie's work has been integral to keeping our communities healthy and \nsafe.\n  Elizabeth Ward Saxl, from Vassalboro, ME, has served as the executive \ndirector of the Maine Coalition Against Sexual Assault for the last 16 \nyears. She is a passionate advocate for joining public policy solutions \nwith community-based approaches that address the complex problems \nimpacting Maine's women and girls. Undertaking daunting projects like \neliminating statute of limitations on child sexual abuse and creating \nhousing protections for victims of sexual assault, Elizabeth has been a \nchampion of abuse victims across the State. Her work also extends to \nimmigrant, refugee, elder, and native populations, making her a \nvaluable asset to all of Maine's marginalized populations.\n  Congratulations to both Connie and Elizabeth for their induction into \nthe Maine Women's Hall of Fame. With this well-deserved honor, they \njoin the likes of Senator Margaret Chase Smith as shining examples of \ncharacter and fortitude. I thank Connie and Elizabeth for all that they \nhave done for Maine women and for our State as a whole.

Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the 75th \nanniversary of Atlantic Regional Federal Credit Union. This nonprofit \ninstitution has a long history of serving the people of Maine, and I am \nproud to add my voice to those in our grateful State in recognizing \nthis milestone.\n  In 1941, Atlantic Regional Federal Credit Union began as St. John's \nFCU, with just 37 members, in the town of Brunswick. Strong leadership \nand steadfast dedication to community service has enabled it to become \none of the largest credit unions in our State and a bedrock of a \nthriving Maine midcoast. This truly impressive and steady growth was \nonly possible through a tireless commitment to good service and sound \nbusiness ethics.\n  Through fundraising, scholarships, donations, and volunteering, \nAtlantic\n\n[[Page S1085]]\n\nRegional has promoted the education, health, and wellness of the \ncommunities in which it serves. Perhaps most notably, they have \nundertaken a campaign against hunger by raising funds to donate to \nlocal hunger prevention programs. Through the Atlantic Regional Ending \nHunger Campaign and Maine CU's Ending Hunger initiative, Atlantic \nRegional has been at the forefront of an effort that has raised over \n$5.3 million to help end hunger in Maine. It is through actions like \nthese that Atlantic Regional Federal Credit Union has developed a \nmeaningful connection with its members and the greater community.\n  I extend my congratulations to the Atlantic Regional Federal Credit \nUnion, its employees, its members, and I wish them many years of \nsuccess to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/29/senate-section/article/S1085-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO LACHLAN FORRESTER\n\n Mr. THUNE.

and\n       (2) President Obama called for a ``prompt, impartial, and \n     transparent'' investigation into the murder of Dr. Nemtsov;\n\n       Whereas on March 1, 2015, tens of thousands of people \n     marched through central Moscow in remembrance of Dr. Nemtsov;\n       Whereas the Russian courts and the Investigative Committee \n     of the Russian Federation have consistently rejected requests \n     to qualify the murder of Dr. Nemtsov under Article 277 of the \n     Russian Criminal Code as ``an attempt on the life of a public \n     statesman'';\n       Whereas within 10 days of the murder of Dr. Nemtsov, \n     Chechen suspect Zaur Dadayev admitted to killing Dr. Nemtsov \n     at the behest of Ruslan Geremeyev, a senior officer in the \n     Sever Battalion of Chechnya;\n       Whereas on March 8, 2015, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov \n     called Zaur Dadayev a ``true patriot'';\n       Whereas on March 9, 2015, Mr. Kadryov was awarded the Order \n     of Honor by Russian President Vladimir Putin;\n       Whereas on January 20, 2016, Aleksandr Bastrykin, the chief \n     of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation \n     responsible for investigating the murder of Dr. Nemtsov, \n     declared that the case had been fully solved;\n       Whereas the Investigative Committee of the Russian \n     Federation charged only Ruslan Muhudinov, the driver of \n     Ruslan Geremeyev, with organizing the murder of Dr. Nemtsov;\n       Whereas on May 26, 2015, Russian opposition activist \n     Vladimir Kara-Murza, a close friend and colleague of Dr. \n     Nemtsov, was severely poisoned by an unknown assailant, \n     resulting in multiple organ failures and a coma;\n       Whereas on January 25, 2016, the daughter of Dr. Nemtsov, \n     Zhanna Nemtsova, appealed to the Parliamentary Assembly of \n     the Council of Europe to investigate the murder of her \n     father;\n       Whereas on February 1, 2016, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov \n     posted a video on Instagram that shows Russian opposition \n     leaders Mikhail Kasyanov and Vladimir Kara-Murza through the \n     crosshairs of a sniper rifle accompanied by the comment, \n     ``Those who did not understand, will understand'';

Res. 379\n\n       Whereas in 1776, people envisioned the United States as a \n     new nation dedicated to the proposition stated in the \n     Declaration of Independence that ``all men are created equal, \n     that they are endowed by their Creator with certain \n     unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and \n     the pursuit of Happiness . . .'';\n       Whereas Africans were first brought involuntarily to the \n     shores of America as early as the 17th century;\n       Whereas African Americans suffered enslavement and \n     subsequently faced the injustices of lynch mobs, segregation, \n     and denial of the basic and fundamental rights of \n     citizenship;\n       Whereas in 2016, the vestiges of those injustices and \n     inequalities remain evident in the society of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas in the face of injustices, people of good will and \n     of all races in the United States have distinguished \n     themselves with a commitment to the noble ideals on which the \n     United States was founded and have fought courageously for \n     the rights and freedom of African Americans and others;\n       Whereas African Americans, such as Lieutenant Colonel Allen \n     Allensworth, Maya Angelou, Arthur Ashe Jr., James Baldwin, \n     James Beckwourth, Clara Brown, Blanche Bruce, Ralph Bunche, \n     Shirley Chisholm, Holt Collier, Frederick Douglass, W.

Woodson and Jesse E. Moorland;\n       Whereas Black History Month, celebrated during the month of \n     February, originated in 1926 when Dr. Carter G. Woodson set \n     aside a special period in February to recognize the heritage \n     and achievement of Black people of the United States;\n       Whereas Dr. Carter G.

Res. 380\n\n       Whereas a rare disease or disorder is one that affects a \n     small number of patients and, in the United States, typically \n     fewer than 200,000 individuals annually are affected by a \n     rare disease or disorder;\n       Whereas, as of the date of approval of this resolution, \n     nearly 7,000 rare diseases affect approximately 30,000,000 \n     people in the United States and their families;\n       Whereas children with rare genetic diseases account for \n     about \\1/2\\ of the population affected by rare diseases in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas many rare diseases are serious and life-threatening \n     and lack an effective treatment;\n       Whereas, as a result of the Orphan Drug Act (Public Law 97-\n     414; 96 Stat. 2049), there have been important advances made \n     in the research of and treatment for rare diseases;\n       Whereas the Food and Drug Administration (in this preamble \n     referred to as the ``FDA'') has made great strides in \n     involving the patient in the drug review process as part of \n     the Patient-Focused Drug Development program, an initiative \n     that originated in the Food and Drug Administration Safety \n     and Innovation Act (Public Law 112-144; 126 Stat. 993);\n       Whereas, although approximately 500 drugs and biological \n     products for the treatment of rare diseases have been \n     approved by the FDA, millions of people in the United States \n     have a rare disease for which there is no such approved \n     treatment;\n       Whereas lack of access to effective treatments and \n     difficulty in obtaining reimbursement for life-altering, and \n     even life-saving, treatments still exist and remain \n     significant challenges for people with rare diseases and \n     their families;\n       Whereas rare diseases and conditions include epidermolysis \n     bullosa, progeria, sickle cell anemia, spinal muscular \n     atrophy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Tay-Sachs disease, \n     cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, many childhood cancers, \n     fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, Smith-Magenis \n     syndrome, Batten disease, and hemophilia;\n       Whereas people with rare diseases experience challenges \n     that include difficulty in obtaining accurate diagnoses, \n     limited treatment options, and difficulty finding physicians \n     or treatment centers with expertise in the rare diseases;\n       Whereas the rare disease community made significant \n     progress during the 113th Congress, including the passage of \n     the National Pediatric Research Network Act of 2013 (Public \n     Law 113-55; 127 Stat. 644), which calls special attention to \n     rare diseases and directs the National Institutes of Health \n     (in this preamble referred to as the ``NIH'') to facilitate \n     greater collaboration among researchers;\n       Whereas the rare disease community continued this progress \n     through the first session of the 114th Congress, including \n     the passage of the Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials Act of \n     2015 (Public Law 114-63; 129 Stat. 549) and through increased \n     funding for orphan products and rare disease research;\n       Whereas both the FDA and the NIH have established special \n     offices to advocate for rare disease research and treatments;\n       Whereas the National Organization for Rare Disorders (in \n     this preamble referred to as ``NORD''), a nonprofit \n     organization established in 1983 to provide services to and \n     advocate on behalf of patients with rare diseases, remains a \n     critical public voice for people with rare diseases;\n       Whereas 2016 marks the 33rd anniversary of the enactment of \n     the Orphan Drug Act and the establishment of NORD;\n       Whereas NORD sponsors Rare Disease Day in the United States \n     and partners with many other major rare disease organizations \n     to increase public awareness of rare diseases;\n       Whereas Rare Disease Day is observed each year on the last \n     day of February;\n       Whereas Rare Disease Day is a global event, first observed \n     in the United States on February 28, 2009 and observed in \n     more than 80 countries in 2015;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Overdose Prevention Act''.\n\n     SEC. _02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, each day in the United States, more than 100 \n     people die from a drug overdose. Among people 25 to 64 years \n     old, drug overdose causes more deaths than motor vehicle \n     accidents.\n       (2) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports \n     that nearly 44,000 people in the United States died from a \n     drug overdose in 2013 alone. More than 80 percent of those \n     deaths were due to unintentional drug overdoses, and many \n     could have been prevented.\n       (3) Deaths resulting from unintentional drug overdoses \n     increased more than 300 percent between 1980 and 1998, and \n     more than tripled between 1999 and 2013.\n       (4) Nearly 92 percent of all unintentional poisoning deaths \n     are due to drugs. Since 1999, in the United States the \n     population of non-Hispanic Whites and the population of \n     Indians (as defined in section 4 of the Indian Self-\n     Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b)) \n     have seen the highest rates of unintentional drug poisoning \n     deaths.\n       (5) Opioid medications such as oxycodone and hydrocodone \n     were involved in nearly 46 percent of all unintentional drug \n     poisoning deaths in 2013.\n       (6) Unintentional drug poisoning deaths involving heroin \n     nearly tripled between 2010 and 2013 and were 23 percent of \n     all unintentional drug poisoning deaths in 2013.\n       (7) Between 1999 and 2010, opioid medication overdose \n     fatalities increased by more than 400 percent among women and \n     265 percent among men.\n       (8) Military veterans are at elevated risk of experiencing \n     a drug overdose. Veterans who served in Vietnam, Iraq, or \n     Afghanistan and who have combat injuries, posttraumatic \n     stress disorder, and other co-occurring mental health \n     diagnoses are at elevated risk of fatal drug overdose from \n     opioid medications.\n       (9) Rural and suburban regions are disproportionately \n     affected by opioid medication and heroin overdoses. From 2000 \n     through 2013, the age-adjusted rate for drug poisoning deaths \n     involving heroin has increased nearly 11-fold in the Midwest \n     region and more than 3-fold in the South region.\n       (10) Urban centers also continue to struggle with overdose, \n     which is the leading cause of death among homeless adults.\n       (11) In 2009 alone, estimated lost productivity and direct \n     medical costs from opioid medication poisonings exceeded \n     $20,000,000,000.\n       (12) Opioid medication poisonings cost health insurers an \n     estimated $72,000,000,000 annually in medical costs.\n       (13) Both fatal and nonfatal overdoses place a heavy burden \n     on public health and public safety resources, yet there is no \n     coordinated cross-Federal agency response to prevent overdose \n     fatalities.\n       (14) Naloxone is a medication that rapidly reverses \n     overdose from heroin and opioid medications.\n       (15) Naloxone has no pharmacological effect if administered \n     to a person who has not taken opioids and has no potential \n     for abuse. Naloxone provides additional time to obtain \n     necessary medical assistance during an overdose.\n       (16) Lawmakers in Arkansas, California, Colorado, \n     Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, \n     Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, \n     Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New \n     York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, \n     Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, \n     Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and the \n     District of Columbia have removed legal impediments to \n     increasing naloxone prescription and its use by bystanders \n     who are in a position to respond to an overdose.\n       (17) The American Medical Association and the American \n     Public Health Association support further implementation of \n     community-based programs that offer naloxone and other opioid \n     overdose prevention services.\n       (18) Community-based overdose prevention programs have \n     successfully prevented deaths from opioid overdoses by making \n     rescue training and naloxone available to first responders, \n     parents, and other bystanders who may encounter an overdose. \n     A study funded by the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention of community-based overdose prevention programs \n     provided by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health \n     found that communities with access to overdose prevention \n     programs experienced lower mortality rates from opioid \n     overdoses than communities that did not have access to \n     overdose prevention programs during the study period.\n       (19) Over 150,000 potential bystanders have been trained by \n     overdose prevention programs in the United States. A Centers \n     for Disease Control and Prevention report credits overdose \n     prevention programs with reversing more than 26,000 overdoses \n     since 1996.\n       (20) At least 188 local overdose prevention programs are \n     operating in the United States, including in major cities \n     such as Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, \n     Boston, San Francisco, and Philadelphia, and statewide in New \n     Mexico, Massachusetts, and New York. Between December 2007 \n     and March 2014, overdose prevention programs facilitated by \n     the Massachusetts Department of Public Health trained more \n     than 22,500 people who reported more than 2,655 rescues. \n     Since 2004, a program administered by the Baltimore City \n     Health Department has trained more than 11,000 people who \n     reported more than 220 rescues. Project Lazarus, an overdose \n     prevention program in Wilkes County, North Carolina, reduced \n     overdose deaths 69 percent between 2009 and 2011.\n       (21) In Illinois, the Department of Human Services, \n     Division of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse has enrolled over \n     20 drug overdose prevention programs with over 100 designated \n     sites across Illinois targeting multiple service populations. \n     These enrollees include police departments, county health \n     departments, medical facilities, licensed substance abuse \n     treatment programs, and community organizations. Statewide, \n     over 2,000 police officers and more than 600 others have been \n     trained thus far. The DuPage County Illinois Health \n     Department has trained over 1,200 police officers and has \n     reported 34 overdose reversals in 2014 alone.\n       (22) The Office of National Drug Control Policy supports \n     equipping first responders to help reverse overdoses. Police \n     officers on patrol in Quincy, Massachusetts, have conducted \n     300 overdose rescues with naloxone since 2011. The police \n     department has reported a 95-percent success rate with \n     overdose rescue attempts by police officers. In Suffolk \n     County, New York, police officers have saved more than 563 \n     lives with naloxone in 2013 alone.\n       (23) Research shows that the cost per year of life gained \n     by making naloxone available to reverse overdoses is within \n     the range of what people in the United States usually pay for \n     health treatments.\n       (24) Prompt administration of naloxone and provision of \n     emergency care by a bystander can reduce health complications \n     and health care costs that arise when a person is deprived of \n     oxygen for an extended period of time.\n       (25) Overdose prevention programs are needed in \n     correctional facilities, addiction treatment programs, and \n     other places where people are at higher risk of overdosing \n     after a period of abstinence.\n       (26) Timely, drug-specific fatal and nonfatal surveillance \n     data at the local, State, and regional level is critically \n     needed to target prevention efforts.\n       (27) People affected by drug overdose gather on August 31 \n     of each year in communities nationwide for Overdose Awareness \n     Day, to mourn and pay tribute to loved ones and\n\n[[Page S1091]]\n\n     raise awareness about overdose risk and prevention.\n\n     SEC. _03.

Mr. President, tonight the Senate voted to turn its \nattention to the issue of opioid addiction. Clearly, what we know now \nis that opioid addiction has carved a path of destruction across \nAmerica--a path of destruction from Medford, OR, to Manchester, NH.\n  During a number of community forums I held across my State just a few \ndays ago, we talked about how we are going to grapple with this great \nchallenge and what it is going to take to really turn the problem \naround.\n  My home State has the dubious distinction of ranking fourth worst for \nabuse and misuse of opioids in America. In my State, citizens made it \nvery clear: They are not going to accept being fourth worst.\n  I know from talking with many of my colleagues that a whole host of \nStates are dealing with this challenge, and what I have been struck by \nis how opioid addiction keeps manifesting itself in ways we certainly \nwouldn't have known about even 10 or 15 years ago.\n  At home in Oregon, I was particularly struck with parents who told me \nabout high school athletes struggling with addiction to opioids. When I \nplayed basketball, dreaming of playing in the NBA, there was never any \ntalk in the locker room about opioids. Now the next generation of young \nathletes seems to be getting caught up in this. If they have an injury, \nyoung people get down when they are not able to play sports. They get \ndepressed. Maybe they go to a party. Maybe it starts with some alcohol. \nMaybe it starts with a prescription. But all of a sudden, it mushrooms \nand grows. This is what parents were telling me at home, and it is \nclear that Congress cannot sit on the side lines while the opioid \naddiction problem continues to mushroom.\n  In the coming years, Medicare and Medicaid are expected to account \nfor over a third of substance abuse-related spending. We are talking \nabout billions of dollars each year. As the ranking member of the \nSenate Finance Committee, which is required to pay for these bedrock \nhealth programs, I want to talk just for a little bit tonight about the \ncritical role these programs are going to play in stemming the tide of \nopioid abuse.\n  I would like to begin by saying that it is my view that the American \npeople are paying for a distorted set of priorities. Our people are \ngetting hooked on opioids, there is not enough treatment, and vigorous \nenforcement is falling short. That, in my view, is a trifecta of \nmisplaced priorities. And while it is not all going to be done this \nweek, beginning this week the Congress has the opportunity to develop \nfresh policies that will begin to right the ship.\n  Last week the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing to discuss the \nopioid crisis. As I listened to the debate, there was a sense that \npolicymakers are sort of lined up to choose between two sides. One is \ntough enforcement, which means cracking down on pill mills, fraudsters \nbilking Medicare and Medicaid with unneeded prescriptions, and \nunscrupulous abusers who doctor shop for their next bottle of pills. \nThen there is another side that believes there should be more focus on \nsocial services. My own view is that what is needed is a better \napproach that includes three priorities: more prevention, better \ntreatment, and, yes, tougher enforcement. True success is going to \nrequire that all three work in tandem.\n\n  When it comes to preventing addiction, any discussion has to include \nhow these drugs are prescribed in the first place. I have come to feel, \nas I got around Oregon and I listened to the testimony in the Finance \nCommittee here recently, what has happened is America, for the last 15 \nor so years, has been on a prescription pendulum, where doctors were \nonce criticized for not treating pain aggressively enough, today they \nseem to be criticized for prescribing too many opioids to manage pain.\n  In my view, our challenge is to work on a bipartisan basis to get \nthis balance right. Of course we want our people to have an opportunity \nfor science-based pain management, and we also don't want \nindiscriminate prescribing of opioids. It is about getting the balance \nright with respect to this prescription pendulum that our country has \nbeen on for the last 15 or 20 years.\n  I am pleased the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is \nbreaking new ground with their guidelines for prescribing opioids. If \nsuccessful, I believe they could provide a meaningful reduction in \noverprescribing. I have also been concerned about the influence opioid \nmanufacturers have on prescribing practices. So I have sent to the \nranking Democrat on the Finance Committee an inquiry to Secretary \nBurwell to ensure that any potential conflicts of interest have been \nproperly disclosed for members of government panels who are evaluating \nthe Centers for Disease Control guidelines as a result of funding they \nreceive from drug manufacturers.\n  Our physicians ought to have the best information on prescribing \nthese powerful drugs without undue influence from the companies that \nare manufacturing. In my view, a key piece of solving the opioid \naddiction puzzle has to be prompt and effective treatment of those who \nare dealing with an addiction to opioids.\n  The Finance Committee had three witnesses last week: a witness who \nwas chosen by our distinguished chairman, Senator Hatch, a witness I \nchose, and an expert who was well thought of by all sides. The question \nwas, How do you solve this opioid addiction challenge if you just \nrestrict access to opioids?\n  I personally believe that kind of enforcement regime should be part \nof a solution, and I support that, but if all you do is restrict access \nto opioids, each of these experts--the one chosen by Chairman Hatch, \nthe one I chose, independent expert, all of them said if all you do is \nrestrict access to opioids, the addiction does not go away. The \naddiction doesn't just magically disappear.\n  I hope we can emphasize this as the Senate begins our debate. Any \nlasting solution is going to have to have enforcement, which this bill \nfocuses on, but it is also going to have to have treatment and \nprevention. We are going to have to improve access to addiction \ntreatment and mental health services.\n  I know the distinguished President of the Senate, like my State, has \na lot of rural communities, and it is going to be particularly \nimportant to ensure that they are served. I think the distinguished \nPresident of the Senate knows it is not a surprise that some of the \nrural communities have some of the highest rates of abuse and opiate \noverdose in the country.\n  Mental health treatment for addiction certainly has gotten short \nshrift for too long. It is too important to have that kind of policy, \nand it is high time for a change. For example, Congress ought to also \nbe taking a look at what is called the IMD exclusion, an out-of-date \npolicy from the 1960s that says services like rehab or some emergency \nmental health stay in an inpatient setting can't be covered by \nMedicaid. That is a big policy change. I think it is important that we \ndebate it, and I think we all understand finding the vast sums needed \nfor those services would be a unique challenge.\n  Like so many other important issues, at the end of the day, this \nrequires that our Congress make some tough choices. Yet if prevention \nand treatment are not locked in upfront, we ought to realize that if \nthose are our choices, to not give adequate emphasis to prevention and \ntreatment, the overall bill is going to come in even higher--pregnant \nmothers giving birth to opioid-dependent babies, EMTs and emergency \nrooms dealing with overdose calls every night, county jails taking the \nplace of needed substance abuse treatment, able-bodied adults in the \nstreets instead of working in the private sector at a family wage job. \nAmerica's tax dollars ought to be spent more wisely. So as we begin \nthis debate, we begin\n\n[[Page S1104]]\n\nthe debate by tackling the opioid scourge that has carved the path of \ndestruction, a path of destruction from one end of the country to \nanother.\n  The Senate has to find the right mix between prevention, treatment, \nand enforcement. It is going to be that kind of strategy, a fresh \nstrategy where prevention, treatment, and enforcement work in tandem. \nThat is going make a real difference for our families and our \ncommunities struggling to heal.\n  I hope those who may have followed this speech will recognize that I \nhaven't talked about Democrats and Republicans. I have been talking \nabout a set of approaches we can all work on together. In fact, all \nthree of the witnesses who were before the Finance Committee made it \nclear that you had to have those three approaches--prevention, \ntreatment, and enforcement--work in tandem if you want to solve the \nproblem.\n  I think it is important Democrats and Republicans recognize what \nthose experts and others have said is going to be necessary to help our \nfamilies and communities across this country heal. We can do it in a \nbipartisan fashion. I am committed to working in just that manner.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
