Mr. President, the pundits told us it would never \nhappen. Republicans and Democrats will never agree on a way to replace \nNo Child Left Behind, they said. But a new Senate that is back to work \nis proving them wrong. We are poised to pass bipartisan legislation \nthat will replace an education law that no longer works with \nsignificant education reforms that will work.\n  It is a bipartisan bill that would take decisionmaking power away \nfrom distant Federal bureaucrats and empower parents, teachers, States, \nand school boards instead. It is a bipartisan bill that would end the \npractice of States being coerced into adopting measures such as Common \nCore. It is a bipartisan bill that would substitute one-size-fits-all \nWashington mandates for greater State and local flexibility.\n  Because the needs of a student in Kentucky aren't likely to be the \nsame as the needs of a student in Montana or California, this is a bill \nthat would clear the way for educational standards and programs to be \ndesigned with the needs of local students in mind. In short, the Every \nChild Achieves Act is aimed at helping students succeed instead of \nhelping Washington grow.\n  I urge colleagues to join me in passing it soon. That would be a big \nachievement for our kids, and it would be another reminder of what is \npossible in a Senate that is back to work for the American people.\n  After all, what did our constituents see in this debate? They saw \nSenators they sent to Washington, regardless of party, having their \nvoices heard. They saw Senators working across the aisle. They saw \nSenators of both parties offering amendment after amendment and then \nvoting to adopt many of them.\n  On this bill alone, the new Senate has already taken rollcall votes \non 17 amendments. We expect to take up to 6 more today. Just to put \nthat in perspective, the new Senate will have taken more amendment \nrollcall votes on this single bill alone than the old Senate took all \nof last year on all bills combined. That is something we should all \nwant to celebrate because it means the voices of the American people \nare being heard again here in the Senate.\n  So I want to thank the senior Senators from Tennessee and Washington \nfor all of their hard work on this bill. Their continued dedication \nhelped to lead us to the point where we are today.\n  I also want to acknowledge the efforts of the House of \nRepresentatives on this issue. The Republican-led House passed \nlegislation to address this issue the past few years, but the old \nSenate did not act. This year the Senate, under new management, is \npoised to finally do its job. We look forward to going to conference \nwith the House on this issue.\n  But first, we must pass the bill before us. So let's keep the \nproductive momentum going. Let's pass this bill, and let's replace No \nChild Left Behind once and for all.\n  After all, we have already seen how States such as Kentucky have been \nable to achieve more success by obtaining just a limited amount of \nflexibility from the current law via conditional waivers. Just imagine \nwhat Kentucky and other States can achieve when fully empowered to do \nwhat is right for their students.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/16/senate-section/article/S5133-6", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I commend Senators Murray and Alexander for \ntheir good work on this education bill. But I want the record to be \nspread with this. The bill is passing this Congress because we have had \na constructive minority during this Congress.\n  Senator Harkin, who was chair of that committee, had indicated--and I \nsaid this on the Record last week--that on two separate occasions they \nreported the bill out of the education committee, but it was \nfilibustered and never got to the floor.\n  So I understand why my friend the Republican leader is beating his \nchest about how great the Senate works, because it does work if you \nhave a cooperative minority, and that is what we have done. We have \nworked very hard to try to get this done, and as a result of our work \ntogether, we have been able to get it done. But please save everyone \nthe lack of history. My friend keeps bringing up: Boy, the Senate is \nworking so well. It is very cynical what my friends did in stopping \neverything for the last 4 years. They stopped everything. Hundreds of \ntimes they stopped bills from moving to the floor. So my friend comes \nto the floor and says: Oh man, things are working so great now. Isn't \nit great the Senate is working?\n  Cynical as it was, the Republicans had a plan, and that was to oppose \neverything. We had a Democratic President, we had a Democratic Senate, \nand if they opposed everything, it would work out great for them, and \nit did. It wasn't good for the country, but they are now in the \nmajority. Now, how long they stay there remains to be seen.\n  If you look at the poll numbers about how well my friend is doing, \nthe Republican leader is not doing very well, with the lowest numbers \nsince they started doing polling on leaders--Democratic or Republican \nleaders.\n  So we will continue to cooperate when we can. The highway bill is \ncoming up, and I hope we can work together to get something done on \nthat. It is something that is long overdue. We have tried to get that \ndone in the past, but we had Republican objections on everything we \ntried.\n  We have had 33 short-term extensions on the highway bill--33. We used \nto do them as a matter of routine every 5 years. But that isn't the way \nit is any longer. But we are going to cooperate as much as we can on \nthe highway bill and everything else.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/16/senate-section/article/S5134-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXPORT-IMPORT BANK\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, prior to leaving the floor, I want to talk \nabout another subject that is extremely important.\n  One of the sad things that has happened the last few months is that \nRepublicans have brought to a standstill--and that is even an \nunderstatement to say that--the Export-Import Bank. It is now gone. \nLegislation was not passed. So something we have always done in the \npast routinely--reauthorized this bill--we have not done so this time. \nThe Republicans have stopped it. It is gone. The Export-Import Bank is \ngone.\n  Our ability to sell to other countries our products has been \nseriously overwhelmed. It is so sad. And it really is sad. Other \ncountries have these export-import banks. There is some mindset from my \nRepublican friends that we can't do anything that government is \ninvolved in. But if we are going to be competitive in the world, we \nhave to have a program such as the Export-Import Bank. It has been \naround for a long time and has been very successful. If we don't do \nthis, for example, the airplanes we build in the State of Washington \nwill actually come to a screeching halt. They can sell to America but \nnot to other countries.\n  Now, am I making all this up? No. In fact, other countries have these \nbanks. Is it one or two countries? No, it is scores of countries--\nscores of countries. I will take a minute or two to read the names of \nthe countries that have working export-import banks to help their \nbusinesses and workers compete globally: Argentina, Australia, Austria, \nBangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, \nColombia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, \nFrance, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, \nJapan, Jordan, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, \nNorway, Oman, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, \nSouth Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, \nTurkey, United Kingdom, Uzbekistan.\n  Every one of these countries has a working export-import bank. Why do \nthey have them? Because they want to be competitive. Whatever they are \nable to sell to a foreign country--whether a bag of wheat or some kind \nof product they manufacture--they want to be able to help their local \nbusinesses sell to foreign countries--but not the United States. And we \nare really hurting.\n  I can't imagine--I can't imagine--how the Republicans, whose support \nfor business-oriented operations--we thought over the years their \ninterest was in helping business--has just turned a blind eye. They are \nnot interested in helping business any more. Why? Because these working \nExport-Import Banks are government operations. Does it cost the Federal \nGovernment of the United States money? Of course not. We have received \n$7 billion back in rewards that goes to our Treasury. We make money on \nthe deal.\n\n  So I would say to my friend who believes the Senate is working well, \nI wish somebody would say to my Republican friends, you know, every \nsmall business organization supports the Export-Import Bank. The \nchamber of commerce is not an organization that is out beating the \ndrums for Democrats, but they are running ads all over America saying: \nRepublicans, do something about this. Huge companies like Boeing--there \nare hundreds of thousands of jobs at Boeing--are dependent on being \nable to export those big airplanes.\n  As a result of Republicans' nonaction and not reauthorizing this \nimportant piece of legislation--before this collapse of the Bank took \nplace, there were 165,000 Americans working in jobs related to the \nExport-Import Bank. I don't know how many there are today, but I \nguarantee there are not 165,000. Each day that goes by, others lose \ntheir jobs. Little companies from the State of Nevada are calling me \nand saying: We have to have this. We are going to go out of business.\n  The bad feeling my Republican friends have for anything dealing with \nthe government so that they do stuff like this--it is hard to explain \nto anybody why they would do something like this.\n  Every one of these countries has programs. I have read their names \ninto the Record. I think it is just a shame what has happened with this \nwonderful institution that is so good for creating jobs for America.\n  If the Presiding Officer would announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/16/senate-section/article/S5134-4", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to speak \nabout the bill that we have pending on the floor, a law that is long \npast due for reexamination and reauthorization, the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act.\n  This law was last updated in 2001 as the No Child Left Behind Act. \nFourteen years is far too long to go without updating the primary law \nfocused on an issue that is so important to the future of our country, \nensuring that children in New Hampshire and across this country receive \na high-quality education.\n  I am the mother of a 7-year-old and 10-year-old, and this could not \nbe a more important issue to me and to, I know, other mothers across \nthe country. Many parents, teachers, and school leaders in New \nHampshire have expressed to me their concerns about No Child Left \nBehind, and so it is past time for us to update and improve this law.\n  I believe education decisions are best made locally, including \ndecisions about school curriculum and how education dollars are spent. \nWhile its goals of accountability were very important and laudable, No \nChild Left Behind, unfortunately, imposed a one-size-fits-all regime on \nevery school in every State in this country.\n  No Child Left Behind imposed unworkable mandates and unreasonable \ngoals that led many schools in America to be labeled as failing, with \nno reasonable way to get off the failing list. Congress's inaction, up \nto this point has led to a system where the Federal Secretary of \nEducation can dictate to States what priorities they must set in order \nto receive a conditional waiver from parts of this law.\n  This Senate's bipartisan education reform bill, the Every Child \nAchieves Act that is on the floor right now, would return \ndecisionmaking on education to where it belongs, back to States, local \nschools, teachers, and parents.\n  I wish to thank Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray of the \nHELP Committee for conducting an open debate on this critically \nimportant legislation and working together. I am encouraged that \nRepublicans and Democrats worked together and overcame disagreements to \nmove this important legislation forward. That is how the Senate should \nwork and that is what the American people deserve from their elected \nrepresentatives.\n  Like all Granite Staters, I want children in our State and across our \ncountry to have even better opportunities than our generation has had, \nand the foundation for future success starts with a quality education. \nEvery parent knows that, and that is why this is such an important \ntopic that we have been debating on this floor.\n  Granite Staters have shared with me some of the biggest challenges \nfacing our students because of No Child Left Behind, and the Every \nChild Achieves Act seeks to address them. For example, as I mentioned, \nNo Child Left Behind created a one-size-fits-all system that ignored \ndifferences between different parts of the country and primarily used \ntests as the measure of accountability at the expense of other \nimportant measures of success, such as student progress, attendance and \ngraduation rates, parent and teacher engagement, among others.\n  We have seen what happened under this law over the last decade. \nSchools are overtesting and educators are teaching for the test as \nopposed to making sure our children really learn the topic matter. That \nis not how we should be educating our young people. We want to make \nsure they have a firm understanding of the concepts they are learning \nin school.\n  The Every Child Achieves Act restores these powers to the States. It \nmakes sure States have the flexibility they need to develop their own \nways to test and measure accountability. I know from our local \ncommunities and our local school boards that they are focused every \nsingle day in their own communities on making sure their communities \nare delivering the best quality education and understand the geography \nand the different challenges facing their communities, and it is \nimportant we restore that decisionmaking to them.\n  This bill will let States decide how to measure student achievement \nand school success within their own borders. What might be right and \nwork for North Dakota may not be the right approach for a State like \nNew Hampshire, and so this allows each State and locality to engage on \nwhat is best for the State.\n  The Every Child Achieves Act also prohibits Washington from mandating \nor incentivizing any States to adopt any particular curriculum \nstandards, such as common core. This is an issue many of my \nconstituents have raised with me, and so this bill will, again, restore \nthis decisionmaking to the States and the parents and teachers. In \ndoing so, this bill reaffirms that it should be the State, not the \nFederal Government, that determines education standards. Each State is \ndifferent and uniquely situated to determine the curriculum and \naccountability measures that best fit the needs of their students \nwithout interference from Washington. We don't need the Washington-\nknows-best attitude. We know the best decisions are made locally.\n  This bill includes additional reforms that will help strengthen our \neducation system and better prepare our young\n\n[[Page S5136]]\n\npeople to join the rapidly changing and competitive global 21st century \nworkforce. It ensures parents can still have access to data about their \nState, district, and school's education performance so they can make \ninformed decisions about their child's education. It increases support \nfor high-quality charter schools, giving parents greater choice to \ndetermine the best learning environment for their children. It creates \nState-based need assessments to help identify low-performing schools \nand allows States, not the Federal Government, to determine how to best \nhelp low-performing schools.\n  All of these reforms are much needed, commonsense steps toward \nreforming and improving our education system, and I believe more can be \ndone to specifically help students in New Hampshire. That is why I \nappreciate the willingness of Senators Alexander and Murray to work \nwith me to allow votes on several bipartisan amendments that I have \nincluded in this bill, and I know this has been a very open process. \nThis is how the Senate should operate.\n  I was able to work across the aisle on a number of amendments that \naddressed New Hampshire's priorities. The first of those is \nstrengthening our mental health first aid training to ensure that \nschool personnel have the critical mental health first aid training \nthey need to improve the safety and well-being of students in schools \nin New Hampshire and across the country. This is something I have heard \nso much about from our local communities. That is why I was pleased to \nsee the Senate adopted my amendment on mental health awareness training \nprograms yesterday.\n\n  I wish to thank Senator Blumenthal for working with me to include \nthis important amendment that will help school personnel safely address \nmental health issues earlier, before they reach a crisis stage.\n  I know an issue I have heard so much about in New Hampshire about \nthat 21st century workforce is STEM education. When it comes to \ndeveloping the high-skilled workers we need to compete, we must ensure \nthat we have better STEM education in our schools for that next \ngeneration of American innovators. Promoting education initiatives and \njob training in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and \nmathematics is critical to ensuring that we stay on the cutting edge \nand that we ensure that our children have the skills they need to get \nthose good-paying jobs when they leave high school, postsecondary \neducation, and beyond with their college education.\n  Over the last few years, an effort to increase students' proficiency \nand close the education gap between the United States and other \ncountries has seen a renewed focus on STEM, and we have seen it in New \nHampshire as well. One of the issues I have seen a focus on which I \nthink is very important is including more women and girls in STEM \neducation.\n  At the college level, women are currently studying in the STEM fields \nat a lower rate than men, and many women who do earn STEM degrees \nactually end up working in other fields. Despite that fact, we are \nexpected to see a 20-percent increase in STEM jobs we are going to need \nto build that workforce. Yet women only make up 25 percent of the STEM \nworkforce. So we have a long way to go, and that is one of the reasons \nI worked with Senator Gillibrand on a measure to broaden student access \nto mentorship, tutoring, and afterschool activities to encourage \ninterest in and develop STEM skills. Our amendment was focused on \nencouraging States to explore ways to increase participation in STEM \nprograms by underrepresented groups, including girls, minority \nstudents, English learners, students with disabilities, and low-income \nstudents, so we can have a broad array of our students ready to take on \nthose jobs and the workforce we need to grow our economy.\n  Another area where we need to grow the economy in our country is in \nmanufacturing. We are seeing the beginnings of a manufacturing \nrenaissance. Last week, I was visiting a company in New Hampshire \ncalled Rapid Manufacturing in Nashua, NH. They have a partnership with \na local community college to train their workforce and to bring them \nright from the community college into Rapid Manufacturing. They have \nmore positions than they can fill right now. In fact, they are going \ninto the middle schools and high schools to get kids excited about \ncareer and technical education. We really need this, and the jobs are \nthere. I hear this from so many of our employers.\n  I was glad to work across the aisle on an important amendment that \ndid not get included but got quite a bit of support from Senator Kaine \nand gained support from Senators Portman, Capito, Graham, Boxer, \nWhitehouse, Casey, and Warner, and I wish to thank them.\n  This would create a pilot program in our middle schools to get our \nchildren excited about career and technical education for those \nadvanced manufacturing jobs where we need to grow our workforce. While \nI am disappointed this amendment was not included on this bill, I am \nencouraged that Senator Alexander said he would be open to working with \nus on this effort as a potential when we reauthorize the Perkins Act in \nthe future, which will deal with higher education.\n  In addition to the issues we see with workforce, STEM, and \nmanufacturing, unfortunately, an issue too many of our States are \ndealing with--and New Hampshire has been hit hard--is substance abuse. \nAs part of my ongoing efforts to combat the heroin and prescription \naddiction crisis in New Hampshire, I worked with Senator Manchin to put \nforth two measures to better assist students dealing with substance \nabuse issues at home. Our amendment would encourage local education \ndecisionmakers to provide professional development, training, and \ntechnical assistance to schools and communities that are affected by \nthe crisis of addiction, and this is something I know we are also going \nto address in an amendment I am supporting later today.\n  New Hampshire has been a leader in what is called competency-based \neducation. What that means is actually assessing students on measures \nother than tests. That is actually measuring students on innovative \nassessments and measures of accountability; for example, when students \nactually go out into their community and have real hands-on experience \nbased on the career they are focusing on. New Hampshire has been the \nfirst State in the Nation to actually receive a grant on competency-\nbased education.\n  I was very glad to work with Senator King to improve a section of \nthis bill that would allow a greater ability for States to participate \nin alternative assessment pilot programs like we have seen in New \nHampshire. This is, again, about transferring control from Washington \nof how we assess how our students are doing and how we ensure \naccountability in our schools to innovative local ideas like what we \nhave seen in New Hampshire when it comes to competency-based \neducation. So I want to thank Senator King for working with me on that.\n\n  There are a number of other amendments for which I thank my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle and which I think are very \nimportant in this bill. I was very glad to work on them with my \ncolleagues. They include working with Senator Booker on assisting \nhomeless and foster youth; working with Senator Warner on including \nlanguage ensuring better transitions from school to the workplace; and \nworking with Senator Bennet on supporting the use of shared service \nalliances for early childhood education programs. For example, in New \nHampshire we have the Seacoast Early Learning Alliance. I was very glad \nto work with Senator Bennet on that amendment. Also, improving \noversight of the Early Learning Alignment and Improvement Grants \nProgram--oversight of our programs is critical. I was glad to work with \nSenator Warner on oversight of these programs and, finally, work with \nSenator Isakson again on the local control piece, and that is putting \nthe decisionmaking back with the parents. This amendment will better \ninform parents about their rights when it comes to mandatory \nassessments and the qualifications of their classroom teachers. I think \nwe need to inform parents so that they can make the best decisions for \ntheir children.\n  I am confident that the bipartisan, commonsense reforms in the Every \nChild Achieves Act will improve our education system and certainly make \nsure that the decisionmaking rests where it should--with parents, \nteachers, local school boards, and our States, rather than the \nWashington\n\n[[Page S5137]]\n\none-size-fits-all approach we have seen too often. In turn, it will \nhelp prepare students in New Hampshire and across our country for good \ncareers and a brighter future. All of us here want to ensure that our \nchildren will have better opportunities than we have had in this great \ncountry, and we certainly owe that to our children. I am very glad we \nhad this important debate on the floor.\n  Again, I thank Senator Alexander and Senator Murray for working \nacross the aisle on this important bill.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                EPA Rule\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, late last month, the Supreme Court \nissued a severe rebuke to the Obama administration and to his \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. It was a strong stand against \nWashington overreach.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency had written what it called the \nmercury and air toxics standards rule. The rule was a key part of the \nObama administration's war on coal. The Supreme Court said that when \nWashington bureaucrats were writing this rule, they failed--the EPA \nfailed--to consider the overwhelming costs they were imposing on hard-\nworking American families. The Court said: ``One would not say that it \nis even rational, never mind appropriate, to impose billions of dollars \nin economic costs in return for a few dollars in health and \nenvironmental benefits.'' It wasn't even rational, never mind \nappropriate. The Court's decision was exactly right, and many of us saw \nit as a big step forward in reining in this out-of-control \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n  Here is the problem. The rule came out in 2012, and the Supreme Court \ndidn't make its ruling until 2015. That is 3 years. It is far too late \nfor many Americans who work at coal plants and who have already been \nhurt by the EPA's ruling in 2012. That is because power companies were \nalready having to comply with that rule while it made its way through \nthe court process. They have already closed plants because of the rule, \neven though the Supreme Court now says that the rule was inappropriate, \nit was wrong. Now, unemployed workers won't get their jobs back now \nthat the Court has ruled against the Obama administration. Because of \nthese regulations, people are already paying higher electricity rates \nthan they would have been paying otherwise. Consumers don't get their \nmoney back, either, now that the Supreme Court says the Environmental \nProtection Agency overstepped its authority.\n  This isn't the first time this Agency has gone beyond the law and \nbeyond what it is allowed to do. That is what it did when it put out \nits so-called waters of the United States rule. It is a recent rule--\nwaters of the United States. It is a new regulation. The Agency wants \nto use it to greatly expand government control over the Nation's land \nand water. Farmers, ranchers, hard-working families would no longer be \nable to decide what to do with their own land. States, counties, and \ntowns would no longer be able to decide what regulations will be best \nto protect the streams and the waters and the lakes within their \nborders. That is the problem. These decisions would now be made by \nWashington bureaucrats no matter what the cost, no matter how small the \nbenefits or how large the cost.\n  Not only did the Agency increase its authority dramatically, it \nappears that it abused the rulemaking process to get the results the \nEPA wanted. What do I mean by that? Well, when Washington writes big, \nexpensive regulations, it is supposed to have a public comment period \nso that people who might be harmed by the rules can have their say. \nAccording to news reports, when the EPA was writing the waters of the \nUnited States rule, the EPA twisted the public comment process into its \nown private, government-funded spin machine. This government agency \nignored the negative comments by Americans who were actually concerned \nabout the law and who were hurt by the law.\n  That is not what I am saying; that is what the New York Times said \nwhen it reported on the scandal back in May. The New York Times said \nthat the EPA used taxpayer dollars to lobby liberal groups to flood the \nAgency with positive comments. These were the same phony, ginned-up \ncomments that it used to justify the dramatic overreach of its new \nregulations. It is incredible, it is unbelievable, and I believe it is \nalso illegal.\n\n  If my colleagues want another example of overreach by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, look at the regulations it wrote to \nrestrict the amount of carbon dioxide produced by powerplants. It is \ncalled the Clean Power Plan. When the EPA was writing this rule, it did \nthe exact same thing the Supreme Court just said was not even rational. \nThe EPA counted up what it said would be the benefits of the regulation \nwithout caring at all about the true costs.\n  So what are the true costs? Well, according to one estimate, the new \nregulations would add up to $366 billion in additional costs over the \nnext 15 years. That cost will be passed on to consumers and will force \nmore powerplants to close and more Americans to lose their jobs. For \nall of that expense, all of that damage to hard-working families, the \nbenefits would be minimal.\n  The Obama administration makes wild claims about environmental \nbenefits of this regulation. They are the same kinds of claims that it \nmade for the rule the Supreme Court just called unreasonable. The \nAgency exaggerates the benefits, the Agency ignores the costs, and it \nputs its thumb on the scale to come up with the policy that it wants.\n  One of the big costs the Environmental Protection Agency has been \nignoring is the damaging health effects of the unemployment caused by \nthe regulations. When a powerplant closes, people in those communities \nlose their jobs and their health suffers. High unemployment increases \nthe likelihood of hospital visits, of illnesses, of premature death. \nHigh unemployment raises health care costs, and it hurts children's \nhealth and family well-being. Those are real costs to families, to \nsociety, and the EPA continues to intentionally ignore them.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency was wrong when it wrote its \nmercury and air toxics rule, it was wrong when it wrote its waters of \nthe United States rule, and it was wrong when it wrote its powerplant \nrule.\n  The Supreme Court has said the Environmental Protection Agency needs \nto take a more honest approach--the Supreme Court telling President \nObama's EPA to take an honest approach--and it needs to take the true \ncosts into consideration. That is what States across the country are \nalready doing. Governors in Oklahoma, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Texas are \nrefusing to be bullied by the Obama administration. They are refusing \nto give up their right to decide what is best for their own citizens. I \nbelieve these States are taking the right approach. They are waiting to \nget a true idea of the costs as well as the benefits before they rush \nto allow rules that would shut down powerplants and put thousands of \npeople out of work. The Supreme Court says that is what Washington \nshould be doing as well.\n  Maybe now the Obama administration will finally listen and start \nbasing its regulations on what the science says is true, not just on \nwhat the bureaucrats of the administration wish were true.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, in my home State of Washington and across \nthe country, students and parents and teachers and communities are \ncounting on us to finally fix No Child Left Behind. I have been very \nglad to work with Chairman Alexander on our bipartisan bill called the \nEvery Child Achieves Act. Our bipartisan bill gives States more \nflexibility while also including Federal guardrails to make\n\n[[Page S5138]]\n\nsure all students have access to a quality public education.\n  I am very proud of the bipartisan work we have done on the Senate \nfloor--debating amendments, taking votes, and making this good bill \neven better. It is not the bill I would have written on my own, and I \nam sure it is not the bill Chairman Alexander would have written on his \nown, but it is a good, strong step in the right direction. And it is \nnot the last opportunity, of course, we will have to work on this bill \nbefore it is signed into law. In fact, after the Senate passes the bill \ntoday, we will go to conference, and then I will be looking forward to \nworking closely with their ranking member, Bobby Scott, with the \nadministration, and with Democrats and Republicans in the House and \nSenate who are interested in building on the Senate's bipartisan work \nand getting this done. I hope Chairman Kline and House Republicans will \nbe willing to join us at the table to reach an agreement on the final \nproduct that works for our kids and our parents and our schools and our \ncommunities across the country.\n  Strengthening accountability is extremely important to me and to \nRanking Member Scott. Democrats, including 42 of our Senate Democrats, \nvoted for Senator Murphy's accountability amendment yesterday. It is \nalso important to the administration. We will continue to push for that \nin conference.\n  We still have more work to do today before we wrap up and vote on \nfinal passage. The senior Senator from Pennsylvania has offered an \namendment to expand access to high-quality early education. That is \nbeing offered by Senator Casey. Making sure kids can start kindergarten \nready to learn is one of the best investments I believe we can make to \nhelp our kids succeed in school and later in life. I urge my colleagues \nto vote for that amendment when it comes up for a vote shortly. Then, \nof course, we will have a number of other amendments and finally \npassage, and hopefully we will be able to reach that in a positive way \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I said this many times on the Senate floor, but it \nbears repeating to emphasize how important education is for the future \nof this country. Providing a quality education isn't just good for \nstudents today, it is an investment in our future workforce, it is an \ninvestment in our future economy, and it is an investment in a growing \nstrong middle class that will help our country grow stronger. As we all \nknow, across the country today, parents, students, and teachers in our \ncommunities are looking to us to fix No Child Left Behind.\n  So, again, I commend Senator Alexander for his strong work on this, \nfor his willingness to work on a bipartisan basis and get us to where \nwe are today, to be able to look very soon to passing the bill out of \nthe Senate and continuing our work to fix this broken law.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nher comments. At 10:45 a.m., we will begin voting. We have six \namendments--five or six that we expect to vote on, and then at 1:45 \np.m. we will have passage of the bill or cloture and final passage of \nthe bill. So we will finish our bill fixing No Child Left Behind today. \nOf course, in the U.S. Senate nothing is done until it is done, so I \ndon't want to anticipate that--but I think it is fair to make a few \ncomments about the bill at this point, anticipating we will have a \nsuccessful conclusion this afternoon.\n  If we are able to pass a bill fixing No Child Left Behind this \nafternoon, it will be a remarkable accomplishment for a U.S. Senate \nfilled with 100 experts on education. I said earlier this week that \ndealing with a piece of legislation about elementary and secondary \neducation is a little bit like going to a football game at the \nUniversity of Tennessee, where there are 100,000 people in the stands \nand every one of them is an expert on football, and they know exactly \nwhat the next play is to call. Consensus among experts is not easy, but \nconsensus is necessary in the U.S. Senate if we are going to deal even \nwith such a complex problem as this, and that is exactly what we have \nachieved.\n  As Senator Murray said, we found a consensus first about the urgent \nneed to fix No Child Left Behind, 7 years overdue. That is our \ncollective thought in the U.S. Congress. We tried twice the last two \nCongresses, but we fell apart over partisan differences. I will give \nSenator Murray credit for coming up with the idea of how we began this \nprocess earlier this year, and that was for the two of us, consulting \nwith our committee members and other Senators, to produce a draft that \nwould be a starting point for our committee, and that worked well. We \nconsidered nearly 60 amendments in committee, adopted 27, I believe, \nand the committee reported unanimously to this body a bill to fix No \nChild Left Behind. That gave us a very good head start because members \nof our committee represent some of our most liberal Members and some of \nour most conservative Members. The fact that we could agree on how to \ntake that step made a big difference, and that is one reason we will \nsucceed this afternoon in passing the bill.\n  So we found a consensus not only on the urgent need to fix No Child \nLeft Behind but on how to fix No Child Left Behind, and the consensus \nis this: continue the law's important measurements of academic progress \nof students but restore to States, school districts, classrooms, \nteachers, and parents the responsibility for deciding what to do about \nimproving student achievement. That theme runs through this bill.\n  This change, in my opinion, should produce fewer tests and more \nappropriate ways to measure students' achievement. It is the most \neffective way to advance higher State standards, better teaching, and \nreal accountability. We have had a lot of talk about accountability \nduring this debate, as we should have, and the Presiding Officer, as I \nwas, having been a Governor, watched over the last 15 years how States \nhave become better prepared in dealing with student achievement, how \nthey worked together to create higher standards State by State, worked \ntogether to create better assessments, tests State by State, and now \nwork together to create better accountability State by State.\n  This bill is a recognition of that preparation by the States and \nrecognition also as the New York Principal of the Year said in a letter \nto us, that people closest to the children cherish their children, and \nwe should not assume that just because we have flown to Washington, DC, \nfor the week that suddenly we are so much wiser about what to do about \nchildren in 100,000 public schools and cherish the children more than \nthe classroom teachers and the parents and the school board members and \nthe community and the legislators and the Governors who are closer to \nthem than we are.\n  The next step, if we are successful this afternoon, is to go to a \nconference with the House. I have had numerous discussions with \nChairman Kline at the House of Representatives. We have been on \nparallel paths. We know better than to try to make our institutions do \nexactly the same thing--that defies human nature--but we can \ncommunicate and stay in touch with each other, and our bills are not \nthat different. The committee members are familiar with the bill. There \nare some important differences, and we will have to work those out, but \nour goal, if we succeed today, is to take the bill passed by the House, \nput it together with the Senate bill, produce a conference report, and \nsend it to the desk of President Obama in a form he will be comfortable \nsigning.\n  I believe the President also sees the need to fix No Child Left \nBehind. He knows there is confusion and anxiety in most of our 100,000 \npublic schools that need to be settled, and we hope we have come up \nwith a version of the bill that while it wouldn't be the bill he would \nwrite if only he were writing it--and as Senator Murray said, it is not \nthe bill she would write if only she were writing it, and it certainly \nwould not be the bill I would write if only I were writing it, but we \nhad a consensus we needed to come to. Why do we need a consensus? \nBecause that is how to govern in a complex society.\n  I first came to the Senate at a young age in the late sixties, and I \nwatched Everett Dirksen, the Republican leader, and President Johnson, \nthe Democratic President, work together to produce the civil rights \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S5139]]\n\nThat was more difficult than this--although this has been pretty \ndifficult. It took 68 votes to get cloture at that time, and they did \nthat. It was only because they had a consensus. Senator Russell from \nGeorgia, who had opposed the civil rights bill, went home to Georgia \nthe next day and said: It is the law of the land. We need to support \nit. The way to govern a complex country is through consensus, and the \nagency of our government that is the only agent for encouraging and \nachieving consensus is the U.S. Senate. I thank my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle for creating an environment where we could do that.\n  Senator McConnell has done that by putting the bill on the floor, \ngiving us enough time to have amendments, and having a policy of \nencouraging amendments so Senators on both sides can have their say, \nboth on the committee and on the floor. There have been more Democratic \namendments considered and adopted than Republican amendments, and that \nis appropriate. Senator Cornyn, Senator Thune, Senator Barrasso on this \nside of the aisle have been very helpful.\n  I have several times thanked the Democratic leader Senator Reid. He \nhas helped to create an environment that permitted this to move in an \norderly fashion. We basically conducted the end of the consideration of \nthis bill by unanimous consent. Enough Senators had a chance to have \ntheir say that they agreed by unanimous consent that we can consider \nthese amendments and only these amendments in a certain way, with a \ncertain amount of time, and go all the way through to the end. That is \na very good way to operate the Senate, and the Democratic leader made \nthat possible, first by allowing the bill to come to the floor without \na cloture vote and by working with us as we went through it, and \nSenator Schumer and Senator Durbin, who along with Senator Murray are \npart of the Democratic leadership, have done the same.\n  Senator Vitter, Senator Lee, Senator Toomey, and Senator Burr have \nall stepped back a little bit on things they would like to do--so did \nSenator Franken and so did Senator Casey on that side of the aisle. In \nother words, a number of Senators exercised restraint to permit us to \nwork toward a result. In a body that operates by unanimous consent, \nthat is absolutely essential. So this has been a good process.\n  We have six more amendments this morning, and we look forward to \ndebating those and acting on them. At 1:45, hopefully, we will have a \nbig vote in favor of fixing No Child Left Behind, reflecting the \nconsensus that will keep the important measurements of student \nachievement, but we will turn back and restore to the State and local \ngovernments the responsibility for what to do about the results of \nthose tests. That is the consensus in this bill that survived very well \nthrough the committee process and through the amendments so far, and I \nexpect it to survive through the rest of the day.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2180\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on the Cruz amendment \nNo. 2180.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, there are a number of Members of this body \nwho in good faith are moving forward to reduce the Federal burdens on \nStates, on teachers, on education. Yet at the end of the day, this bill \nstill mandates specific testing requirements. This amendment is a \nstraightforward amendment to remove the testing mandates and to leave \nthe substance of any testing that occurs to the States.\n  This leaves power over choices in education in the hands of teachers, \nin the hands of school boards, in the hands of States, in the hands of \ngovernment that is closest to the people. We have seen with the \nbipartisan objection to Common Core that the last thing we need in \neducation is unelected bureaucrats in Washington dictating what is \nbeing taught to kids at home. This amendment simply takes out the \nFederal mandates and empowers teachers, school boards, and parents to \ncontrol the education of their own children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would urge a ``no'' vote on this \namendment. This is the report card. The Federal Government is saying: \nWe will give you $23 billion, and all we are asking in return is that \nyou, State, write a test; that you, State, figure out what the \naccountability system is and you report it to the parents and the \npublic.\n  That would mean a third grader, for example, would take two tests a \nyear. Each test would be about 2 hours. So it is a State test, a State \nassessment. In our Alexander-Murray bipartisan bill, we keep what works \nin No Child Left Behind, which is the report card, but we get rid of \nwhat does not work, and we give back to States responsibility for \ndetermining student achievement. This is the consensus that supports \nthis bill.\n  Keeping the important measure of student achievement is essential to \nmaintaining that consensus. So if you want to get rid of the Common \nCore mandate, get rid of the waivers for 42 States, reverse the trend \nto a national school board, vote no and keep the requirement for \nimportant measures of student achievement, which are State tests.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2180.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Madam President, I applaud President Obama for visiting \na Federal penitentiary today to highlight the fact that, tragically, \nthe United States has more people in jail than any other country on \nEarth. One of the reasons we have so many people in jail is that we \nhave an obscenely high level of youth unemployment: for young White \nkids, 33 percent; for Hispanic kids, 36 percent; for African-American \nkids, 51 percent.\n\n[[Page S5140]]\n\n  The time has come for us to begin investing in jobs and education for \nour kids, not jails and incarceration. This bill, over a 2-year period, \nwould create 2 million jobs for our young people. It is paid for by \nclosing the carried-interest loophole that allows billionaires to pay a \nlower tax rate than working class Americans.\n  It is high time we addressed this issue of high youth unemployment. I \nask for bipartisan support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, the five remaining votes will be 10-\nminute votes.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote, No. 1, because this proposal is \nunconstitutional. You cannot start a tax increase in the Senate. It has \nto start in the House. No. 2, we already have three workforce programs \nthat we created just last year: Jobs Corps, the youth bill, and \ndislocated workers. No. 3, it is a big tax increase. So because it is a \nbig tax increase, because it is duplicative of existing programs, and \nbecause it is unconstitutional, I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on the Coons \namendment No. 2243.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, the bipartisan amendment I am offering \ntoday with Senator Rubio--and I am grateful to Senator Gillibrand for \ncosponsoring--this American dream accounts amendment is about one \nthing: giving every child the chance to go to college if they are \nwilling to work hard for it. Time and again, we have seen in this \ncountry what kids can achieve when they know their dreams are possible. \nThat is what this amendment and the American dream accounts help solve, \nensuring that every child knows a college education is possible.\n  The American dream accounts encourage partnerships in 10 \ndemonstration sites to develop secure, Web-based student accounts that \ndevelop information about each student's literacy and academic \npreparedness and then ties it to high-impact mentoring and a college \nsavings account.\n  I myself have seen over the years of working with the national ``I \nHave a Dream'' Foundation how sending the message to our kids that \ncollege is a real possibility for them can make a powerful impact, from \nelementary school, to middle school, to high school, to college, and it \nhas an impact that changes their behavior and their outcomes in school.\n  American dream accounts are a bipartisan idea whose time has come. I \nurge my colleagues to support it with a ``yes'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, if I could have the attention of \nSenators, we have four more votes before lunch. It is 11:40 a.m. What \nwe would like to do is to have 10-minute votes. So if Senators will \nstay on the floor, we will have 10-minute votes or come as close to \nthat as we can.\n  Madam President, this is an interesting idea, but it belongs in the \nHigher Education Act, which we are about to take up in our committee, \nand here is why: It duplicates two existing Federal programs called \nGear Up and TRIO.\n  No. 2, we already have $30 billion of tax credits that we spend. This \ninvolves more tax credits. We already spend $30 billion. We should \ncalculate the advantages of this program, along with the $100 billion \nof loans we make, the $35 billion of Pell grants we make, the $30 \nbillion of tax credits we have, and see where it fits into that. The \ntime to do that is in the next big bill we have from our committee, \nwhich is the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time remaining.\n  Mr. RUBIO.

Madam President, in 1965, President Lyndon Johnson, when \nthe ESEA was passed, said this: Financial assistance to school \ndistricts serving areas with concentrations of children of low income \nshould be the target of it. We have never successfully targeted all of \nthose kids in poverty.\n  Let me say to my colleagues, if your State is in red, your poor \nstudents lose under the current formula.\n  Now, we have come to a compromise, and though I don't think it \nreflects the best policy, compromise is at the heart of this \ninstitution. Therefore, with $14 billion worth of appropriations in \ntitle I-A today, this new formula would not take place until we have \nreached $17 billion, meaning for the next years--probably 10 based upon \nhistorical numbers--there would be no change in the distribution in any \nStates. But after that point, this body, for once--for the first time \nin 50 years--would have the money follow kids in poverty, represented \nby the red States we see on this map.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is the right thing \nto do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask that 30 seconds of my time be \nyielded to the Senator from Ohio.\n  I oppose this amendment. I thank the Senators from Tennessee, \nWashington, and North Carolina for making it less onerous. We did come \nto a compromise. As he said, it starts at $17 billion, but there is \nstill a major fallacy here.\n  When we change formulas, we have always held harmless the States that \nwould lose money, but we have been able to increase money. In this \nbill, we don't. We keep it flat. So we are robbing Peter to pay Paul, \nwhich will be an awful precedent which will bite every one of us.\n  Second, my good friend said the money should go to people from \npoverty, but they also voted against the Merkley amendment, which \nrequired the money to go to people in poverty, and now it can go \nanywhere.\n  So I respectfully urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, \nalthough it is improved from the original.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I appreciate the fact that we have \ndelayed the impact of this, but the impact is still severe. In my State \nand many other States, we will see a significant cut.\n  Do my colleagues know what it is? It is telling States that if you \ninvest in children, you are going to be penalized.\n  This legislation, the underlying bill, is about helping our children \nsucceed. Yet, in this amendment, we are actually telling States that if \nyou help your kids succeed, you are going to be penalized under a new \nformula. It is not part of the bill that came out of committee. It is \nnot part of the underlying bill.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment and ensure that \nthe States that are helping our kids continue to be able to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \nbrief colloquy with my colleagues from the State of Tennessee and the \nState of Washington for no more than 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Madam President.\n  As we stated, some of us had serious objections to changing the \nformula, but thankfully the modified amendment follows in a tradition \nof compromise. And I appreciate my colleagues from Tennessee, \nWashington, and North Carolina working on it. As a result, we will \ncontinue to abide by the ``do no harm'' principle. New York's funding \nwill not be cut, and neither will the funding in any of the other 13 \nStates that would have been cut by the original amendment. We will not \npunish schools unfairly by using a formula that creates winners and \nlosers. This takes the idea of losing school districts off the table. \nSo, again, I would like to thank my colleagues for working with me to \nensure that our students in New York and the 13 other States do not \nstart the next school year at a disadvantage with fewer school \nresources.\n  The title I changes we have agreed to reflect our commitment to \nincreasing funding and supporting funding for low- and moderate-income \nstudents. I appreciate the commitment my colleagues from Tennessee and \nWashington have made, and I would like to confirm those here on the \nfloor.\n  I would ask my dear friend Senator Alexander--I would like you to \nconfirm your commitment to maintain this title I funding proposal which \nwe just passed which is contained in amendment No. 2247, as modified--\nwhen the Senate and House convene a conference, that we will not go any \nlower than this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I would say through the Chair to the \ndistinguished Senator from New York and the Senator from Illinois and \nthe Republican Senators who are interested in this that the answer to \nSenator Schumer's question is yes, that my commitment is to work--to \nkeep the Senate decision in conference.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, reclaiming the floor, I would just ask \nmy dear friend from the State of Washington whether she concurs in that \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, through the Chair to the Senator from \nNew York, I will work in conference to keep the commitment of this \namendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I yield to my friend from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given \n1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield that minute to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my friend and colleague from New York.\n  Madam President, the original core amendment would have cost Illinois \n$180 million in title I funds--$68 million cut to Chicago Public \nSchools. It was\n\n[[Page S5142]]\n\nunconscionable. It would have been devastating. They have so many low-\nincome students. I am glad there is a better approach now.\n  I hope the title I funding will reach $17 billion soon. It is \ncurrently at $14.4 billion, and it has been at that level roughly for \nthe last 5 years.\n  I thank my colleagues from Tennessee and Washington for affirming \nthat they are going to stand behind this protection during the course \nof the conference committee.\n  I would like to commend the leaders of the HELP Committee for working \nwith Senators to reach an agreement on Senator Burr's proposal to \nrewrite the formula for distributing title I education dollars to the \nStates.\n  Title I is the single largest source of Federal funding for \nelementary and secondary education. It helps States and districts offer \nthe kind of teachers and extra services that help low-income students \nlearn and succeed in school.\n  The Burr amendment we just voted on would change the way those \ndollars are distributed and would hurt low-income students in \nIllinois--based in part on the fact that Illinois spends more per pupil \non elementary and secondary education than the national average. That \nis neither fair nor good policy.\n  The original Burr amendment would have cut Illinois' title I funding \nby $180 million next year. Every district in the State receiving title \nI funds would have seen a cut. With the modifications we were able to \nwork out, Illinois' students won't be hurt until title I funding at the \nFederal level reaches $17 billion a year.\n  While I hope Federal title I spending would reach $17 billion soon, \nis currently at $14.4 billion and has remained around that level for \nthe last 5 years. Looking at history and understanding the fiscal \nchallenges in Congress, it is unlikely that Illinois' title I \nallocation would be impacted by the new formula during the 5-year \nlifespan of this authorization bill.\n  I am concerned, however, that the agreement we reached in the Senate \ncould be undermined during conference negotiations with the House. I \nask the leaders of the committee, through the Chair, for their \nassurance that the title I formula will not be further altered in \nconference.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2100\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on the Brown \namendment No. 2100.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, the Brown-Manchin amendment expands the \nfull-service community schools model to schools across the country. \nCommunity schools are different from Promised Neighborhoods--two \ndifferent approaches to what is a complex set of challenges. Community \nschools start with a focus on the school, engage partners in joint \nefforts to improve student achievement and development, and in the \nprocess work to strengthen family and community.\n  Madam President, I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Manchin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, all of us have challenged areas in our \nStates. I have a county--one of the poorest counties in the country is \nMcDowell County. These children have no chance whatsoever. It has the \nabsolute worst statistics any child could be living in. And it is \nbecause of these programs that are bringing the compassion of public-\nprivate partnerships that we are able to work through to reestablish \nthe services these children won't get. The areas are so sparsely \npopulated, and there is high unemployment.\n  I would encourage all of you to support this amendment. It continues \nthe program. It is worthwhile. We have McDowell County now with 125 \npublic-private partnerships that we would not have, and these children \nwill not have a chance without them. I encourage your support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I urge a ``no'' vote because States \nmay already do what the amendment says they can do in this new program. \nThere is money in titles I, II, and IV to do that. All this does is \ntake money away from existing programs and give it to a new program \nwhich States, if they choose, can already do.\n  Second, we are approving today an almost identical program called \nPromised Neighborhoods which the Center for American Progress \nrecommended Congress consolidate with the program this amendment would \nauthorize and create. So we are creating two programs that do the same \nthing in the same day. In addition, the Education Department Secretary \nfor the Obama administration said Promised Neighborhood in full-service \ncommunity schools are much more similar than different.\n  So we need to stop this business of doing well-intentioned programs. \nOne well-intentioned program is enough. We don't need to create two \nthat do the same thing.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. MANCHIN.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on the Casey \namendment No. 2242.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, this amendment focuses on the link \nbetween learning and earning. We know that if we invest in our children \nin prekindergarten education, they will learn more now and earn more \nlater. It is a State-Federal partnership. It is paid for. It focuses on \n4-year-olds. Three million 4-year-olds in the country will benefit from \nhigh-quality early learning.\n  The best testimony about this issue comes from parents. Beth in \nsouthwestern Pennsylvania said--talking about an early learning program \nin Pennsylvania: Her daughter couldn't write any of her letters or even \nrecognize them. Now she's improved so much since the first day of \nclass.\n  And then Megan in southeastern Pennsylvania said: When her son came \ninto this program, he was shy and had very little verbal communication. \nHe now talks nonstop and loves hearing.\n\n[[Page S5143]]\n\n  That is why we need this amendment to pass. I urge a ``yes'' vote on \nthe Casey amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The amendment is unnecessary because the Federal Government already \nspends $22 billion on early childhood education through 45 programs. \nStates spend money through the title I program on early childhood \neducation. Our underlying bill has an important amendment on early \nchildhood, fashioned by Senator Murray and Senator Isakson, to spend \nthat money more effectively.\n  This proposal has a familiar ring. It is like a Medicaid mandate, \nStates would pay 40 percent. It is like a national school board, the \nFederal Government would define teacher salaries, class size, staff-\nchild ratios, and professional development. It is a national school \nboard for 4-year-olds. That is the reverse of what we want to do in \nthis bill.\n  Another familiar ring is it would be Common Core for kindergarten, so \nI urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes \nfor the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2232\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish to make just a quick couple of \ncomments on an amendment that I appreciate the floor managers, Senators \nAlexander and Murray, agreeing to accept by voice vote. It deals with \nan issue that is really important to my home State.\n  This amendment would expand the authorized use of Project School \nEmergency Response to Violence--what we call Project SERV--grants to \ninclude violence prevention.\n  Currently, Project SERV funds are used to restore the learning \nenvironment by addressing the disruptive effects of a traumatic crisis \nor event. However, these funds cannot be used to fund violence \nprevention activities, such as afterschool programs, mentoring, anger \nmanagement or skills-building programs.\n  My amendment would permit a limited and focused expansion of Project \nSERV to permit prevention activities as part of the efforts to restore \nthe learning environment in cases where there is a continued risk of \ndisruption. This would better tie prevention to a crisis or trauma that \nhas already occurred and better restore and preserve the learning \nenvironment in cases such as the tragic suicide crisis in Indian \nCountry or gang violence.\n  For example, on South Dakota's Pine Ridge Indian Reservation alone, \ntwo high school and two middle school age students have committed \nsuicide just since December. My amendment would help give these areas \nof crisis additional flexibility in restoring our schools to safe and \npositive environments.\n  I have worked closely with Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member \nMurray to keep this expansion limited so as not to detract from Project \nSERV's current scope, and I appreciate very much their help and the \nSenate's support.\n  Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that following the \ndisposition of the Warren amendment No. 2249, all postcloture time on \nthe substitute amendment be yielded back; further, that the cloture \nvote on S. 1177 be at 1:45 p.m. today, and that if cloture is invoked, \nall postcloture time, except for 4 minutes equally divided between \nSenators Alexander and Murray, be yielded back; and following the use \nor yielding back of time, the Senate vote on passage of S. 1177, as \namended, if amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2082\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Hatch-Bennet amendment amends the early \nlearning grant program to allow States to use Pay for Success \nInitiatives to improve the quality and coordination of the State's \nsystem of early learning and care services. My home State of Utah has \nthe first-ever pay for success program designed to expand access to \nearly childhood education for at-risk children. The Utah High Quality \nPreschool Program delivers a high-impact, targeted curriculum that \nincreases school readiness and academic performance among 3- and 4-\nyear-olds. As children enter kindergarten better prepared, fewer \nstudents will need to use special education and remedial services in \nkindergarten through 12th grade, allowing schools and States to save \nmoney. We should build on this success and empower other States to do \nthe same.\n  I should reiterate that this amendment only allows government funds \nto be used if the program is successful, encouraging effective use of \ntaxpayer dollars. We should be allowing States to use their funding to \nencourage ground-up, evidence-based practices. I look forward to seeing \nmeaningful results.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2249\n\n  Mr. GARDNER Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington and \nthe Senator from Tennessee for their leadership over the past several \ndays--last week and this week--as we talk about the future of education \nin this country. I commend them for creating a bill that takes away the \nFederal Government's mandates on curriculum and direction and makes \nsure we provide local control to school districts and teachers.\n  As a father myself of a student who is going into the sixth grade, I \nhave heard a lot about tests over the past several years, and I want to \ncommend the leadership for making sure we are actually getting Congress \nout of the classroom. So I appreciate my colleagues' leadership.\n  Today I want to talk about an amendment accepted in the education \nbill we are dealing with here today that deals with the use of title I \nfunds for concurrent and duel enrollment programs at eligible schools \nthroughout the country.\n  According to the Georgetown Public Policy Institute, by 2020, 65 \npercent of the jobs available in the country today will require \nsecondary education. In Colorado, that number is even higher. Again, by \n2020, 65 percent of our jobs will require secondary education. In \nColorado, that number is going to be greater. The Colorado Department \nof Education estimates it is not just 65 percent of the jobs that \nrequire a secondary education in Colorado by 2020. It will actually be \n74 percent of the jobs in our State that are going to require some form \nof postsecondary education.\n  Ensuring that our students have the skills necessary to excel in \ncollege and in the workforce is absolutely and by far and away the best \nway to address this concern so we can make sure that we are providing \nour students with successful futures. Concurrent enrollment and dual \nenrollment programs have a proven record of success in this arena.\n  I was in the State legislature in Colorado when we embarked on the \nfirst concurrent enrollment ideas that came out of the legislature and \nthat have been greatly successful. But we know it is not just the \nanecdotes from Colorado, but it is the American Institutes for Research \nthat finds that participation in concurrent and dual enrollment \nprograms reduces the number of students dropping out of high school, \nincreasing a student's likelihood of entering college, making sure they \ncomplete college, and getting through to a career.\n  But our challenge today is that an astounding number of students need \nto take remedial courses when they enter college. Sitting down with \njunior college leaders and community college presidents and talking to \nour universities, they all tell stories about how many students come \nfrom high schools to their college or to their campus requiring \nremedial work in English or mathematics.\n  According to a report by testing organization ETS, nearly one-half of \nU.S. millennials scored below the threshold that indicates proficiency \nin literacy, and two-thirds of U.S. millennials missed the cutoff mark \nin math proficiency.\n  Students are discouraged from continuing college when they are \nrequired to take courses--nobody wants to go on to college and take the \nsame course--that you thought you had completed in high school. But \nconcurrent and dual enrollment will help solve this problem by allowing \nstudents to participate in college-level courses, which, upon \ncompletion, will ensure that these students are indeed proficient.\n  Not only does concurrent and dual enrollment allow proficiency, but \nit allows students to get ahead of the curve and doing so while in high \nschool.\n  A study by the National Education Longitudinal Study found that \nconcurrent and dual enrollment participants were 16 to 20 percent more \nlikely to complete a bachelor's degree than their counterparts. \nResearch shows that students who participate in concurrent and dual \nenrollment programs complete their degrees earlier than their \ncounterparts as well.\n  A study in 2010 by Kristen Klopfenstein, a Colorado native and \ngraduate of the University of Texas, found that ``the results of taking \none or more concurrent or dual credit class tripled the likelihood of \ngraduating from associate programs in three years in relation to \nstudents who did not take such courses who typically graduate in four \nyears.''\n  ``Dual enrollment participation was also positively correlated to \ncompleting bachelor's degrees in four and five years, relative to \nstudents who did not take such courses who typically take longer to \ngraduate.''\n  These are the types of programs that reward students for their hard \nwork and prepare them for their college career and success.\n  Many people recognize that courses that provide college credit are \ntypically taken by high-achieving students already on the path to \ncollege. A lot of college courses that we see are filled with people we \nknew were destined for college in the first place. But I think we have \nto talk about the times where that is not the case, where college \ncourses were taken by people who perhaps never thought they had college \nin their future. I will share one such story today.\n  We were visited in the office not too long ago by a young woman from \nColorado who told her story about how concurrent enrollment in Colorado \nreally opened the doors to a college future and a college degree she \nnever thought was possible.\n\n       The community where I come from is not one that promises a \n     bright future. I am from a low income area of Denver, CO, and \n     we weren't expected to go to college.\n       I had always known I wanted to pursue higher education, but \n     was nervous that I wouldn't have the skills to succeed.\n       Fortunately for me, because of concurrent enrollment I was \n     able to get ahead in college for free. I graduated high \n     school with all of my high school credits along with 15 \n     credit hours of college credits.\n       Concurrent enrollment has helped me in phenomenal ways. It \n     gave me the confidence to know I had the capabilities to \n     succeed in college.\n       In addition, with the high cost of college I was able to \n     save money. I am now a student at Colorado State University \n     and made the Dean's list this semester.\n       I am on track to graduate early and it would never have \n     been possible without the programs I participated in in high \n     school.\n       I want to spread the word so other students can benefit \n     from concurrent enrollment the way that I have. Every young \n     person who wants to go to college should have the opportunity \n     to attend, and I'm thankful I had the opportunity to do so.\n\n\n[[Page S5145]]\n\n\n  Those aren't my words. Those are the words of a Coloradan whose \nfuture was made brighter by the fact that she was able to take \nadvantage, while in high school, of college credit classes.\n  Stories like this are why we have to make sure that, not just \nColoradans, but everyone across this country, is able to use title I \nprograms in the same beneficial manner.\n  So the amendment we offered and that has been accepted, thanks to the \nwork of Senator Alexander, our great chairman, and Ranking Member Patty \nMurray, would empower students to use these kinds of programs and would \nallow schools to use title I funds for concurrent and dual enrollment \nprograms, enabling students to simultaneously receive college credit \nfrom courses taught by college-approved teachers in secondary \neducation. It would allow eligible schools to use fifth-year program \npartnerships with institutions of higher education to allow students to \nparticipate in concurrent enrollment in the year directly following \ntheir senior year of high school.\n  Earning a postsecondary degree has become a prerequisite for jobs in \nthe 21st century. Going back to the statistics that we shared in the \nvery beginning, 74 percent of jobs in Colorado will require, by the \nyear 2020, a postsecondary education degree. As we face more \ncompetition in the global workplace, as we face more competition \nabroad, we have to have the kinds of education and educational \nopportunities that give the next generation of business leaders, \ninnovators, and entrepreneurs the skills to succeed.\n  I believe the concurrent and dual enrollment high school program not \nonly gives them the types of skills they need while in high school but \nthe opportunity to further a college degree and perhaps, as in the \nstory I shared earlier today from that young Coloradan, the chance to \ngo to college, the chance to receive a degree, and to prove they have \nthat bright future. That is what this policy is about. That is what \nthis amendment has been about.\n  Again, I thank the chairman for the consideration and acceptance of \nthe amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2222\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a problem that \neach one of us--all 100 Senators--knows. In any gathering we go to, in \nour State or around the country, people are affected by drug abuse, \nwhether legal or illegal. In our personal families, immediate families \nor extended families, we know somebody whose life is affected.\n  So today I urge my colleagues to support a commonsense amendment that \nI have introduced to the Every Child Achieves Act that addresses an \nepidemic that is devastating to my State and our country--and I know to \nthe Presiding Officer's State also--which is substance abuse.\n  Communities across the country, including many in my beautiful State \nof West Virginia, are seeing an alarming rise in substance abuse and \naddiction to legal prescription drugs. These are drugs we would find in \nthe medicine cabinet of our home.\n  West Virginia is No. 1 in overdose deaths--No. 1 in overdose deaths--\ndue to drug abuse.\n  We have seen over a 600-percent increase in the number of people \ndying since 1999. Nationally, 21.6 million Americans are battling \nsubstance dependence or abuse. But as most of us know, we can't truly \nunderstand substance abuse by just listening to facts and statistics. \nIt is one that can only be understood by hearing stories of those \nimpacted.\n  When I was Governor of the State of West Virginia, I traveled around \nthe State, and I saw firsthand the effects that substance abuse can \nhave. We tried to tackle many of these issues at the State level. But \nit is impossible. All of us have to be in this.\n  But one of the most moving experiences occurred during my first trip \nback to the Mountain State after becoming a Senator. I traveled to the \nreally beautiful little town of Oceana, WV.\n  I went to Oceana Middle School, where I had expected to talk about \nthe importance of receiving a good education and working hard to gain \nthe necessary skills to be successful in the workforce. Instead, I \nheard personal stories from 11-year-olds who spoke candidly about the \nways that drugs were tearing apart their families, their homes, and \ntheir community.\n  As tears trickled down their faces, they shared how they rarely \nplayed outside because too many needles coated the streets and drug \ndeals often took place right in front of them.\n  It is one thing to hear about overdoses and addictions from doctors, \nmedical experts or police officers who deal with substance abuse cases \nevery day. But I can tell you that it is another thing to sit across \nfrom an 11-year-old girl who is fighting through tears to describe how \nher family and her family life have been destroyed.\n  Her father was hurt in the coal mines and gradually became addicted \nto painkillers, causing her family to lose everything. As I listened to \nher story, I couldn't help but think that this young girl had to grow \nup so very fast and miss some of the pleasures of childhood.\n  That is why I am doing everything in my power to fight this national \nproblem. My commonsense bipartisan amendment with Senator Ayotte would \nsimply require that, in States where this is a significant problem, the \nState education plan include a strategy for how the State will help \nlocal education agencies educate students who face substance abuse in \ntheir home.\n  What we are saying is no child can be in a drug-infected home and \nhave a normal childhood. They can't have a normal learning experience \nin the school system.\n  To be clear, it does not prescribe or require any particular \nresponse. We are not saying you have to do this. The States that wish \nto have this done can. It simply gives the States the flexibility to \ncraft proposals that meet particular local needs.\n  That means if there is a child that basically needs extracurricular \nactivity, extra help, extra support, preschool or afterschool, they are \nable to intervene and change the system that would meet the needs of \nthat community.\n  Substance abuse by parents and other caregivers can have a \nsignificant negative impact on the well-being of children, and it makes \nit more difficult for them to learn and thrive in schools, as we know.\n  This amendment is a small step forward toward addressing that \nproblem. But it will encourage the States to consider solutions that \nwill enable local schools and communities to better help these \nvulnerable children and ensure that every child is ready to learn.\n  Our country, our States, our communities, our schools, and our \nchildren need us to take action to protect them from the devastation of \nsubstance abuse.\n  I am often reminded of the five promises we as adults should make to \nevery child. Colin Powell started this--the five promises--and my wife \nand I have adopted it when I was Governor. We still have a foundation.\n  The first promise is that every child has to have a loving, caring \nadult in their life--a loving, caring adult and unconditional love.\n  Second, every child should have a safe place.\n  Every child should have a healthy start in life.\n  Every child should have an education and have a skill set.\n  The fifth promise is what we can't teach. We can usually show it from \nexample. Every child should grow to be a loving, caring adult and give \nsomething back.\n  If we don't give children the chance to have that type of an \nexperience and they know they don't have a loving, caring adult, and \nthey don't have a safe place because the home has been ruined because \nof drug abuse, this is where we need to step in. If we are going to \nsave a generation, this is where we do it. This is the frontline of \ndefense today.\n  The No. 1 thing that is killing our country is drug abuse, and it is \nbasically coming from prescription drugs. It starts with manufacturing. \nIt goes down with the FDA putting all these lethal drugs on the market \nthat we never had before. It goes down to distribution and dispensing \nby doctors. Yet we don't have any treatment centers to cure people once \nthey get into it.\n\n[[Page S5146]]\n\n  So I am asking all of you to please consider supporting this \namendment. It is most reasonable, most responsible. It is not \nmandatory. It is optional. You can fit the needs and tailor this \nhowever your community, your State or your county might need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                 Justice for Tularosa Basin Downwinders\n\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, 70 years ago today, the first atomic bomb \nwas exploded at the Trinity test site in New Mexico. For our Nation, it \nwas the beginning of the nuclear age. For the residents of the Tularosa \nBasin, it was also the beginning--of great suffering, of generations of \ncancer and chronic illness. Seven decades later, their suffering \ncontinues and so does their fight for justice.\n  Windows rattled hundreds of miles away. The people of Tularosa saw \nradioactive debris fall from the sky, not knowing what it was. The \nfallout killed cattle, and poisoned water, food, and the air. The \ndamage was done. The destruction was real, and so is the sadness, \ndisappointment, and anger. That is very real too.\n  The Tularosa Basin Downwinders have not forgotten. They rightly ask \nthat we not forget, either.\n  I met with them and their families earlier this month in Tularosa, \nand they told me their stories, some of which I will share today.\n  Henry Herrera was just 11 years old at the time of the blast. He is \nnow 81. He remembers:\n\n       I heard a very large blast and saw a very big flash of \n     light. I got so scared I thought the world was coming to an \n     end.\n\n  He himself is a cancer survivor. He told me:\n\n       I'm the only one alive to tell about it. Everyone else has \n     died of cancer.\n\n  Edna Hinkle recalled so many in her family that had cancer, one after \nthe other--aunts, uncles, cousins, mother, sister, and herself. She \nsaid: ``My oldest daughter . . . says it's not a matter of if you get \ncancer, it's a matter of when.''\n  Marjie Trujillo told me that of nine members of her family, six have \ncancer, and three died from it. The loss is tragic and so is the \nfrustration. She said: ``Many in our community feel our government has \nturned a deaf ear to our health issues.''\n  I also heard from Virginia Duran. She was born in Tularosa in 1940 \nand lived on Padilla Lane. She told me that on the street where she \nlived, at least 10 people have had cancer. That is just one block.\n  Many families from the Tularosa Basin know this loss and pain. Nora \nFoltz is 71 years old. She is the only sibling of five who doesn't have \ncancer. Her sister, Helen Guerra, is 81 years old. Helen was diagnosed \nwith kidney cancer 17 years ago. Helen's daughter Lupe had multiple \nillnesses and chronic pain and died at the age of 62.\n  There are so many stories--far too many stories--like this. As Gloria \nHerrera said, the Tularosa community has ``shed enough tears to fill a \nlake.''\n  It was my privilege to meet with these survivors. Their stories are \ncourageous and troubling, but most troubling of all is the people who \nwere not there, who were not able to speak, and those who have passed \naway over the last seven decades. We all speak for them now, and we \nwill keep on speaking until justice is done.\n  The Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium is doing critical work. \nThey are organizing the community, telling their stories, and making \nsure people listen and understand what happened. Tina Cordova is one of \nthe many great advocates who are dedicated, committed, and refusing \ngive up. Tina summed up the feelings of many when she told me: ``We \nwere the unknown, unwilling guinea pigs in the world's greatest \nexperiment.'' I agree with Tina and the members of the consortium. \nTheirs is a tragic story. They suffered so that we could develop bombs \nand win wars. That is why I have again pushed for legislation with my \ncolleagues--Senator Crapo and several others--to amend the Radiation \nExposure Compensation Act and finally recognize the Trinity site and \ninclude New Mexicans who have suffered for decades. They deserve \njustice, they deserve compensation, and they are still waiting 70 years \nlater.\n  We can't change the years that have passed, nor can we erase the \nyears of illness and the pain endured by too many for too long, but \nfair compensation will make a difference and will provide badly needed \nhelp.\n  It took many years to create the original RECA Program. My father \nhelped to lay the groundwork. He devoted many years to fighting in the \ncourts for men, women, and children who were sick because they had \nlived downwind during nuclear tests. They were exposed to dangerous \nradiation. They should have been helped but were ignored instead.\n  I remember going with him to meet folks in St. George, UT, in 1978. I \nwas just out of law school. There were about 40 or 50 survivors there. \nThey loved their country and trusted their government. They were \nhesitant to speak out. They did not seek special treatment, but they \nwere wounded people. Caught in the fallout of the nuclear age, they had \na right to be heard. My dad heard them, and he demanded that others \nhear them as well. He fought for them until the end of his life at 90 \nyears old, first in the courts and then in the Congress. He worked with \nSenators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch--an unlikely match if ever there \nwere one--and they kept pushing.\n  President H.W. Bush signed RECA into law 25 years ago in 1990. It was \na bipartisan bill. It was driven by simple fairness and it was a \nhistoric step forward, but it left some folks behind, including the \nDownwinders in the Tularosa Basin.\n  My dad would not give up, the families he worked with would not give \nup, and we won't give up either. Our bill expands the downwind exposure \narea to include seven States from the Trinity and Nevada test sites, \nand it also includes Guam from the Pacific site. It would also allow \ncompensation for post-1971 uranium workers and fund a critical public \nhealth study for those who live and work in uranium development \ncommunities.\n  I will continue to push for this legislation. It is the right thing \nto do, and we should get it done, which is why I will again join my \nSenate colleagues in sending a letter to the Judiciary Committee to \nrequest a hearing on this important bill.\n  Many families in New Mexico have been hurt, and they worry there is \nmore harm to come. When I was in Tularosa this month, I spoke with a \nwoman named Louisa Lopez. Her husband has mantle cell lymphoma. They \nknow at least 17 other people who have cancer or who have died from it. \nShe said, ``We fear passing this on to our children, future \ngrandchildren, and other generations.''\n  This weekend, there will be a candlelight vigil in Tularosa. Folks \nwill gather, as they do every year now. They will stand together as \ncandles flicker in the warm New Mexico night. They will remember those \nwho have been brought down by cancer and other radiation-related \ndiseases. They will remember those who have passed away. They will \nremember that a wrong was done and has yet to be righted. And they will \noffer prayers and support for those who continue to struggle.\n  Rosemary Cordova told me in Tularosa:\n\n       We can't bring back those we've lost, but we can support \n     those still suffering. All we're asking is that our \n     government face up to the wrong that has been done . . . that \n     someday soon our government will do what should [have] been \n     done long ago.\n\n  It takes courage to speak out. It takes courage to speak truth to \npower. These folks are heroes, and on this 70th anniversary, I want to \nsay to them: Thank you. Thank you for making your voices heard. Thank \nyou for making your stories known. And thank you for refusing to give \nup. I will not give up, either. Together, we will keep working for \nfairness, and the day will come when we can stand together in Tularosa \nand light the candles of remembrance and finally say justice has been \ndone.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Tennessee, Mr. Corker, and I\n\n[[Page S5147]]\n\nbe permitted to engage in a short colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Shooting in Chattanooga\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the details are still coming in, but \nearlier today, between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., there was a violent attack \nin Chattanooga, where Senator Corker was once mayor. Right now Federal, \nState, and local officials are responding in Tennessee.\n  I am deeply disturbed by the reports. We understand that the shooting \ntook place at the Naval Reserve Center in Chattanooga and that a police \nofficer has been injured. We also understand that other individuals at \nthe Naval Reserve Center may have been injured as well. Many local \nbusinesses, schools, and hospitals are locked down.\n  I have been in touch with Federal, State, and local officials and \nwill continue to monitor the situation closely. My thoughts and prayers \nare with all of those involved.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I wish to join our senior Senator in \nexpressing our deep sorrow for those who have been affected and \nextending our thoughts and prayers to the families. Details are still \nemerging. We believe this took place in multiple locations, and I know \nthe local representatives there are dealing with this effectively as \nthey move ahead.\n  I thank the Senator for having us take the time right now to express \nour sorrow and support for those who are dealing with this issue. I \nhope those who were injured will survive and end up having full lives, \nbut we know some people were tragically injured. I appreciate the \nreach-out that has taken place at the local, State, and Federal level \nto ensure that we are aware of what is occurring.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                  charter school authorizing language\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with Senator Alexander.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FLAKE. As the Senate prepares to vote on the Every Child Achieves \nAct, I wish to commend Senator Alexander for working with me to include \nlanguage regarding charter school authorizers in the substitute \namendment language.\n  A charter school authorizer is an entity approved by the State \nlegislature and is responsible for establishing charter schools' \nacademic and accountability standards, among other things. State \ncharter laws vary from State to State in regards to how and to whom \nauthorizers are subject to accountability. For example, a State with \nindependent or multiple authorizers gives entities other than local \neducation boards or the State board, the authority to approve charter \nschools. These entities are typically outside the traditional education \nstructure of a state and can include independent, statewide charter \nschool boards, or colleges and universities. According to the Center \nfor Education Reform, ``there is a direct correlation between States \nwith multiple authorizers and higher student achievement.'' Out of 44 \nState laws, 21 States have created independent authorizers.\n  The language in the underlying Every Child Achieves Act encouraged \nStates applying for grants to Support High-Quality Charter Schools \n(Sec. 5103) to establish authorizing standards of an authorized public \nchartering agency, despite the fact that some States don't have any \nexplicit authority over charter school authorizing. This language \ndidn't take into consideration the variation of State by State \nauthorizing structures for charter schools and required that the \nFederal Government, not States, dictate how and what charter \nauthorizing agencies must do to demonstrate success. In addition, \nsubjecting charter schools to the same rules governing traditional \npublic institutions would make them identical to the very entities that \ncharter schools were meant to provide an alternative to.\n  The language that Chairman Alexander and I worked with, and \nultimately included in the substitute, recognizes that some States have \nelected to use multiple or independent authorizers and ensures that \nthose States don't have to add an additional layer of bureaucracy to \nreceive grants under the Every Child Achieves Act.\n  This bill goes a long way in recognizing that Washington cannot be a \nnational school board, and that is why it is imperative that the \nFederal Government continue to encourage States to determine their own \nauthorizing standards and learn what works best for their students.\n  The Center for Education Reform, a leading organization promoting \ncharter education supported the language in the substitute explaining \n``. . . Charter schools are public schools, which are free from many \nonerous rules but accountable for performance to their authorizers, \nwhich vary State by State. The substitute ensures respect for those \nindividual differences State by State as well as the hard work they are \ndoing to ensure the proliferation of quality schooling option for all \nchildren.''\n  I commend Chairman Alexander for his hard work on this legislation, \nand for working with me to ensure States, not the Federal Government, \nare determining charter authorizing standards.\n  Senator ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Flake for his hard \nwork to ensure that charter schools and their authorizers continue to \noperate with the flexibility needed for them to thrive. Charter schools \nare public schools that provide more choices for parents to improve \ntheir children's future and more freedom for teachers and principals to \nincrease the academic performance of their students. The Every Child \nAchieves Act supports charter schools in many ways by solidifying \nFederal support for expanding and replicating high-quality charter \nschools with a demonstrated record of success, giving States more \nflexibility to invest in new school models and encouraging them to \nstrengthen charter school authorizing practices. The language \nchampioned by Senator Flake will promote quality charter authorizing \nactivities without imposing layers of Federal bureaucracy and \nstructures that are incompatible with State practices and laws. As we \nfix a law that has effectively resulted in 100,000 public schools being \ncontrolled by a National School Board in the U.S. Department of \nEducation, it is important to recognize the variance in State laws \ngoverning charter schools and empower States to determine their own \nquality standards.\n  Today, nearly 2.9 million students--6 percent of U.S. public school \nstudents--were enrolled in approximately 6,700 charter schools, and \njust over the past year, charter school enrollment has grown by over 14 \npercent, or an additional 348,000 students. I commend Senator Flake on \nhis actions to strengthen the program and to promote better State \ncharter school policies and activities that help high quality charter \nschools continue to grow and flourish.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2161\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, when all students have the chance to \nlearn, we strengthen our future workforce. Our country grows stronger. \nWe empower the next generation of Americans to lead the world. We \ncreate more opportunities for more families, and we help the economy \ngrow from the middle out, not the top down.\n  But today, across the country, stark educational inequalities exist. \nThe students in some schools simply don't have the same opportunity to \ngraduate college-and-career ready like other students do. In our \ncountry, all students should have access to a quality public education, \nno matter where they live, how they learn, or how much money their \nparents make.\n  So that is why I am glad our bipartisan bill to fix No Child Left \nBehind has Federal protections to hold schools accountable for \neducating all students. And I will continue to fight for stronger \nprotections as the bill moves forward.\n  But educating all students is a tall order if schools don't have the \nvery resources that help students succeed. That is why it is so \nimportant to make sure States address inequalities in resources. \nSenators Kirk, Reed, Baldwin, and Brown offered a bipartisan amendment \nthat would help schools and States address persistent inequalities in \nresources and opportunities. I strongly urged my colleagues to support \nit.\n  Students do better in school when they have access to a well-rounded \neducation. That includes rigorous coursework that helps prepare \nstudents for a college curriculum. It includes offering classes like \narts, music, physical\n\n[[Page S5148]]\n\neducation, and STEM education. It includes setting up effective school \nlibrary programs that can inspire in kids a love for reading. Those \nclasses and those programs create a school environment where students \ncan learn and thrive.\n  But too many students across the country do not have access to those \ncritical resources. And too often, it is students of color, kids with \ndisabilities, English-language learners, and students from low-income \nbackgrounds who have the least access to resources that can help them \nget ahead.\n  Take experienced teachers, for example. Students of color are more \nlikely to have a teacher who is new to the profession. These students \noften don't have access to advanced classes and classes like art and \nmusic. Students of color are more likely than their White peers to go \nto a high school that does not offer AP classes. In fact, 20 percent of \nAfrican-American high schoolers go to a high school that does not offer \nAP classes. And in 2008, White students were twice as likely to have \naccess to arts education as African-American and Hispanic students.\n  The same inequality exists for access to technology. Students from \nlow-income backgrounds often don't have access to the Internet or to \ncomputers, compared to their peers. A study from Stanford University \nput this into sharp focus. The researchers asked teachers if their \nstudents have the digital tools they need to effectively complete \nassignments at home. More than half of teachers from more affluent \nschools said yes. But just 3 percent of teachers from high-poverty \nschools said their students had access to tools like computers and the \nInternet.\n  All of this inequality holds students back. It widens achievement \ngaps. It robs students of the chance to learn and excel in the \nclassroom. And we need to do something about it, so all students have \nthe opportunity to learn.\n  We have made important progress in the Every Child Achieves Act. \nUnder the current bill, school districts will already be required to \nreport on: access to safe and healthy school environments, per-pupil \nexpenditures, access to advanced coursework, the number of children \nenrolled in preschool, and teacher qualifications. And that is a good \nstep in the right direction.\n  But this bipartisan amendment would take the next step. First, it \nwould expand the list of resource indicators to include things like \naccess to art and music and dedicated school library programs. And it \nwould give States a choice on which resources will be the most \nmeaningful in their communities.\n  Most importantly, this amendment would help States remedy opportunity \ngaps across school districts. It does this by requiring States to \ncreate a plan to improve access to resources in the schools that lack \nthose tools. And because the plans will be designed by the States and \nmust include input from the communities, these plans will be tailored \nto fit the needs of local school districts. And States would be \nrequired to disaggregate the data on how resources are distributed by \nincome, race, language proficiency, and disability. That will shine a \nlight on if some groups of students are not getting the kinds of \nopportunities as others. And it will help parents know which resources \ntheir local schools offer and where the gaps are.\n  In short, this amendment will help strengthen our commitment to \nproviding a quality education to all students. This amendment is also \nimportant for another key reason. Of course, nearly everyone agrees \nthat the current law, No Child Left Behind, is badly broken. And one of \nthe main reasons is that it placed an almost singular focus on test \nscores for reading and math. But test scores do not paint the whole \npicture of how a school is performing.\n  This amendment would give parents and communities a more holistic \nview to determine if a school is providing a quality learning \nenvironment for all students. And most importantly, this will help \nStates focus resources on traditionally underserved populations so they \nwill get the supports they need to succeed.\n  Now, some of my Republican colleagues have argued that we don't need \nthis amendment because States and school districts should be \nresponsible for solving resource disparities. But for too long, States \nand school districts have gotten off the hook for stark inequality. \nThat is why we have seen the persistent inequality of some schools \nsimply not getting the resources they need to help their students \nsucceed. And that needs to end.\n  This amendment would not tell States how to address inequality. But \nit would require them to identify the disparities that exist and to \ncreate a plan to address them. That is why this amendment would be a \ngood step in the right direction.\n  I know that others have argued that simply reporting the disparities \nbetween resources would be enough. But acknowledging the problem won't \nnecessarily solve the problem. And on something as important as \nensuring that students have equal opportunities to succeed, we need \naction. And that is why I believe it is so important that this \namendment would help States act to address inequalities.\n  This isn't just important for student success in the classroom. It \nhas long-term implications for our country. When some students don't \nhave the chance to graduate from high school college-and-career ready, \nwe lose out on the full potential of our Nation's future workforce, \nentrepreneurs, and leaders. In the years to come, our economy will rely \non the students of today being able to take on and create the jobs of \nthe 21st century economy. We can help States and school districts make \nsure all students have the resources that defines a quality education \nby supporting this bill and this amendment. These resources are \nfundamental to student success--in school and in the future. So I urge \nmy colleagues to support this amendment to address resources equity.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2247, as Modified\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I wish to talk about my reasons \nfor voting against Senator Burr's amendment to change the title I \nformula and on cloture to cut off debate on the Every Child Achieves \nAct.\n  The bill before us is not perfect, but it is a step in the right \ndirection towards giving all kids a shot at quality education and \nfixing the failures of No Child Left Behind. I support a number of the \nprovisions in this bill, including raising academic standards for \nstudents, supporting teachers with additional development tools, and \nproviding resources to the lowest performing schools.\n  However, the bill also includes an amendment offered by Senator Burr \nto change the title I formula, which would drastically and negatively \naffect Maryland. Every single school district in my State would have \nlost money.\n  I could not let that happen. So I rolled up my sleeves and got to \nwork. I formed a coalition with other Senators whose students--like \nmine--would lose under this amendment. The amendment was eventually \nchanged. Now it says that any funds Congress appropriates for title I \nabove $17 billion will be subject to a new formula. Since title I is \ncurrently funded at $14.5 billion, the new formula will not kick in at \nany time soon and Maryland won't lose any of its funds.\n  I am happy that I saved Maryland from losing $40 million, but the \nlanguage sets a terrible precedent. It penalizes States that do right \nby their students and their schools. As the Senator for Maryland, I \ncan't support any formula that could cause Maryland to lose Federal \ndollars in the future--even one labeled a ``compromise.'' As vice \nchairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I cannot support any \ndisincentive to fully fund title I when additional funds would harm \nMaryland.\n  As long as this amendment is included, I cannot vote to move this \nbill forward and will vote no on cloture.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for the \nEvery Child Achieves Act. I would like to thank Senator Alexander and \nSenator Murray for their hard work on this legislation. This bipartisan \nbill offers an opportunity for real progress in educating our children.\n  The Every Child Achieves Act takes an important step forward in \nupdating the badly broken No Child Left Behind Act. This \nreauthorization is greatly needed to support Washington State's \nstudents, educators, and families. Currently in Washington, our schools \nmust still comply with the original and most onerous requirements of No \nChild Left Behind since our flexibility waiver was\n\n[[Page S5149]]\n\nrevoked in 2014. The Every Child Achieves Act would end the States' \nneed for waivers and provide them with greater flexibility to come up \nwith state-led education plans.\n  I have visited a number of schools in Washington and I have heard \nfrom so many of my constituents about the need to improve this law to \nbetter support our Nation's teachers and students. I am pleased that \nthe Senate was able to have this important debate that is critical to \nour Nation's progress.\n  Today, we live in a global economy and our children are not only \ncompeting with other students in the United States but with students \nacross the world. Therefore, I am particularly interested in science, \ntechnology, engineering, and math education to keep American students \ncompetitive in the 21st century. Washington State ranks first in the \nNation in the concentration of STEM-related jobs, and it is essential \nthat we invest in our future workforce.\n  The Every Child Achieves Act includes an important dedicated funding \nstream to support partnerships between schools, businesses, \nuniversities, and nonprofit organizations to support student \nachievement and teacher training in STEM subjects. I am a strong \nsupporter of these partnerships and I am pleased that the bill also \nincludes a provision with an emphasis on increasing access to STEM \nsubjects for women, minorities, economically disadvantaged students, \nand other groups that are frequently underrepresented in STEM subjects.\n  Additionally, I am pleased that this bill includes a new competitive \ngrant program championed by my colleague, Senator Murray, to enable \nStates to improve early childhood learning. I long have supported early \nchildhood learning due to its importance to developing young minds and \nintelligence. These grants would target resources for low- and \nmoderate-income families.\n  There are few programs more important than early childhood education \nin preparing children to succeed. I am proud to be a cosponsor of \nSenator Casey's Strong Start for America's Children amendment, which I \nregret did not receive enough votes for adoption. This would have \nestablished a partnership between the Federal Government and the States \nto fund high-quality kindergarten programs for low- and moderate-income \nfamilies.\n  Washington State has been on the fore-front of early education and \nsince 2006, the Department of Early Learning has ensured that \nWashington students have access to high-quality learning opportunities, \nso that they are prepared for kindergarten and a successful school \ncareer. According to the Washington State Department of Early Learning, \nthere is clear and convincing science that early childhood is a \ncritical time for mental development. Economists and social scientists \nhave found that for every $1 invested in high-quality early learning, \nat least $3 are returned in reduced costs for remedial education, \npublic safety, health care, and other social spending. I would call \nthis a good return on investment.\n  In closing, I would like to commend my colleague Senator Murray for \nher leadership and for her steadfast commitment to ensure that STEM \neducation and early childhood education were included in the Every \nChild Achieves Act. I was happy to partner with her on these efforts. I \nurge my colleagues to support these important investments in our \nNation's education system.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

On this vote, the yeas are 79, the nays are \n18.\n  Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Under the previous order, there is now 4 minutes of debate equally \ndivided between Senators Alexander and Murray.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I first want to thank Chairman Alexander \nfor working with me on the Every Child Achieves Act. He has been a \ngreat partner in getting us to this point with this bill. This process \nstarted when he and I agreed that No Child Left Behind is badly broken \nand needs to be fixed. Our bill, the Every Child Achieves Act, is an \nimportant step forward to do just that.\n  The current law overemphasized test scores. Our bill will give States \nflexibility to use multiple measures, not just test scores, to \ndetermine how well a school is performing. Our bill also eliminates the \none-size-fits-all provisions of No Child Left Behind that have been so \ndamaging for our schools and our districts. Instead, it allows our \ncommunities, our parents, and our teachers to work together to improve \nschools and ensure that every child can get a well-rounded education.\n  Our bill maintains Federal protections to help students graduate from \nhigh school with the tools they need to compete and lead in the 21st \ncentury economy. This is a good bill. I will keep working, of course, \nto make it better--even after our vote today--in conference.\n  I hope we can continue to build on the Senate's strong bipartisan \nwork. I will continue to push to strengthen the accountability measures \nin our bill and\n\n[[Page S5150]]\n\naddress inequality in schools. But today I urge my colleagues to vote \nto pass the Every Child Achieves Act that will give all students the \nchance to learn and grow and thrive. Let's fix No Child Left Behind. \nLet's prove that Congress can break through gridlock and work together. \nLet's pass this bill for students, parents, teachers, and communities \nacross the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an extra \nminute if I need it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, Senator Murray suggested we work on \nthis in a bipartisan way. I took her advice. It was good advice. This \nis the result. We have had 100 amendments in committee and on the \nfloor. We have had excellent process. I thank the majority leader. I \nthank Senator Reid, the Democratic leader, for creating an environment \nto do that.\n  Now, let me say this about the vote we are about to have. This is a \nlaw that everybody wants fixed. We have a consensus on that. We have a \nconsensus on how to fix it: keep the important measurements of academic \nachievement and turn the rest of it over to the States, to classroom \nteachers, and others who are closest to the children. That is what the \nGovernors, that is what the superintendents, that is what the teachers \norganizations have said to us. They want us to fix it. They support the \nway we are proposing to fix it.\n  Now, in the last few years, we have created in this country, in \neffect, a national school board. It has made it harder to have better \nteaching, harder to set higher standards, harder to have real \naccountability in the States. So we changed that. We reversed the trend \ntoward the national school board. We end the common core mandate. We \nend the waivers that the U.S. Department of Education is using to run \npublic schools. We end DC evaluating teachers. We end adequate yearly \nprogress.\n  Some are saying vote no because you should go further. Well, we had a \nchance to go further. We voted for the Daines amendment, the Scott \namendment, and the Alexander amendment. That would have gotten us 90 \npercent of what we wanted. We got about 45 votes, so we didn't get \nanything. This gets us about 80 percent of what we want. A President \nnamed Reagan used to say: If you got 80 percent of what you wanted, you \nmight take it and fight for the rest on another day. I am recommending \nwe follow this advice.\n  If we vote no today, that means we leave the Common Core mandate \nright where it is. That means the waivers are still running your \nschools. That means adequate yearly progress is determined from \nWashington, DC, not in your hometown, and that means Washington, DC, is \nevaluating your teachers. Everybody wants this law fixed. If you vote \nno, we fix nothing. We fix nothing. So no means we haven't fixed \nanything. So vote yes. Do what the Governors, do what the \nsuperintendents, do what the teachers say we ought to do. They all \nagree on that. This is the most important step in that direction we \nhave had in 25 years. Let's not miss the opportunity. Vote to restore \nto the people closest to the children the responsibility for their \neducation. Vote yes for local control of public schools.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the bill having been \nread the third time, the question is, Shall it pass?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom South Carolina (Mr. Graham).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Florida (Mr. Nelson) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 81, nays 17, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 249 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--81\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Baldwin\n     Barrasso\n     Bennet\n     Blumenthal\n     Boozman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burr\n     Cantwell\n     Capito\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Cassidy\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coons\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Cotton\n     Donnelly\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Ernst\n     Feinstein\n     Fischer\n     Franken\n     Gardner\n     Gillibrand\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heinrich\n     Heitkamp\n     Heller\n     Hirono\n     Hoeven\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kaine\n     King\n     Kirk\n     Klobuchar\n     Lankford\n     Leahy\n     Manchin\n     Markey\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Perdue\n     Peters\n     Portman\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rounds\n     Sanders\n     Schatz\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shaheen\n     Stabenow\n     Sullivan\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Tillis\n     Toomey\n     Udall\n     Warner\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--17\n\n     Blunt\n     Booker\n     Crapo\n     Cruz\n     Daines\n     Flake\n     Lee\n     Moran\n     Murphy\n     Paul\n     Risch\n     Rubio\n     Sasse\n     Scott\n     Shelby\n     Vitter\n     Warren\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Graham\n     Nelson\n       \n  The bill (S. 1177), as amended, was passed.\n  (The bill, as amended, will be printed in a future edition of the \nRecord.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the vote was 81 to 17. What that says \nto me and should say to the American people is that not only is there a \nconsensus in this country that everybody wants to fix No Child Left \nBehind, that is the consensus we began with. Not only was there \nconsensus in the Senate's education committee about how to fix it--\nwhich was unanimous in a 22-member committee that includes Members who \nare about as diverse as you could find in the Senate--the entire Senate \nhas a consensus on how to fix it.\n  The Senator from Washington and I were just talking. This is a \ncomplicated piece of legislation. There are crocodiles in every corner, \nany of which could have made it difficult for this bill to succeed. For \nthe Senate to take a look at the 100,000 schools in this country for \nthe 50 million children and the 3.5 million teachers and say, ``We hear \nyou. We know you want to end the confusion, the anxiety, and the \nfeeling that you are not in charge of your own children. We hear you. \nWe have listened to you, and we have come up with a solution with which \nyou agree''--and that we voted by a vote of 81 to 17 is a remarkable \nevent.\n  So we have a remarkable consensus that No Child Left Behind needed to \nbe fixed. We had a remarkable consensus on how to fix it in the \ncommittee. There are not many times on a bill this difficult and this \nencompassing that we have a consensus this remarkable--81 to 17--in the \nSenate. I mentioned in my earlier remarks the importance of the Senate \nin this way.\n  Someone said the Senate is the one authentic piece of genius in the \nAmerican political system. The only claim we would have to that exalted \ndescription would be that we are the only part of our government that \nis created for the express purpose of developing consensus. The House \nof Representatives is America's sounding board. The country moves \nsuddenly, the House moves suddenly. Our job is to take all the \ndifferent points of view and to consult with each other and to see \nwhether we can create the kind of consensus so that when people look at \nthe Senate and see a result, they may say: Well, I am not sure I agree \nwith every single thing they did, but if 81 Senators of\n\n[[Page S5151]]\n\nboth parties--out of 100--believe this is the right way to fix No Child \nLeft Behind, I will accept it.\n  That is the way the civil rights bill was done in the 1960s and the \n1970s. Large majorities--bipartisan groups--came to a complicated \ndecision on a complex problem. The way you govern a complex country is \nby consensus, and the only agency in the government that is capable of \ncreating that kind of consensus on a major piece of legislation is the \nUnited States Senate. It has done that today, and I am very proud of my \ncolleagues for the way they have done this.\n  I especially thank the majority leader for creating the time to deal \nwith it. We took a little more than a week. We came on the floor a week \nago Tuesday, so we didn't really take that long. We got on and off the \nfloor pretty quick. I also thank him for creating an environment where \nwe could adopt a lot of amendments. Senators are here to have their say \nwhether or not we agree. People of North Dakota expect that. People of \nTexas expect that. Senator McConnell has created that environment.\n  Senator Cornyn, Senator Thune, Senator Barrasso, and the other \nleaders on the Republican side have been an enormous help.\n  I have during the week thanked the Democratic leader, Senator Reid. \nSenator Reid allowed this bill to come to the floor without delay. That \nhelps a lot. During the week, he, Senator Schumer, Senator Durbin, and \nthe other members of the Democratic leadership, along with Senator \nMurray, created the environment where we could do what we have \naccomplished--especially Senator Murray. I have often said that the \nreason we are here is because she suggested to me a way to go forward, \na way to do this together. She did that after both of us watched the \nlast two Congresses where we just fell apart in the partisan \ndifferences. I took her advice--it was good advice--and that is why we \nare where we are today. I deeply respect the way she works toward a \nresult. She is deeply passionate on the things she cares about, but she \nknows we are here to get a result, and that means in this case we need \nto work with the House of Representatives, which we will begin to do in \nthe next few weeks. Then we will produce a bill and send it to the \nPresident in a form he is comfortable signing.\n  There are a number of Senators who, because we are able to offer \namendments on the floor, withheld their amendment or stepped aside \nbecause what they were doing might have interfered with our result. I \nthink of Senator Franken on an amendment he feels powerfully about. He \nstepped aside and didn't offer it in committee but waited until the \nfloor. Senator Vitter stepped aside on an amendment he felt strongly \nabout because he could bring it up in the Judiciary Committee. Senator \nLee, Senator Toomey, and Senator Burr all did that. They showed some \nrestraint in pursuit of a result.\n\n  I thank those outside this Senate whose work was so important to us. \nThere are a lot of remarkable things about this consensus, but none was \nmore remarkable than what those outside of the Congress thought. It is \nrare that you see the National Governors Association, the Council of \nChief State School Officers, the American Association of School \nAdministrators, the National Education Association, and the American \nFederation of Teachers all agree that not only did No Child Left Behind \nneed to be fixed but that this was the way to fix it, and that made it \neasier to get a vote of 81 to 17.\n  Finally, all of us in the Senate know how important staff work is. In \nthis case, staffs have worked for days and days, and the trust Senator \nMurray and I have developed is the same kind of trust they have \ndeveloped. So I especially thank David Cleary, who is the staff \ndirector of the education committee, our HELP Committee, Peter \nOppenheim, Lindsay Fryer, Lindsey Seidman, Liz Wolgemuth, Jim Jeffries, \nMargaret Atkinson, Bill Knudsen, Jordan Hynes, Steve Townsend, Hillary \nKnudson, Jake Baker, Kayla McMurray, Bobby McMillin, Matthew Stern, \nDiane Tran, Haley Hudler, Patrick Murray, and Allison Martin.\n  On Senator Murray's exceptional staff, I thank Evan Schatz, Sarah \nBolton, Mike Spahn, Amanda Beaumont, John Righter, Jake Cornet, Leanne \nHotek, Allie Kimmel, Aissa Canchola, Ariel Evans, Aurora Steinle, \nLeslie Clithero, Sarah Cupp, Eli Zupnik, and Helen Hare.\n  On the floor, I thank those who have the oil cans, Laura Dove and \nRobert Duncan, who keep this side greased and working, Gary Myrick on \nSenator Reid's side, Chris Tuck, Mary Elizabeth Taylor, Megan Mercer, \nTony Hanagan, Mike Smith, and Chloe Barz.\n  I would also like to thank the Senate Legislative Counsel's staff who \nworked long hours on the bill and then on the amendments, so I would \nlike to especially thank Amy Gaynor, Kristin Romero, and Margaret \nBomba.\n  We always rely on the experts at the Congressional Research Service \nto give us good information in a timely manner, so on behalf of the \nCommittee I extend our thanks to Becky Skinner, Jeff Kuenzi, Jody \nFeder, and Gail McCallion.\n  On Senator McConnell's staff, I would like to thank Sharon \nSoderstrom, Don Stewart, Jen Kuskowski, Katelyn Conner, Erica Suares, \nJohn Abegg, Neil Chatterjee, and Johnathan Burks.\n  On Senator Cornyn's staff, I thank Russ Thomasson, Monica Popp, Emily \nKirlin, John Chapuis, and Michele Chin.\n  I would also like to thank the following staff who played critical \nroles to help pass this important legislation. Dana Barbieri with the \nRepublican Policy Committee: Meghan Taira and Veronica Duron with \nSenator Schumer; Dena Morris and Brad Middleton with Senator Durbin; \nNatasha Hickman and Chris Toppings with Senator Burr; Josh Yurek with \nSenator Roberts; Tara Shaw and Kristin Chapman with Senator Enzi; \nNatalie Burkhalter with Senator Paul; Bret Layson with Senator Isakson; \nKatie Neil and Bill Castle with Senator Hatch; Katie Brown with Senator \nCollins; Karen McCarthy with Senator Murkowski; Cade Clurman with \nSenator Kirk; Lizzy Simmons, Will Holloway, and Daniel Bunn with \nSenator Scott; Pam Davidson and Chris Gillott with Senator Cassidy; \nJosh Delaney and Julie Morgan with Senator Warren; David Cohen with \nSenator Sanders; Brenna Barber, and Chris Stavish with Senator \nWhitehouse; Michael DiNapoli and Brian Moulton with Senator Baldwin; \nBrent Palmer with Senator Mikulski; Jared Solomon and Joe Hill with \nSenator Casey; Boris Granovskiy and Gohar Sedighi with Senator Franken; \nJuliana Hermann with Senator Bennet; Russell Armstrong with Senator \nMurphy; Aisha Woodward with Senator King; David Cole with Senator \nMcCain; Sharon Burd with Senator Fischer; Dana Richter with Senator \nCapito; Jordan Hess with the Republican Steering Committee; Christy \nKnese with Senator Lee; Devon Brenner and Constance Payne with Senator \nCochran; Jennifer Bowman with Senator Inhofe; Crystal Martinez with \nSenator Feinstein; Nancy Richardson and Viraj Mirani with Senator \nCoats; Desiree Mowry with Senator Blunt; Moira Lenehan with Senator \nReed; Mary Blanche Hankey with Senator Sessions; Jessica-Phillips Tyson \nwith Senator Graham; Jane Lucas and Jon Abdnor with Senator Thune; \nTravis Johnson and Kate LaBorde with Senator Vitter; Daniel Auger with \nSenator Ayotte; Jennifer Humphrey and Toni-Marie Higgins with Senator \nBoozman; Mike Thomas with Senator Cardin; Robert Murray with Senator \nWicker; Brian Perkins with Senator Moran; Shawn Affolter with Senator \nHoeven; Emily Bouck with Senator Rubio; Sean Riley with Senator \nJohnson; James Mikolowsky and Ethan Saxon with Senator Blumenthal; \nRachel Green with Senator Heller; Will Holloway and Daniel Bunn with \nSenator Scott; Sarah Towles with Senator Flake; Jonathan Elkin with \nSenator Hirono; Elizabeth Hill with Senator Heinrich; Jeff Murray, \nAndrew White, and Courtney Asbill with Senator Cruz; Clint Bowers with \nSenator Heitkamp; Chris Slevin and Ashley Eden with Senator Booker; \nCurtis Swager and Alison Toal with Senator Gardner; Katherine Mayne \nwith Senator Lankford; John Martin with Senator Cotton; Dan Gerig with \nSenator Daines; John Eustice with Senator Perdue; Joe Nolan with \nSenator Tillis; Peter Eckrich with Senator Rounds; Tony Frye with \nSenator Ernst; Alyene Senger and Andy Reuss\n\n[[Page S5152]]\n\nwith Senator Sasse, and Kate Wolgemuth with Senator Sullivan.\n  I also thank members of the education community for their persistent \nhelp with this bill, including Mary Kusler with the National Education \nAssociation; Tor Cowan with the American Federation of Teachers; Chris \nMinnich, Peter Zamora Carissa Moffat Miller, and Jessah Walker with the \nCouncil of Chief State School Officers. There are many others who have \nhelped, but this is a day I am very proud of the Senate. For 50 million \nchildren, 3\\1/2\\ million teachers, and 100,000 public schools, it is a \nbig step forward.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the senior Senator from Tennessee, as \nhe often does, has laid it out very well. I believe it is the case the \nU.S. Senate is the only legislative body in the world where a simple \nmajority is not enough on almost everything.\n  This body was crafted in a way that would ensure, unless one side has \na really big majority, that we work together, but it doesn't \nautomatically work unless you have leaders like Senator Alexander and \nSenator Murray who want to get a result.\n  So I want to commend both these outstanding Senators for an \nextraordinary accomplishment. This is a significant bill for the \ncountry, and to fold all of these disparate interest groups, with all \ntheir separate agendas, into a position of support was an extraordinary \nleadership contribution. So I say to both of you, both the Senator from \nWashington and the Senator from Tennessee, the Senate is proud of you \nfor what you did here.\n  This is a good example for all the rest of us. On a little more \ncontentious issue, Senator Murray and I had a chance to work together \non trade promotion authority. We hope to do that on highways. We hope \nto do it on cyber security. The Senate is back to work. I think Members \non both sides appreciate that, and we are going to continue to do this, \nbut I thank both Senators for providing a wonderful example for all the \nrest of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I recently heard from a teacher in \nSeattle by the name of Lyon Terry. Over the course of his 17-year \ncareer, he has taught second, third, and fourth grade. What makes Mr. \nTerry a great teacher is the way he engages with his students. He \nstarts the morning by playing songs on his guitar. He keeps his \nstudents laughing with jokes, and every day he tries to create an \nenvironment where kids want to come to school.\n  Last year, he was named Washington State Teacher of the Year for \n2015. This week, Mr. Terry has been following our debate on the Senate \nfloor, and he was truly hoping we would pass this bill because he says \nthe current law doesn't reflect the work he and his fellow teachers at \nLawton Elementary School are doing every day.\n  So let me echo the words of the chairman of our committee and the \nmajority leader. I am proud today that the Senate passed a bill to fix \nNo Child Left Behind for teachers like Mr. Terry, for parents, for \ncommunities, and most importantly for our students--a bill to continue \nour mission of delivering on the promise of providing every child with \nthe best our Nation can provide.\n  I have been very proud to partner with Chairman Alexander on the \nEvery Child Achieves Act, and I want to thank him tremendously for the \nsuccessful bipartisan process we have had. I want to thank all our \ncolleagues on the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nfor their work and dedication in moving this bill forward. And, of \ncourse, I want to thank the staff as well--both my staff and the staff \nof Senator Alexander--for all of their hard work. They have worked \nmany, many, many long days and late nights and weekends to get us to \nthis point today.\n  I will submit a full list of names later, but there are some staffers \nin particular I want to recognize. On Senator Alexander's staff, I want \nto acknowledge and thank his staff director David Cleary, as well as \nLindsey Seidman, Peter Oppenheim, and Lindsay Fryer. They have done an \nexcellent job. On my staff, I want to acknowledge and thank my staff \ndirector Evan Shatz, and my education policy director Sarah Bolton for \ntheir outstanding leadership, as well as Amanda Beaumont, Leanne Hotek, \nAllie Kimmel, Aissa Canchola, Ariel Evans, Jake Cornett, Leslie \nClithero, Aurora Steinle, Helen Hare, and Mary Robbins. Thank you for \nall of your hard work on this important bill.\n  I, too, want to thank our floor staff on our side, Gary Myrick, Tim \nMitchell, Tricia Engle, and all our floor staff--Republican and \nDemocratic--for their help and guidance. We couldn't be here without \nthem.\n  I want to take a step back for a moment to look at the work we have \ndone so far and the work that remains even beyond the vote we had \ntoday.\n  Of course, nearly everyone agrees No Child Left Behind is badly \nbroken. That goes almost without saying. I have heard it from so many \nparents, teachers, and administrators in Washington State--Democrats, \nRepublicans, and Independents. They are sick and tired of the broken \nlaw in front of us. They want Congress to fix it, and they do not want \nus to wait any longer.\n  That is why I am so proud our bill, the Every Child Achieves Act, is \na strong step in the right direction to finally fix the broken No Child \nLeft Behind law and make sure all of our students have access to a \nhigh-quality public education.\n  For one, our bill addresses high-stakes testing. The current law \noveremphasizes test scores to measure how students are doing in school. \nOur bill will give flexibility to States to use multiple measures, not \njust test scores, to determine how well a school is performing. These \nsteps will reduce the pressure on students, teachers, and parents so \nthey can focus less on test prep and more on learning.\n  Our bill eliminates the one-size-fits-all provisions of No Child Left \nBehind that have been so damaging for our schools and our districts. \nInstead, it allows communities and parents and teachers to work \ntogether to improve their schools and ensure that every child gets a \nwell-rounded education. Our bill maintains Federal protections to help \nstudents graduate from high school college- and career-ready.\n  When the education committee debated the bill, I was very proud to \nwork on a bipartisan amendment with Senator Isakson to expand and \nimprove on early learning programs. As a former preschool teacher, I \nhave seen the kind of transformation early learning can inspire in a \nchild. So I am very glad this bill will help us expand access to high-\nquality early childhood education so more kids can start kindergarten \nready to learn.\n  I have also seen fixing the current law as a multistage process. At \nthe beginning of this year, as the chairman said, he released his \ndiscussion draft for reauthorizing ESEA. After that, the two of us had \na conversation about a path as to how to move forward. Instead of going \ndown a partisan path and letting politics become our guide, we agreed \nto work together to find common ground. We agreed to do everything we \ncould to put our students first, to put the families and communities we \nrepresent first, to break through the gridlock and dysfunction that too \noften paralyzes this Congress, and to chart a path to fix a broken law.\n  I again want to commend my partner Chairman Alexander for sticking to \nthat approach. He is a role model for all of us, and I appreciate all \nhe is doing. The result is our Every Child Achieves Act. It wasn't the \nbill I would have written on my own, I know it isn't the bill he would \nhave written on his own, but it is what is called a compromise. It is a \nstrong bill that all sides can be proud of.\n  After we negotiated our bipartisan compromise in April, we passed our \nbill out of committee with a unanimous vote--12 Republicans, 10 \nDemocrats. So I want to thank all of our Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee members who worked to improve and strengthen this \nbill in committee and all the Members--Democrats and Republicans on our \ncommittee and off--who wrote the dozens of amendments we included in \nour substitute and managers' packages, and all those who brought their \nideas to the floor and debated and voted on them over the past week on \nthe Senate floor.\n  Today, I am very proud we have passed this bill with a strong \nbipartisan vote. As we know, our work is not\n\n[[Page S5153]]\n\nyet done. Now we begin the next phase. As Chairman Alexander has said \nthroughout our floor debate, ultimately we need a bill President Obama \nwill sign into law, and though this bill has taken a number of steps in \nthe right direction, there are still a few more we need to do before \nour work is done. We have important work to do in conference to reach \nan agreement on a final bill.\n  The President has made it very clear to us he can only sign a bill \nthat strengthens the accountability measures in the Every Child \nAchieves Act and that addresses inequality, where some schools are \nunable to offer the same opportunities as others. I agree that is a \nmust, and I know I will continue to work hard, alongside ranking member \nBobby Scott in the House and the administration, to make accountability \nand resource equity a priority in conference.\n  The only way forward is for the strong bipartisan work we have seen \nin the Senate to continue in that process. Now, I will say, \nunfortunately, so far, House Republicans chose a partisan approach to \nreauthorize this bill. Their bill doesn't represent one end and ours \nrepresents another, where we have to meet in the middle. Their bill \nreally represents an unacceptable partisan approach and path and ours \nrepresents a carefully negotiated compromise with just a few important \nsteps to go.\n  So I hope in conference our friends in the House, the House \nRepublicans, will be ready to join House and Senate Democrats, Senate \nRepublicans, and the administration as we work together to get this \ndone in a way that works for all our students and families.\n  By working together, I am confident we can get this bill over the \nfinish line and fix this broken law for our teachers in my home State \nand across the country and help make sure all our students have a \nquality education. Delivering on that promise of a good education for \nall students will pay off for generations to come. This is one of the \nbest investments in our country we can make to ensure we have broad-\nbased and long-term economic growth because, as we all know, when \nstudents have the chance to learn, we strengthen our future workforce. \nWe know our country grows stronger and we empower the next generation \nof Americans to lead the world. We will help our economy grow from the \nmiddle out, not just the top down, and that is something we have known \nfor a long time.\n  Fifty years ago, in what would be just months before signing the \noriginal Elementary and Secondary Education Act into law, President \nJohnson said, when it comes to education, ``nothing matters more for \nthe future of our country.'' That is still true today. The future of \nour country hinges on our students' ability to one day lead the world.\n  So I am looking forward to our continued work on this Every Child \nAchieves Act for our students, for our parents, for our teachers, and \nfor the future of our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, it is my understanding we are in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, will the Senator from Indiana yield for \n60 seconds?\n  Mr. COATS. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I forgot to mention the number of \namendments that were considered, and I would like to place that in the \nRecord.\n  In the committee, we adopted 29 amendments. On the floor, 178 \namendments were filed, 78 were considered, and 65 amendments were \nadopted--10 of those through rollcall votes, 28 through voice votes, \nand 27 by unanimous consent through two managers' packages.\n  Nearly 100 amendments were adopted to the bipartisan draft that \nSenator Murray and I presented to our education committee earlier this \nyear. I think the fact so many Senators not only had a chance to have \ntheir say but had their ideas included in the bill--and I think \nespecially of the Senator from Rhode Island who has worked for the last \ncouple of years on a particular provision--was one important reason why \nwe had a consensus that rose to 81 votes.\n  I thank the Senator from Indiana for his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise to speak but first want to \nacknowledge and thank my colleague Senator Collins for allowing me to \nstep ahead of her in this process. I promise to be expeditious in terms \nof getting through this. It turns out her plane to Maine leaves later \nthan my plane to Indiana, so she has very graciously allowed me to go \nforward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/16/senate-section/article/S5153-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5153-S5154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WASTEFUL SPENDING\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the last 6 months of this Senate I have \nbeen coming down here every week to talk about the ``Waste of the \nWeek''--examples of waste, fraud, and abuse within the Federal \nGovernment. I can't believe this is No. 17. We are continuing to rack \nup significant savings to the taxpayer. We can eliminate these \ndocumented and certified wastes that have been determined through the \nvarious government agencies, inspectors general, and others.\n  Today we turn to a rather serious topic regarding the receipt of \ntaxpayer dollars by criminals who are avoiding felony arrest but are \nstill receiving benefits at taxpayers' expense.\n  Here is a little history. The Social Security Act currently prohibits \nthose fleeing justice from receiving Social Security and other Federal \nbenefits. Congress first addressed this issue in 1996, when it banned \nfugitive felons from receiving Social Security benefits. It then \nexpanded this prohibition in 2004 to also apply this ban to Social \nSecurity disability insurance and World War II benefits.\n  Unfortunately this law has run into some conflicting opinions by \ncourt challenges, which have weakened the effects of the law and led to \na lack of clarity in terms of what the original language and original \nintent by Congress was supposed to be. To address this problem--because \nit is a problem, and there is lack of clarity--I have this week \nintroduced legislation to amend the Social Security Act to clearly \nstate--to clarify--the intent of the law that prohibits fugitive felons \nfrom receiving Social Security retirement and disability benefits. My \nbill would clarify this law and return the implementation of the policy \nto its original intent.\n  Now, let me be clear. The government should not be providing benefits \nto those avoiding prosecution, custody or confinement for a crime or \nattempt to commit a crime that is considered a felony. But we are not \ntalking about individuals who get speeding tickets or make a mistake on \ntheir taxes. This legislation applies only to those with an arrest \norder for felony charges.\n  The crime must be of enough serious magnitude to carry with it a \nminimum sentence of 1 or more years in prison.\n  So we want to be careful here that we are not imposing this \nrestriction of receipt of benefits on someone who doesn't qualify under \nthe law, and that is another clarification that we want to make.\n  Furthermore, the bill retains the ability of the Social Security \nAdministration to continue or restore benefits if the individual can \nshow good cause--such as that they were exonerated of the crime or \nperhaps were victim of an identity theft or other legitimate reasons to \nnot lose benefits.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, this commonsense fix \ncould save taxpayers $4.8 billion over the next 10 years alone.\n  So the bottom line is this: We pull out our chart with our ever-\ngrowing gauge of money that has been wasted through fraud and abuse \nwithin the Federal Government. We are climbing very quickly to $100 \nbillion. I thought it would take a year to get there if I did one a \nweek. We are going to have to make a major extension to this chart or \nredo this because we are closing in on $100 billion of wasted taxpayer \nmoney documented by Federal Government agencies in investigations. So \npassage of this bill would add $4.8 billion to our chart.\n  We have come across so many instances of bloat, waste, fraud, and \nabuse. I could be down here every day the Senate is in session. I could \nbe down here every hour the Senate is in session--such is the \nstaggering amount of dysfunction occurring through this\n\n[[Page S5154]]\n\nbloated bureaucracy called the Federal Government.\n  Here we are, trying to protect taxpayers of our States who are \nstretched to the gills in terms of what they have to pay not only in \nFederal but State or sales--you name it--or real estate taxes that roll \nup and consume so much of everybody's weekly pay.\n  The least we can do--while we need to make major fixes to our fiscal \nproblems here--is take those that have been identified by legitimate \nneutral organizations--inspectors general of the United States, various \nagencies--bring those to light, and then do something about it and not \njust come down here and make a chart and add some red ink, but actually \nintroduce legislation, which I am trying to do on some of these pieces \nso that we can remedy this problem.\n  So meanwhile we have an administration here that has refused over and \nover to sit down and work out a long-term fiscal debt reduction \nprogram, which this country desperately needs because the debt clock is \nstill ticking away like crazy.\n  If you want to see it, go to my Web site at coats.senate.gov. We have \nthe clock right there. We haven't talked about it much down here \nlately. We made a big push earlier. Too many people have thrown up \ntheir hands and said that under this administration it is not going to \nhappen. That probably is right. But the least we can do then, until we \nget new management in the White House, is to find these issues of \nwaste, fraud, and abuse, and do something about it now. So that is what \nwe are trying to do.\n  I look forward to being back here next week with the latest edition \nof ``Waste of the Week.''\n  I thank my colleague from Maine for her patience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy).

Mr. President, the Senator from Maine is about to \nspeak I believe on the Older Americans Act.\n  While she is here on the floor, I wish to take a moment to express my \npersonal appreciation to her and to Chairman Alexander for an issue \nthat arose during the course of the Older Americans Act.\n  I have a very strong concern that older Americans, particularly as \nthey approach the end of their lives, are not getting their wishes \nhonored. In fact, very often nobody even knows what their wishes are \nabout how they would like to be treated at the end of their lives. Do \nthey want to be at home? Do they not particularly care about using all \nthe medical apparatuses available to them? Do they want to be in the \nhospital and have everybody take every available measure? That should \nbe their choice. It should be an informed choice and a choice that we \nshould honor.\n  I sought language within the Older Americans Act to try to empower \nthat. There were difficulties with it, and those difficulties were \nresolved by the willingness of Chairman Alexander to ask Chairman \nCollins to hold a hearing on this subject in the Select Committee on \nAging and for all of the chairmen and ranking members on the two \ncommittees to send a letter to the Government Accountability Office to \nlay out the case and put a factual brief before us for that hearing.\n  This would not have happened without the courtesy of Senator Collins. \nThis is an aging committee thing that she has been willing to do to \nresolve an issue that actually started in the HELP Committee. It was \nvery gracious of her. She has been a leader on these end-of-life issues \nfor a long time. I didn't want to miss this chance to express my \nappreciation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, before the Senator from Rhode Island \nleaves the floor, let me thank him for his kind comments. I have \nenjoyed working with him on issues such as hospice care and advanced \nplanning. I know these issues are very important to him, as they are to \nme. I am happy we are able to collaborate on a GAO request and also on \na hearing later this year.\n  So I thank him for his efforts in resolving this issue so that the \nreauthorization of the Older Americans Act could go forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/16/senate-section/article/S5154-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EVERY CHILD ACHIEVES ACT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, as the chairman of the Senate Special \nCommittee on Aging and as the cosponsor of the reauthorization of the \nOlder Americans Act, I also commend the chairman and the ranking member \nof the HELP Committee for their hard work over the past 2 years in \ndeveloping a bipartisan consensus bill to reauthorize and strengthen \nthe Older Americans Act. It is my hope that the Senate later today will \nunanimously pass this important legislation.\n  The programs authorized by the Older Americans Act are tremendously \nimportant in the State of Maine and across the country. Maine is the \noldest State by median age in the entire country. Probably, if I asked \nmost of my colleagues, they would guess it was Florida, but in fact it \nis the State of Maine.\n  Maine's network of five area agencies on aging provides invaluable \nsupports and services to more than 100,000 seniors living in my State.\n  In just the past few months, I have received almost 700 letters from \nseniors across Maine urging that we pass the reauthorization bill. I \nlook forward to letting my constituents know that the Senate soon will \ndo just that.\n  While funding has been provided on a continuing basis through the \nappropriations process, the fact is that legislation reauthorizing the \nOlder Americans Act is long overdue. The authorization expired in 2011.\n  It is particularly significant that the Senate pass this legislation \nthis month, for July marks the 50th anniversary of the Older Americans \nAct.\n  This law funds critical services in communities across our Nation \nthat help to keep our older adults healthy and independent. Its funding \nsupports some of the most vital and successful Federal programs for our \nNation's seniors.\n  Nearly 12 million older Americans receive services through this law, \nsuch services as Meals on Wheels, senior centers, transportation, legal \nservices, and caregiver support.\n  Moreover, these programs are operated through a national network of \narea agencies on aging that stresses local decisionmaking regarding \nwhat services are most needed for older adults in a particular \ncommunity. It is a flexible program that allows local needs to be met.\n  Older Americans Act programs also help to relieve the financial \npressure on the Medicare and Medicaid Programs, because they help \nseniors to stay healthy, independent, and living right where they want \nto be--in the comfort, security, and privacy of their own homes.\n  AARP's surveys consistently reflect the fact that aging in place is \nthe preferred option for seniors who want to continue to live \nindependently and avoid expensive nursing home and other \ninstitutionalized care as long as possible.\n  This bill also includes important provisions to strengthen the Long-\nTerm Care Ombudsman Program and to help protect our vulnerable seniors \nfrom financial exploitation and abuse. Financial exploitation of our \nseniors is a growing epidemic that cost them an estimated $2.9 billion \nin 2010. It is so disturbing that in 90 percent of these cases, the \nfinancial exploitation abuse is perpetrated by a family member, a \ntrusted individual, a caregiver--someone whom the senior knows well. \nThe\n\n[[Page S5155]]\n\nAging Committee has held hearings to highlight this issue, and the bill \nthat will be coming before the Senate later today will take steps to \nstrengthen the Federal response to this growing problem.\n  Of course passage by the Senate, while an essential step, is not the \nfinal step in reauthorizing this significant law. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with the chairman, the ranking member, and our \ncolleagues here and in the House to make the reauthorization of the \nOlder Americans Act a reality this year. And how wonderful would it be \nif it could be a reality this month, which marks the 50th anniversary \nof this significant law.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to take just a moment to speak \nabout a subject that is very difficult for me to speak about and, quite \nfrankly, difficult for a lot of Americans to speak about and hear \nabout. It connects to all of us in extremely personal ways. Let me set \nsome context.\n  Not long ago, a group of animal rights activists gathered around a \nresearch facility that was using animals for their testing. The \nactivists gathered around the facility, chanted, and had signs they \nheld up that said ``It is not science, it is violence'' and other signs \nthat said ``Animal lives are their right; we have just begun to fight'' \nas they protested to protect the lives of the animals that were being \nused for research in that facility.\n  I understand their frustration, but let me put it in the context of \nsome things that came out this week. We have learned that this week an \norganization called Planned Parenthood is using children who were \naborted and sending the bodies of those aborted children to research \nfacilities--sometimes for sale, different body parts--to be used in \nresearch. These are not mice. These are not lab rats. These are \nchildren--children who have gone through the process of a horrific \nabortion.\n  This morning, in an appropriations hearing the Presiding Officer and \nI both were in, we had an extensive conversation about the rights of \norca whales. This protracted conversation went on and on--many people \nalso were connected to this--about the rights of orca whales and about \ntheir care. Then we had a protracted conversation about horse slaughter \nand how horses would be humanely put down. But in the middle of all \nthat conversation that happened today, there were children still being \naborted with an instrument reaching into a mother and tearing apart a \nchild but carefully protecting certain organs because those organs \nwould be valuable to sell.\n  Now the challenge we have on this as a nation is the argument that \nthat baby is not really a baby, that it is just a fetus, it is tissue. \n``That is not a human baby'' is what everyone is told. ``That is just \ntissue, and it is up to the mom to determine what happens to that \ntissue.'' And then on the flip side of it, moments later, they take \nthat tissue and then sell it because it is human organs that are needed \nfor research. You can't say in one moment that it is not a human and \nthen sell it in the next moment as a human organ and now suddenly say \nit is. It was a human all the way through. There was never a time that \nwasn't a child. There was never a time that wasn't a human.\n  It seems the ultimate irony to me that we spend time talking about \nthe humane treatment of animals being put down, such as in horse \nslaughter, and we completely miss children being ripped apart in the \nwomb and their body parts being sold.\n  Here is how it happens. A mom comes into a facility, gives consent to \nhave an abortion, makes that request. After that request is made, to \nsome moms--and we don't know exactly how they choose which moms--to \nsome moms they then ask consent for their child, after it is aborted, \nto be used for research purposes.\n  From the video that was put out this week, they said that was \nactually comforting to some moms, that as they know how traumatic the \nabortion is, at least some good would come out of it, that those body \nparts would then be used for research to hopefully save other \nchildren--which again comes back to the ultimate irony that we \nliterally tear one child apart in an abortion with the assumption that \nhopefully that would actually help some other child in the future, \nmissing out on the significance of the child who is right there who \ncould be helped by protecting their life.\n  Then the doctor in this particular video gives the details of how \nonce they get that consent from the mom, they would be careful to reach \nin and actually crush the head of the child to kill the child in the \nwomb so they could preserve the rest of the organs because the kidney \nhas value, because the liver has value, because the lungs have value, \nand because the muscles in the legs have value.\n  I would tell you that child has value and that every single adult who \ncan hear me right now was once 20 weeks old in the womb. We can look at \neach other and understand that the difference between that child in the \nwomb and any of us now is time. That is a human being we are talking \nabout, and it doesn't bring me comfort to know that one child is torn \napart so that maybe they can do research on the child's organs so that \nat some future moment, it may help a different child.\n  Not every woman is being asked if her aborted child can be used for \nresearch, and we really don't know the why. Maybe they are looking for \nparticularly healthy moms. Maybe they are looking for very mature, \nhealthy babies. Maybe it is a situation where a particular mom couldn't \nafford to have the abortion procedure, and so they swap off and say: If \nyou can't afford the abortion procedure, maybe we can cover the costs \nby then possibly selling some of these organs. We don't know.\n  But I think maybe the question needs to be asked why this Congress \nwould spend time today debating horse slaughter and debating orca \nwhales, and yet we have become so numb to children that the other \ndebate doesn't seem to come up.\n  Maybe we need to start again as a nation asking a basic question: Is \nthat a child? In our Declaration, we said every person, we believe, is \nendowed by our Creator to life, liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. \nMaybe we need to ask again as a nation, do we really believe that?\n  Let's start with some basic things. How about a child of 20 weeks who \nwe know scientifically can feel pain cannot have their limbs ripped \napart in an abortion. There are only seven countries in the world that \nallow that. We are in a prime group--like North Korea and China--of \nnations which still allow abortions that late. We should ask that \nquestion again: Is that really who we are as America?\n  Maybe we need to ask the question again to Planned Parenthood, to \nwhich we give half a billion dollars in funding. Maybe this is not a \ngood idea. Other organizations that serve people all over the country \nraise their funds separately and don't do it with Federal funds.

Mr. President, I rise today to express serious concern \nabout an ongoing project at the Organization\n\n[[Page S5156]]\n\nfor Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD. It is called the \nBase Erosion and Profit Shifting--or BEPS--Project. BEPS is a program \nthat is intended to address perceived flaws in international tax rules \nthat have allowed multinational corporations to shift profits--but not \nnecessarily corresponding economic activity--from high-tax to low-tax \njurisdictions. These strategies, in some cases, had a negative impact \non the tax basis of OECD countries, creating a need for solutions.\n  Unfortunately, it appears that the project has moved well beyond its \noriginal mandate, and many U.S. companies are rightly concerned that \nthey may be facing significant negative consequences. This should \nconcern all of us in government as well.\n  Let's talk for a minute about how we got to where we are today. In \n2012, the G20 tasked the OECD with developing a comprehensive and \ncoordinated approach to addressing certain aggressive tax-planning \nstrategies. As we all know, the G20 is an international forum for \ngovernments and central bank officials from 20 major economies around \nthe world which meets periodically behind closed doors to discuss \nfinancial matters and, even though it has no formal charter, arrive at \nagreements.\n  The G20's direction resulted, at least in part, because of the BEPS \nproject. It was originally supposed to be limited in scope, with a \nfocus on discrete actions to address inappropriate tax avoidance. The \nidea was to find ways to possibly arrive at consensus on how to prevent \nthose strategies that result in very little or no taxation of profits \nor what some have come to call ``stateless income.''\n  The OECD released what it called its BEPS Action Plan in 2013. The \nplan identified 15 action items for changes in tax policy. Among those \naction items were recommendations to modify domestic laws to, one, \nstrengthen controlled foreign corporation or CFC rules and limits on \ninterest deductions; two, prevent tax treaty abuse; three, increase \ntaxpayer reporting requirements and information sharing among \ngovernments; and, four, develop a multilateral instrument to implement \ncertain BEPS actions.\n  Discussion drafts have been released on many of the action plan items \nand final reports are anticipated to be finalized and delivered to the \nG20 later this year.\n  The Obama administration's Treasury Department has been actively \ninvolved in the BEPS project. Last summer, Deputy Assistant Treasury \nSecretary for International Tax Affairs Robert Stack stated that \n``failure in the BEPS project could well result in countries taking \nunilateral, inconsistent actions thereby increasing double taxation, \nthe cost to the U.S. Treasury, and the number of tax disputes.''\n  Now, given this and other statements from Treasury officials, it \nappears Treasury believes its role in the BEPS project is to protect \nthe U.S. tax base from erosion and to protect U.S. multinational \ncompanies from actions from other countries that could lead to double \ntaxation and time-consuming disputes. In that regard, Treasury has been \nactively negotiating on behalf of the U.S. Government to reach \nconsensus on the BEPS action items.\n  These are laudable goals. However, I do not believe these goals have \nbeen achieved. Indeed, just last month, Deputy Assistant Treasury \nSecretary Stack himself faulted the UK and Australia for taking \nunilateral actions targeting U.S. multinationals, possibly contrary to \nthe commitments those countries have made in their treaties with the \nUnited States.\n  More importantly, I am very concerned there are bigger issues at play \nand that the BEPS project has far exceeded its original mandate. Once \nagain, BEPS was meant to be limited in scope, focusing on the \nprevention of tax strategies that yield inappropriate results. Instead, \nit appears to have become a mechanism for rewriting global tax \nstrategies--potentially including those commonly used by U.S. \ncompanies--behind closed doors without the input or consent of Congress \nitself.\n  As we all know, only Congress can make changes to U.S. tax law. Yet \nno representatives from Congress have been offered a seat at the table \nin any of the BEPS negotiations. Sure, the OECD has been quite \nforthcoming in meeting with Members and congressional staff, but in the \nactual BEPS deliberations, all the decisions are being made by \nunelected bureaucrats in Paris and not by anyone from the Senate or \nHouse of Representatives.\n  The Senate Committee on Finance, which I chair, is currently engaged \nin an effort that we hope will eventually lead to comprehensive tax \nreform. This has been a long-term effort and Members of both parties \nand both Chambers of Congress have been engaged in this endeavor for \nquite some time. Yet while Congress continues to work toward this long-\nterm goal, the Treasury Department is negotiating the BEPS action \nitems, which may attempt to commit the United States to make changes to \nour domestic tax laws, without any substantive input from Congress or \nCongress's tax-writing committees.\n  We know this is a problem. Indeed, certain positions already agreed \nto by the Treasury Department as part of the BEPS project could \nmaterially damage U.S. tax reform efforts. Congress and the \nadministration need to work together on these issues. When I say ``work \ntogether,'' I do not mean that Treasury officials should only \nperiodically come to the Hill in order to brief congressional staff on \ndecisions that have already been made. I mean administration officials \nshould not make any commitments that could impact U.S. tax policy \nwithout adequate consultation and explicit agreement from Congress.\n  We all remember when, years ago, then-Treasury Secretary Geithner \ndecided to reach an agreement with other officials in the G20 regarding \nfunding for the International Monetary Fund or IMF. After reaching this \nagreement, without any significant input or consent from Congress, the \nObama administration presented, and continues to present, the issue of \naltered IMF funding as an ``international commitment'' the \nadministration made and Congress must honor.\n  Put simply, that is not an appropriate model for pursuing and \nachieving changes to U.S. law. And if the administration intends to use \na similar model for the changes recommended by the BEPS project, that \nis, as the saying goes, a dog that just won't hunt.\n  I am going to put this as simply as I can. Congress is the steward of \nthe American taxpayer resources. Those resources are not bargaining \nchips for international agreements that may or may not advance our \nNation's interests. Make no mistake, international cooperation and \nconsensus are important. I don't object to unified actions toward \ncommon goals and shared objectives, but when the resources of U.S. \ntaxpayers are on the line--as they appear to be with the BEPS project--\nCongress must play a significant role.\n  Once again, some of the BEPS action items would commit the resources \nof U.S. taxpayers either in the form of alterations to tax rules \ngoverning the taxation of U.S. multinationals or in the form of \nresources American taxpayers will have to expend in order to abide by \nthe terms of the BEPS action items.\n  Last month, the OECD held a conference on the BEPS project here in \nWashington, DC. Prior to the conference, the House Ways and Means \nCommittee chairman, Paul Ryan, and I sent a letter to Treasury \nSecretary Lew outlining our concerns with several of the actions \nproposed under the BEPS project, including country-by-country \nreporting, ``master file'' documentation, potential limits on interest \ndeductibility, and others. Those specific proposals could have far-\nreaching negative consequences for U.S. multinationals and the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  For example, consider the master file documentation scheme envisioned \nin the BEPS project. Under this proposal, companies would have to \nprovide additional detailed and intricate information about their tax \nplan and business models to foreign tax authorities. If we impose this \nrequirement on U.S. businesses, what assurances do we have that these \nforeign governments would keep the information confidential? I don't \nknow, and no one from Treasury has told me.\n  What about countries with prevalent state-owned enterprises that \nwould greatly benefit from this type of information? Wouldn't the BEPS \nproposal force U.S. companies to reveal sensitive information to \nforeign governments that either own or substantially\n\n[[Page S5157]]\n\nback competing enterprises? I don't know, and no one at Treasury has \ntold me.\n  I could go on for quite a while about these proposals, especially \ngiven the broad scope of the BEPS project, the breadth of possible tax \neffects, and the potential negative impact these proposals could have \non our companies and our economy. Needless to say, as the chairman of \nthe Senate's tax-writing committee, I have many concerns.\n  Before any additional steps are taken, and before we can even \nconsider moving on any of the BEPS action items, we need more \ninformation. In fact, the President's lead negotiator on BEPS, Deputy \nAssistant Secretary Stack, stated we need to slow down the pace of the \nBEPS work substantially.\n  We need to know more about the costs relative to the benefits of the \nBEPS proposals. We also need to know whether the IRS is capable of \nsharing sensitive tax information with foreign tax authorities without \nviolating the confidentiality of American businesses. After all, the \nIRS does not have the best track record. Between the fraud and \noverpayment rates on various refundable tax credits and other breaches \nof trust at that agency, we have more than enough reasons to be \nconcerned about whether the IRS can effectively and appropriately \nimplement a plan for global information sharing.\n  To address these questions, I sent a letter today to the Comptroller \nGeneral asking that the Government Accountability Office engage with me \nand my staff to begin an indepth analysis of these issues, so we can at \nleast get a sense as to how the OECD's proposals might impact the U.S. \neconomy, including employment, investment, and revenues. In the coming \nmonths, I will be reaching out to other experts as well.\n  It is difficult to imagine the analysis and discussions that would \nhave to accompany consideration and adoption of BEPS-related rules and \nschemes can be completed by September, when the OECD has stated it \nhopes to render final action plans by the time of the next G20 meeting. \nBut as I stated, even if final reports from the BEPS project are \nreleased on schedule, many, if not all, of the action plan items would \nneed congressional action in order to be implemented in the United \nStates.\n  So, again, I urge Treasury to work very closely with Congress on this \nand not tie our hands as we move toward tax reform by consenting to bad \noutcomes. I urge them to consider the interests of U.S. taxpayers and \nnot make any commitments that would impose unnecessary burdens on \nAmerican companies and put them at a competitive disadvantage.\n  The United States has always recognized the right of other countries \nto tax income earned within their borders, to the extent such taxation \nis consistent with treaty obligations. However, regardless of what some \nin other countries may think, the U.S. tax base should not be up for \ngrabs in an international free-for-all, and I expect officials at the \nU.S. Department of Treasury to remember that. In fact, I demand they \nremember that.\n  Mr. President, I will have much more to say on these matters in the \ncoming weeks and months.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the economic \neffect of regulations coming out of the Environmental Protection Agency \non the energy sector and particularly on fossil fuels and coal.\n  The State of Wyoming is the largest coal-producing State in the \nNation. Coal represents almost 40 percent of our share of electricity \ngeneration across the United States. It is abundant, it is affordable, \nit is stockpileable, it can be clean, and it shouldn't be replaced \nthrough regulatory actions. But this administration continues to try to \nregulate coal out of existence.\n  In 2012, the EPA finalized a standard that requires a strict \nreduction in air emissions from electric-generating utilities. It is \nknown as the mercury and air toxic standards rule. Like many of the \nrules coming from the EPA, the costs of this regulation are great and \nthe benefits are very limited.\n  EPA estimates the rule will create between $500,000 and $6 million in \nbenefits. That sounds like a lot of money. But related to the mercury \nreductions, the cost is $10 billion annually--$10 billion annually--for \na return of $500,000 to $6 million. That is a pretty big range. It \nindicates there probably isn't a lot of calculation into how that came \ninto being or much transparency so we can see how that came about.\n  The $10 billion annual cost will be to consumers of electricity. \nThose are costs that aren't allowed to be recouped. Now, many of those \nhave already been put in place. They become part of the rate base, and, \nunder most of the laws dealing with utilities, they are allowed to make \na return on that. So there wouldn't be a huge protest for it. It is a \nlot of upfront cost for them, but they get to recoup that over a period \nof time. We have to be sure that when we are making regulations, we \ndon't flood a whole bunch of them in there that have huge costs and \nvery little benefit.\n  We just had a hearing on this a short time ago on the homeland \nsubcommittee on regulations, talking about how all of those costs come \nabout. Well, the actual cost of doing it is pretty easily calculable. \nThere are things that have to be bought and put in place and \nconstruction done in order to get it done. The benefits? It is a little \nhard to find out where those come from, and a lot of the things aren't \nclearly cut so that the problem comes from a single spot. Often there \nare a lot of things involved, but there is a tendency to pick on one \nplace.\n  Three years after the rule was finalized, the Supreme Court has ruled \nthat the EPA should have considered costs before determining to \nregulate mercury from fossil-fired powerplants. The cost-benefit ratio, \nassuming the EPA's best case scenario, is approximately 1,600 to 1. The \nCourt's majority opinion called this an overreach and stated: ``The \nAgency gave cost no thought at all, because it considered cost \nirrelevant to its initial decision to regulate.''\n  Since these standards began to take effect in April, utilities have \nalready retired or plan to retire coal-fired plants to comply with cuts \nin emissions. Sometimes it is cheaper to shut them down than it is to \nmake the changes. The courts did not issue a stay on implementation, so \ncompanies began installing the mandated controls to meet the deadline \nfor compliance. These costs will be passed on to consumers and will \nresult in higher electricity prices. On average, a household could see \ntheir electricity bill go up by $400 a year--a cost that will \ndisproportionately impact those with lower, fixed incomes, such as many \nolder Americans.\n  In 2012, Congress had a chance to use the Congressional Review Act to \nstop this devastating rule from moving forward. The Congressional \nReview Act gives Congress the ability to disapprove rules that go \nbeyond what Congress intended. It requires a simple majority for \npassage and was a legislative vehicle available to stop the MATS rule \nfrom moving forward. Unfortunately, it was rejected by the Senate \nmajority at the time.\n  With the process, you have to get a petition with a lot of signatures \non it, and then you are guaranteed 8 hours of debate and an up-or-down \nvote. Of course, after it goes to the Senate, it also has to go to the \nHouse. And after it goes to the House, it then has to go to the \nPresident for his signature. The rules and regulations are done by \nCongress, not by the President. The President is the enforcer of the \nrules that we supposedly put in place. So it should not take a \nPresidential signature to stop the action if the House and Senate \nagree. In this case, it was rejected by the Senate majority. It wasn't \nuntil this lawsuit filed by State Governors was finally decided that \nthe Agency was called out for charging ahead with this disastrous rule \nwithout considering the consequences.\n  Ratepayers shouldn't have to wait this long for the correct decision. \nCongress has to stand up to this runaway\n\n[[Page S5158]]\n\nagency, but we need to expand on our tools to fight governing by \nrulemaking. We need to increase accountability for and transparency in \nthe Federal regulatory process by requiring that Congress approve all \nnew major regulations. The Regulations From the Executive in Need of \nScrutiny, or REINS, Act would make sure the people's representatives \nget a say in regulatory action affecting our Nation's economy. The \npresumption should not be deference to a Federal agency attempting to \nimplement a regulation but to Congress and to the States.\n  If enacted, the REINS Act would require an up-or-down vote by both \nHouses of Congress before any executive branch rule or regulation with \nan annual economic impact of $100 million or more could be enacted. In \nthe case of the Clean Power Plan, the costs are in the billions. So it \nwould ensure Congress gets a say to stop the EPA from regulating coal \nout of business.\n  Additionally, the Environment and Public Works Committee has moved \nlegislation--that is, the Affordable Reliable Energy Now Act--which \nwould extend the proposed rule's compliance dates pending further \njudicial review. That way we don't see premature plant closures that \nharm our grid reliability and make energy more expensive before even \nknowing whether the rule is on good legal standing and whether the \nnumbers are good.\n  Both of these bills would give Congress additional tools to fight \nExecutive overreach, and the House has already passed legislation \nsimilar to the Affordable Reliable Energy Now Act. We must do what we \ncan because there is no doubt that MATS regulations will continue to be \nchallenged for its requirement of outside-of-the-fence-line changes, \nits coordination with existing source performance standards, the \nimplementation of Federal standards should States not submit plans or \non the scientific basis if the status quo contributes to the \nendangerment of public health. In fact, the White House has requested \nover $50 million to defend the rule in court. That is your tax money. \nThey have already lost once.\n  And while the EPA ignores the costs, outside groups have projected \nfour to seven times the costs of the regulation. The National Economics \nResearch Association found an annual compliance cost for MATS $41 to \n$73 billion. That is the annual compliance costs. So that would be up \nto $73,000 million, as I like to put it, because I think talking about \nmillions instead of billions makes it a little more understandable. So \nthat is the policy that is going to affect consumer prices.\n  It also shows States like Wyoming seeing double-digit increases in \nelectrical prices. Congress must ensure the EPA does not continue to \nact unreasonably by not considering the costs of compliance before \ndrafting carbon regulations. By requiring States to implement their own \nplans, the EPA is trying to skirt their responsibility to determine the \ntrue costs. The EPA has not adequately considered the costs of the \nClean Power Plan. So what they did was shift that over and said: \nStates, this is what each of you has to do to make the Federal plan \nwork, but since this is a State plan, we don't have to do all of this \nanalysis to see what the costs are going to be. Of course, we need more \ntransparency in the calculations.\n  As I mentioned, costs are easy to come up with, but benefits are \npretty hard to determine, and they are kind of in the eye of the \nbeholder or eye of the calculator. Usually, the costs happen upfront in \njust a few years--5 years, maybe 10 years at the most--but they are \nallowed to calculate benefits over 50 years, 100 years. How long can \nthey do that? The company has to pay it upfront, but the consumers have \nto pay it over a regular short period of time.\n  Fifteen percent of U.S. coal-generating capacity is already planned \nfor retirement. Wyoming would be forced to prematurely close four \nadditional coal-fired plants under this rule. Incidentally, that is \nabout the amount of electricity that we export to California. The EPA \nasserts that since States determine compliance, the remaining useful \nlife of coal-powered units prematurely shut down need not be \nconsidered.\n  Governors have already begun telling the EPA that they will not be \nable to submit plans to meet the proposed standards, so Administrator \nMcCarthy has threatened a Federal implementation plan if States do not \ncomply. Now, a Federal implementation plan is a Federal regulatory \naction, and so they need to consider the costs of premature plant \nshutdowns and the consumer energy prices that will cause prior to being \nfinalized. You cannot bypass these considerations by placing the onus \non the States first.\n  Congress also needs to empower States to oppose Federal regulations \nthat hurt their constituencies, again with little benefit. As Wyoming's \nGovernor Matt Meads commented on MATS: ``The EPA does not have the \nlegal authority to propose, finalize or enforce this proposal.'' The \nEPA has introduced a proposal that functionally and structurally \nhamstrings energy and electricity sectors, thereby driving up the \nelectrical prices. It would burden our Nation's economic security and \nprosperity with almost no environmental or health benefits. The State \nof Wyoming is considering its legal options once the rule is finalized. \nThey can't do anything until it is finalized.\n  I have proposed an amendment to the Constitution which would give \nStates the ability to repeal Federal laws and regulations when ratified \nby two-thirds of the legislators. That is almost like calling a \nconstitutional convention under article V of the Constitution. This \namendment stands up for States' rights and gives them another option \nother than the court system to find solutions to regulatory problems. \nUltimately, the States know what is best for them, and it is time to \nshift the power back into their hands. Even when Federal regulations \nmay have good intentions, they can create situations in which they \ncause more harm than good.\n  Unfortunately, the regulatory process is skewed in favor of the \nadministration. We need to find a way to empower Congress and to \nempower the States--those most accountable to the voters--to keep \nrunaway agencies in check or we will continue to see regulations that \nimpede our economy by directly hurting the energy industry, which hurts \nindividuals, costs jobs, and hits the ratepayers--the price ultimately \npaid by the consumers.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion \nto reconsider be made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Senate has now passed the \nreauthorization of the Older Americans Act by voice vote.\n  As the chairman of the Senate Committee on Aging and as a Senator who \nrepresents a State with the highest median age, I am well aware of how \nimportant the programs authorized by this law are to our Nation's \nseniors. They include, for example, Meals on Wheels, which is a \nwonderful program that allows so many of our seniors to stay in their \nown homes and yet have their nutritional needs met. I also know how \nmuch the seniors in my State look forward to the visits from those who \nare delivering Meals on Wheels. It is a way that their health and well-\nbeing can be checked on. In some cases, it may be the only social \ninteraction they have on a given day.\n  In my State, the five area agencies on aging are very active in \ndelivering the services needed for the seniors in that particular \ncommunity or region in my State, particularly in rural Maine, where \nthere may be an absence of services, such as caregiving services. The \narea agency on aging plays an absolutely critical role. In some other \nareas of the State, under the Older Americans Act programs, \ntransportation services are provided to our seniors, legal services, \nwhatever is needed.\n  One of the provisions of this bill in which I have a particular \ninterest is the strengthening of the role of the ombudsman for long-\nterm care. That is important for the quality of care our seniors are \nreceiving in nursing homes and other institutionalized settings. But \nthe great thing about the Older Americans Act is that it helps many of \nour seniors avoid nursing homes and instead remain in the comfort, \nsecurity, and privacy of their own homes--just where they want to be.\n  This bill also takes steps to help safeguard older Americans from \nabuse and financial exploitation. I know from the hearings we have held \nbefore the Aging Committee that this is a growing problem. In fact, in \nthe year 2011, it is estimated that older Americans lost some $2.9 \nbillion due to schemes that were foisted on them. That probably is a \ngreatly understated number because, sadly, 90 percent of this \nexploitation comes from people the senior knows well--either a \nrelative, a trusted adviser, or a caregiver. Oftentimes, seniors are \nvery hesitant to report these crimes because they don't want to get a \nloved one in trouble or they are simply too embarrassed to go to the \npolice.\n  We have held hearings on how technology has made the Do Not Call list \nvirtually useless these days because unfortunately technology allows \npeople from call centers in India, for example, to call into this \ncountry pretending to be a member of the Internal Revenue Service or \nthe local police department. Well, when a senior sees on the caller ID \nthat the Department of Treasury from Washington, DC, is calling, they \nare going to pick up the phone, and thus the exploitation begins.\n  We are making a real effort on the Aging Committee to educate seniors \nabout these con artists and the techniques they use to try to rip off \npeople of all ages but with a particular focus on our senior citizens. \nSo I am pleased that the Older Americans Act is focused on financial \nexploitation and trying to stop that kind of abuse.\n  In short, the reauthorization of these important programs under the \nOlder Americans Act is long overdue. While we have continued to fund \nthem, the reauthorization expired years ago, and I am very pleased that \nthe chairman and the ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee, of which the Presiding Officer is such a \nvaluable member, have worked together to produce the bipartisan bill we \njust passed. This shows what the Senate can do when we work together to \nmeet the needs of our citizens.\n  It is an honor to be on the floor to manage this bill. I hope, since \nit was 50 years ago this month when the Older\n\n[[Page S5163]]\n\nAmericans Act first passed, that we can move rapidly to see it approved \nby the House of Representatives as well and signed into law by the \nPresident.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, 50 years ago this week, President Lyndon \nJohnson signed the Older Americans Act, which enshrined into law our \nresponsibility for helping seniors live healthier, fuller, and more \nindependent lives. Fifty years later, I am pleased Congress has worked \nto reauthorize the Older Americans Act to once again uphold that \npromise of our Nation. And I am pleased we came together in a \nbipartisan way to provide important support for seniors in my home \nState of Washington and those across the country.\n  I especially thank Senators Alexander, Sanders, and Burr for all of \ntheir hard work on this bill. I believe we should be doing everything \nwe can to support seniors so they can lead healthy, independent lives. \nImproving opportunities for seniors is part of how we can restore some \nmuch-needed economic security for them. And it is how we can help \nensure our country is working for all Americans, not just the \nwealthiest few.\n  But today, far too many seniors find themselves skipping meals or \ngoing hungry, instead of getting the nutrition they need. In fact, 9.3 \nmillion seniors in our country face the threat of hunger, according to \na 2012 report. And in my home State of Washington, 13.5 percent of \nseniors struggle with hunger.\n  As if that isn't enough, many seniors face other serious challenges, \nlike elder abuse. That can include mistreatment in a nursing home or \nfinancial exploitation. This bill to reauthorize the Older Americans \nAct supports crucial social services and nutrition programs for \nseniors.\n  As one example, this bill sustains our investment in Meals on Wheels. \nIn my home State of Washington, more than 460,000 seniors enroll in \nthat program. Meals on Wheels is a critical lifeline for them. It is an \nimportant investment for our country. For every dollar we invest in \nMeals on Wheels, we can save up to $50 in Medicaid spending, according \nto a study from the Center for Effective Government. Among other \nimportant provisions, the bill also strengthens programs to combat \nelder abuse.\n  This bill focuses on the critical importance of both abuse screenings \nand prevention efforts, and it would improve the response to abuse, \nneglect, and exploitation in long-term care facilities. It also puts a \nkey emphasis on evidence-based public health programs.\n  It bolsters transportation programs, and it ensures that OAA programs \ninclude a focus on seniors' behavioral health needs. I am proud that \nthis bill is the result of strong bipartisan work. It proves yet again \nthat when Republicans and Democrats work together, we can get results, \nso I hope we can build on this progress.\n  I want to continue to work with Republicans to find common ground and \nget results for families and communities in Washington State and across \nthe country. And I hope to continue to work on ways to restore economic \nstability and security to more seniors.\n  In 1965, at the original signing of the Older Americans Act, \nPresident Johnson said the true significance of this bill would be in \nits results. He said he hoped the bill would, quote, ``help us to \nexpand our opportunities for enriching the lives of all of our citizens \nin our country, now and in the years to come.''\n  Reauthorizing this law will carry out that mission and expand \nopportunities so more seniors can lead healthy, independent lives. It \nis an important part of our work to help the economy grow from the \nmiddle out, not the top down. It will be another step toward making \nsure our government is working for all families, not just the \nwealthiest few.\n  Today, I call on all my colleagues to support this bill. Let's \nreauthorize the Older Americans Act and live up to our Nation's \nresponsibility to seniors across the country.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am glad the Senate has turned today to \nthe reauthorization of the programs under the Older Americans Act. For \ndecades, this law has provided community assistance to seniors in \nunderserved and rural areas across the country, but unfortunately, \nthese programs have gone unauthorized since 2011. As our population \nages, seniors face an increased need for community resources, which is \nwhat makes this bill so important.\n  The Older Americans Reauthorization Act of 2015 will prioritize \nfunding for crucial community and in-home services that offer the \nprotection and reassurance for seniors requiring specialized care. The \nbill will reauthorize transportation assistance and home-delivered \nnutrition programs. It will also strengthen State grants for in-home \ncaregiver support. Through the coordination of community and health \ncare providers, the bill will improve disease promotion services and \nincrease mental health awareness among elderly populations. \nFurthermore, the legislation will strengthen programs that prevent \nsenior abuse, neglect, and exploitation by holding health facilities \nand adult care homes accountable for promoting excellent patient care.\n  These programs have given seniors in Vermont and across the country \nthe chance for independence and wellbeing long after retirement. This \nis not a partisan issue, but one we can all agree requires our \ndedication and support. I am pleased to cosponsor this legislation and \nwish to thank Senators Murray, Alexander, Sanders, and Burr for making \nthis issue a priority this Congress. I am pleased the Senate has passed \nthis legislation, which will help to improve the livelihood of our \nNation's seniors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, once again I see my good friend Senator \nCollins fighting for all of the good people of her State and all of our \nStates and raising important issues--issues that I dealt with, quite \nhonestly, quite a bit when I was attorney general of my State. \nExploitation is a horrible practice that takes away the dignity and the \nopportunity for a healthy life of an elderly American citizen. So I \ncongratulate the Senator from Maine on her fine work, and I pledge my \nfull support as she moves forward with this bill.\n  I thank the Senator from Maine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/16/senate-section/article/S5163-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5163-S5165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HONORING VIETNAM VETERANS AND NORTH DAKOTA'S SOLDIERS WHO LOST THEIR \n                            LIVES IN VIETNAM\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, today, as I do most Thursdays in this \nSenate, I rise to speak about the young men from my State of North \nDakota who went to Vietnam and certainly those who died while serving \nin the Vietnam war. As I have said before, the families of each of \nthese 198 fallen North Dakotans deserve to have America pause to honor \nand remember each of them.\n  Before I speak about some of the North Dakotans who are missing or \nwho died during the Vietnam war, I wish to thank Author ``Tom'' Mandan, \na Vietnam veteran from New Town, ND, who is an inspiration to our State \nand to our country.\n  In 1966, Tom chose to enlist in the Army. He was stationed in Vietnam \nas a medic. He volunteered to extend his time in Vietnam twice and \nspent a total of 3 years there. The Army awarded him with a Purple \nHeart and Bronze Star with the V device to denote his heroism involving \nconflict with the armed enemy.\n\n  Tom comes from a family who is also an example of service to our \ncountry. Tom and his four brothers all served in Vietnam, each one \nafter the other. Previously, their father, Victor Mandan, served our \ncountry in World War II.\n  When Tom returned to the United States from Vietnam, he raised his \nfamily and became a teacher. He enjoyed teaching fourth graders in \nMandari and teaching the Hidatsa language to elementary and middle \nschool students. Tom retired from teaching and now serves the Mandan \nHidatsa Arikara Nation, working full time as tribal liaison for elders \nand veterans.\n  Tom is a proud father and proud grandfather, but he is humbled about \nhis important contributions to his tribe, to his State, and to his \ncountry.\n  Tom's first cousin, Myron Johnson, who was like a brother to Tom, \nalso served in Vietnam and was killed in action there. I now would like \nto talk about Myron and four other young men who didn't come home from \nthe war.\n\n[[Page S5164]]\n\n                     Myron ``Chief's High'' Johnson\n\n  Myron ``Chief's High'' Johnson was born September 26, 1948. He was \nfrom Mandaree and was an enrolled member of the Mandan Hidatsa Arikara \nNation. He served in the Army's 1st Battalion, 46th Infantry, Americal \nDivision. Myron died March 28, 1971. He was 22 years old.\n  He was the sixth of nine children born to Melvin Johnson and Eloise \nMandan Johnson. His siblings said that Myron had a magnetic personality \nand was kind and sincere to everyone who met him. When people reminisce \nabout Myron, they always talk about how much they loved him.\n  Myron enjoyed riding bucking horses and was a top contender in the \nAmerican Indian Rodeo Association. He was also a good hunter and a \ngreat shot.\n  In Vietnam, Myron's best friend Richard Boehm and 32 other American \nsoldiers were killed in action when Firebase Mary Ann was attacked. \nMyron received many medals for his honorable and distinguished service \nin Vietnam.\n  Diane Johnson is Myron's sister and my great friend. Diane said that \nafter Myron's death, he was escorted by his first cousin, John \nMorsette, who, in the Indian way, was Myron's brother. John Morsette \nserved two tours in Vietnam and also was highly decorated. John told \nDiane that taking Myron home was the hardest thing he ever did. The \ntrail of cars accompanying Myron from the Minot Airport back to his \nhome in Mandaree was miles long.\n  In addition to his parents and siblings, Myron left his wife Sharol \nand daughter Melanie. Myron's family said that his death left a \npermanent scarred hole that can never be filled. They will continue to \nhonor veterans and honor Myron for giving his life for his country.\n  The Mandaree American Legion Post 271 is named after Myron and \nMyron's nephew, Nathan Good Iron, who was killed in Afghanistan in \n2006.\n  The Mandaree American Legion Post honors me consistently by allowing \nme to enter with their shawl at American pow-wows and honors me by \nallowing me to walk with Nathan's mother Harriet as we honor her as a \nGold Star Mother.\n  For over 30 years, Myron's mother, despite her limited resources, \nhonored Myron by giving away star quilts and shawls she made in Myron's \nname. These giveaways were held throughout the years at various flag \nraisings, various pow-wows, and Memorial Day and Veterans Day services.\n  On Myron's mother's death bed, she looked up and smiled and said in \nher native language, ``Oh my son, you're here. You've finally come to \nsee me.''\n\n\n                            Francis Dowling\n\n  Francis Dowling was from Cooperstown, and he was born July 13, 1929. \nHe served as a sergeant major in the Army's First Infantry Division. \nFrancis was 38 years old when he died on October 17, 1967.\n  Francis was one of eight children. His two brothers also served in \nthe Vietnam war--George in the Air Force and Forrest in the Marines. We \nwere unable to reach any of Francis's family members, but according to \na remembrance written by Jim Shelton, who served with him, Francis was \na brave and a loyal soldier. Jim described Francis as ``tall, handsome, \nand professional,'' with a strong sense of humor.\n  Michael Meyers also served with Francis, and he recalls that Francis \nwas easily 6 feet 6 inches tall and was very muscular. Michael said, \n``He was so big people thought he was mean, but 97 percent of the time \nhe had a big smile on his face.''\n  Francis died during an ambush when he was trying to shield his \nwounded commanding officer from further fire. Francis is buried in \nArlington National Cemetery.\n\n\n                              Glenn Maier\n\n  Glenn Maier was from Bismarck and was born December 31, 1949. He \nserved in the Navy and was trained as a fireman. Glenn died July 11, \n1970, when he was 20 years old.\n  This Senator has the pleasure of knowing Glenn's family. His parents, \nVi and Chuck Tracy, lived just two doors down from my house where I \nraised my family in Mandan.\n  Glenn's father, Ervin Maier, served our country in the military and \ndied when Glenn was very young. Vi later married Chuck Tracy, and they \nraised Glenn together. Vi and Chuck also gave Glenn a brother, Bob, and \na sister, Sue. Bob and Sue said that Glenn was a happy-go-lucky guy. \nThey remember him riding his Vespa scooter and enjoying time with his \nfriends and especially playing a lot of pinochle.\n  Glenn's sister Sue chuckles when she thinks about growing up and \nGlenn not knowing how to swim. Even though Sue was younger by 6 years, \nshe tried to teach him how to swim in the small swimming holes on the \nsandbars of the Missouri River. When Glenn decided to enlist in the \nNavy, she joked with him that he was foolish, but he assured her that \nthe Navy would make sure he could swim.\n  Glenn's brother Bob is grateful for meeting other men who served with \nGlenn in the Navy. They told Bob stories about Glenn's service, like \nhow despite being trained in the Navy as a firefighter, Glenn served on \na swift boat in brown waters running machine guns. They said they \nalways requested Glenn for missions because he was so good with .50-\ncaliber machine guns. The month he was killed, he was scheduled to \nleave Vietnam to train in the United States as a Navy SEAL.\n\n\n                               John Tague\n\n  John Tague was from Burlington. He was born December 2, 1945. John \nserved in the Army's 1st Infantry Division. He was 22 years old when he \ndied on June 16, 1968.\n  He was the oldest child in his family, and he had three sisters: \nAlice, Georgia, and Jody. Alice and Georgia said that John loved to \nhunt and fish and did so at every opportunity. His golden retriever \nfollowed him everywhere, especially when he went hunting.\n  After high school, John joined the Job Corps, where he helped teach \nothers about life and taking care of themselves. The Wahpeton Job Corps \nhonored John for his outstanding work by naming a building after him. \nWhen that facility closed, Jobs Corps gave John's family the building \nsign with John's name.\n  John's sisters appreciate that their former Des Lacs Burlington High \nSchool classmates are planning to honor John in a parade float this \nsummer.\n  In Vietnam, John served as a field communications electronics \nequipment mechanic. John was about 6 months into his tour of duty when \nhe was severely burned. Shortly thereafter, he was flown to Japan, \nwhere he died of his injuries. He was laid to rest in Rose Hill \nMemorial Park in Minot.\n\n\n                            Lowell Einarson\n\n  Lowell Einarson was from Bantry and was born March 18, 1938. He \nserved in the Navy as a shipfitter. Lowell was 28 years old when he \ndied on September 1, 1966.\n  Lowell and his sister Marilyn were the children of immigrants from \nIceland, Joe and Sophie Einarson. They grew up on a small farm outside \nof Bantry.\n  Lowell's niece Vonda remembers hearing her mother Marilyn telling \nstories about how she and Lowell traveled to school in the winter by \ncross-country skiing. Marilyn told Vonda that Lowell was a strong young \nman who watched over her and took care of her, taking care of the many \nchores, especially after Marilyn was diagnosed with polio at age 7.\n  Shortly after completing high school, Lowell enlisted in the Navy. He \nserved for 10 years until he died of a heart attack during the early \npart of the Vietnam war.\n  Marilyn cherished the three sets of china Lowell brought home for \nher, their mother, and for himself. Sadly, Marilyn lost her belongings, \nincluding Lowell's china, when her home burned down in the 1970s.\n  Lowell's niece Sue keeps a rubbing of Lowell's name etched on the \nVietnam Memorial Wall, and shared that several family members have said \nthat Lowell's nephew Mitch resembles Lowell.\n  I continue to speak here on the floor of the U.S. Senate about the \nlives and deaths of North Dakotans who died while serving in the war \nbecause these men remain in our hearts, and they certainly remain in \nthe hearts of the wonderful families we have had an opportunity to get \nto know during our work on this project.\n  The 2012 Presidential Proclamation on the Commemoration of the 50th \nAnniversary of the Vietnam War states:\n\n       In the reflection of The Wall, we see the military family \n     members and veterans who\n\n[[Page S5165]]\n\n     carry a pain that may never fade. May they find peace in \n     knowing their loved ones endure, not only in medals and \n     memories, but in the hearts of all Americans, who are forever \n     grateful for their service, valor, and sacrifice.\n\n  It is so important that we never forget the sacrifice of those who \nserved in Vietnam or the sacrifice of those who serve today, and that \nis why I consider it such a privilege to tell the stories of those who \ndid not make it home and listen to the stories of those who did.\n  I want to share with you a song that was sung at the recent Vietnam \nMemorial Exhibit at the Fargo Air Museum in May. I was really moved by \na local poet and local performing artist, Shaun Schipper, who was able \nto sing this song to honor those who served, and I would like to read \nthe lyrics of his song, which is called ``Nineteen Years Old.'' I am \nnot going to sing it, and all of you should be very excited that I am \nnot singing it. I couldn't do justice to the words he wrote.\n  He wrote:\n      nineteen years old six months from prom\n     out in a jungle in Vietnam\n     so scared don't wanna die\n     thinking bout home, tears in my eyes\n\n     what are we fighting for, I'm so sick of war\n     I bet the guys on the other side\n     wanna go home like I do\n     miss your mom and dad, the life I had\n     I pray to God I'll get back home again\n     to be with you\n\n     search and destroy, kill or be killed\n     mayhem out here in the battlefield\n     adrenaline flowing another sleepless night\n     holding my M16, ready for a fight\n\n     here in the trenches fear everywhere\n     death and destruction smoke in the air\n     mortars grenades deafening sounds\n     shrapnel and bullets flying all around\n     praying to God calling for mom's\n     another buddy dies in Vietnam\n     another buddy dies in Vietnam\n     and it goes on and on and on and on\n\n     what are we fighting for, I am so sick of war\n     I bet the guys on the other side\n     Wanna go home like I do\n\n  I want to thank him, and I know he was greatly moved by and inspired \nto write this song by encountering a Vietnam vet. I think all of us who \nhave had those experiences meeting veterans and people who serve can't \nhelp but be moved by the quality of their continued devotion to their \nbrothers-in-arms but also the quality of their service.\n\n\n                       Connect With Veterans Act\n\n  So I was moved to doing something for veterans, making sure that our \nveterans have an opportunity when they return home to basically \nreconnect with their families. So while each week I come to the Senate \nfloor to honor the persons who gave their lives in the Vietnam war, to \ntruly honor them and our current servicemembers and veterans, we have \nto make real changes to better support them.\n  Today I am proud to reintroduce a bipartisan bill with Senators \nMoran, King, and Boozman that would better connect our Nation's new \nveterans with the services, resources, and benefits that are available \nright at home in their communities. My Connect With Veterans Act, S. \n1797, aims to help servicemembers transitioning to civilian life after \nthey separate from the military and begin to settle into their \ncommunities.\n  Organizations, such as the Association of Defense Communities, have \nstated that the most important part of the transition from \nservicemember to civilian comes in the short period of time after that \nservicemember leaves the military. We need to make sure it is effective \nand successful, and there is more we could do to accomplish that goal.\n  Too often, these veterans do not have access to the basic information \non local services, and many communities have few ways to connect with \nthem. I have traveled across North Dakota and listened to our veterans. \nI hear time and time again about the need for veterans to have more \ninformation on services and opportunities available to them at the \nlocal level.\n  My Connect With Veterans Act would provide these veterans with better \naccess to that information by making it easier for cities, counties, \nand tribes to interact directly with them. It is a simple but \ncommonsense bill. Participation, No. 1, is completely voluntary. \nTransitioning servicemembers will be given the option to share their \ncontact information with communities in which they intend to live after \ncompleting military service.\n  Interested cities, counties, and tribes will be able to request that \ncontact information from a secure directory maintained by the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs so they can provide the information. \nIntegrating back into civilian life may be particularly difficult for \nthose living in rural communities, like so many of the communities in \nmy home State of North Dakota, as they often have fewer resources and \naccess to less services.\n  As a study from 2014 shows, half of the veterans polled from the wars \nin Iraq and Afghanistan said they are having difficulty adjusting to \ncivilian life. This reasonable solution would help change that by \nallowing local communities to connect with new veterans at the earliest \npossible point in the transition process. With 550 servicemembers \ntransitioning daily--I want to repeat that--550 servicemembers \ntransitioning daily nationwide out of the military and with nearly \n250,000 service men and women expected to leave military service over \nthe next 5 years, we have to prepare.\n  We have to say thank you by making sure they get the services they \nhave earned and that we can connect them with communities where they \ncan continue to participate and serve their country and their \ncommunities. I know from talking to North Dakotans that this bill will \nespecially benefit communities in my State that have unmet employment \nneeds.\n  As you can imagine, over 20,000 jobs go unfilled, and we have all of \nthese trained servicemembers who are coming out of the military who \nwould be just excellent additions to our North Dakota community. So \nwhether it is employment or health care or family support services, we \nhave to do better. I appreciate the opportunity to talk about this. We \nhave to have a plan for our servicemembers. I think connecting them \nwith their community is a great plan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/16/senate-section/article/S5165-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5165-S5166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXPORT-IMPORT BANK\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Finally, Mr. President, I would just like to give a \nlittle update on what has been happening since we have basically \nallowed the charter of the Ex-Im Bank to expire. Just as we predicted, \nthat unilateral disarmament in our trade financing opportunities would \nopen the door for opportunities in other countries. We are seeing more \nand more this delay in basically having a fully functioning Ex-Im Bank \nis already costing jobs and opportunities in our State.\n  So I want to reinforce that, not by just my words but talk about what \nis being said about the U.S. Export-Import Bank being shut down as what \nis good for China and bad for our competitiveness. Today, the Business \nStandard printed an interview with the head of the Export-Import Bank \nof India, who said that with U.S. Ex-Im Bank closing down, we would now \nhave more markets because Indian products are going to compete with \nU.S. products, and now that competition will go away.\n  In a recent Reuters article, the chief risk analyst of the China \nExport-Import Bank said that the end of the American Export-Import Bank \nwould help China be more competitive. He said, ``With respect to \ncompetition in strategy and policies between the U.S. and China, this \nis a good thing'' for China.\n  Another recent article said China's central bank is injecting $32 \nbillion into the China Development Bank and $30 billion into the \nExport-Import Bank of China. We are seeing very similar growth in the \nExport-Import Bank of India.\n  So I would suggest, if we truly want to remain a global competitor, \nif we truly want to access an international market where we have--in \nfact, 95 percent of all consumers live outside our country. If we don't \nhave access to those markets and if we are not competing on a level \nplaying field, it is going to cost American business, including \nAmerican small business, opportunities--opportunities for exports, \nopportunities for profitability. But equally important, it is going to \ncost American jobs. So sooner rather than later we expect we will have \na vote on reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank.\n  I know we continue to see challenges to having that vote. We continue \nto see challenges to this institution. But I will tell you that many \nsmall businesses in my State are contacting us, wondering why in the \nworld we would\n\n[[Page S5166]]\n\ndo this. Why in the world would we shut down the Ex-Im Bank that is a \ncritical part of that trade infrastructure? So why in the world, \nindeed. Why would we ever make this decision? It is a decision that \nneeds to be reversed. We need to get the Ex-Im Bank fully functioning \nand back in business.\n  So we are going to be doing everything we can in this next month and \ninto future months, if we expect that we are going to eliminate the \npossibility of unilateral disarmament in trade financing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan).

Mr. President, I rise to recognize and congratulate \nthe Pikeville Independent Schools system in Pikeville, KY, on the \noccasion of its 100th anniversary. Under the leadership of \nSuperintendent Jerry Green, it is one of the best public school systems \nin the Commonwealth.\n  Before the founding of Pikeville Independent Schools, in the early \n20th century, the region contained only a scattering of small, one-room \nschoolhouses. In 1915, the first public high school in Pike County \nopened under the system's first superintendent, Tobias J. Kendrick. \nThere were approximately 150 students and 9 teachers and \nadministrators. Courses taught included geometry, advanced algebra, \nphysics, German, rhetoric, and 4 years of Latin. The first senior class \ncontained only one graduate, a man named Vernon Stump.\n  Today, Pikeville Independent Schools includes Pikeville Elementary \nand Pikeville Junior High/High School. The district boasts some 1,280 \nstudents from preschool to the 12th grade, and all go by the nickname \n``Pikeville Panthers.'' Both Pikeville Elementary and Pikeville High \nare accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, and \nthe school district has been chosen as one of only 17 Kentucky school \ndistricts to receive the What Parents Want Award.\n  Pikeville Independent Schools is constantly evaluating and creating \nprograms to serve the needs of the students in the district. Pikeville \nElementary, which serves preschool through grade 6, features full-time \nhumanities teachers for art, music, and band. It has transition \nprograms for both new students entering preschool and exiting students \ngraduating into the seventh grade. It has many volunteer programs, and \nPikeville Elementary volunteers log an average of 3,000 volunteer hours \nper year. It features a fully equipped science lab, an active and \nsupportive parent-teacher organization, small class sizes, and \nindividual instruction and tutoring.\n  Pikeville High School, which serves grades 7 through 12, offers its \nstudents 8 honors courses and 10 advanced placement courses, as well as \nunlimited opportunities for students to earn dual credit at the \nUniversity of Pikeville.

Mr. President, I have represented Quincy, IL, and Adams \nCounty since coming to Congress in 1983 as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives. I have found that there is something special about the \nGem City--its people, its strong sense of community, and the fighting \nspirit to tackle any crisis from floods to storms.\n  That spirit was tested this week.\n  I am relieved and thankful that there were no serious injuries or \nfatalities after a major storm tore through Quincy on Monday night. \nTorrential rain and winds up to 74 miles per hour felled trees, broke \ndozens of utility poles, and tore roofs off several homes and \nbusinesses during the event. The Quincy mayor declared a citywide state \nof emergency Monday evening and Adams County followed with a state of \ndisaster declaration. Several people say the battered city looked like \na warzone.\n  More than 21,000 people were without power on Monday night and \nTuesday. Crews have worked around the clock to restore electricity to \nmost. Due to the loss of power, many stoplights were out throughout the \ncity. Between the outages, flooded streets, and streets made impassable \nby fallen trees, navigating Quincy has been a challenge.\n  The Quincy Park District estimates that the ``jaw dropping'' damage \nto the city's 29 parks--especially Madison and South Parks--far exceeds \nthe devastation from severe storms in 2011 that costs the District more \nthan $400,000. Caretakers at Woodland Cemetery discovered after the \nworst of the storm had passed that a 20-foot piece of a Civil War \nmonument was toppled by the high winds and at least 35 trees were \nuprooted in the cemetery, many of which were more than a century old.\n  Dozens of Quincy residents checked into motels to escape the heat as \nthey started the cleanup of their homes and properties without power. \nJohn Wood Community College and the Quincy Senior and Family Resources \nCenter set up cooling centers to give people a place to take a break. \nThe Red Cross, Salvation Army, and other local agencies have been on \nsite to lend a helping hand.\n  I am grateful that Quincy fire chief Joe Henning, Adams County \nemergency management agency director John Simon, Quincy police chief \nRob Copley, and many other elected officials and community leaders are \nleading cleanup and recovery efforts. Getting the city back on its feet \nand helping the people whose homes and businesses were damaged is a big \njob.\n  In today's Quincy Herald-Whig columnist Steve Eighinger said it best, \n``It's going to be quite a while before things are back to what we \nconsider normal, but we'll get there. We're Quincy. We pay it \nforward.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the column be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n[[Page S5167]]\n\n  In closing, I would like to commend the Quincy and Adams County \ncommunity for pulling together to get through this storm and the \naftermath. The cleanup is daunting, but the spirit endures. From the \npeople of Hannibal and Macomb who have sent crews, trucks, and supplies \nto area residents who opened their homes and businesses to the \ndisplaced to the local businesses--grocery stores and gas stations--\nthat have supplied free ice, water, and recharging stations, and done \ntheir best to restock basic supplies so residents can feed and care for \ntheir families to the Kroc Center and its supporters who have fed \nQuincyans. This has been a team effort.\n  I stand ready to support the local clean up and recovery efforts in \nQuincy and Adams County and will continue to keep community residents \nin my thoughts as they get the Gem City back up and running.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Quincy Herald-Whig, July 16, 2015]\n\n           `Normal' Still a Ways Away, But We Will Get There\n\n                          (By Steve Eighinger)\n\n       There is no use trying to sugar coat what has happened. It \n     has been a brutal week in and around Quincy, thanks to the \n     monstrous storm that swept through Monday night.\n       It was the first time in my life that I was legitimately \n     scared of what might happen at the height of that blowing \n     downpour and accompanying 74 mph winds.\n       My wife, Kathy, was screaming at me to get in the basement \n     with her and Ashes, the family dog. For some reason, I \n     refused. I vowed to stay upstairs, running from one window to \n     another, from one door to the next, to make sure they didn't \n     blow open.\n       Massive limbs and entire trees were falling all around our \n     home. I saw them. I heard them. It was like nothing I had \n     ever experienced.\n       If our home was going down, I had vowed to go with it.\n       Obviously, that was not the smartest thing I ever chose to \n     do. If I had to relive those frightening 30 minutes or so, I \n     would have joined Kathy and Ashes in the basement.\n       It's what happened after the storm had finally passed that \n     was equally--if not more so--incredible.\n       On street after street, block after block, neighbors were \n     assisting friends and helping people they did not even know. \n     While only initial, limited assistance could be offered \n     Monday night because of the lack of light, but the true heart \n     of Quincy emerged Tuesday, as it always does.\n       One of the most heartwarming stories I encountered this \n     week involved a family of five--a husband, wife and three \n     kids--seeking out homeowners, particularly older adults, in \n     need of help. The anonymous family cleaned yards, did not ask \n     for anything in return and quietly moved on to the next \n     person in need.\n       They did not seek and would not accept publicity. I admired \n     that more than anything.\n       ``We're doing it because we should,'' they answered.\n       That is the ultimate pay it forward.\n       Another offering of help was provided by at least one \n     Hannibal inn handling an influx of displaced Quincyans on \n     Monday night who needed a place to stay, including one family \n     with a special-needs child who needed air conditioning. The \n     lodge in question not only found the Quincyans rooms, but \n     also provided them at a discount.\n       Hannibal has a big heart, too.\n       How about the cooperation of the drivers working their way \n     through the maze of downed trees and no stoplights? Most \n     major Quincy intersections became a little more than four-way \n     stops, which could have become incredibly dangerous at major \n     sites like 36th and Broadway. Instead, there was an esprit de \n     corps among Quincyans, who politely made it all work.\n       Hats off to the local supermarkets for providing items like \n     free bags of ice and places to recharge cellphones.\n       If you follow any social media, you have been impressed \n     with the salutes, praises and admiration of Ameren and other \n     workers trying to restore power to city residents. More than \n     1,000 Ameren workers alone have been working around the \n     clock.\n       It's going to be quite awhile before things are back to \n     what we consider ``normal,'' but we'll get there.\n       We're Quincy. We pay it forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/16/senate-section/article/S5167-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EVERY CHILD ACHIEVES ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate has approved landmark \nlegislation to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965. Since 2001, the failed policies of No Child Left Behind have \nunfairly burdened educators and administrators by holding students \naccountable for snap-shot academic progress. The Senate's bipartisan \naction today--an overwhelming vote of approval--is one step forward in \nthe reversal of these troubling measures. The Every Child Achieves Act \nfurther highlights the Federal Government's crucial responsibility to \nensure that students everywhere, across the country, have access to the \nresources they need for lasting academic success.\n  Since 2001, I have heard from parents, teachers, students, \npolicymakers, and administrators about the negative impact of No Child \nLeft Behind. I voted against the legislation, as I did not agree, and \nstill do not agree, with a one-size-fits-all approach to education. I \nwas also disappointed with the bill's rigid Federal accountability \nmeasures, as I truly believe States and local education agencies \ndeserve flexibility when it comes to how schools operate.\n  The Every Child Achieves Act restores educational flexibility to the \nStates, while safeguarding student access to resources, regardless of \nrace, gender, financial status, and learning level. I am pleased that \nthe bill takes into account the greater needs of students in rural \nareas, increases funding for early childhood education programs, and \nimproves school safety measures. I am especially pleased with the \nbill's innovative assessment and accountability demonstration authority \nprovision, which will allow Vermont to adopt competency and \nperformance-based assessments that prove far more than how well a \nstudent can perform on a test on one given day.\n  Of course, no bill is perfect, and this one is no different. I am \ndisappointed that several amendments that would have improved the bill \nwere not adopted. The Student Non-Discrimination Act, authored and \nfiled as an amendment by Senator Franken, would have taken the \nimportant step of ensuring protections for students who face harassment \nand bullying simply because of their actual or perceived gender \nidentity or sexual orientation. I was proud to cosponsor the amendment, \nand remain committed to revisiting this important discussion to ensure \nall children are protected against bullying and discrimination in our \nschools. It garnered a majority of support in the Senate; it should \nhave been adopted.\n  In a strong statement of support, the Senate came together in \nopposition against amendments on portability and private school \nvouchers, which would have unfairly redistributed title I funding from \nour Nation's highest need schools. I commend Chairman Alexander and \nRanking Member Murray for their leadership throughout the debates, and \nfor their tireless dedication to promoting educational reform that \nserves the needs of all students.\n  We have come together, members on both sides of the aisle, to support \nthe Every Child Achieves Act. Amid the partisan rancor, bipartisanship \nwon the day, and the winners in this debate will be students in Vermont \nand across the country. As the House and Senate move to conference, I \nhope Congress will use this opportunity to promote the many measures \nincluded in the Senate's bill, which reflect the true needs of all \nstudents, educators, parents, and administrators.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/16/senate-section/article/S5167-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5167-S5168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TRUCK SAFETY ACT\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, trucking is critical to the movement of \ngoods to consumers across the country. The trucking industry is a vital \npart of our economy. But we must also strive to ensure that goods are \nmoved as safely as possible.\n  Each year, nearly 4,000 lives are lost due to truck crashes on our \nNation's highways. Research by the National Transportation Safety Board \nhas shown that many of these crashes could have been prevented. We owe \nit to the individuals and families affected by these tragedies to take \nevery step possible to reduce the risks and prevent needless crashes.\n  That is why I have introduced the Truck Safety Act of 2015, \nlegislation that will modernize our truck safety standards and embrace \nnew technologies that can help reduce crashes across the country.\n  This legislation includes a provision to require collision-avoidance \ntechnologies in commercial vehicles involved in interstate commerce. \nMany of the fatalities that occur today are the result of rear-end \ncollisions that could have been prevented with current technology. The \ntechnology can detect an impending collision or unsafe lane departure \nand automatically apply corrective action if a human operator is\n\n[[Page S5168]]\n\nunable to do so. The U.S. Department of Transportation has been working \non this issue for several years and many companies have adopted these \ntechnologies. It is far past time that these lifesaving devices were \nrequired in all new trucks.\n  This legislation also updates the minimum liability insurance for \ntrucking companies in order to ensure victims of crashes are able to \nfully recover the cost of their damages. In a report to Congress, the \nDepartment of Transportation found compelling evidence to reevaluate \nthe current minimums. In some crashes, the costs to the victims far \nexceed the current minimum of $750,000. This can leave the victim \nuncompensated for damages. Minimum insurance levels have not been \nraised since the 1980s, so my legislation requires an immediate \nincrease to the trucking minimum insurance level, requires annual \nadjustment for inflation, and requires the Department of Transportation \nto evaluate whether minimum insurance levels need to be increased \nfurther.\n  Another provision in this legislation would allow the Secretary to \nrequire trucking employers to compensate drivers for time spent on duty \nbut not driving. Currently, drivers are compensated for miles driven, \nnot hours worked. This sets up an unsafe incentive structure in which \ndrivers are penalized for taking the rest they need in order to drive \nsafely. Drivers in this country play a critical role in ensuring \nAmericans get the products they rely on for everyday life. They should \nnot be forced to choose between resting to ensure their safety and \nfeeding their families at home.\n  The Truck Safety Act is an important step to protect our truck \ndrivers, individuals, and families traveling on our Nation's highways. \nI urge my colleagues to support this legislation that will improve the \nlives of New Jerseyans and individuals across the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/16/senate-section/article/S5168-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SHAYNE PIERRE\n\n Mr. DAINES.

I send my condolences and prayers to his wife Cookie \nand all of Mr. Kidder's family in this time of mourning. He was a man \ntruly committed to his family and his community. Although he will be \nsorely missed, his great influence in Nevada will be felt for years to \ncome.\n\n  Mr. Kidder was born on July 31, 1937, in Tonopah. His first 3 months \nwere spent in Manhattan, NV, where his father worked on the dredge. His \nfamily then moved to Honey Lake for 5 months and later to Hawthorne, \nwhere he was raised. Throughout his youth, Mr. Kidder was recognized \nfor his incredible athletic ability, excelling in baseball, basketball, \nand track at Mineral County High School. He also contributed to the \nschool's football team as a manager. Along with sports, he exceeded \nexpectations in the academic world. Mr. Kidder participated in Mineral \nCounty High School's Honor Society and Block H, as well as attending \nAmerican Legion Boys State, which is a highly respected educational \nprogram. After graduating high school, he attended the University of \nNevada, Reno, UNR, where his drive in sports continued. From 1957 to \n1959, Mr. Kidder played on the university's baseball team for Wolf Pack \nCoach Jake Lawlor. He graduated from UNR in 1959.\n  Shortly after, Mr. Kidder was recruited by Al Seeliger to teach and \ncoach in Carson City. Throughout his tenure, he taught physical \neducation, social studies, and Nevada history, and he served as \ndepartment head for six different departments. He also coached golf, \nsoftball, basketball, and baseball and helped with the track team. His \nexcellent teaching and coaching skills touched the lives of generations \nof Nevada students, including me. He was truly a role model as my \nphysical education teacher. His tremendous involvement in Carson City \nwill never be forgotten.\n  Mr. Kidder maintained only the highest level of excellence for \nhimself and for the local community throughout his career. Carson City \nremains better because of his outstanding contributions.

Mr. President, today, I wish to recognize Capt. \nChristy Wise for her unwavering dedication to both the U.S. Air Force \nand to overcoming great adversity. It gives me great pleasure to \nrecognize this young woman's incredible strength. She embodies the true \nBattle Born spirit of determination, fearlessness, confidence, and \nresilience.\n  Captain Wise was raised in Reno with her twin sister and younger \nbrother. She was accepted into the Air Force Academy, where she \ndiscovered her passion for flying. Shortly after, she was accepted into \nflight school. Captain Wise flies HC-130 search and rescue planes \nsupporting pararescue jumpers and helicopters at her squadron base in \nValdosta, GA. She flew in six rescue missions in Afghanistan in 2012 \nand is scheduled to redeploy this December. I extend my deepest \ngratitude to her for her service and wish her a safe deployment.\n  Recently, Captain Wise competed in the 2015 Department of Defense \nWounded Warrior Games after sustaining serious injuries in a boating \naccident. Immediately after recovering from her injuries, which \nincluded the loss of her right leg above the knee, Captain Wise began \nher rehabilitation. She had heard about the Department of Defense \nWounded Warrior Games though a fellow amputee patient at the gym and \ndecided to compete. Less than 3 months after the accident, Captain Wise \ncompeted in track and field, swimming, and cycling events, earning 11 \nmedals total. It was only 2 days before the games that she was cleared \nto participate in the swimming events, leaving her little time to \npractice for the five events in which she would compete. She received \nsilver medals in both hand cycling and field competitions and received \na bronze medal in the 100-meter wheelchair race.

After graduating from the Virginia Military Institute in \n1977 as an infantry officer, he commanded troops at every level and is \na veteran of multiple deployments to Iraq. As a young officer, he \nserved in Germany, Georgia, California, and the Pentagon. He attained \nthe rank of brigadier general in 2006 and was assigned as the assistant \ndivision commander for maneuver of the 2nd Infantry Division in Korea. \nUpon returning, he was assigned to the U.S. Army Installation \nManagement Command. From there, he became the deputy commanding \ngeneral, operations, for I Corps and Fort Lewis, WA. He deployed to \nIraq serving in that role to the Headquarters for Multi-National \nCorps--Iraq, where he learned first-hand the atrocities inflicted by \nimprovised explosive devices, foreshadowing his rise to his final \nposition. In his penultimate position, he was the commanding general, \nEighth U.S. Army; and Chief of Staff for United Nations Command, \nCombined Forces Command, and U.S. Forces Korea, preserving readiness \nfor coalition forces across the Korean Peninsula.\n  As the director of JIDA, Lieutenant General Johnson set the \nconditions for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat \nOrganization, JIEDDO, to become JIDA, a permanent defense agency that \nwill enhance our Nation's capabilities to fight improvised weapons and \nthose who employ them. He has fostered countless cooperative \nrelationships with government agencies, coalition partners, academia, \nand industry supporters in an effort to find innovative solutions to \nthese pervasive improvised threats. During this challenging transition \nperiod for JIEDDO, he led an extensive effort to right-size the \nworkforce and streamline processes while still bestowing a high level \nof support to the warfighter.\n  I had the pleasure of personally working with Lieutenant General \nJohnson during his tenure at JIEDDO.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1786\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Centennial Monetary \n     Commission Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Constitution endows Congress with the power ``to \n     coin money, regulate the value thereof''.\n       (2) Following the financial crisis known as the Panic of \n     1907, Congress established the National Monetary Commission \n     to provide recommendations for the reform of the financial \n     and monetary systems of the United States.\n       (3) Incorporating several of the recommendations of the \n     National Monetary Commission, Congress created the Federal \n     Reserve System in 1913. As currently organized, the Federal \n     Reserve System consists of the Board of Governors in \n     Washington, District of Columbia, and the Federal Reserve \n     Banks organized into 12 districts around the United States. \n     The stockholders of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks include \n     national and certain state-chartered commercial banks, which \n     operate on a fractional reserve basis.\n       (4) Originally, Congress gave the Federal Reserve System a \n     monetary mandate to provide an elastic currency, within the \n     context of a gold standard, in response to seasonal \n     fluctuations in the demand for currency.\n       (5) Congress also gave the Federal Reserve System a \n     financial stability mandate to serve as the lender of last \n     resort to solvent but illiquid banks during a financial \n     crisis.\n       (6) In 1977, Congress changed the monetary mandate of the \n     Federal Reserve System to a dual mandate for maximum \n     employment and stable prices.\n       (7) Empirical studies and historical evidence, both within \n     the United States and in other countries, demonstrate that \n     price stability is desirable because both inflation and \n     deflation damage the economy.\n       (8) The economic challenge of recent years--most notably \n     the bursting of the housing bubble, the financial crisis of \n     2008, and the ensuing anemic recovery--have occurred at great \n     cost in terms of lost jobs and output.\n       (9) Policymakers are reexamining the structure and \n     functioning of financial institutions and markets to \n     determine what, if any, changes need to be made to place the \n     financial system on a stronger, more sustainable path going \n     forward.\n       (10) The Federal Reserve System has taken extraordinary \n     actions in response to the recent economic challenges.\n       (11) The Federal Open Market Committee has engaged in \n     multiple rounds of quantitative easing, providing \n     unprecedented liquidity to financial markets, while \n     committing to holding short-term interest rates low for a \n     seemingly indefinite period, and pursuing a policy of credit \n     allocation by purchasing Federal agency debt and mortgage-\n     backed securities.\n       (12) In the wake of the recent extraordinary actions of the \n     Federal Reserve System, Congress--consistent with its \n     constitutional responsibilities and as it has done \n     periodically throughout the history of the United States--has \n     once again renewed its examination of monetary policy.\n       (13) Central in such examination has been a renewed look at \n     what is the most proper mandate for the Federal Reserve \n     System to conduct monetary policy in the 21st century.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n       There is established a commission to be known as the \n     ``Centennial Monetary Commission'' (in this Act referred to \n     as the ``Commission'').\n\n     SEC. 4. DUTIES.\n\n       (a) Study of Monetary Policy.--The Commission shall--\n       (1) examine how United States monetary policy since the \n     creation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n     System in 1913 has affected the performance of the United \n     States economy in terms of output, employment, prices, and \n     financial stability over time;\n       (2) evaluate various operational regimes under which the \n     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the \n     Federal Open Market Committee may conduct monetary policy in \n     terms achieving the maximum sustainable level of output and \n     employment and price stability over the long term, \n     including--\n       (A) discretion in determining monetary policy without an \n     operational regime;\n\n[[Page S5173]]\n\n       (B) price level targeting;\n       (C) inflation rate targeting;\n       (D) nominal gross domestic product targeting (both level \n     and growth rate);\n       (E) the use of monetary policy rules; and\n       (F) the gold standard;\n       (3) evaluate the use of macro-prudential supervision and \n     regulation as a tool of monetary policy in terms of achieving \n     the maximum sustainable level of output and employment and \n     price stability over the long term;\n       (4) evaluate the use of the lender-of-last-resort function \n     of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as a \n     tool of monetary policy in terms of achieving the maximum \n     sustainable level of output and employment and price \n     stability over the long term; and\n       (5) recommend a course for United States monetary policy \n     going forward, including--\n       (A) the legislative mandate;\n       (B) the operational regime;\n       (C) the securities used in open market operations; and\n       (D) transparency issues.\n       (b) Report on Monetary Policy.--Not later than December 1, \n     2016, the Commission shall submit to Congress and make \n     publicly available a report containing a statement of the \n     findings and conclusions of the Commission in carrying out \n     the study under subsection (a), together with the \n     recommendations the Commission considers appropriate.\n\n     SEC. 5.

A bill to provide authority for certain depository \ninstitutions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Community Bank \nSensible Regulation Act of 2015, a bill which would allow financial \nregulators to exempt community banks from unnecessary and unduly \nburdensome requirements, if doing so is in the public interest. My bill \nwould provide this authority to the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller \nof the Currency, and the Federal Reserve, and would apply to financial \ninstitutions with less than $10 billion in assets.\n  The aim of my legislation is to allow the financial regulators to \nexempt community banks from highly complex regulations designed to \nprotect our financial system from systemic risks that would arise from \nthe failure of larger banks. All banks, large and small, should be \nwell-capitalized and properly regulated, but that does not mean that \nour financial regulators must impose a ``one size fits all'' regulatory \nregime across the board without regard to the risks posed to the \nfinancial system by banks with fundamentally different business models \nand of vastly different sizes.\n  Some regulations that are appropriate or essential for larger banks \nmay make no sense when applied to community banks. For example, current \nlaw requires community banks to demonstrate that they are in compliance \nwith the Volcker Rule--which restricts proprietary trading and hedge \nfund investments by banks--even though community banks rarely engage in \nsuch trading. Even so, community banks must shoulder the burden of \ncomplying with this complex regulation. My bill would allow the \nregulators to exempt community banks from the Volcker Rule.\n  As the GAO has noted, smaller banks are ``disproportionately affected \nby increased regulation, because they are less able to absorb \nadditional costs.'' These costs are significant. According\n\n[[Page S5174]]\n\nto industry representatives, the cost of complying with regulations \nabsorbs 12 percent of total bank operating expenses, and is two-and-a-\nhalf times greater for small banks than for large banks.\n  The cost of regulation puts community banks at a competitive \ndisadvantage vis-a-vis larger banks. Over the past 2 decades, the share \nof the U.S. banking industry represented by community banks has \ndeclined from 40 percent to just 18 percent. Over the same period, the \nshare of the market represented by the five largest banks has grown \nfrom roughly 18 percent to 46 percent. I am concerned that unnecessary \nregulation will accelerate these trends, and ironically, contribute to \nthe further consolidation of the banking industry into a handful of \n``too big to fail'' banks.\n  Community banks play an essential role in meeting the credit needs of \ntheir customers, particularly small businesses, homeowners, and \nfarmers. Although community banks represent just 18 percent of total \nbanking assets, they are responsible for half of our nation's small \nbusiness loans. With small business formation at generational lows, it \nis essential that we preserve and protect their access to credit, as \nthey are the major driver of job creation in our country. In addition, \ncommunity banks provide \\3/4\\ of our Nation's agricultural loans, a \nline of finance that requires highly specialized knowledge of farming \nand a long-term perspective suited to agricultural cycles.\n  Regulators should be able to tailor their regulations to take the \ndistinctive nature of community banks into account. My bill would allow \nregulators to exempt community banks from unnecessary and burdensome \nregulations where it is in the public interest to do so. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/16/senate-section/article/S5174-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n  SA 2257.
