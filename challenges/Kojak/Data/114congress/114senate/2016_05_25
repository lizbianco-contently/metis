Mr. President, after 2 days of needless delay from \nacross the aisle, this morning we will vote to invoke cloture on the \nmotion to proceed to the National Defense Authorization Act and \nhopefully adopt that motion quickly thereafter.\n  This critical defense bill passed committee on a strong bipartisan \nbasis; there is no reason for further delay from our Democratic \ncolleagues. The National Defense Authorization Act authorizes funds and \nsets our policy for our military annually. It is always an important \nbill. It is especially important today.\n  Consider the multitude of threats facing us from nearly every corner \nof the world. Consider the need to start preparing our armed services \nfor the many global threats the next President will be forced to \nconfront.\n  As I have noted before, some of the most senior national security \nofficials within this administration--such as Secretary of Defense \nCarter and General Dunford or those recently retired from service, such \nas retired General Campbell--have spoken of the need to better position \nthe next President in theaters from Afghanistan to Asia to Libya.\n  So whoever that President is, regardless of party, we should take \naction now to help our next Commander in Chief in this year of \ntransition. That is what this defense legislation before the Senate \nwill help us do.\n  No. 1, it will support our allies and partners, authorizing funds to \ncombat ISIL, preserve gains in Afghanistan, increase readiness at NATO, \nand assist friends like Ukraine.\n  No. 2, it will enhance military readiness, providing more of the \nequipment, training, and resources our servicemembers need.\n  No. 3, it will help keep our country safe, getting us better prepared \nto confront emerging threats like cyber warfare, terrorism, and the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  Critically, this bill will also honor our commitment to \nservicemembers, their families, and veterans, authorizing raises, \nsupporting Wounded Warriors, and delivering better health care and \nbenefits for the men and women who stand on guard for us every single \nday.\n  This bill contains sweeping reforms designed to advance American \ninnovation and preserve our military's technological edge. The funding \nlevel it authorizes is the same as what President Obama requested in \nhis budget.\n  As I said earlier, it passed the Armed Services Committee on a strong \nbipartisan vote, 23 to 3, including every single Democrat on the \ncommittee. The Armed Services chairman, Senator McCain, knows what it \nmeans to serve. He is always on guard for the men and women of our \nmilitary. This bill is a reflection of his commitment. It is a \ncommitment to them, and it is a commitment to every American--to \npreparing our country in this year of transition for both the threats \nwe face today and the threats yet to emerge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/senate-section/article/S3129-5"}, {"day": "25", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3129-S3130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               OBAMACARE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last week Senators came to the floor to \nhighlight the continuing broken promises of ObamaCare. We did so in the \nshadow of proposed double-digit ObamaCare premium increases in States \nacross our country, everywhere from Tennessee, to Oregon, to New \nHampshire.\n  Americans have gotten further bad news since, including ObamaCare \npremium spikes that could reach as high as 83 percent in New Mexico. \nEach day seems to bring more and more troubling news, which could mean \nheartbreak for even more Americans. Take, for instance, some headlines \nfrom just last night:\n  ``Most Arkansas insurers propose double-digit hikes for 2017.''\n\n[[Page S3130]]\n\n  ``Some rates in Georgia insurance exchange could soar in 2017''--and \nby ``soar,'' they are talking about as high as 65 percent.\n  As one paper put it, there is ``no end in sight for higher Obamacare \npremiums.''\n  These are not just abstract numbers; they can represent real pain for \nfamilies already stretched to the limits under the ObamaCare economy. A \nrecent survey showed that health care costs are now the top financial \nconcern facing American families, ahead of concerns about low wages and \neven job loss. And what does the Democratic response too often seem to \nboil down to? They say: Just get over it. Get over it.\n  Just the other day, the Democratic leader in the Senate said that \nAmericans who, like us, disagree with the pain ObamaCare is causing \nneed to just ``get over it and accept the fact that ObamaCare is here \nto stay.'' That is hardly the only callous comment we have heard from \nacross the aisle on ObamaCare.\n  I would ask Democratic colleagues to listen to the Americans who \ncontinue to share heartbreaking ObamaCare stories with us, like these \nKentuckians:\n  Should the Elizabethtown man who says he can't afford to see a doctor \nunder his ObamaCare plan, despite the fact that he pays more for his \npremium than his house payment, just get over it?\n  Should the dad from Owensboro who said he has seen his family's \nhealth costs increase by nearly 250 percent under ObamaCare just get \nover it? ``What happened to being rewarded for working hard in \nAmerica?'' this dad asked. ``What happened to the American dream?'' \nMany Americans are wondering the same thing.\n  ObamaCare continues to write a record of broken promises at the \nexpense of the American people. Instead of lowering premiums by up to \n$2,500 for a typical family, as then-Senator Obama talked about on the \ncampaign trail, ObamaCare has raised many families' rates. Instead of \nmaking health care costs more affordable for all, ObamaCare has led to \nunaffordable out-of-pocket costs for families all across our country.\n  The bottom line is this: ObamaCare is too often hurting those it \nproposed to help. It is a direct attack on the middle class.\n  The Republican-led Senate sent a bill to President Obama's desk to \nrepeal this partisan law so we can replace it with policies that \nactually put the American people first because, let's remember, the \nAmerican people do not need to get over ObamaCare's failures. Our \nDemocratic colleagues need to finally join us in working to end those \nfailures.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/senate-section/article/S3129-6"}, {"day": "25", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO RUBY PAONE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, when Ruby Paone started her first day \non the job in 1975, she was fresh out of college. Today, she has served \nhere longer than any current Senator, save one--the senior Senator from \nVermont.\n  Ruby Paone, our Senate doorkeeper, has seen a lot in her 41 years in \nthe Senate. She has watched legends, such as Baker and Mansfield, in \naction. She has acquired a lot of unique titles, such as card desk \nassistant and reception room attendant.\n  We are really going to miss her when she retires later this month. I \nthink Ruby is looking forward to kicking back in Myrtle Beach after \nmore than four decades of Senate service. More importantly, I think she \nis anxious to spend some time with her family, away from work. Her son \nTommy works at the Senate appointments desk. Her daughter Stephanie \nworks in the Democratic Cloakroom. Her husband Marty used to as well. \nThe two of them even met right here in the Senate.\n  We are glad that Ruby will get to spend more quality time--that is, \nnon-Senate time--with her family. And we are sure she would like to see \na little more of her son Alexander as well.\n  As Ruby knows, she will be leaving a family behind here too. She has \nserved as surrogate mom of sorts to many doorkeepers, pages, and \ninterns. They have looked up to her for wisdom and for advice. And it \nis no wonder. She has a lifetime of stories and experiences to share in \na retirement that is richly deserved.\n  We will miss Ruby Paone, but we wish her the very best, and above \nall, we thank her for her many years of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/senate-section/article/S3130-1"}, {"day": "25", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is really unfortunate that the Republican \nleader comes here often and continues to harp and complain about \nObamaCare, even though it is continuing to work. More than 9 out of 10 \nAmericans now have health care. This is the best it has ever been. It \nhas never been this way before.\n  They say they want to repeal ObamaCare. They have tried scores of \ntimes. It hasn't worked. So I guess what they are saying is that they \njust want to get rid of this, and have people go back to the way it \nused to be. I remember and people in America remember canceling \ninsurance if they were sick. If they had a real serious illness, they \nwould cancel because their bills were too high. If they had a \npreexisting disability, forget about it--they couldn't get insurance. \nIf they were a college student, they were cut off quickly; they \ncouldn't stay on their family's insurance policy. Many men and women \ncan stay on the insurance of their parents.\n  So we would be much better off with ObamaCare and with helping the \nAmerican people if, rather than complain, as they have for 6 or 7 \nyears, they worked with us to try to improve the bill. We know it can \nbe improved, but we can't do it alone.\n  So that is how unfortunate this argument has been. We need everything \nObamaCare does. We don't have anything better. And we are not going to \ndo anything to help the poor. That is a strange way to conduct \nbusiness, but that is the way it has been in the filibuster-laden \nRepublican Party since Obama was elected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/senate-section/article/S3130-3"}, {"day": "25", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3130-S3131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION AND DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS BILLS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, over the next few weeks, the Senate will be \nvoting on both the Defense authorization and Defense appropriations \nbills, these two very important pieces of legislation. We need to take \nthe time to understand them and, of course, to read these bills and \nmake sure we are doing the right thing. Just reading the Defense \nauthorization bill is not going to be an hour-long deal. It is not \ngoing to be done watching a ball game or watching television programs. \nWhy? It is a very big piece of legislation. This is it. Try reading \nthat between innings--1,664 pages.\n\n  Chairman McCain may have read this. He may understand every line in \nit. He would have a better chance than most of us because he is the one \nwho conducted the hearings behind closed doors--secret sessions. Few \noutside the committee probably know what is in this monstrous bill, \nthis big bill.\n  Even though the chairman came here on Monday and started complaining \nabout this legislation, if you want to get an idea how the bill was \nhastily put together, consider this. The bill was put together behind \nclosed doors. At 5 p.m. last night, Senator McCain's committee voted on \nthe classified annex to the Defense authorization bill. He had been \nranting and raving about Democrats holding up this bill. That is what \nthe Republican leader did here today. He didn't rant and rave, but he \ndid say we are holding it up. But the committee hadn't finished its \nwork as of last night. The bill wasn't done. They just finished it last \nnight at 5 p.m. Unfortunately, it appears that this massive bill is \neverything Senator McCain has in the past complained about. He says he \nhated what has gone on in the past.\n  This bill is loaded with special projects--loaded with them--\nsprinkled with special favors and many different flavors. It has \nextraneous provisions, and who knows what else. If there were ever \nanything that could be identified as an earmark or two or three or four \nor a few hundred, it is in this bill. I thought Senator McCain didn't \nlike that. I can understand why some would want to rush this bill \nthrough the Senate without a lot of public scrutiny, but we are not \ngoing to do that. This legislation is far too important.\n\n[[Page S3131]]\n\n  I started reading a book last night called ``Red Platoon.'' It is a \nbrand-new book written by a man who won a Medal of Honor. It talks \nabout a remote outpost in Afghanistan. We know what sacrifices the Red \nPlatoon and the men and women who fought in the new wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan made. So we know they deserve better than just rushing \nthrough this bill. Hard-working American taxpayers deserve better.\n  The one thing we can all agree on is that Americans must have a \nstrong, strong military with the capability to defend America's \nnational security interests around the world and to protect us here at \nhome. There is no dispute about that.\n  Democrats believe that we must take care of our middle class also. We \nmust know that the security of all Americans depends not only on the \nPentagon--on bombs and bullets--but also on other national security \ninterests--the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, the Drug \nEnforcement Administration, and the help that comes through this \nlegislation to local police departments and first responders. That is \nwhy we fought so hard as Democrats last year to stop the devastating \ncuts from sequestration, which was generated by the Republicans and \nwhich would have been a disaster for the military, our national \nsecurity, and millions of middle-class Americans.\n  We need a bipartisan budget agreement. We reached that, and it is \ncommendable that the Republican leader said we want to stick with that. \nWell, we need to stick with it because that bipartisan budget agreement \nwas based on the principle that we need to treat the middle class as \nfairly as the Pentagon. That agreement was intended to avoid another \nbudget fight this year, but it doesn't appear that is possible.\n  I was pleased that my Republican friends stuck to this budget \nagreement in the committee with both authorization and appropriations. \nBut we have been told--and told publicly--that they intend to break the \nbipartisan budget agreement and propose $18 billion increases only for \nthe Pentagon. This money is going to come from a strange source. It is \ngoing to come from the military itself.\n  I had the good fortune of meeting with the Secretary of Defense last \nThursday. To use the so-called OCO moneys--they are used for \nwarfighting, and that is why they are put in there--to take this and \nuse it for some other source or some other purpose is wrong.\n  My friend talks about how the military supports this legislation. Of \ncourse they do. But they don't support what Chairman McCain is going to \ntry to do. In the process, we need only to look at what else is going \non with the Republican Senate. They refuse to provide money to fight \nthe Zika virus, to stop the terrible situation regarding opioid drugs. \nThe people of Flint, MI, are still waiting for help. We need funding \nfor local law enforcement, which has not been forthcoming, and for the \nintelligence agencies and our first responders. It is wrong not to take \ncare of these folks.\n  We reached an agreement last year. Now both sides need to keep our \npromises and the agreement for the American people. We must treat the \nmiddle class fairly. Make no mistake, as the appropriations process \nmoves forward, we are going to insist on that.\n  I will support cloture on the motion to proceed to the Defense \nauthorization bill today, even though in 2010 my friend, the chairman \nof the committee, voted with other Republicans to stop moving forward \non the Defense bill. But Democrats are willing to proceed deliberately. \nWe are going to hold Republicans to their word on the budget agreement. \nWe are going to do our jobs, as we want them to do theirs. Our Armed \nForces and middle-class Americans deserve nothing less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/senate-section/article/S3130-4"}, {"day": "25", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO RUBY PAONE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend the Republican leader talked about \nRuby Paone. I have so much admiration and respect for her that it is \nhard to put it into words.\n  In 1975, a young woman from North Carolina came to the U.S. Capitol. \nShe was overwhelmed by everything, especially overwhelmed by this huge \nbuilding she was going to work in. Ruby was excited for her first day \nof work at the Senate reception desk. But as she approached the \nCapitol, realizing what her new job was all about and the new city, she \nrecalls: ``Walking into this building, I was overwhelmed.''\n  It is understandable that she felt that way. Many of us have and do \nfeel the same way. The Capitol was a big change for Ruby. She was \nraised in the small town of Bladenboro, NC. She was a farm girl who \nspent her summers pulling peanuts--I didn't know you pulled peanuts, \nbut that is what they do--and harvesting tobacco. Ruby graduated from a \nsmall Presbyterian school, St. Andrews University. She is the only one \nin her family to leave their small town in North Carolina. But as Ruby \ngot situated in her new job that day, another feeling set in. She said: \n``It just felt right to be here.''\n  Now, 41 years, 2 months, and 9 days after she walked through the \nCapitol doors to start a new job, she is leaving. It is hard to imagine \nher not being here. To borrow from her own words, ``it just feels \nright'' to have Ruby here.\n  Tomorrow is going to be her last day in the Senate. After more than \nfour decades of service to the greatest deliberative body, Ruby is \nretiring to spend more time with her family. Her family's gain is our \nloss. She is an institution, a fixture in the Senate. She is the \nlongest serving woman who works with the doorkeepers. She has been here \nfor 7 different Presidential administrations, 10 consecutive \ninaugurations, 16 different Sergeants at Arms, and 383 different \nSenators.\n  She recognizes every one of those 383 Senators, and there is a reason \nthat she does that. When she was first hired, we didn't have the names \nand faces in these books we give to the pages and to new Senators. It \nwasn't done that way then. She had to do it by memorizing their names \nand learning to recognize them when they came into the Capitol Rotunda \nand on the Senate floor. She would walk around and look for these \nSenators to get to know who they were. She grew close to many of these \nSenators, including Blanche Lincoln, Tom Carper, and Thad Cochran.\n  I know Ruby. I know her family quite well. Her husband worked on the \nSenate floor for many years. He was instrumental to Majority Leader \nGeorge Mitchell, Tom Daschle, and me. No one knows the rules of the \nSenate better than Marty Paone. He now works for President Obama in the \nOffice of Legislative Affairs. He is a very special person, and I have \nsuch admiration for him.\n  When their children were in high school, we would often talk about \ntheir children--how they played ball, how they did well, how they \ndidn't do so well the night before. That is what our conversations were \nabout. We didn't talk a lot of Senate business, unless we had to. I am \nsorry to say that we had to many times. Marty helped me so many times \nthrough very difficult situations on the floor.\n  To say that I will miss Ruby is an understatement. I want be able to \ncome to Ruby and say: How is Marty? How is he doing?\n  Throughout my entire time in the Senate, she has always been here \nwith a smile and a kind word. She is as much a part of this place as \nanyone who has ever served in the Senate. So I, along with the entire \nSenate--Senators, staff--wish her the best as she embarks on her well-\ndeserved retirement.\n  Ruby, thank you very much for your 41 years, 2 months, and 9 days of \nservice.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/senate-section/article/S3131-1"}, {"day": "25", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in opposition to S.J. Res. 28 and \nask to be allowed to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, it seems there are only two speakers. So \nperhaps we will be able to finish this discussion by the top of the \nhour.\n  Last week, the Senate appropriated a large sum of money to fight the \nthreat of the Zika virus. We are going to spend, together with what was \nalready available and what was appropriated last week, at least $1 \nbillion fighting this Zika threat and probably $2 billion, and rightly \nso because Zika is a potential health threat to Americans. We believe \nit is money well spent to prevent more serious diseases and more \nserious afflictions to Americans. Yet we have in place today a USDA \nprogram that is protecting Americans against 175,000 cases of cancer, \naccording to USDA documents. It is protecting Americans against 91 \nmillion exposures to antimicrobials.\n  This USDA catfish inspection program that is under threat this \nmorning is protecting Americans from some 23.3 million exposures to \nheavy metals, and yet this program cost the taxpayers, in the \nDepartment of Agriculture, only $1.1 million a year. Compared to the $1 \nbillion or $2 billion we are going to spend on Zika, a relatively small \n$1.1 million a year is protecting Americans against contaminated \nforeign catfish coming in from overseas.\n  We have been inspecting imported fish for quite a while in the United \nStates of America. Under the old procedure, the Food and Drug \nAdministration inspected imported catfish. There was a problem. Under \nthe old procedure, FDA inspected only 2 percent of all imports and what \nwe found out was that in the 98 percent of catfish imports that were \ncoming in, there was a lot of bad stuff coming in that threatened \nAmericans and their good health.\n\n  In 2008 Congress passed--and the President made a change to it, which \nwas reiterated in 2012 and has recently been enacted--the farm bill. It \nprovides for 100 percent inspection of foreign catfish instead of the 2 \npercent that we had before.\n  What has been the result of that? By comparison, when the FDA was \ninspecting Vietnamese and other foreign catfish coming into the United \nStates during the years 2014 and 2015, the FDA picked up on a whopping \ntotal of two shipments of foreign catfish containing known carcinogens \nover the course of more than 2 years. I am glad they found those \ncarcinogens and stopped these cancer-causing agents from coming in, but \nthink of what we could have discovered that was eventually consumed by \nAmericans if we had inspected not just 2 percent but the whole 100 \npercent. By contrast, the USDA inspection procedures began in April, \nand in that short time the USDA has intercepted two shipments of \nforeign catfish containing known carcinogens in less than 2 weeks. If \nyou do the math, the USDA is intercepting harmful catfish--and there is \nno question that the carcinogens are harmful and there is no question \nthat we can't legally bring this contaminated catfish in--at a rate 21 \ntimes greater than under the old procedure under the FDA.\n  It is mystifying that we will soon vote on a resolution that would go \nback to the old way. We caught two deadly shipments in the last 2 \nweeks, and we have before us today a resolution that would put us back \nto a procedure that found two violations in the course of 2 years.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter, dated May 24, \n2016, from the Safe Food Coalition be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                          Safe Food Coalition,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 24, 2016.\n       Dear Senator: The undersigned members of the Safe Food \n     Coalition write to strongly oppose S.J. Res. 28, which \n     provides for congressional disapproval and nullification, \n     under the Congressional Review Act, of the final rule for a \n     mandatory inspection program for fish of the order \n     Siluriformes, including catfish and catfish products \n     (``catfish''). Congress transferred regulation of catfish \n     from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to the U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection \n     Service (FSIS) as part of the 2008 Farm Bill. Since then, we \n     have supported FSIS rulemaking in written comments and in \n     public meetings.\n       Starkly different catfish farming practices in foreign \n     countries, often accompanied by inadequate environmental and \n     food safety standards, raise significant public health \n     concerns. The FDA regulation of catfish did not sufficiently \n     address those concerns. As the U.S. Government Accountability \n     Office found in 2011, FDA's inspection of imported seafood \n     products was ``ineffectively implemented,'' and subjected \n     just 0.1% of all imported seafood products to testing for \n     drug residues. Yet chemical residue violations in imported \n     catfish are rampant. According to testing performed by FDA \n     and the Agriculture Marketing Service, fully 9% of imported \n     catfish products tested positive for the banned antimicrobial \n     chemical malachite green, and 2% tested positive for the \n     banned chemical gentian violet.\n       The FSIS inspection program, and its continuous inspection \n     requirement, will provide a sorely needed safeguard against \n     this type of adulteration. The program, which applies to both \n     domestic and foreign processors, incorporates more robust \n     import inspection protocols. These more rigorous standards \n     are already paying off. Within the past two weeks, FSIS \n     inspectors have detained two shipments from Vietnam of \n     catfish products adulterated with gentian violet, malachite \n     green, enrofloxacin, and fluoroquinolone--all banned \n     substances under U.S. law. Under the new inspection program, \n     these importers will have to cover the expense of test-and-\n     hold sampling while they undertake corrective actions. \n     Compared to the former inspection regime, this will provide \n     needed assurance to American consumers, and more equitably \n     assign the costs of enforcement.\n       For the foregoing reasons, we urge rejection of the motion \n     to rescind the catfish inspection rule.\n           Sincerely,\n     Center for Foodborne Illness, Research & Prevention,\n     Consumer Federation of America,\n     Consumers Union,\n     Food & Water Watch,\n     National Consumer League,\n     STOP Foodborne Illness.\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I will read a few sentences from the \nsecond paragraph of this Safe Food Coalition letter, which is signed by \na coalition, including the Center for Foodborne Illness Research & \nPrevention, the Consumer Federation of America, the Consumers Union, \nFood & Water Watch, the National Consumers League, and STOP Foodborne \nIllness. Those groups have formed this coalition, and they say this:\n\n       Starkly different catfish farming practices in foreign \n     countries, often accompanied by inadequate environmental and \n     food safety standards, raise significant public health \n     concerns. The FDA regulation of catfish did not sufficiently \n     address those concerns.\n\n  Two percent of all imports were inspected and the others came in \nwithout a single look from the government.\n  The letter continues:\n\n       As the U.S. Government Accountability Office found in 2011, \n     FDA's inspection of imported seafood products was \n     ``ineffectively implemented'' and subjected just 0.1% of all \n     imported seafood products to testing for drug residues. Yet \n     chemical residue violations in imported catfish are rampant. \n     According to testing performed by FDA and the Agriculture \n     Marketing Service, fully 9% of imported catfish products \n     tested positive for the banned antimicrobial chemical \n     malachite green, and 2% tested positive for the banned \n     chemical gentian violet.\n\n  I will simply say, these people don't have an ax to grind. They don't \nstand to make a lot of money by selling cheap catfish to the American \nconsumer. They are looking out for food safety, and they say there is a \nstarkly different farming practice here than they have in foreign \ncountries. It strikes me as stunning that with the starkly different \npractices--the unsafe practices in Vietnam and places like that in Asia \nand the safe practices here--that we would be about to vote in a few \nmoments on a procedure that is very tough on catfish produced by \nAmerican workers. If this resolution passes today, 100 percent of \ncatfish produced by American workers earning a living and doing this \nfor their families will be subject to inspection, and only 2 percent \nwill be subjected--only 2 percent of the starkly different catfish \nprocedures that are potentially bringing in carcinogens--will be \nsubjected to testing by the government. It is completely backward.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote no on final passage of this S.J. Res. \n28. Let's treat American workers at least the\n\n[[Page S3133]]\n\nsame as we treat foreign workers. Let's treat products grown and \nproduced in America the same as products grown and produced in foreign \ncountries, and let's do it in the name of food safety.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise to support this Congressional \nReview Act resolution to block the USDA catfish inspection program.\n  Despite what my colleague from Mississippi has said, there is no \nevidence that the catfish program provides any additional food safety \nbenefit. It was designed to create a trade barrier.\n  I appreciate the opposition of my colleague from Mississippi. He is \nworking for his catfish farmers in Mississippi. I know I like \nMississippi catfish, but I like all kinds of catfish. In fact, the \nUSDA, FDA, CDC, and the GAO have all confirmed that catfish, both \ndomestic and imported, is already safe under FDA's jurisdiction. In \nfact, you are more likely to get hit by lightning than to get sick from \nimported or domestic catfish.\n  Let's not lose sight of what we are talking about. The FDA inspects \nhundreds of species of domestic and imported seafood. There is nothing \nparticularly dangerous about catfish that merits setting up a whole \nseparate inspection program under the U.S. Department of Agriculture. \nThe fact is, the FDA is responsible for the safety of most--about 80 to \n90 percent--of all U.S. domestic and imported foods, and it has years \nof successful expertise in the unique area of seafood safety. The FDA \nsystem has worked for both domestic and imported seafood, and it has \ndone so for years.\n  Let's talk about how we got to this point. Before 2008, the Food and \nDrug Administration was responsible for inspecting all foreign and \ndomestic fish products. The Department of Agriculture inspected \nlivestock, such as beef, pork, and poultry. However, a provision was \nadded to the 2008 farm bill that transferred the inspection of \ncatfish--not all imported seafood, just catfish--to the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture, requiring that agency to set up a new, separate program \nto inspect just catfish alone. Again, inspection of all other \nnoncatfish seafood remains at the Food and Drug Administration, and it \nstill does today. This means that seafood businesses across this \ncountry that handle catfish are now subject to two different sets of \nregulations from two completely separate Federal agencies.\n  I have heard from businesses in New Hampshire and across the country \nthat are being hit by these burdensome new regulations. They are \naffecting their ability to grow and create jobs. There is no scientific \nor food safety benefit gained from this new program. There is no \nevidence that transferring catfish inspection to the USDA will improve \nconsumer safety.\n  I appreciate that there have been a couple of examples given in the \nlast few weeks of imported catfish. I think we ought to address that \nand do it very quickly, in the same way we address domestic problems \nwith our food system and do it very quickly.\n  Officials from the FDA and USDA have explicitly stated that catfish \nis a low-risk food. The USDA acknowledges in its own risk assessment \nthat no one has gotten sick from eating domestic or foreign catfish for \nmore than 20 years. The USDA catfish inspection program is a classic \nexample of wasteful and duplicative government regulation that is \nhurting our economy, and it is expensive. The FDA has been inspecting \ncatfish up until now for less than $1 million a year. The USDA, by \ncomparison, has spent more than $20 million to set up the program \nwithout inspecting a single catfish during that time. Going forward, \nestimates are that the program could cost as much as $15 million to \noperate per year.\n  The Government Accountability Office, GAO, has recommended \neliminating this program 10 separate times.\n  If there is no food safety benefit, costing millions and actively \nhurting jobs across the country, why was this program created in the \nfirst place? This program, as I said earlier, is a thinly disguised \nillegal trade barrier against foreign catfish. This kind of a barrier \nleaves us vulnerable on other American products, such as beef, soy, \npoultry, and grain, to a wide variety of objections from any WTO \nnation. Since there is no scientific basis for what we are doing, any \nWTO nation that currently exports catfish to the United States could \nchallenge it and secure WTO sanction trade retaliation against a wide \nrange of U.S. exports, as I said, things like beef, soy, poultry, \ngrain, fruit, and cotton, to name a few.\n  Again, it is important to go back and note how this policy change was \ncreated. It was not included in either version of the 2008 farm bill \nthat passed the House and Senate, and it was never voted on or debated \nin either Chamber before it was enacted. It was secretly included in \nthe final version of the farm bill by the conference committee in 2008. \nThe only other time the Senate has voted on this issue was in 2012, and \nwe voted to repeal it in a strong bipartisan voice vote.\n  The resolution we are talking about today has strong bipartisan \nsupport. A discharge petition was signed by 16 Democrats and 17 \nRepublicans in order to initiate floor action and, most importantly, \nthis resolution actually has the chance to become enacted into law. \nThis is not a program this administration ever wanted to have to \nimplement. In fact, it delayed implementing a final program for 8 \nyears, I think in hopes that we in Congress would finally be able to \nget a vote that repealed the program. Unfortunately, this is an \nexpensive and harmful special interest program--something some might \ncall an earmark--and it is already having severe impacts on some \nbusinesses.\n\n  I am hopeful that my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nimportant resolution to block the USDA catfish inspection program once \nand for all.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I strongly urge the Senate to reject S.J. \nRes. 28, which would overturn a catfish inspection rule that is working \nto protect American consumers.\n  In both the 2008 and 2014 farm bills, Congress directed the \nadministration to transfer authority for catfish inspection from the \nFood and Drug Administration to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. We \ndid so based on evidence that the FDA inspection regime then in place \nwas inadequate.\n  And we have been proven right. The FDA's inspection regime was \ninadequate.\n  Over the course of 2 years, from 2014-2015, the FDA caught a total of \ntwo shipments of foreign catfish containing known dangerous cancer-\ncausing chemicals that are illegal in the United States--two shipments \nover 2 years.\n  Under the catfish inspection rule, USDA has intercepted two shipments \nof foreign catfish containing illegal, cancer-causing chemicals in less \nthan 2 weeks.\n  If you do the math, USDA is intercepting harmful catfish at a rate \nnearly 21 times greater than the rate at which FDA was before its \ninadequate program was closed down.\n  USDA's inspection program has already proven to better safeguard \nconsumer safety than FDA, which makes sense. After all, USDA is the \nmost experienced, well-equipped agency to ensure farm-raised meat \nproducts, including catfish, are as safe as possible.\n  The catfish rule is not costly. The Congressional Budget Office has \nsaid this resolution won't save a dime.\n  The catfish rule is not duplicative. The FDA ceased all catfish \ninspections on March 1 of this year. USDA is now the only agency \ncharged with inspecting catfish.\n  The catfish rule does not create a trade barrier. The rule applies \nequally to foreign and domestic producers. USDA has stated that the \nrule is compliant with the World Trade Organization's equivalency \nstandard.\n  The catfish rule has already been proven to keep American consumers \nsafe from illegal, cancer-causing chemicals. Adoption of this \nresolution would not change the law regarding catfish inspection. It \nwould only call into question, and potentially halt, the ability of the \nU.S. Government to carry out these proven consumer safety protections.\n  It is clear that the inspection rule is working as intended to \nprotect U.S. consumers. Congress was right in twice mandating these \ninspections.\n  I hope Senators will reject this resolution.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S3134]]\n\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time in \na quorum call be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this morning we will be voting on a joint \nresolution of disapproval for the rule that establishes the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture's catfish inspection program. As I mentioned \nyesterday, I would remind my colleagues that the General Accounting \nOffice, a watchdog organization we rely on for their views, \nparticularly on fiscal issues and matters--and I think that of all the \ninstitutions of government right now, probably the GAO is arguably the \nmost respected--GAO has warned in 10 different reports between 2009 and \n2016 that ``the responsibility of inspecting catfish should not be \nassigned to the USDA,'' calling the program ``wasteful'' of tax dollars \nand ``duplicative'' of the FDA's existing inspections on all other \nseafood products.\n  That is an interesting item, I say to my colleagues. The FDA performs \ninspections on every seafood product that comes into the United States \nof America. And guess what. There is only one, and that is catfish.\n  Let's be very blunt about the reality. The reality of this is to stop \nthe competition from foreign sources--specifically one of which is the \ncountry of Vietnam--from coming into this country. It isn't much more \ncomplicated than that when you see that there is only one. And by the \nway, that only one, according to the GAO, cost the taxpayers $19.9 \nmillion to develop and study the inspection program, and the GAO says \nit will cost the Federal Government an additional $14 million annually \nto run the program. The GAO found that the Food and Drug Administration \ncurrently spends less than $700,000 annually to inspect catfish. So, \naccording to my calculations, over $13 million a year will be saved by \ndoing away with this duplicative inspection program.\n  I noticed in the vote yesterday that a majority of my colleagues on \nthis side of the aisle who call themselves fiscal conservatives, \nincluding the Chair, have said: Well, we want to keep this duplicative \nprogram. That is fine with me, if that is your view, but then don't \ncome to the floor and call yourself a fiscal conservative if you are \nwilling to spend $14 million a year that is not needed and not wanted \nand is clearly duplicative and especially is earmarked for a special \ninterest--i.e., the catfish industry in Southern States. So vote \nhowever you want, but don't come back to the floor when you see a \nduplicative or wasteful program and say you are all for saving the \ntaxpayers' dollars, because you are voting to spend $14 million of the \ntaxpayers' dollars on a duplicative and unnecessary program.\n  Don't wonder why only 12 percent of the American people approve of \nwhat we do. The reason is because we allow programs such as this, where \nparochial interests override what is clearly the national interest and \nthe taxpayers' interest. That is why the Center for Individual Freedom, \nthe National Taxpayers Union, the Heritage Foundation, the Taxpayers \nfor Protection Alliance, the Campaign for Liberty, the Independent \nWomen's Forum, the National Taxpayers Union, the Taxpayers for Common \nSense, and on and on, are all totally in favor of this resolution. \nEvery watchdog organization in this town and in this country favors \nthis resolution.\n  I also point out that one of the arguments my dear friend from \nMississippi will raise again is that somehow, unless we have this \nspecial office, this specific office for inspecting catfish, there will \nbe a problem with the safety of the catfish that are imported into this \ncountry. In classic farm bill politics, proponents worked up specious \ntalking points about how Americans need a whole new government agency \nto inspect catfish imports. As a result, USDA has begun operating a \nprogram that will require foreign importers to adjust the catfish \nprogram over a period of 5 to 7 years while the USDA duplicates the \nFDA's inspection program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for the opponents has expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. All I can say is that the FDA has been doing this job for \nyears and has intercepted banned compounds in foreign imported catfish, \nand I would point out that the USDA has encountered problems in \ndomestic catfish as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for the opponents has expired.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, do I understand that the proponents of \nthis resolution have 4 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute of that time to my friend \nfrom New Hampshire who has sought recognition and then reserve 3 \nminutes for myself. I am happy to yield to the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, first of all, we have 10 GAO reports that \nhave found this to be duplicative and wasteful.\n  For some reason, there is a special office for catfish but no other \nfish species. The USDA normally inspects meat and poultry, not fish, so \nto waste taxpayer dollars this way lacks common sense.\n  I say to my friend from Mississippi, I know he made an argument on \nthe Budget Committee, but the Budget Committee's opinion basically says \nthere is no direct spending. We all know that a lot of domestic \nspending is discretionary spending, and discretionary spending will \ncontinue on this program. The GAO has found that this costs an \nadditional $14 million a year, this duplicative program. By the way, \nthe $1.5 million that has been cited has not been confirmed by GAO.\n  Colleagues, let's not be bottom dwellers. Let's get rid of \nduplicative and wasteful spending. We have 10 GAO reports stacked up. \nWe can get rid of this duplicative program that inspects catfish, which \nis already inspected by the FDA. By the way, as Senator McCain has \nsaid, the FDA has intercepted the toxins my colleagues and friends from \nMississippi have cited as well as toxins found in domestic fish. They \nknow how to do this, and we don't need a special office for catfish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I oppose the resolution. My friend from \nNew Hampshire has said: Let's inspect catfish like all other catfish. I \nwould tell her and I would tell my colleagues that American-produced \ncatfish is inspected by the USDA at a rate of 100 percent. If the \nresolution passes, that will not apply to foreign catfish. How does \nthat make sense? How is that fair to Americans? How is that fair to \nAmerican consumers when we have information that indicates clearly that \nthere are different, less safe procedures overseas than we have in the \nUnited States? Yes, let's treat all catfish the same. We inspect \nAmerican catfish; let's inspect foreign catfish.\n  We can say this new program is expensive, and I guess if we say it \nenough, it becomes true. But the fact is that the agency that is going \nto enforce this program, the USDA, says it is going to cost $1.1 \nmillion a year. It seems like a reasonable cost to prevent cancer-\ncausing agents from coming in from overseas, goods that will be eaten \nby Americans.\n  One could say that it is duplicative, and I guess if it is said \nenough, one might think it becomes true. But the fact is that the FDA \nis out of the inspection business, according to law, and the USDA is in \nthe business, and they can do it for $1 million a year. That is not a \nduplication.\n  Saying it is expensive doesn't make it true, and saying it is \nduplicative doesn't make it true. The facts are exactly otherwise.\n  This is about food safety. This is about preventing cancer-causing\n\n[[Page S3135]]\n\nagents from coming in and being consumed by Americans. Now is the time. \nThis is the time to vote no, to protect American consumers from cancer-\ncausing agents.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading \nand was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The joint resolution having been read the \nthird time, the question is, Shall the joint resolution pass?\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report the motion to proceed.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 469, S. 2943, a bill to \n     authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2017 for military \n     activities of the Department of Defense, for military \n     construction, and for defense activities of the Department of \n     Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such \n     fiscal year, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, it is an honor to serve in the Senate. It \nis an honor to serve the people of Arkansas. I would never complain \nabout the tasks we are given.\n  There is one small burden I bear, though. As a junior Senator, I \npreside over the Senate--I usually do it in the mornings--which means I \nam forced to listen to the bitter, vulgar, incoherent ramblings of the \nminority leader. Normally, like every other American, I ignore them. I \ncan't ignore them today, however.\n  The minority leader came to the floor, grinding the Senate to a halt \nall week long, saying that we haven't had time to read this Defense \nbill; that it was written in the dead of night.\n  We just had a vote that passed 98 to 0. It could have passed \nunanimously 2 days ago. Let's examine these claims that we haven't had \ntime to read it--98 to 0--and in committee, all the Democrats on the \nArmed Services Committee voted in favor of it. When was the last time \nthe minority leader read a bill? It was probably an electricity bill.\n  What about the claims that it was written in the dark of night? It \nhas been public for weeks. And this, coming from a man who drafted \nObamaCare in his office and rammed it through this Senate at midnight \non Christmas Eve on a straight party-line vote?\n  To say that the Senator from Arizona wrote this in the dead of night, \nslipped in all kinds of provisions, that people don't have time to read \nit, that is an outrageous slander. And to say he cares for the troops, \nhow about this\n\n[[Page S3136]]\n\ntroop and his son and his father and his grandfather--four generations \nof service, to include almost 6 years of rotting in a prisoner of war \ncamp. To say he is delaying this because he cares for the troops, a man \nwho never served himself, a man who, in April of 2007, came to this \nvery floor, before the surge had even reached its peak, and said the \nwar was lost when over 100 Americans were being killed in Iraq every \nmonth, when I was carrying their dead bodies off an airplane at Dover \nAir Force Base--it is an outrage to say we had to delay this because he \ncares for the troops. We are delaying it for one reason and one reason \nonly: to protect his own sad, sorry legacy.\n  He now complains in the mornings that the Senate is not in session \nenough, that our calendar is too short. Whatever you think about that, \nthe happy byproduct of fewer days in session in the Senate is that this \ninstitution will be cursed less with his cancerous leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I believe that the other side of the aisle \nhas been informed that, at noon, I will ask that we move forward with \nthe bill.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding now that, most likely, the \nDemocratic leader will object to moving forward with the defense \nauthorization bill. That is deeply regrettable. That is, in fact, \nconfounding to me; that even though there may be differences on the \nother side of the aisle, that we would not move forward, given the \nsituation in the world today and the men and women who are serving in \nour military.\n  I would remind my colleagues that this legislation was passed through \nthe committee with a unanimous vote from the Democrats and under the \nleadership of my friend from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, who has also \nserved this Nation honorably in uniform, albeit, poorly educated. The \nfact is, we have a tradition the Senator from Rhode Island and I have \nbeen scrupulously observing; that is, to work in a bipartisan fashion \nfor the good of the country.\n  I would mention a couple of things. One is the Democratic leader \nyesterday or the day before said they hadn't had time to read the bill. \nThe bill has been online since last Wednesday--last Wednesday, a week \nago. Obviously, that seems to be sufficient time for most to be able to \nexamine the bill. We have been on the floor explaining it. There have \nbeen press releases. There have been all kinds of examination of the \nlegislation.\n  As has been pointed out, we have had legislation when the Democratic \nleader was in the majority that we never saw until the time he demanded \na vote, particularly when they had 60 votes in order to override any \nobjections that we might have--including, by the way, the passage of \nthe now-disastrous ACA, or known to some of us as ObamaCare, which now \nwe are seeing the catastrophic consequences, including our citizens \nseeing dramatic increases in their premiums to the point where it is \nsimply unaffordable, and there is more to come.\n  The fact is, after 13 hearings with 52 witnesses, a unanimous vote on \nthe other side, 3 in opposition on my side, we came up with a defense \nauthorization bill. The defense authorization bill has reached the \nPresident's desk and has been signed by the President for 53 years. In \nmy view, there is no greater example over that 53-year period of the \nability of both sides to work together for the good of the country.\n  Here we have, just recently, what appears to be--most evidence \nindicates--a terrorist act, the blowing up of an airliner. We have \nalmost unprecedented suicide attacks in the city of Baghdad, which have \nkilled over 1,000 people in the last year. We have ISIS metastasizing \nthroughout the region, including Libya, and now rearing its ugly head \nin Afghanistan. We have a situation of abuse of human rights that is \nalmost unprecedented. We have a migrant refugee flow into Europe, which \nobviously it is well known that Mr. Baghdadi has instructed some of \nthese young men and possibly young women to be prepared to commit acts \nof terror in European and American countries. Already, some of those \nplots have been foiled.\n  The Director of National Intelligence has testified before our \ncommittee that the world is in more crises than at any time since the \nend of World War II; that there are more refugees in the world than at \nany time since the end of World War II; that America is in danger of \nterrorist attacks.\n  Whom do we rely on? We rely on the men and women who are serving in \nthe military. That is why we passed, on a vote of 24 to 3 through the \nSenate Armed Services Committee--work on both sides in a cooperative \nand bipartisan fashion--the Defense authorization bill.\n  You would think that all of those facts would argue for us to take up \nthis bill immediately and debate and vote. That is what the Senate is \nsupposed to do. That is what our Founding Fathers had in mind.\n  So, again, the Democratic leader is going to object to us moving \nforward. Why in the world, with the world as it is today, with the \nchallenges we face, with the men and women who are serving our Nation \nin uniform with courage--one of whom is a citizen of my own State who \nwas just killed--why are we blocking the ability of this Nation to \ndefend, train, equip, and reward the men and women who are serving in \nthe military? Why? Why won't we move forward and debate? We have always \nhad lots of amendments, lots of debates, lots of votes, and we have \ndone that every year in the years I have been here.\n  The Democratic leader and I came to the Congress together, by my \ncalculation, almost 34 years ago. We have had a very cordial \nrelationship from time to time, and we have strong and spirited \ndifferences. Those differences have been honest differences of opinion \nbecause of the party and the philosophy he represents. But I must say \nto my friend from Nevada, I do not understand why we would not go ahead \nand take up this legislation and begin voting. That is what we are \nsupposed to do. That is what has happened for 53 years where we have \ndebated, we have gone to conference, we have voted, and it has gone to \nthe desk of the President of the United States. A couple of times it \nhad been vetoed, and we had gone back, but the fact is, we have done \nour job.\n  What greater obligation do we have than to defend this Nation? What \ngreater obligation do we have than to help and do whatever we can to \nassist the brave Americans who are serving in uniform? What is our \ngreater obligation? I think it is clear to everyone what our obligation \nis. That obligation is to do our job and do our duty.\n  The American people have a very low opinion of us--on both sides of \nthe aisle. When they see that we are not even moving forward on \nlegislation to protect, help, train, and equip the young men and women \nwho have volunteered to serve this Nation in uniform, no wonder they \nare cynical. No wonder.\n  We have a piece of legislation that is literally a product of \nhundreds of hearings, literally thousands of hours of discussion and \ndebate, of work together on a bipartisan basis, and we are not able to \nmove forward with it and begin the amending process. I don't get it. I \nsay to the Democratic leader, I don't get it. I do not understand why \nhe doesn't feel the same sense of obligation that the rest of us do; \nthat is, as rapidly as possible, for us to take care of the men and \nwomen who are serving, meet the challenges of our national security \nthat our larger--according to the Director of National Intelligence--\nthan at any time since the end of World War II. That is what I do not \nget. Maybe the Democratic leader will illuminate us on that issue, but \nI don't see that there is any argument.\n  When the Democratic leader and I meet the brave men and women who are \nserving in uniform--those who are at Nellis Air Force Base and in Yuma \nat Luke Air Force Base--and tell them that we wouldn't move forward \nwith legislation that was to protect and house and feed and train those \nmen and women, I would be very interested in the response the \nDemocratic leader might have to that.\n  I urge my friend of many years--for the last 34 years--to allow us to \nmove forward and begin debate on this very important issue. I know of \nno greater obligation we have than to address this issue of national \nsecurity, which is embodied in the Defense Authorization Act. In all \nthese 34 years, I have never objected to moving forward with this \nlegislation. I have had disagreements. I have had strong problems with \nsome of\n\n[[Page S3137]]\n\nthe provisions. But I thought it was important to debate and vote.\n  I urge my colleagues not to object. The bill has been available for \npeople's perusal for over a week now. Everybody knows the major points \nof the bill. So I hope the Democratic leader will not use that as a \nflimsy excuse because it is not one. But most importantly, I appeal to \nmy colleague from Nevada to think of the men and women in uniform who \nare serving our country and to think of our obligation to act as best \nwe can to protect them and help them carry out their responsibilities \nand their duties as they go into harm's way.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all postcloture time be \nyielded back and that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. \n2943.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). Is there objection?\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, every time I \ncome to the floor when my friend is on the floor speaking, I need not \ntell everyone within the sound of my voice how much I admire him and \nthe service he has rendered to our country, both as a naval pilot and \nas a Senator and as a Member of the House of Representatives. However, \nhe has a job to do and I have a job to do.\n  I, like most people in the Senate, have not served in the military. I \nacknowledge that. But I didn't go to Canada. I did my best. I had civil \nobligations during the time my friend was in Vietnam.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If my colleague will yield, I believe you have served the \nState of Nevada and this Nation with honor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I do believe we have a job to do. He does \nhis job the best he can, and everyone knows how hard he works. But I \nalso have obligations to my caucus, to this body, and to the country.\n  This is a very big, important bill. I have had the good fortune for \nall these years to work on it. It has been difficult sometimes where we \njust barely made it. I can remember one year that Senator Levin, who \nwas our man on defense, and Senator McCain--we were able to do the bill \nin 2 days. It was an emergency situation. But we have gotten the bill \ndone over all the years I have been here. We have gotten it done all \nthe years I have been the leader.\n  Here is the situation in which we find ourselves. This bill is almost \n2,000 pages long. As he indicated, it could have been online from \nsometime Wednesday night, but the truth is that we didn't get the final \nversion of this bill until last night at 5 o'clock. The committee voted \non the appendix to this bill last night. They completed it at 5 o'clock \nlast night. An important part of the bill deals with the intelligence \naspect of this bill, and a lot of people want to read that and the rest \nof the bill.\n  I don't think it is asking too much to allow Members to understand \nthe bill, to have the opportunity--the Presiding Officer is a very \nstudious man; maybe he will read every page of that bill. Most Senators \nwill not, but they will make sure their staff reads every line. Why? \nBecause they need to do that.\n  This bill was marked up in closed session. It was marked up \nprivately. There was no press there. It was done in closed rooms in the \nRussell Building. I believe that is where all the markups took place. \nThe bill came to the floor.\n  We have amendments we want to offer. We have a caucus tomorrow to \ntalk about that. We have a number of Senators who are preparing \namendments, and they want to discuss them with the rest of the \nDemocrats prior to moving to this bill.\n  We will be out for a week for the Memorial Day recess. When we come \nback, it would seem to me it would be much more efficient and \nproductive if we were ready on that Monday we come back to start \nlegislating. We are not ready to do that yet. We are not ready. We are \ngoing to proceed very deliberately in spite of all the castigations \nabout me made on the Senate floor. I am going to ignore those because, \nto be quite honest with you, anytime we need to talk about any \nstatements I have made at any time, I am happy to do it, but I think it \nwould distract from what we are doing here today to go into the \nstatements made by the junior Senator from Arkansas. But I do have to \nsay this: I am not the reason we are having such short workdays in the \nSenate, even though that was alleged by my friend from Arkansas.\n  If we are going to do our job, we are going to do it the best way we \ncan because it is important.\n  I have said it here on the floor, and I won't go into a lot more \ndetail than what I am saying here, but in the room where we meet on a \nclosed, confidential basis, last Thursday I met with the Secretary of \nDefense. I have the good fortune every 3 weeks to be briefed on what is \ngoing on around the world by the military and by others who help us be \nsafe and secure in this country. We talked about a number of things \nthat we need not discuss here openly, but one thing we can talk about \nopenly here is that the Secretary of Defense thinks it is really, \nreally, really--underscore every ``really'' I said--to put in this bill \nwhat my friend from Arizona said he is going to do, and that is move \n$18 billion from warfighting--the overseas contingency fund--into \nregular, everyday authorization matters that take away from the ability \nof this Pentagon to plan what they are going to be doing next year or \nthe year after--this is something we--I--need to take a hard look at.\n  I said earlier today that I appreciate very much the Republican \nleader responding to a letter we wrote to him, saying that on these \nbudgetary matters, he would stick with the 2-year deal we made. I am \nglad. That is great. But my friend from Arizona wants to violate that \ndeal, and I think that is wrong. We are going to take a hard look at \nthat because we believe that a secure nation not only depends on the \nPentagon--bombs and bullets--but it also depends on all the other \nagencies of government that help us maintain our security: the FBI, the \nDrug Enforcement Administration, all of the different responsibilities \nof the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Let's understand that no one is trying to stall this legislation. If \nnothing happens on this bill in the next 24 hours, I think it will be a \nmuch better process to finish the bill when we come back. We will do it \nwith our eyes wide open. No one will be able to say: I didn't know that \nwas in there. What I said--and I will say it with my friend on the \nfloor--is there are a lot of little goodies in this bill. I think we \nneed to take a look at those.\n  My friend, of all people, who has worked hard during the entire time \nhe has been in the Senate--he and I didn't get much done in the House. \nWhen you are there for two terms, you don't get much done. But in the \nSenate, he has gotten a lot done, focusing on what he believes is \nwasteful spending in the government. I disagreed with him on some of \nthe examples he has pointed out--some of them have dealt with Nevada--\nbut he has done that well.\n  We have a responsibility and we have been trained pretty well by the \nsenior Senator from Arizona to look at these bills, what is in them. I \nhave been told by my staff that we better take a close look at some of \nthe things that have been identified in this bill.\n  I am not here in any way to not give my full support to the efforts \nmade by Jack Reed, the ranking Democrat on this committee. This bill is \nnot John McCain's bill. It is not Jack Reed's bill. It is our bill. I \nwant to make sure that this bill--our bill--comes out in a way that is \ngood for the American people. My view of what is good for the American \npeople may be different from others, but I think we have a \nresponsibility to do everything we can to proceed in a very orderly \nfashion.\n  As soon as we get on this bill, I will do my very best to move it \nalong just as quickly as possible.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Cuban Refugee Benefits\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I came to the floor a few weeks ago to \nbring to people's attention an abuse that is occurring in our welfare \nsystem, and it involves Cuban immigration.\n\n[[Page S3138]]\n\n  Let me describe the situation we face today. If an immigrant comes to \nthe United States from Cuba legally, entering the United States from \nanother country--let me rephrase that. If an immigrant legally enters \nthe United States from any country in the world, except for Cuba or \nHaiti, they cannot immediately receive Federal benefits. If you are a \nlegal immigrant and came to the United States from Venezuela, Mexico, \nor Japan--you did your paperwork and paid your fees--you do not qualify \nfor any Federal benefits for the first 5 years you are in this country. \nHowever, there is an exception for people who come from Cuba. Under the \nCuban Adjustment Act, anyone who comes from Cuba legally or illegally--\nif you cross the border and say ``I am a Cuban''--you are immediately \naccepted into the United States legally. I am not here today to talk \nabout changing that status, even though there is a significant \nmigratory crisis that is building, and I do think that issue needs to \nbe reexamined.\n  Here is the exception to the law: If you come to the United States \nfrom Cuba, whether you entered across the border or entered on a visa, \nyou are one of the only immigrants in America who immediately and \nautomatically qualifies for Federal benefits. You don't have to prove \nyou are a refugee or prove you are fleeing oppression. You don't have \nto prove anything. You are automatically assumed to be a political \nrefugee and given not just status in the United States but a series of \npublic benefits.\n  For decades this has been because U.S. law made the presumption that \nif you were leaving Cuba to come to the United States, you were \nobviously a refugee. I believe for a lot of people who are still coming \nthat is true because they are fleeing a horrible and oppressive regime \nand have had nowhere else to go because in many cases they fear for \ntheir lives in Cuba. For some time now, there has been growing doubt \nabout whether all of the people who are now coming from Cuba are, in \nfact, fleeing oppression. Or are they increasingly becoming more like \nan economic refugee?\n  From what we see in South Florida with our own eyes and also because \nof the investigative reporting by the South Florida SunSentinel, we \nknow there are growing abuses to this benefit. The reason is that many \npeople who are coming from Cuba, supposedly as refugees seeking to flee \noppression, are now traveling back to Cuba 15, 20, or 30 times a year. \nThat raises an alarm right away.\n  If you are entering the United States and immediately and \nautomatically given status as refugees--in addition, you are being \ngiven access to a full portfolio of Federal benefits--because you are \nsupposedly fleeing oppression, but then traveling back to Cuba 15, 20, \nor 30 times a year in many cases, it causes us to have a serious doubt \nabout whether everyone who is coming here from Cuba should be \nconsidered a refugee for purposes of benefits, but today they are.\n  Even at this very moment, we are seeing a historic increase in the \nnumber of people who are originally from Cuba crossing the Mexican-U.S. \nborder. We have seen an increase in the number of rafters. Last week \nthere was a standoff between the Coast Guard and some Cuban migrants \nwho went up to a lighthouse and wouldn't come down because they wanted \nto get the status under the wet-foot, dry-foot policy.\n  I think we can debate that issue. I am not here today to propose \nchanges to the status, but I do think we have to ask ourselves: What \nabout the Federal benefits? What about the benefits they are collecting \nwhich are specifically and exclusively intended for refugees and \nrefugees only? Obviously, if you are traveling back to Cuba over and \nover again, you are not a refugee and therefore should not be eligible \nfor these benefits.\n  The abuses we have now seen are extensive. The stories of people who \nare actually living in Cuba--they are living in Cuba but collecting \ngovernment benefits in America, and their family is wiring the money to \nthem. There are people who are collecting an assortment of benefits \nfrom housing to cash, and that money is being sent to them while they \nlive in Cuba for months and sometimes years at a time. It is an \noutrage. It is an abuse. By the way, I am of Cuban descent and live in \na community with a large number of Cuban exiles and migrants. Our own \npeople in South Florida are saying that this is an outrage. They see \nthis abuse. It is their taxpayer money, and they want something done \nabout it.\n  Today we learned from the Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes \nthese issues in-depth and determines how much they actually cost \ntaxpayers, that the long-term cost of this abuse over the course of the \nnext 10 years will be approximately $2.5 billion to the American \ntaxpayer. A significant percentage of that $2.5 billion is going to \npeople who aren't even living in the United States. We know from \ninvestigations that the money often ends up back in Cuba. We have seen \npeople abuse the system over and over again by having a relative in the \nUnited States who goes to the bank every month, takes a cut, and sends \nthe rest of the money to them. That is your money that is being sent to \nthem.\n  The American people are a generous people, but right now those who \nabuse the system are taking American taxpayers for fools, and we need \nto stop it. That is why I am hopeful that today's report from the \nCongressional Budget Office will give us renewed momentum to end this \nproblem and reform the system. The way to do it is by passing a law I \nhave introduced with Congressman Carlos Curbelo in the House that ends \nthe automatic assumption in U.S. law that assumes all Cuban immigrants \nare refugees. It says that in order to receive refugee benefits, they \nhave to prove they are refugees or legitimately fearing for their lives \nif they were to return to Cuba.\n  This is how the process works: If you cross the U.S.-Mexico border \nand you are from Cuba or arrive on a raft, you will get your status and \nwill be legal in this country, but you will have to prove you are \nactually coming because you fear persecution before you automatically \nqualify for refugee benefits. In essence, all I am asking is that \npeople prove they are political refugees before they qualify for \nFederal benefits that are available only to political refugees.\n  Lest anyone think this is some sort of partisan trick, this is a \nbipartisan measure that my Democratic colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom Florida, supports. It has over 50 bipartisan cosponsors in the \nHouse, including the chairman of the Democratic National Committee.\n  I hope we can get this done, even if the best way to do it is on its \nown merits with a straight up-or-down vote or as an amendment included \nin a larger bill. With all the talk about paying for Zika virus \nfunding, maybe this is one of the ways we can pay for some of that, but \nlet's get it done.\n  Mr. President, $2.5 billion is still real taxpayer money, a \nsignificant percentage of which is being misspent on a loophole that \nexists in the law that most people don't even know is there. I truly \nhope we can address it. It makes all the sense in the world. Everyone \nis asking for it. There is no good-faith or reasonable reason to oppose \nit, and it is my hope we can address it before this Congress adjourns \nat the end of this year, or sooner if possible, and that we can put an \nend to these abuses once and for all.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I wish to add my voice to Chairman \nMcCain's comments a little bit ago about moving forward on the Defense \nauthorization bill. I have the honor of serving with him and Senator \nReed, the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee. It is a huge \nhonor, but as Senator McCain mentioned, we also have an enormous \nobligation and responsibility. The biggest, most important thing we do \nhere is probably our national defense.\n  The chairman asked a really important and simple question: Why? Why \nare we not taking up the Defense authorization bill at this time? Why \nis the minority leader moving forward with a filibuster on this \nimportant bill that was voted out of committee almost on a complete \nbipartisan basis?\n  We have an enormous obligation to our troops and to the national \ndefense of our country, and that is what this bill is all about. We can \ndebate it, but we need to begin that debate.\n  My colleague and friend from Arkansas was on the floor here a little \nbit\n\n[[Page S3139]]\n\nago, expressing his frustration about why we are delaying this \nlegislation. I share that frustration, and I share the chairman's \nfrustration.\n  Why? Why are we filibustering? Why is the minority leader \nfilibustering this important bill?\n  I remind my colleagues on the floor that this is actually a pattern. \nIf you remember, at this time last year the minority leader led a \nfilibuster of the Defense appropriations bill. It funds the bill so we \ncan support our troops who are, by the way, overseas in combat. Despite \nthe fact that the President and others in the White House want to tell \nthe American people they are not in combat, they are in combat. We all \nknow it. We know it is a fiction.\n  Last year the minority leader led a filibuster of the Defense \nauthorization bill--spending for our troops--not once, not twice, but \nthree times on the Senate floor. This pattern of procedural delays \nclearly undermines our troops. There is no doubt about that.\n  I want to add my voice to my colleague. I believe it is a bipartisan \nfrustration, not just Republicans. Remember, the NDAA came out of \ncommittee with huge bipartisan support.\n  One of the most important things we do here is focus on our national \ndefense, focus on having a strong military, and focus on taking care of \nour veterans. We should be bringing that bill to the floor, not \ndelaying it any longer, and debating its merits and moving forward. I \njust don't understand why we are not doing that right now. I certainly \ndon't think the American people understand it.\n\n\n                            The U.S. Economy\n\n  Mr. President, another important topic that we should be talking \nabout on the Senate floor more often is the state of our economy. In my \nview, national defense and economic opportunity for Americans are the \ncritical things we need to debate in the Senate.\n  As I have been doing recently, I wanted to come down here and talk \nabout the health of our economy and the importance of getting to a \nhealthy economy because--make no mistake--we have a sick economy right \nnow. We need to bring the U.S. economy, the greatest economic engine of \ngrowth the world has ever known, back to life. We need to bring \nopportunity once again to people who have lost economic hope.\n\n  Let me be clear. Americans don't easily give up on hope. We are a \ncountry of hope, a country of dreams. Progress is in our DNA. We are \nalways moving forward. But Americans are starting to lose hope because \nthey are not seeing opportunity, they are not seeing progress, and they \nare not seeing a healthy economy. So what is going on?\n  I would like to provide a quote from a recent article in the Atlantic \nMonthly entitled: ``The Secret Shame of the Middle Class.'' I would \nrecommend this article to my colleagues. The author is talking about \nAmericans from all spectrums who, because of the weak economy and \nbecause of no economic opportunity, are living paycheck to paycheck. \nMillions of Americans, as he describes in this article, are living \npaycheck to paycheck. He says:\n\n       It was happening to the soon-to-retire as well as the soon-\n     to-begin. It was happening to college grads as well as high \n     school dropouts. It was happening all across the country, \n     including places where you might least expect to see such \n     problems. I knew that I wouldn't have $400 in an emergency. \n     What I hadn't known, couldn't have conceived, was that so \n     many other Americans wouldn't have that kind of money \n     available to them, either. My friend and local butcher, \n     Brian, who is one of the only men I know who talks openly \n     about his financial struggles, once told me, ``if anyone says \n     he's sailing through, he's lying.''\n\n  Then the author goes on to make a very important statement. He says: \n``In the 1950s and '60s, American economic growth democratized \nprosperity.'' Everybody had opportunity with strong economic growth. \nBut, ``in the 2010s,'' he says, ``we have managed to democratize \nfinancial insecurity.''\n  That is what is happening across the country. In my opinion, a big \npart of the problem--one that is playing out in our politics right \nnow--is the fact that those who are hurting are not being heard. They \nsee their lives. They know their lives. They know the challenges. \nNearly half of Americans would have trouble finding $400 in a crisis, \nas this article lays out, and yet it doesn't match up with what their \nleaders are telling them.\n  Let me give you an example. In a recent speech, President Obama \nactually said: ``We are better off today than we were just seven years \nago.'' He said that anybody who tells you differently ``is not telling \nthe truth.'' That is the President.\n  I guarantee you the President is not agreeing with this article. I \nhate to inform the President, but even former President Bill Clinton \nrecently had this to say about the Obama economy: ``Millions and \nmillions and millions . . . of people look at the pretty picture of \nAmerica [President Obama] painted, and they cannot find themselves in \nit . . . ''\n  That is former President Bill Clinton on the current State of the \nU.S. economy. It is not hard to see why so many can't find themselves \nin the picture that the President has painted of our current economy. \nDuring nearly 8 years of the Obama administration, the number of \nAmericans participating in the labor force shrank to its lowest level \nsince 1978. What does that mean? It means Americans have just quit \nlooking for jobs. In the last 8 years, more Americans have fallen into \npoverty, family paychecks have declined, and the number of people on \nfood stamps has skyrocketed by 40 percent--all during the last 8 years. \nThe percentage of Americans who own homes, the marker of the American \ndream--homeownership--is down by over 5 percent.\n  Let me give you another number that, although many Americans aren't \nfamiliar with, impacts them deeply. A few weeks ago it was announced by \nthe Commerce Department that the economy essentially stopped growing. \nLast quarter we grew at 0.5 percent of GDP, or gross domestic product. \nThat is an indicator of progress, an indicator of the health of our \neconomy, of our country, of opportunity. It was stagnant. It didn't \ngrow.\n  Let me put this in perspective. In the past 200 years, American real \nGDP growth through Democratic or Republican Presidents--it doesn't \nmatter; we have had ups and downs--has been about 4 percent, or 3.7 \npercent. This is what has made our country great. This is what has \nfueled the engine of the middle class of America. Under this \nadministration, the average has been an anemic 1.5 percent of GDP \ngrowth. We have never had even one quarter of 3 percent of GDP growth. \nNow the administration doesn't talk about that. In fact, very few do. \nWe need to talk about it more on the Senate floor. But the American \npeople feel it.\n  This article describes it. They see it again and again when one of \ntheir neighbors or loved ones loses a job, when they see their \npaychecks stagnant for 8 years, when they see another small business in \ntheir community closing, or when they start wondering how they are \ngoing to put their children through college. They see it in the long \nroad ahead of them that shows no promise of a brighter future because \nof the lack of economic opportunity. They see it, and, as this article \ndescribes, they feel the stinging shame.\n\n  The bottom line is that we have had a lost decade of economic growth \nand opportunity in the last 10 years. We need to get serious about this \nproblem. We need to focus on this problem almost above any other issue.\n  My colleagues a lot of times come down here and talk about a moral \nimperative. This is a moral imperative--to create a healthy economy for \nthe entire country--but we are not doing that.\n  Now, what are the solutions? Well, we ask the experts: How do you \ngrow the economy? How can we create articles that talk about \nopportunity and not the shame of the middle class? One idea certainly \nis that we have to reform a Federal Government that tries to \noverregulate every aspect of our economy, especially the small \nbusinesses. When asking the experts or politicians, they all agree. A \nnumber of us had an opportunity to talk to former Chairman of the Fed \nAlan Greenspan yesterday. This clearly is one of the issues where he \nthinks we need to ignite traditional levels of economic growth--\nregulatory reform.\n  Again, Bill Clinton, in a Newsweek cover article in 2011 said that \nthe No. 1 thing we need to do is to move forward on regulatory reform \nto get projects moving, to build this country again.\n  Even President Obama, in his State of the Union Address this year, \nsaid we have to cut redtape and we have to\n\n[[Page S3140]]\n\nlessen the regulatory burden on Americans. So there seems to be \nwidespread agreement, but it is all talk.\n  When we actually try to act, when we actually try to do just minimal \nreforms to this explosion in the growth of Federal rules and \nregulations over the last several decades--when we try to do just a \nlittle of this--we are stopped, stymied, and caught up in politics.\n  Let me give you just two recent examples. I introduced a bill called \nthe RED Tape Act, a very simple bill debated on the Senate floor that \nessentially would put a cap on Federal regulations--a ``one in, one \nout'' rule. If a Federal agency is putting more regs on the U.S. \neconomy, then we have to look at our big portfolio of regulations and \nsunset the equivalent economic burden in terms of regs. It is a very \nsimple idea. It is a 4-page bill. The UK is doing this, Canada is doing \nthis, and it is working.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle certainly \nthought it was a good idea, but when we brought it to the floor--the \nsimple idea that would help our economy--there was a party-line vote. \nIt goes down.\n  Just last week, as we were debating the Transportation appropriations \nbill, we wanted to move on another simple reg idea. The idea is simple. \nIf there is a bridge in a neighborhood and it is structurally \ndeficient--and by the way, the United States has 61,000 structurally \ndeficient bridges--and the bridge is not going to be expanded but is \njust going to receive maintenance or be reconstructed, the permit can \nbe expedited so that it doesn't take 5 years to build or reconstruct \nthe bridge. Again, it was a very simple amendment that used common \nsense on regs. We were told: No, the other side viewed it as a poison \npill. We even heard that the White House was thinking about threatening \nto veto the bill if that amendment was attached to it. These are \nsimple, commonsense ideas that the American people fully support to \nkeep them safe and to grow our economy.\n  We need to grow our economy. We need to take action on the Senate \nfloor to help grow our economy. We need to bring this sick economy back \nto health, but we are not doing it right now. Instead, we see articles \nsuch as the one I just mentioned about middle-class Americans living \npaycheck to paycheck because they don't have opportunity.\n  What we need to do, in addition to focusing on the defense of our \nNation and taking care of our troops, is to get this anemic economy--\nthis lost decade of economic growth that we have seen over the last 10 \nyears--roaring again, to provide opportunity and hope for Americans. \nThat is what we should be focused on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak on S. 2943, \nwhich is the National Defense Authorization Act that we recently \ninvoked cloture on the motion to proceed. I guess we are going to be on \nthis bill, and I am glad we are. In particular, I want to address \nsection 578 of this act.\n  Section 578 is designed to protect our servicemembers' children when \nthey are in school--specifically, to protect them from convicted \npedophiles and other dangerous felons who try to infiltrate our \nNation's schools, when they can, to find more victims. This is a cause \nI have been working on for at least 2\\1/2\\ years in the Senate. We have \na serious problem. We have made some progress, but we have a long way \nto go.\n  For me, this effort to address this began with a terrible story of a \nchild named Jeremy Bell. The story begins in my home State of \nPennsylvania, in Delaware County, PA.\n  A schoolteacher had molested several boys and had raped one of them. \nOfficials at the school figured out that something was going wrong, \nprosecutors were brought in, but they never felt they had enough \nevidence to press charges to bring a case. The school decided they \nwould dismiss this teacher. They didn't want him around anymore, but, \nshockingly and appallingly, they decided that to facilitate his \ndeparture from the school, they would help him get a job in another \nschool. They would actually recommend him for hire somewhere else. \nWell, he did get a job in another school, in West Virginia, in part, \nwith the help of the letter of recommendation he got from the Delaware \nCounty School District.\n  That teacher went on to become a school principal, and of course he \ncontinued his appalling victimization of children. It ended when he \nraped and murdered a 12-year-old boy named Jeremy Bell.\n  Justice eventually caught up with that monster who had gone from \nPennsylvania to West Virginia. He is now in jail, where I hope he will \nremain for the rest of his life, but for Jeremy Bell, of course, that \njustice came too late.\n  Sadly, Jeremy Bell is not alone. Year after year, we see staggering \nand heartbreaking numbers. In 2014, at least 459 teachers and other \nprofessional school workers across the country were arrested for sexual \nmisconduct with the kids they are supposed to be taking care of. That \nis more than one per day. In 2015, the number went up. It got worse--it \nwas 496 arrests--again, schoolteachers and school personnel who have \nunsupervised contact with these children, and so far 2016 is not doing \nany better. We have had 185 arrests in just 144 days.\n  One way to look at this is, just since I got engaged in this battle \n2\\1/2\\ years ago, we have had at least 1,140 school employees arrested \nfor sexual misconduct with the children in their care. Of course, these \nare just the ones who have been caught. These are the ones we know \nabout. These are the ones where there is enough information and \nevidence that the law enforcement folks were comfortable in making an \narrest. How many more? How much is this going on?\n  Of course, every one of these stories is a terrible tragedy for the \nvictims. Like the child whose sexual abuse began at age 10 and only \nended when, at 17, she found she was pregnant with the teacher's child \nor the teacher's aide who raped a young mentally disabled boy who was \nin his care. These are hard things to talk about but think about how \ninfinitely harder it is for the victims who suffer through this, and \nthe examples go on and on.\n  This has to stop. We have to be doing everything we can to try to \nprevent this and to protect the kids who are in our country's schools. \nThis is why, in 2013, I introduced a bill that was meant to do exactly \nthat. It was called the Protecting Students from Sexual and Violent \nPredators Act. It is a bipartisan bill, and it included fundamentally \ntwo protections.\n  The first was a ban on this terrible practice that led to the murder \nof Jeremy Bell. It holds that a school would have to be forbidden from \nknowingly recommending for hire someone who was a known child molester. \nIt seems so appalling. How could this happen? But the Jeremy Bell case \nis not the only case. In fact, this phenomenon by which schools try to \nget rid of their monsters by making him someone else's problem is so \nwidely recognized that schools will facilitate that person getting a \njob somewhere else. This phenomenon has its own name. It is called \npassing the trash. People who are advocates for crime victims, people \nwho help children cope with the horrendous experience they have been \nthrough, know this very well. They know this phenomenon because they \nhave seen it all too often. That is the first piece of my legislation \nfrom 2013, make it illegal to knowingly pass the trash.\n  The second piece is to require a thorough background check--a \nthorough criminal background check whenever someone is being hired who \nwill have unsupervised contact with children in the school. That means \nteachers, but it also means coaches, it means the schoolbus driver, it \nmeans contractors, if the contractor will have that kind of access to \nthe children.\n  Last December we had an important victory on this because the first \nprotection, the prohibition against knowingly passing the trash, passed \nthe Senate. It was a battle. There were people here who fought this \nvery aggressively, but eventually I was able to get a vote on the \nSenate floor and it passed overwhelmingly. It was then included in\n\n[[Page S3141]]\n\nthe text of the Every Student Succeeds Act. That legislation has since \nbeen signed into law. So it is now the law of the land that it is \nforbidden to knowingly recommend these pedophiles for hire.\n  As I said, that was only the first part of our legislation. The \nsuccess we had back in December was only a first step. We were not able \nto succeed with the tougher, more comprehensive background checks we \nneed. So I said at the time: I am not finished. We are going to \ncontinue this fight--and we are.\n  That is why I am here today--because the legislation we are about to \ntake up, the National Defense Authorization Act, takes us another \nimportant step forward, which helps in this effort to have more \ncomprehensive background checks.\n  I have a personal interest in this. I have three young children--a \n15-year-old, a 14-year-old, and a 6-year-old--and I represent 12.8 \nmillion Pennsylvanians. The vast majority of the people I represent \nhave the same view I do, which is: When we put our kids on a bus in the \nmorning to go to school, we have every right to believe we are sending \nour child to the safest possible environment. So that is what this is \nabout.\n  What this legislation does in the Defense authorization bill is it \nincorporates a bill I introduced earlier this year. That bill is called \nthe protecting our servicemembers' children act. The national defense \nauthorization bill takes my bill, this protecting our servicemembers' \nchildren act, and incorporates it. It builds it in. It covers DOD, \nDefense Department-operated schools in the United States, of which \nthere are many, but it also covers schools in school districts that \nreceive Federal impact aid because children of our military folks \nattend those schools. So that is one of the ways we cover some of the \ncost of educating the children of our men and women in uniform. We do \nit by providing this impact aid to the school districts to which they \nsend their kids.\n  What my legislation does and what the NDAA therefore does is it \nrequires these schools to conduct the same kind of background check \nthat the DOD requires of its own schools, which is exactly the right \nthing to do. It also provides that if a person has been convicted of \ncertain serious crimes--which includes violent or sexual crimes against \na child--then that criminal may not be employed in a position that \ngives him unsupervised access to children. It is as simple as that.\n  This will cover schools that serve about 17 percent of our \nschoolchildren, roughly 8.5 million kids. I think this is just common \nsense. A background check for school workers is simply common sense. \nAll States, all school districts do this to some degree. The problem \nis, not everyone does it to an adequate degree. It should not be \npossible for a person who has been convicted of child rape to walk out \nof prison, walk down the street, and get a job in an elementary school. \nThat should be absolutely impossible.\n\n  I am not suggesting that a convict shouldn't be able to get any job, \nbut I absolutely am suggesting that he should not be able to get a job \nin which he has unsupervised contact with children. To me, that is a \nno-brainer.\n  This feature--my bill, this legislation--does not impose any new \nburdens on the Department of Defense. The DOD regulation already \nrequires this thorough background check on all DOD-operated schools. \nBut what we do is reaffirm that so that no future administration could \nwater that down by Executive order or some other way.\n  Also, I suggest that there is an important reason why it is \nabsolutely essential that we provide this protection to the members of \nour military; that is, the men and women who put on the uniform of this \ncountry don't always have a say in where they are going to be \nstationed. They don't necessarily get to decide which base and which \nState they are going to work and, therefore, which school their \nchildren will attend. So when they get moved to another State, over \nwhich they have no say, they certainly have no say in the background \ncheck policy of that school or that school district or that State. The \nleast we can do for these men and women who take enormous personal \nrisks and make huge sacrifices to protect us is to protect their kids \nwhen their kids are going to school.\n  I should salute the efforts of State Senator Tony Williams from \nPennsylvania because the children in Pennsylvania are protected by a \nvery rigorous background check system, thanks largely to Senator \nWilliams' insistence that we do this and his advocacy for legislation \nthat gets that done.\n  When Pennsylvania servicemembers are stationed in another State, they \nstill deserve the same level of protection that they get in \nPennsylvania. But Tony Williams' bill that is now the law of the land \nin Pennsylvania does not apply beyond the borders of Pennsylvania, and \nthat is why we need this legislation--to make sure that all the men and \nwomen who wear the uniform of this country can know that their children \nwill have this protection. The least we can do for the people who are \nensuring the safety and security of all of us in our country is to make \nsure their children are safe from convicted pedophiles and other \ndangerous felons who attempt to infiltrate the schools.\n  Let me also thank someone else. I want to thank the chairman. Senator \nMcCain has been an ally of mine in this ongoing battle to keep our kids \nsafer for years now. His leadership has been outstanding. It is because \nof his commitment to the safety and security of our kids that my \nlegislation is in the National Defense Authorization Act, the \nlegislation that we are considering today.\n  Senator McCain was a cosponsor of my first bill to protect kids in \nthe classroom. His support was essential in the victory we had last \nyear when we were able to prohibit passing the trash. It is absolutely \nthe case that without his steadfast support, we would not have this \nprovision in this legislation today. So I am very grateful to Senator \nMcCain for his leadership on this, and I am proud to be standing with \nhim on this important issue.\n  Let me close with this. It is past time to act; it is past time to do \nsomething about this. In the 2\\1/2\\ years since I have been trying to \nmake sure that we stop permitting schools to pass the trash, in the \n2\\1/2\\ years since I have been trying to get the most rigorous \nstandards for doing background checks--during that time alone--there \nhave been over 1,100 school employees arrested. Those are the ones we \nknow about.\n  How much bigger does this number have to get? How much longer do we \nhave to wait? More importantly, how many kids have to be brutalized? \nHow many kids have to have their childhood shattered before we are \ngoing to impose the toughest possible regimen to protect these kids? I \nhave seen way more than enough. The families who have been torn apart \nby this devastating crime have seen way too much.\n  I urge my colleagues today to get this done. Let's take a big step \nforward in providing a significant additional level of security and \nprotection for the children of the men and women who sacrifice so much \nto protect all of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to use a visual aid during my speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Genetically Modified Food Labeling\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, the most important three words in our \nConstitution are the first three words: ``We the People.'' When our \nFounders were crafting our Constitution, they put those words in \noversized print so that hundreds of years later Members of Congress--\nthe House and Senate--and citizens across this Nation would remember \nthat this is what our Constitution is all about--``We the People.'' It \nis not ``we the powerful'' or ``we the privileged.'' It is ``We the \nPeople.''\n  President Jefferson said that we can only claim to be a republic to \nthe degree that the decisions of our government reflect the will of the \npeople. He went on to say that the only way our government will make \ndecisions which reflect the will of the people is if the\n\n[[Page S3142]]\n\npeople have an equal voice. An example of that was the town square, \nwhere each individual could stand up and make their position known \nbefore a vote was held on whom they were going to elect, and so on and \nso forth.\n  The challenge today is that the town square is the television, radio, \nand Web. Unfortunately, those are not free, the way the town square was \nin Jefferson's day, and that means that the role of money can change \neverything.\n  Unfortunately, we have had a couple of Supreme Court decisions that \ndo not do due accord to the very heart of our Constitution because they \nhave essentially said that even though the commons, or town square, is \nfor sale, we are going to allow the few people and corporations with \nbillions of dollars to buy up the town square and use the equivalent of \na megaphone sound system to drown out the voice of the people. That is \nthe opposite of what ``We the People'' is all about, and that is the \nopposite of what our Constitution is all about.\n  Periodically, I have come to the floor to talk about a variety of \nissues that are relevant to the Jefferson vision--that we can only be a \nrepublic to the degree that our decisions reflect the will of the \npeople. The issue I will talk about today--and this is an issue that \nDemocrats, Republicans, and Independents overwhelmingly support--is \nabout whether or not their food has been genetically modified, and if \nso, should those ingredients be listed on the package.\n  I am raising this issue today because on July 1 of this year, Vermont \nwill have a new law which will require labeling on the packages of food \nthat have genetically modified ingredients, and that has led to a \nconversation here in this Chamber about whether we at the Federal level \nshould allow that to happen. Should we allow Vermont to make this \nrequirement? There are a lot of food producers who say: We really don't \nwant the people to know about the details of their food. Well, I think \nAmericans across this country disagree.\n  As I mentioned, the overwhelming majority support the right to know. \nThe argument has been made that we can't allow State after State or \ncounty after county to have conflicting standards about what we list on \nfood labels because that would be impossible for interstate commerce, \nand that is a fair point. How can a food manufacturer be expected to \naccommodate a multitude of different labeling requirements from county \nto county, city to city, or State to State? That is a fair case if \nthere is a risk of multiple standards. There is no risk of that at this \nmoment because only one State has passed a standard which will be going \ninto effect in a couple of months. Just as we have seen with other \npolicies across this Nation, to something that one State tries, another \nState might say: Yes, let's do that but in a slightly different way. So \nthere is a legitimate concern about conflicting standards. Again, it is \nnot an immediate concern or something to cause this Chamber to act \ntoday. But if indeed other jurisdictions say they would like to have \nthe same type of information available to their citizens, who also \noverwhelmingly want that information, then there is a potential for \nthat and a legitimate cause for us to discuss it here.\n  Here is the thing. If you are going to take away the ability of \ncities, counties, and States to respond to the citizens' desire to know \nabout whether there are GMOs, or genetically modified ingredients, in \ntheir food, then you have to replace it with a national standard that \nanswers that question. If you fail to do so, you are simply denying the \nrights of citizens across the country to know what is in their food, \nand that is just wrong.\n  There is a name for the bill for denying Americans the right to know, \nand it is called the DARK Act, or Deny Americans the Right to Know \nAct. It is appropriate that it be called the DARK Act because it is all \nabout keeping consumers in the dark about something they would like to \nknow. There are many people here who say: Well, we know better than \nconsumers. They want to know, but we don't want them to know because \nthere is no reason they should know because why would they have any \nconcern if they knew all the facts? Is that our decision to make?\n\n  We decided to label food and let people know whether there is salt in \nit. Some people want it, some people don't. We decided to put calories \non the package. Some people want more calories, and some want less, but \nthey have the right to know. Some people want preservatives to make it \ntaste better and some don't, and so on and so forth. It is simply the \nconsumer's right to know and make choices accordingly.\n  This conversation is not about whether GMO food is safe to eat. \nPerson after person has come to this floor and said it is safe to eat, \nthere is no proven impact on citizens, and so therefore it is \nlegitimate to strip citizens from the right to know. There are lots of \ningredients we put on packages that have no carcinogenic effects, but \ncitizens want the full list, and that is what we provided them. Some \nwant to know the individual pieces of that story.\n  Let's turn back to this question about the fact that GMOs \nthemselves--genetically modified plants--are not substantially in one \ncamp or another, wonderful or terrible. There are all kinds of genetic \nmodifications that have taken place. For example, this chart shows \ngolden rice. Golden rice has been modified to have vitamin A. In parts \nof the world where there is vitamin A deficiency, this has been very \nbeneficial. Let's turn to carrots. Some carrots have been modified to \ntreat for a genetic disorder called Gaucher's disease, a metabolic \ndisorder where people lack a specific enzyme which helps rid the body \nof fatty substances that then accumulates causing enlarged livers and \nspleens and bone damage, bruising, and anemia. So people are very happy \nwe have a way to address that.\n  Researchers have been developing sweet potatoes that withstand \nmultiple viral infections commonly encountered in Southern Africa. That \nenables sweet potatoes to be grown and be part of the subsistence and \nis a substantial source of food in that region. There are also genetic \nmodifications that cause concerns. Most genetically modified crops \ngrown in the United States have been altered to confer resistance to a \nchemical herbicide known as glyphosate. Glyphosate is a weed killer, \nand essentially as the application of glyphosate has gone up \ndramatically from 1994 to the current time--we can see the huge \nincrease in the application of this weed killer on this chart--we have \nhad a corresponding general depletion of the monarch butterfly in those \nregions where glyphosate is used. That is a concern. Monarchs have been \ncrashing, and that is a concern to folks.\n  Look at and think about the runoff. If you put billions of gallons of \nweed killer on crops, and there are billions of gallons running into \nthe waterways, it has an impact on the waterways. It changes the makeup \nof the waterways because of the weed killer killing various organisms \nwithin the streams. Herbicides in our waterways can have a negative \nimpact on fish, mussels, amphibians, and microorganisms.\n  There is also a challenge in which plants evolve in response to the \napplications of glyphosate. We can end up with what are called \nsuperweeds, which are weeds that have been in the presence of the \nherbicide so often that the natural mutations occurring cause the weeds \nto evolve and they become superweeds. We had the same problem with \nthese corn-destroying rootworms. They have been evolving to be \nresistant to the pesticide that is placed into the plant cell by \ngenetic modification.\n  In short, there are competing considerations to balance, some \nbenefits and some concerns. Some people have reached the conclusion \nthat they are very comfortable consuming genetically modified foods, \nand other individuals can reach a different equally justifiable \nconclusion that they have concerns and want to know more about the \nspecific types of modification. The way they find out is, they get an \nalert on the package to show there are GMO ingredients and they can go \nto the Web site and look at the herbicide involved. That is why \nlabeling matters. It is an alert to the citizens so they can gain more \ninformation and decide if they are comfortable or uncomfortable.\n  What we have seen are companies that are starting to say, because we \nvalue the relationship with our customers, because our company believes \nin having high integrity in that relationship, we do not want to be \npart of the DARK movement--the ``deny Americans the right to know'' \nmovement. We want to be part of the movement that says if our consumers \nwant\n\n[[Page S3143]]\n\nto know, we are going to give them that information.\n  There are a variety of companies that have announced they are going \nto provide that information on their foods. One of them is the Mars \ncompany. Here I have a package of M&Ms;, and right on the package they \nare now disclosing. They have a phrase. I know it would be impossible \nto read this so we have enlarged this a bit and reproduced it. It says \n``partially produced with genetic engineering.'' So they give a heads-\nup on every package of M&Ms; across the country. They give a heads-up to \nconsumers, and if they want to know more about the details, they can \ncontact Mars to find out about the details. That is integrity. That is \nhonoring citizens who have a desire to know what is in their food.\n  We have all grown up seeing the wonderful pictures of Campbell's \nsoups in advertisements and the warm hearty meal of tomato soup. I know \nwhen I was sick as a child I always looked forward to that Campbell's \ntomato soup. Campbell's has said: We want to honor the integrity of the \nrelationship with our consumer. We are not going to be part of the \n``deny Americans the right to know'' movement. We are not going to be \non the side of the DARK, and we are going to be on the side of \ninformation that citizens desire to have. They are putting labels on \ntheir products, and a number of companies are following suit in honor \nof protecting the consumer's right to know.\n  That is certainly commendable, and I commend the companies that do \nnot feel like they are trying to mislead or hide from their consumers, \nbut in fact support the integrity of the relationship with the folks \nwho buy their products. Some of the companies that have done this are \nConAgra, General Mills, Kellogg's, and, as I mentioned, Mars. They have \nalready begun to label their products in anticipation of Vermont's July \n1 requirement.\n  Vermont has a 6-month grace period--so, again, it is not just around \nthe corner--but the beginning period companies are asked to meet is \nJuly 1. Because companies are now putting it on their labels, they are \ndiscovering there is nothing scary to consumers about it. Just like \nanything else on the ingredients list on labels of packages, it is \ninformation that different consumers can evaluate when it matters \nto their life.\n\n  There is a group of Senators who have said they do want to be part of \nthe DARK Act, deny Americans the right to know. So we will have a \nvoluntary labeling plan nationally. We will take away State's rights to \nput information on the package and replace it with a voluntary request \nfor companies to disclose. That is no justification for taking away the \nability of States to require what consumers want, which is not a \nvoluntary disclosure, it is a required disclosure. If a State wants to \ndo that, they should be honored. If we take away that right, we need to \ndo a replacement at the national level.\n  As a part of this movement, this Deny Americans the Right to Know \nAct, they say: You know what. We are willing to suggest that companies \nput a barcode on their product and consumers can scan that code or they \ncan put a quick response computer code, which is a square code with all \nthe little squares on it--something like what you have on an airline \nticket. They suggest that we put this quick response code on it, and if \nsomebody wants to know what is in our product, they can scan it with \ntheir smartphone and look it up on a Web site. That is not a consumer-\nfriendly label. That is a scam.\n  Not all consumers have a smartphone. Not all consumers have a digital \nplan that allows them to scan something in that fashion. They don't all \nhave a phone with a camera. We are asking them to have to spend money \nout of their phone plan in order to look up information that should \nhave just been on the package in the first place. That is a tax. That \nis a DARK Act tax on American consumers.\n  Some of my colleagues who talk about not putting taxes on individuals \njust voted for that DARK tax a few weeks ago. I hope they reconsider \nthat type of imposition on the moms and dads and brothers and sisters \nthroughout America. No one going down the aisle to shop is going to sit \nthere and compare four different soups by taking pictures of four \ndifferent soups and going to four different Web sites to look up that \ninformation. Plus, consumers are also disclosing information about \nthemselves when they go to those Web sites. That is an invasion of \nprivacy on top of the DARK tax that my colleagues want to impose on \nAmerican consumers. It is wrong on multiple levels.\n  Some of my colleagues say: Let's put an 800 number on the label, with \nno explanation of why it is there. Well, you can take most products in \nAmerica and you can probably find an 800 number somewhere on that \npackage with some corporate information line, but when you put an 800 \nnumber on with no explanation of why it is there, that is not consumer \ninformation. That is like taking an ingredients list on the package and \nreplacing it with an 800 number. Call this and we will read you a list \nof ingredients on the phone. It is absurd, it is ridiculous, and it is \noffensive to try to say that type of scam is a replacement for \nconsumer-friendly information right on the package.\n  Do you want to know how to determine whether you are being true to \nthe desire of consumers to have a consumer-friendly label? Well, I will \ntell you. It is called the 1-second test. We have a product on the \nshelf. We pick it up, turn it over, and look--1 second. I see the \nanswer that there are or are not genetically modified ingredients in \nthis package. That is the 1-second test. That is a fair replacement for \nState standards.\n  It can be done in a variety of ways. There can be a symbol on the \npackage. I suggest that the FDA or USDA can choose a symbol. Brazil \nchooses to have a key for transgenic in a triangle. We can do that. We \ncan put a ``B'' on it for biotechnology. We can put a ``G'' or ``GM'' \nfor genetically modified. There are all sorts of options that would be \na simple way for consumers to see what is there. We can put a phrase \nsuch as Mars has done on their candy or we can put an asterisk on the \ningredients that have been modified with a phrase below to explain the \nasterisk. All of those are possible, but an unlabeled phone number, an \nunlabeled barcode or quick response code--because it is a deliberate \neffort to pretend you are solving something when you are not, that is a \nshameful scam, and it should never pass scrutiny on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  I said earlier that citizens across this country want a consumer-\nfriendly label. We can look to a survey that was done. This is a 2016 \nlikely election voters survey that was done in November of 2015, and it \nshows that 89 percent of Americans said they would like to have the \ninformation on the label. They say they favor labels on foods that have \nbeen genetically engineered or contain genetically engineered \ningredients. So it is basically 9 out of 10 who not only favored but \nstrongly favored such labeling. To put it simply, 9 out of 10 Americans \nwant the information on the label, and rounding off, 8 out of 10 feel \nvery strongly about this.\n  Here is something that is interesting. We are often divided by party \nhere. The Republicans are sitting on the right side, the Democrats are \non the left side. There is partisan division--maybe Independents have a \nview in the middle. On this issue, Democrats believe, 9 out of 10, \nrounding off, that we should have these labels. Republicans believe, 9 \nout of 10, that we should have these labels. Wouldn't it be ironic if \nthe one thing Americans can agree on--whether they are east coast or \nwest coast or North or South or Democrat or Republican or Independent--\nthe one issue they can all agree on, this body decides to do the \nopposite and take away that ability. That certainly counters the \nfundamental principle that Jefferson put forward of the ``we the \npeople'' democracy. We can only claim to be a republic to the degree \nthat what we do reflects the will of the people.\n  So we should think about that a lot because there is a lot of \nconversation about folks who want to spring a surprise on the American \npeople. They want to come down here to the floor on some bill in the \nnear future, with some amendment or some motion or some \nreconsideration, and spring a surprise and drive the DARK Act through \nwith little public notice. Why is that? Because they are afraid of the \nopinions of the American people. They want to hide their decision in a \nshort period of time with no ability for the American people to be \nfilled in on the fact that\n\n[[Page S3144]]\n\nthey are attempting to pass legislation that overturns what 90 percent \nor 9 out of 10 Americans want. So we need to be aware of this.\n  I encourage my colleagues: Do not be part of this ``deny Americans \nthe right to know'' movement--this movement that is opposed by 9 out of \n10 Americans in the Democratic camp, in the Republican camp, in the \nIndependent camp, in every geography of America. Don't be part of going \nso profoundly, so fundamentally, so overwhelmingly against the will of \nthe American people.\n  We put a lot of things on packages because the American people ask \nfor that information. If you buy in a grocery store of any size, they \nare required to put whether fish is farm raised or wild. Why do we \nrequire that? It is not because being farm raised is going to kill \npeople; it is because citizens have a desire to know and to vote with \ntheir food dollar--vote with their food dollar for something they \nbelieve to be important. It may have to do with the taste of the \nproduct. It may have to do with the difference in antibiotics that are \nused in farmed versus wild. It may have to do with their desire to \nenvision that food when it was swimming the broad, beautiful Pacific \nOcean, the incredible salmon of the Pacific Ocean and the salmon of the \nAtlantic Ocean. But the point is, it is their right to know. Nothing \nmuch is as important to us as what we put into our bodies.\n  People fundamentally feel they should be able to have full \ninformation. We, indeed, provide information on whether juice is \nreconstituted from concentrate or is fresh, not because it will cause \nyou to get sick, not because it is unhealthy to consume, but because \nconsumers desire to know and they want to exercise their food dollars \nappropriately. Some people say: I really would like to have the stuff \nthe way it was squeezed out of the fruit rather than frozen and \ncondensed and reconstituted. So we provide that information because of \nthat citizen desire. Should we not honor our citizens in this issue as \nwell? Isn't it wrong for a group of Senators to plot to come to this \nfloor and to put forward an amendment or put forward a reconsideration \nor put forward a bill on short notice so that the American people have \nlittle chance to weigh in? Personally, I think it is very wrong. That \nis why I am speaking today.\n  It is not as if this question of putting labels on food is something \nnew or different; it is being done all around the world. Sixty-four \ncountries, including 28 members of the European Union and Japan and \nAustralia, already require mandatory GMO labeling. We can add Brazil to \nthat list. We can add China to that list.\n  China has no democratic forum in which to respond to the will of the \npeople. The decisions are top down. Yet the leadership of China has \nsaid: Our consumers care enough about this that we are going to \ndisclose that information. Isn't it profoundly ironic that here in the \nUnited States of America, where citizens have a voice, a group of \nSenators are trying to suppress that voice, are trying to implement and \ndeny Americans the right to know, when the leaders of China have \ndecided this is information consumers deserve?\n  Let me return to where I started--the vision of a ``we the people'' \ndemocracy. We have gone far afield from that. The role of money in \npolitics has put us in a very different position because that money \nweighs in, and it corrupts the fundamental nature of our legislative \nprocess. That is why we are having this debate over denying Americans \nthe right to know when 9 out of 10 want that information--because of \nthe corrupting power of massive concentrations of campaign cash in our \nsystem.\n  So let's do something we should do all the time: Set aside the \ncampaign. Set aside the desire to raise money. Set aside those issues \nand ask yourself, aren't we here to help pursue the will of the people? \nIn this case, in our ``we the people'' democracy, shouldn't we give our \ncitizens the same right to know--a right they overwhelmingly expect and \ndemand--as 64 other countries in the world?\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Tulsa Race Riot Anniversary\n\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I would like to ask this body for just a \nmoment to remember something that there are probably many people who \nhave never heard of for the first time because, for whatever reason, a \nbit of America's past seemed to just disappear from memory as soon as \nit occurred. Let me take us back almost 100 years for a moment.\n  The summer of 1919 was commonly referred to after the fact as the \n``Red Summer.'' The Red Summer included race riots all over America, \nWhite-on-Black riots specifically. There were White individuals moving \ninto Black neighborhoods and devastating those communities. That \nhappened in Charleston, SC; Long View, TX; Bisbee, AZ; Norfolk, VA; \nChicago; Washington, DC; Elaine, AR; Knoxville, TN; Omaha, NE; and many \nother places. Scattered around the country, one after another, month \nafter month, those race riots moved.\n  As World War I veterans--at that time, we called it the Great War--as \nthose veterans returned home, many looking for jobs--and the anxiety \nthat rose up from that--as many Black Americans who had bravely fought \nin World War I pursued jobs and were unable to get them or were hated \nby Whites because some of these Black individuals came home and took \nsome of the jobs that they were ``entitled to,'' the tensions began to \nrise across the country. It burst out into riots.\n  Oklahoma was mostly spared from that in 1919 and in 1920, but on May \n30 of 1921, a young man named Dick Rowland who worked downtown, an \nAfrican-American gentleman, was 19 years old. He was actually shining \nshoes in downtown Tulsa, which, if you have ever been to Tulsa and if \nyou have missed it--if you have never been there, you need to go. It is \nan absolutely beautiful town. If you can ever see the pictures of what \nTulsa looked like in the 1920s, you would be astounded. It was an oil \nboom town. Oil was discovered all around Tulsa, and people came from \nall over the country. Most of those individuals around Tulsa who put in \noil wells suddenly became rich, and Tulsa became a wealthy community \nextremely rapidly. The architecture and history of it is beautiful. \nBut, like every other town in Oklahoma in the 1920s, it was also \nsegregated by law.\n  The Northern District of Tulsa at that time was called the Greenwood \nDistrict, just north of downtown. It was an incredibly prosperous \ncommunity. In fact, African Americans from around the country moved to \nTulsa because there were doctors and lawyers and businesses, grocery \nstores, department stores. It became a very wealthy community because \nsome individuals lived in Greenwood and worked in Tulsa, which was a \nfast-growing, wealthy city.\n  Also, there was great freedom within the Greenwood District. Oddly \nenough, the segregation that was required in Oklahoma at the time also \ncaused Greenwood to grow because many African Americans could not buy \ngroceries or could not go to certain restaurants or go into certain \nbusinesses or department stores in Tulsa. So when those businesses \nopened up in Greenwood and the population continued to grow, it became \na fast-growing city as well. In fact, it was nicknamed the Black Wall \nStreet of America. That community was extremely well educated, had many \nWorld War I veterans who had come home, many businesses and \nentrepreneurs. It became known as a place where Blacks could come from \naround the country and start businesses, grow businesses, and grow into \nprosperity. I would love to be able to show you all the homes and the \nplaces--what that looked like in the 1920s. It was a beautiful \ndistrict.\n  I will get back to my story about Dick Rowland. Working downtown in \nTulsa--most buildings in downtown Tulsa would not allow a Black man to \ngo to the bathroom there, but the Drexel Building would, so he would go \nto the Drexel Building to go to the restroom. He would go on the \nelevator because the restroom he was allowed to use was on an upper \nfloor. That particular day, on May 30, 1921, he got into\n\n[[Page S3145]]\n\nthe elevator, and the elevator operator was a 17-year-old young lady, a \nWhite lady named Sarah Page. The elevator doors closed. As they got to \nthe upper floor, they got off. At that point, Sarah Page screamed. To \nthis day, we don't know why. We don't know if there was an altercation. \nWe don't know if Dick Rowland bumped her and she screamed. We don't \nknow if she was just scared, and we don't know why. But a friend heard \nher scream, came running, saw Dick Rowland stepping out of the \nelevator, and accusations started immediately. Within 24 hours, the \npolice arrested Dick Rowland and took him to the courthouse and the \njail in downtown Tulsa.\n\n  By the time the afternoon paper had been released on May 31, 1921, \nthe word was out that a young African-American male had raped a White \nfemale in the elevator at the Drexel Building, and a mob began to form \noutside of the courthouse. That mob gathered around. They say it \nstarted out with around 100 and then quickly grew to 200.\n  The sheriff in Tulsa, understanding the threat there of this mob \ngathering around the building calling for Dick Rowland to be delivered \nto the mob, immediately turned off the elevator in the courthouse \nbuilding and put up armed guards in every staircase around that \nbuilding to not allow any of the people from the mob to get into the \nbuilding, to try to get upstairs, and to be able to get Dick Rowland \nout. But the mob continued to grow outside that building. I understand \nthat by the end of that day, it was now approaching over 1,000.\n  Not far away from there at all, the men who lived in the Greenwood \nDistrict heard that the mob was gathering. As I mentioned before, many \nof them were World War I veterans. They loaded up with their weapons \nand went to the courthouse to offer their assistance to the sheriff to \nbe an additional armed guard there.\n  The sheriff denied it, said they had the situation well in hand, and \nturned the men away. As the mob continued to grow and continued to \npress the sheriff, the men returned and said: You need our help here. \nWe do not want a lynch mob in our city. We have all heard what had \nhappened in other cities just a year ago. We don't want that happening \nhere.\n  The sheriff again turned them away and said: You are not needed here; \nwe have the situation at hand.\n  But as the men left that second time, some White men in the crowd \nconfronted some of the African-American men as they left. There was a \nstruggle as one of the White men tried to take away the guns from the \nAfrican-American men and a shot was fired.\n  The rest of it was chaos. Many of the African-American men headed \nback to the Greenwood District as quickly as they could as that mob \nturned into a riot. They pursued them back to the Greenwood District of \nTulsa. It was not far away, literally just on the other side of the \ntracks from downtown Tulsa. They pursued them back into the Greenwood \nDistrict and started a massive riot the evening of May 31.\n  The police, trying to quell this massive riot that broke out, \nimmediately deputized many White men who were gathered around downtown \nTulsa, gave them weapons, and told them to go arrest as many Black \npeople as they could to stop the riot.\n  They ran into the Greenwood District and shootings began all over the \nGreenwood area. Many African-American men--the numbers are up over the \nthousands--were arrested, dragged into Tulsa, and were put in temporary \ndetention facilities there and held, which left the Greenwood District \ncompletely unprotected.\n  Looters and rioters moved through that part of Tulsa all throughout \nthe night and into the next morning, literally looting every home, \nlooting every business, doctor's office, grocery store, and department \nstore--looting each one of them and burning them to the ground. By the \ntime the National Guard arrived the next day to try to stop the riot, \nalmost every building, home, and business--everything in a 1-mile \nsquare that was the Greenwood District before--was completely \ndestroyed.\n  It makes you wonder what happened then. It is estimated that over 300 \npeople died that night in Tulsa. No one was ever charged with a crime.\n  Dick Rowland, whom I mentioned before, was released from jail because \nno charges were ever pressed against him. Sarah Page never pressed \ncharges against him.\n  Insurance companies refused to pay the African-American businesses \nthat were burned to the ground. They walked away.\n  What happened next is even more surprising to me. I am not surprised \nthat many African-American individuals who lived in the Greenwood \nDistrict left. I don't blame them, but most everyone stayed. They \nliterally rebuilt their homes by living in tents for a year.\n  The American Red Cross moved in and helped build wood platforms where \nthere used to be homes so that tents could be built in that spot and \npeople could live there while they rebuilt their own home and rebuilt \ntheir own businesses. One by one they rebuilt.\n  Mount Zion Baptist Church had just been finished a few months before \nthat and had a $50,000 mortgage on it. No one walked away from that \nchurch. They rebuilt that church, and they repaid the $50,000 mortgage \nthat was owed from before. Block by block, individuals started \nrebuilding Greenwood.\n  By the 1940s, and given all the struggles that had happened, it never \nfully recovered to what it was before. What is also fascinating about \nit is that the State of Oklahoma quietly ignored what happened that \nday. Most folks growing up in Oklahoma have never even heard of the \nTulsa race riot. In many ways, the Tulsa race riot is kind of like that \nuncle you know in your family who ended up in jail and at Christmas no \none talks about. Everyone kind of knows they are out there, but you \nnever discuss them. That was the Tulsa race riot for Oklahomans for a \nvery long time, until just a couple of decades ago, when the \nconversation quietly started again about a very difficult part of our \nhistory.\n  So 95 years ago this week, the worst race riot in American history \nbroke out in Tulsa, OK. In 5 years the entire country will pause and \nlook at Oklahoma and will ask a very good question: What has changed in \n100 years? What have we learned in 100 years?\n  I would say a few things. I would say we can remember. There is great \nhonor to be able to say to people: We have not forgotten about what \nhappened. We have not ignored it. We have not swept it under the rug \nand pretended it never happened. We remember.\n  I think there is great honor in that. We can recognize there is more \nto be done and that we can't just say: You know what; that was then, \nand this is now. There is more to be done.\n  Our own racial challenges and what has happened in the country just \nover the past few years remind us again that we don't have legal \nsegregation any more, but we still have our own challenges as a nation. \nWe still need to have a place in the Nation where every person of every \nbackground has every opportunity. It is right for us. We can respect \nthe men and women who lived, worked, died, and rebuilt. We can pour \nrespect on those individuals who are still working to rebuild.\n  These are people such as Donna Jackson, who is leading a group that \nshe calls the North Tulsa 100 who say that by the time we get to the \n100th anniversary just 5 years from now, there will be 100 new \nbusinesses in the Greenwood area. The jewel of Black Wall Street was \nthe number of businesses, entrepreneurs, and family businesses that \nwere there. Donna Jackson and the group that is around her--business \nleaders, church leaders, individuals from the area, family members, and \nsome of them even connected to the survivors of the riot itself--are \nall committed to what they can do to reestablish the business community \nagain in Greenwood and North Tulsa and not looking just for Black \nbusinesses, but businesses--period. They wish to reengage a community \nthat is still scarred years later and to be able to have some respect \nfor those folks who run the cultural center at John Hope Franklin \nReconciliation Park and the individuals who are willing to talk about \nit in a way that is open, honest, and not accusatory. But my fourth \n``r,'' after remember, recognize and respect, is reconciliation. What \nare we going to do as a nation to make sure that we are reconciled?\n  This simple speech on this floor is not going to reconcile our \nNation. We have for years said this is something\n\n[[Page S3146]]\n\nwe need to talk about. Quite frankly, we do need to talk about it, but \nwe also need to do something about it. What can we do to make sure that \nour children do not grow up in a nation that forgets its past but also \nto make sure it is not repeated again and to make sure that all \nindividuals are recognized and respected and that every person has the \nsame opportunity. There is no simple answer, but I bring to this body a \nstory that I think is important for us to talk about--the worst race \nriot in American history, in my State, and in all of our States.\n  I bring to us a question. Five years from now, we as a nation will \ntalk about this even more when it is the 100-year anniversary. Who are \nwe as a nation? How far have we come, and what do we have left to do to \nmake sure that we really are one Nation under God, indivisible?\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank our colleague, the Senator from \nOklahoma, for telling that marvelous story and offering some hope--not \njust talking about it but doing something about it as well.\n  Of course, it reminds me a little bit of our recent trip to \nCharleston and the amazing thing that happened there after a terrible \ntragedy when a young man opened a gun in a church and a killed a number \nof innocent people who were there worshipping and who had taken him in.\n  Just as the story told by the Senator from Oklahoma, one of the \nthings we found when we visited Charleston later, as the Presiding \nOfficer will recall, was the power of forgiveness. This changed the \nentire conversation when people in great pain, suffering an unspeakable \ntragedy, had the faith and the fortitude to stand and say: You hurt me, \nbut I forgive you.\n  It was very, very remarkable. It reminded me of that experience. What \nSenator Lankford was telling us about Tulsa--the Tulsa race riot--\nreminded me of the similar lesson and example. There is perhaps nothing \nmore powerful than a good example, and we saw that rising out of great \nhurt and great hate.\n  I thank the Senator for telling the story and reminding me of that \nrecent experience in Charleston.\n  Mr. President, sometimes when I go home to Texas, my constituents \ntell me: I don't know how you stand it. I don't know how you stand the \nfrustration of working in Washington and dealing with some of the \npolitics, the unnecessary obstacles, the procedures, just the delay--\nthe do-nothing aspects of this job.\n  Unfortunately, I was reminded of that again because we are here \nostensibly working on a national defense authorization bill, burning \ndaylight and wasting time when we could actually be dealing with the \nneeds of our men and women in uniform--making sure they have the \nequipment, training, and the tools necessary to fight our Nation's wars \nand keep our Nation safe.\n  But we are just burning hours on the clock because the Democratic \nleader, in his--I was going to say in his wisdom. I don't think it is \nin his wisdom. I think it is just an effort to delay our ability to \nprogress with this important legislation on a bipartisan basis. This is \nlegislation, after all, that was supported by every Democrat on the \nSenate Armed Services Committee. They know what is in the bill. It has \nbeen posted for a long time. Anybody who really cared enough to find \nout could have found out what was in this bill. We could be having a \ndebate and a discussion about how we can improve it, about how we can \nreconcile the House and Senate versions and get it to President Obama \nfor his signature so our troops don't have to wonder, so they don't \nhave to wait, and so they don't have to worry about whether we care \nenough to get our work done to support them.\n  Despite all the foot dragging we have seen and the frustrations that \nare just inherent in this job--because things never happen as quickly \nas any of us would like, and I think certainly that adds to the public \nfrustration--we actually have been getting some things done around \nhere. It is just that we have had to grind them out and take a long \ntime do them.\n  But I know the majority leader, Senator McConnell of Kentucky, is \ndetermined to complete this legislation, and we will. In Senator \nMcCain, the chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, we couldn't \nhave a more forceful advocate for the men and women in uniform and the \nveterans. Of course, he was a great example of that true American \nhero--a former prisoner of war himself. You can tell how passionately \nhe feels about doing our duty by our troops.\n\n  I did want to mention a few things I will be offering by way of \namendments that I think will help make America safer and take some \nsmall steps toward correcting some of the foreign policy mistakes we \nhave seen from this administration over the last few years.\n  The first two amendments I intend to offer focus on countering the \nworld's foremost state sponsor of terrorism; that is, the nation of \nIran. The first amendment I have specifically targets an airline called \nMahan Air, which is that country's largest commercial airline--the \nlargest commercial airline and the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism. \nThis airline has repeatedly played a role in exporting Iran's \nterrorism. It supports the efforts of the Quds Force, an elite fighting \nunit of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards, and supports Hezbollah as \nwell. We might as well call Mahan Air ``Terrorist Airways.'' That might \nbe a more appropriate name. Because of its role in ferrying Iranian \npersonnel and weapons throughout the region in the Middle East, it \nplays a big hand in undercutting the interests of the United States and \nour ally Israel.\n  Of course, everywhere you turn, Iran is up to some sort of mischief--\nin Syria, obviously, with their efforts to shore up the corrupt and \nbrutal regime of Bashar al-Assad, its support of Hezbollah, Hamas, and \nother terrorist organizations. It seems like everywhere you turn, they \nare up to no good. And, of course, there is the nuclear agreement, \nwhich I think was enormously misguided, and they have thumbed their \nnoses at the very basic elements of that agreement, demonstrating they \nhave really no interest in complying with it. And the United States, in \nturn--well, actually the administration; because it is not a treaty, it \ndoesn't bind future Presidents--but we have essentially, in the words \nof Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel, not contained or prevented Iran \nfrom gaining nuclear weapons; we have essentially paved the pathway.\n  Today, Mahan Air is working to add more international airports to its \nflights, including several in Europe. Given the links to terrorist \nactivity, we have to consider the potential security risks to Americans \nand others who fly in and out of airports where Mahan aircraft may \nland.\n  This amendment would require the Department of Homeland Security to \ncompile and make public a list of airports where Mahan Air flies, and \nit would require the Department of Homeland Security to assess what \nadded security measures should be imposed on flights to the United \nStates that may be coming from an airport used by Mahan Air.\n  I recently had the chance--and I have spoken about this--to go to \nCairo with the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and \nthe chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, my friend \nMichael McCaul of Texas. One of the things we looked at was airport \nsecurity because there are flights that currently exist between Cairo \nand JFK Airport in New York. It is my understanding there are also \nflights planned from Cairo to Reagan National here in the District of \nColumbia.\n  Following the explosion on a Russian plane out of Sharm el-Sheikh in \nsouthern Sinai, it is pretty clear Egypt has a lot of work to do to \nimprove its homeland security measures in both its screening of baggage \nand also personnel who work at airports.\n  So you can see why people would necessarily be concerned about the \naction of Mahan Air and what risk that might expose innocent passengers \nto. I hope my colleagues will review the proposal and support it.\n  The second amendment I have related to Iran would require President \nObama to determine if Iran violated international law several months \nago when it detained a number of U.S. sailors. Under bedrock rules of \ninternational law, all ships, including U.S.\n\n[[Page S3147]]\n\nNavy ships, have the right to innocent passage through another nations' \nterritorial waters. In other words, when one of our Navy's riverine \nboats is innocently transiting across Iranian waters and is not engaged \nin military activity or taking any other action that would prejudice \nthe peace and security of Iran, it is against the law--against the \nlaw--for Iran to stop, board, and seize that vessel. Iran can't just \nremove our sailors from their boats and detain them in Iran because \nthey feel like it or steal the GPS units from those boats.\n  In addition, the Geneva Convention makes clear that Iran can't detain \nfor no reason and exploit another nation's military servicemembers, \nespecially not for propaganda purposes, which is clearly what they did. \nIran can't force our sailors to apologize when they have done nothing \nwrong. Iran's Revolutionary Guards and their state-controlled media had \na heyday with the videos and images of our sailors they captured and \npurposely humiliated.\n  It seems very likely, based on available evidence, that they violated \nour sailors' rights of innocent passage and very likely the Geneva \nConvention itself, and I think we need the Commander in Chief to call \nIran into account. This type of destabilizing and dangerous behavior by \nIran cannot occur without some consequences.\n  My amendment would require the President to determine if the rules of \ninternational law were broken and, if so, require the imposition of \nmandatory sanctions on Iranian personnel who were involved.\n  A third amendment I have introduced would grant tax-free income \nstatus to U.S. troops deployed to the Sinai Peninsula.\n  As I have mentioned before, after our trip to Cairo, we flew out to \nNorth Camp, a peacekeeping mission in the northern part of the Sinai. \nThis is an area between the Gaza Strip and Egypt where, as part of the \npeace agreement between Egypt and Israel, negotiated by Prime Minister \nBegin, President Sadat, and President Carter, this peacekeeping \noperation was established. It is called the Multinational Force & \nObservers, and it is largely made up of U.S. military, although it is \nled by a two-star Canadian general and a number of Colombian soldiers \nand others.\n  Our troops play a strategic role in maintaining peace between Egypt \nand Israel right there in the northern Sinai, and their work is \nincredibly dangerous. Unfortunately, some Bedouin insurgents have now \naffiliated themselves with ISIS. They have claimed allegiance to the \nIslamic State and are regularly putting out improvised explosive \ndevices, which kill Egyptian peacekeepers.\n  By granting our troops tax-free status for their pay, we can put them \non equal footing with other American troops who are deployed in other \ndangerous places, such as Afghanistan and Iraq and other similarly \ndangerous hot spots around the globe.\n  Finally, I mentioned earlier this week that I will be submitting an \namendment to support the human rights of the Vietnamese people. The \nPresident has been in Hanoi for the last couple of days, but, frankly, \nthe conduct of the Communist regime is marked by the regular silencing \nof dissidents and the press and anti-democratic, heavyhanded tactics to \nstay in power at any cost, not to mention the denial of religious \nfreedom. By one estimate, Vietnam is currently detaining about 100 \npolitical prisoners.\n  Clearly, this country does not come anywhere close to sharing the \nvalues we have here in the United States, democratic values, and rather \nthan steadily improving, I am afraid there is no sign the Vietnamese \nGovernment is working to advance more freedoms for its people.\n  Just this last week, during the visit of President Obama, it was \nreported that several activists who planned on meeting with the \nPresident were detained by the Communist Party and prevented from doing \nso. Similarly, a BBC correspondent said that the Vietnamese Government \nordered him to stop his reporting, simply silencing this reporter from \nthe BBC. Earlier this month, the wife of a Vietnam activist testified \nbefore a subcommittee on the House Foreign Affairs Committee about her \nhusband, a human rights lawyer, who was beaten by plainclothes officers \nand imprisoned. What was his crime? Well, according to the government, \nhe was charged with ``conducting propaganda against the state.'' His \nwife hasn't seen or heard from him in months.\n  While I support increased economic and security ties with Vietnam, I \ndon't believe we should sacrifice our commitment to human rights in the \nprocess. We should not be seen as tolerating this sort of anti-\ndemocratic behavior. At the very least, we shouldn't be rewarding it \nwith new access to arms deals by completely lifting the longtime arms \nembargo against Vietnam. And what did we get in exchange? Well, I think \nit approaches zero or nothing.\n  My amendment would help ensure that we don't reward Vietnam for bad \nbehavior, such as human rights abuses, when we confer upon them \nbenefits, such as lifting the arms embargo, and that they show some \nrespect for democratic values, religious liberties, and human rights.\n  We have to keep in mind that the Vietnamese people in that country \nhave no real voice because they are subjects of a Communist \ndictatorship. We must do more to put pressure on the regime in Hanoi to \nempower their own people.\n\n\n                 Cross-Border Trade and Enhancement Act\n\n  Separately, Mr. President--and I see my colleague from Wyoming wants \nto speak, so let me conclude with this--earlier today, the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee passed legislation I have \nintroduced called the Cross-Border Trade and Enhancement Act, a bill \nthat would help our ports of entry by strengthening public-private \npartnerships at air, land, and sea ports.\n  In Texas, because we share a 1,200-mile common border with Mexico, we \nhave seen upfront and close the security challenges--which we need to \ndo much more to address--but also the benefits of bilateral trade. As a \nmatter of fact, trade between the United States and Mexico supports \nabout 6 million American jobs.\n  We have seen time and time again how important these public-private \npartnerships are in helping to reduce wait times for the flow of \ncommerce across the border and moving people and goods across safely \nand efficiently. This isn't just about convenience; this is about \nsecurity and compliance with our laws, interdicting illegal drugs and \nother activities.\n  This legislation would also improve staffing, in addition to \nmodernizing the infrastructure to help better protect legitimate trade \nand travel and keep our economy running smoothly.\n  I thank the chairman, Senator Ron Johnson, for his commitment to this \nissue and commend him for his diligent effort in leading the committee. \nI am glad the committee understands that the priority here is to \nstrengthen our ports of entry at the border and across the country.\n  I am grateful not only for the committee's support but also the \nbipartisan support of other cosponsors, including Senator Klobuchar, \nthe senior Senator from Minnesota, and Senator Heller, the junior \nSenator from Nevada.\n  As always, I appreciate my colleague on the House side, Henry \nCuellar, for working with me on a bipartisan basis and introducing \ncompanion legislation in the House.\n  I hope now that the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee has acted, this Chamber will take up the bill soon so we can \nbuild on the success of similar programs in Texas and across the \ncountry.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk once \nagain about the health care law.\n  This past weekend I was home in Wyoming--as I am just about every \nweekend--visiting a community called Lovell, WY. At Lovell, we had a \nhealth and fitness fair that was focused on kids and adults in terms of \nprevention of problems and early detection of problems. They could get \ntheir blood tests done there. In talking to hundreds of people there at \nthe hospital, what I heard again and again, as I do each weekend, is \nthat this health care law is having a negative impact, a hurtful impact \non the people of my home State of Wyoming.\n\n[[Page S3148]]\n\n  I want to spend a little time today talking about what is happening \nthere. On Monday night, Senator Enzi and I had a chance to have a \ntelephone townhall meeting. We talked to a lot of people around the \nState, and this continues to come up: the high increases in costs, in \nspite of what the President promised. He promised that insurance rates \nwould go down by $2,500 per family if his health care law was passed \nand signed. In fact, the exact opposite has occurred. Today I had lunch \nwith a number of students from Lander, WY, in Freemont County, and \nagain this came up as a topic of discussion.\n  What we see is that the insurance companies at this time of year are \nturning in their rate requests--the requests they have to increase \ntheir rates for next year.\n  I am going to talk about places all over the country now because it \nis not just Wyoming that is suffering under the President's health care \nlaw, it is all around the country.\n  Families in Iowa now know that their insurance company wants to raise \npremiums by as much as 43 percent for some plans. Some families in New \nYork have learned that their rates may be going up as much as 46 \npercent. Let's turn to New Hampshire. There are families in New \nHampshire who have gotten the news that they could be paying 45 percent \nmore. So when we look State by State by State, what we are seeing \nacross the country is rates going up dramatically, impacting the \nability of people to even afford their insurance.\n  A health care group looked at nine States where information has been \nreleased. They found what they call a standard shopper for insurance. \nThe average cost of a silver plan--the most commonly sold plan--will go \nup 16 percent next year. That is for a typical, say, 50-year-old person \nwho doesn't smoke. It adds to an average cost of about $6,300 per year \nfor that person trying to buy insurance.\n  What we are seeing today is more and more people getting sticker \nshock under ObamaCare. The health care law has created so many problems \nfor the American public--for taxpayers--because taxes have gone up as a \nresult of this for providers of health care and certainly for patients. \nThe health care law has caused mandates. It has put restrictions in \nplace. It has been made so expensive that most people think it is not a \ngood deal for them personally, which is why, in terms of the number of \npeople who were uninsured when the law was passed, fewer than one in \nthree of them have actually signed up for ObamaCare. That is because \nall these mandates and all these restrictions have made insurance much \nmore expensive when it comes down to actually trying to get care.\n  Let me point out that the President is very specific when he talks. \nHe doesn't talk about people getting care; he talks about coverage.\n  The headlines in the New York Times have been that there are a lot of \npeople with coverage who can't get care. There was a story last week \nabout so many people in New York City who feel that ObamaCare is a \nsecond-class program. They have that insurance card, but it doesn't \nhelp them get to see a doctor--certainly not one they want or need for \nthe problems they are having.\n  Some insurance companies have lost so much money by selling insurance \non the ObamaCare exchange that they have decided to drop out of the \nexchanges entirely. They said: We are done with it. We can't afford to \ncontinue to sell it this way.\n  We know the insurance company Humana is dropping out of several \nStates. We know that UnitedHealthcare is leaving all but a handful of \nStates. In Colorado, 20,000 people have received letters saying that \nthey are losing their insurance plan next year because companies cannot \nafford to sell it. And it is only going to get worse.\n  According to a recent survey by McKinsey & Company, it turns out that \nonly one out of every four health insurance companies made a profit \nlast year. Those are the ones I am talking about specifically selling \ninsurance on the ObamaCare exchange. So one out of four made a profit; \nthree out of four lost money. And we say: How is it that they were able \nto make a profit?\n  Well, this is what they did: The ones that were able to make a profit \ntended to be companies that have a lot of experience offering Medicaid \ninsurance. Basically, they took their Medicaid plans and sold them to \npeople on the ObamaCare exchange. These are plans with very narrow \nnetworks of doctors, so you can't just go to any doctor you like, and \nthey have very narrow numbers of hospitals, so you can't go to any \nhospital you like. For these specific companies, a lot of these plans \nare ones that have very high deductibles. So somebody may have an \ninsurance card, but the deductible is so high--the dollar-for-dollar \nout-of-their-pocket expense--that they say they can't afford to see a \ndoctor, and they have ObamaCare, which they are finding is essentially \nuseless for them.\n  There were different levels of insurance plans that ObamaCare came \nout with--bronze, silver, gold, and platinum. Most of the people have \nbeen choosing the silver plans because that was thought to be sort of \nthe midrange plan. Well, now those silver plans are coming with very \nhigh costs. This means that people may be paying, again, for coverage, \nbut they are not getting care.\n  There is a company in Virginia. They have decided they are getting \nrid of the bronze plan entirely. They have said ``No, we are not going \nto sell the bronze plan anymore,'' and they are pushing all of their \ncustomers up into the silver plan. They are doing this, but if you are \none of the people who had the bronze plan that they are not going to \nsell anymore, you can see your rates going up 70 percent from what you \nwere paying this year--an increase of 70 percent. Some of these silver \nplans have gotten so inadequate that they are now what the bronze plans \nused to be. This is all as a result of what the Obama administration \nforced down the throats of the American public and every Democrat voted \nfor and every Republican voted against.\n  One insurance company is actually offering a silver plan next year \nthat comes with a deductible of more than $7,000. Now, that is how much \nsomeone would need to pay out of their pocket before insurance actually \nkicked in. Blue Cross of Idaho is talking about a deductible of $6,850 \nfor their silver plan. That is for the silver plan--the one that \nDemocrats said was supposed to be the benchmark plan, the one that the \nsubsidies are linked to.\n  Let's think about what a $6,850 deductible means for most people. \nAccording to a new poll out by the Associated Press, two-thirds of \nAmericans say they would have a hard time actually coming up with \n$1,000 for an emergency. So, then, how are they supposed to come up \nwith over $6,800 in case of a situation that they may find confronting \nthem?\n  These kind of plans, where people pay a lot and don't get much in \nreturn, are what President Obama and the administration used to call \n``junk insurance.'' I remember the President talking about that. ``Junk \ninsurance'' is what he said. He said that the health care law would \nstop that; that would never happen under an Obama administration and an \nObama plan. Instead, this President, under ObamaCare, is pushing more \nand more people into these kinds of plans, and this administration is \neven subsidizing them.\n  So premiums are going through the roof. The deductibles are going up \nso high that people have insurance--which is mandated by law that they \nhave--but it turns out that, for many of them, it is useless. People \nmay have to find a new primary care doctor or a new pediatrician every \nyear because they are getting switched from plan to plan to plan \nbecause they can't afford the plan that they have, and the rates \ncontinue to go up. And the President, who had once said ``If you like \nyour plan, you can keep it,'' now says ``Oh, no, you had better shop \naround.'' He said that if you like what you have, you can keep it. He \ncompletely flipped and now says that you had better shop around.\n  People continue to lose plans because insurance companies are going \nout of business or they just quit selling insurance entirely. To me, \nthis is just one more sign that this health care law is a sinking ship. \nIt is falling apart. And insurance companies have found that one reason \nthey are losing so much money is that their customers are sicker than \nthe President thought they would be and that the insurance companies \nthought they would be. The people who are healthy basically aren't \ninterested in buying this very expensive\n\n[[Page S3149]]\n\ninsurance. They feel it is a waste of their money and would rather just \npay the fine to the IRS.\n  On Monday, the head of the State ObamaCare co-op in New Mexico was on \nthe television network CNBC, talking about this problem. His name is \nDr. Martin Hickey, and he is the CEO of New Mexico Health Connections. \nHis company is asking to raise premiums for some of its plans by 34 \npercent next year. Still, he said, ``With these heavy rate \nincreases''--and these are heavy rate increases--``the problem is the \npeople who are going to say `for a $695 penalty, to heck with it.' '' \nSo of the people the President is mandating to buy insurance, many are \nsaying, ``to heck with it.'' That is what we hear from this CEO.\n  Look, this is just what Republicans have been predicting ever since \nDemocrats first brought this health care law to the floor and they \npassed this extraordinarily expensive law and mandates on the American \npublic.\n  Dr. Hickey, CEO of New Mexico Health Connections, said, ``The healthy \nare abandoning insurance, and what you're left with is the sick, and \nyou can never raise your rates high enough.'' That is not what \nDemocrats promised. That is not what they stood up here on the floor \nand talked about. They promised--and so did President Obama--that the \nhealth care rates would go down. They promised insurance coverage would \nget better. It has not. It has gotten much worse. They promised that if \nyou like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. In many cases, you \ncan't. They promised that if you like your insurance, you can keep your \ninsurance. In many cases, you cannot.\n  People all across this country are getting a reminder of ObamaCare's \nbroken promises as the health care requests for increases come out. \nDemocrats want to double down on this failed health care law and add \nmore mandates and more restrictions. They want more government control \nover people's health care.\n  It does seem that everything the Democrats propose just makes prices \ngo up faster. That isn't what the American people wanted, and it is \ncertainly not what we need from health care reform in this country. \nThis law was passed 6 years ago, and it is getting worse every day.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Our National Debt\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want the Presiding Officer and my \ncolleagues and the people of America to know what is keeping me awake \nnights. It is actually thoughts of my grandkids and their future that \nkeep me awake nights. I see a bleak future for them because of our \noverspending, and I hear their small voices saying: You were there. Why \ndidn't you fix it? Why didn't you give us the chance you had? We didn't \nwant anything for free. We just wanted an opportunity to earn our own \nway to what was the American dream.\n  How are we going to answer that question? I am not just asking the \nMembers of Congress, I am asking everyone in America because everyone \nhas and is getting benefits from this great country at the expense of \nthe future.\n  Let's look at the problem together. Here is where we are right now \nand where we are headed: Our national debt isn't sustainable because of \nthe interest alone. Interest on the debt could mean we would have to \nmake cuts to programs we never dreamed of cutting. We already owe \n$1,900 billion. Sometimes that is called $19 trillion. I prefer to call \nit $19,000 billion; it sounds like more. That is soon headed to $20,000 \nbillion, or $20 trillion. We have already exceeded that. At 1 percent \ninterest--and that is interest alone--interest would amount to $200 \nbillion a year.\n  We need to worry about when the interest rate gets to the norm of 5 \npercent, and that could happen as early as in the next 3 years. Imagine \nif the interest rate went to 5 percent; 5 percent is the historic \naverage for Federal borrowing. Excluding mandatory spending, we \ncurrently only get to make decisions on $1,070 billion a year. Do the \nmath. Five times $200 billion is $1,000 billion. Remember, we only get \nto make decisions on $1,070 billion a year. So interest alone could \ncrowd out almost the entire annual budget. What would that extra $70 \nbillion fund? When that happens, could we forget about funding defense \nor education or agriculture or any of the other programs we are \nexpected to fund?\n  What we are doing is not sustainable. What would we be forced to cut \njust to pay the interest? How many people do you think would be willing \nto invest in America just in order to get their own interest paid? The \nanswer is no one. Incidentally, we may already be borrowing to pay \ninterest, but so far no one knows it--yet.\n  From a Bloomberg business article, ``There's an acknowledgement, even \nin the investor community, that monetary policy is kind of running out \nof ammo.'' That was said by Thomas Costerg, the economist at Standard \nChartered Bank in New York City. A lack of monetary ammo will drive up \ninterest rates dramatically, forcing us to pay even more interest on \nour debt. Because we are the largest economy in the world, there isn't \nanyone who could bail us out.\n  There are lots of causes to this problem. Let me cover some of them. \nWe don't ever look back at what we have done. We keep looking forward \nto new things we would like to do to help everyone out. Every elected \nofficial has great ideas for something that might make a difference, \nbut we don't look to see if it already has a similar program or if what \nwe already do in that area is working. In fact, the bills we passed \ndon't have enough specificity to know if we are achieving what we hoped \nwe would get done.\n  Without measurable goals, we can't measure progress. We don't include \nspecificity for how we are going to achieve our goals, which allows or \nforces agencies to go where they want to go. We never know if we \nactually solved the problem we started out to solve. For some Federal \nemployees, it is important never to get the problem solved as their \njobs might be eliminated.\n  Have you ever had an agency come to you and suggest that their \nmission no longer exists so we should end their funding? Not that I \nknow of.\n  Once a young man came to me and he said: This will probably cost me \nmy job, but what I am doing doesn't have to be done at all. By telling \nyou this, I will probably lose my job, but I feel strongly about it.\n  I told him he ought to be promoted and worked to have that happen.\n  I want to congratulate Senator Grassley for his efforts on \nwhistleblower protection so employees can point out problems without \nretaliation. We have regulations that cost jobs and the economy for \nvery little value. We have a rule that there has to be a cost-benefit \nanalysis for any project over $100 million of impact, but that is \nseldom done, and there are few standards for doing it anyway or \nrequirements to actually force it to be done. The benefits might be \ncosted over decades while the costs are immediate and continuing.\n  If we can improve the private economy by 1 percent, we would increase \nrevenue to the Federal Government by $400 billion without raising \ntaxes. Instead, we have gone from GDP--that is private sector \nproductivity--from 2.7 percent down to 0.5 percent. That is a huge loss \nof tax revenue.\n  We have regulations that have been on the books for years that \nhaven't been reviewed to see if technology has made them outdated. \nRegulations cost jobs but only in the private sector. When is the last \ntime you remember a Federal employee being laid off because of budget \ncuts or ending a program? I know we passed a major education bill here \nrecently, and we eliminated the national school board and a lot of the \nnational requirements.\n  So when we had the new nominee for Secretary of Education, I asked \nhim how many jobs that was going to save in the Department of \nEducation. He said: Well, none. We are just going to move them around \nand use them in other places. Wrong answer. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, we saved 237 jobs that will not have \nanything to do.\n\n[[Page S3150]]\n\n  There are 96,000 Federal employees in the District alone. What are \nthey all doing? An example is a principal who came to see me my first \nyear here. He had been filling out Federal reports for a long time, and \nhe wondered where they went. So I sent him to the Department of \nEducation, and he spent a semester there and followed all those reports \naround. Then he came and reported to me. He said: You know, they really \nlook at those carefully. They make sure every single blank is filled \nin. They make sure every single blank has a logical answer. If it \ndoesn't, they send it back. They get it back, and they check it over \nagain. Then, they file it and nobody ever looks at it.\n  I have been trying to get rid of some of those forms since that time.\n  How about expired Federal programs? Last year I spoke often about the \n260 programs we still have that expired, but we are still spending \nmoney on them to the tune of $293\\1/2\\ billion a year--260 programs \nexpired, $293\\1/2\\ billion paid out to them each year. One of them \nexpired in 1983, another one in 1987, and most of them before 2006, and \nwe are still giving them money.\n  After a year of harping on it, I find that we have reduced the number \nof expired programs from 260 to 256, but we have increased the spending \non expired programs from $293 billion to $310 billion. That is not \nprogress.\n  Here is another part of the problem. I have this housing chart. There \nought to be savings from better organization. We have 20 Federal \nagencies here. Somebody once said that if you take the 26 letters of \nthe alphabet and you picked any 3 or any 4 and you put them in any \norder you want to, there would be a Federal agency by that name. We \nhave 20 of those right here, and that isn't the whole chart. It would \ntake a much bigger chart to show the whole story, because these 20 \nFederal agencies oversee 160 housing programs. How many housing \nprograms does it take? What are they doing? Could they be combined? We \ndon't look at that.\n\n  Wouldn't consolidation of these result in some kind of savings? Maybe \nconsolidation would result in some efficiency. Shouldn't all of this be \ncontrolled by one entity? What are we trying to achieve in housing? Do \nwe have 160 different plans and goals? Shouldn't we consider that a \nmajor economic sector and have that a separate part of our budget? \nCan't some of the programs be combined?\n  When I came to the Senate, there were 119 preschool programs for \nchildren. We all know and acknowledge the value of preschool and how it \nincreases their earnings later on and cuts down on the amount of crime \nand helps the economy. We all know and acknowledge that value, but \nSenator Kennedy and I found that many of them have been evolved into \nexpensive childcare services rather than education, and they weren't \nmeeting their goals. We were able to get those programs down from 119 \nto 65. That was all that was in our jurisdiction of Health and \nEducation. Later we were able to get some of those others down to 45. \nTwo years ago, I got an amendment passed that the programs had to be \nreduced to five and all of them put under the Department of Education. \nEven though that is the law, that hasn't happened yet.\n  Does the Federal Government ever take a cut in dollars? We get \ninstant complaints if the requested increase is less than what was \nasked for--not less than what they had the year before, less than what \nwas asked for. Only in government is that considered a cut. Our budgets \nand spending are set up to allow everyone to get what they got last \nyear, plus the amount of inflation. We call it baseline budgeting. Many \ngovernments have gone to economic sector budgeting under a cap of \nexpected revenues. You don't look at what the expected revenues are. \nSome governments only borrow for long-term infrastructure investments. \nWe borrow for day-to-day expenses. As I mentioned earlier, we could be \nborrowing to pay our interest on our debt.\n  I am not even going to cover the Tax Code that has evolved from \nraising the basic money to run the government to a way to legislate \nsocial programs or for special benefits to individuals and businesses. \nOur Tax Code is costing us jobs.\n  What are some of the other causes of our debt problem? We are really \ngood at new and super ideas. Every idea is designed to help out the \nfolks back home. They all lend themselves to the greater good, but if \nthey aren't paid for, they steal from the future. We found many ways to \nsteal from the future. We are spending money that will not be there for \nour kids or our grandkids to spend. As my grandpa would say, it is \n``like milking a cow in a lightning storm, they'll just be left holding \nthe bag.''\n  We fudge these new ideas into existence. The easiest way is to do a \ndemonstration program. Demonstration programs let you ease into the \nspending a little at a time--boil the frog slowly. You just start it in \na few cities or States to show what a difference that idea would make. \nDemonstration programs are always sold on the basis that a successful \nprogram will show the local benefit and will be taken up locally \nbecause they have seen the advantage.\n  I am not aware of a single program that hasn't been spectacular. \nEvery program works out as planned, except for the part about being \nvaluable enough to be adopted and paid for locally. So the need for the \nmoney to continue to be spent continues and continues. Not only that, \nif it worked so well for the few, it needs to be expanded nationally so \neveryone can benefit. Unfortunately, while there may have been offsets \nfor the original programming, there was never a source of ongoing funds \nfor the continuance of the program, let alone for its expansion.\n  The next way to trick hard-working, tax-paying Americans is to make \nit a mandatory program. Here is a mandatory versus discretionary chart. \nThis is the $1,070 billion I talked about that we get to make decisions \non. These are the mandatory programs that we have, and they are growing \nfaster and faster. As the baby boomers kick in, you will see such a \nrapid escalation here that I don't know how we will ever be able to \nafford it.\n  Fifty years ago, 30 percent of spending was mandatory. We got to make \nannual decisions on 70 percent of the money. Because of the expansion \nof the mandatory programs, 70 percent of spending is on autopilot and \nfunded every year without a vote, and we only get to make decisions on \n30 percent of the money. Some of the mandatory programs used to have \ntheir own revenue stream, sufficient to cover the amounts paid out. \nSocial Security is a prime example. When it was set up, you couldn't \nretire until you were 65, and life expectancy was 59.\n  There used to be more people working and paying into Social Security \nthan the amount paid out to recipients. When that happened, the excess \nmoney was spent--yes, spent--and bonds were put in a Social Security \ndrawer backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. If \ninterest rates go to 5 percent, how well do you think that will work \nout? Pension funds for bankrupt companies of coal miners and the \nCentral States multiemployer pension fund are going broke now, not 20 \nyears, not 30 years, not 40 years in the future. They are going broke \nnow. But they are a symptom of what we are about to face.\n  People are talking about Puerto Rico and how they need a bailout. Who \nwould bail out the United States? Who would have enough money to do \nthat? We go to mandatory programs, so we don't have to figure out how \nto pay for programs. It continues without further votes or review. \nEveryone wants their favorite program to have dedicated funds, except \nwe don't dedicate funds to it and we ran out of real money. Mandatory \nspending used to mean that there was a dedicated stream of money \nsufficient to cover the cost of the program without dipping into the \ngeneral fund.\n\n  Here is a chart that shows how we are doing on that score. Let's see. \nHere is dedicated income as a percent of spending for 2015--actual--and \nincome covered just 51 percent of spending. In 2016, we only covered 49 \npercent, and in 2017, it might bump back up to 50 percent. Where does \nthe other 50 percent come from? It either has to be stolen from the \nfuture or taken from the present, which means that less can be done \nunder the regular budget.\n  Another funding trick that we use is to allocate funds from the \nfuture to spend in the present. We take funds from up to 10 years out. \nWe imagine that they already came in and sometimes we spend them in 1 \nyear. That is\n\n[[Page S3151]]\n\nborrowing from the future. That is borrowing money that our kids will \nneed for the dreams they have for their kids and America.\n  That brings me to emergency spending. Any event that can be \nconsidered a crisis can be considered for emergency spending. \nHurricanes, floods, tornadoes, earthquakes, and even failures by \nFederal agencies can be considered emergencies.\n  In earlier years when I looked at emergencies, it looked to me like \nwe spent about $6 billion a year on emergencies. Recently, I decided I \nneeded to have that figure checked. To my surprise, I found out that we \nhave $26 billion a year in emergencies that is unpaid for and will be \nborrowed from the future or borrowed on the debt. This little chart \npoints that out. We are billing an average of $26 billion for \nemergencies.\n  Anytime you know you are going to have some expense every year, maybe \nthat ought to be a part of the budget. Maybe we ought to plan on it. \nMaybe we ought to figure out how we are going to pay for it.\n  What are you going to tell your grandkids you did to give them \nopportunities? Do you want to be here to answer that question when \nSocial Security is cut by 20 percent to fund defense because interest \npayments have used up all of the money we get to make decisions on? Can \nwe consolidate programs? Can we be sure they have measurable goals and \nhold them to achievement? Can we watch regulation to see that it \nachieves its goal with a minimum of jobs lost? Can we review old \nprograms for elimination or consolidation when we look at new ideas? \nCan we find ways to fund our ideas without stealing from the future? \nHow will you answer to your grandkids for what you have done?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                 Gun Violence and Mental Health Reform\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, about a week ago, Josh Cortez was found \nshot and lying on the pavement in Hartford's South end. Josh was 22 at \nthe time. His girlfriend, who was 23 years old, was found in a parked \ncar nearby with a gunshot wound. She was rushed to Hartford Hospital \nwhere she died a half hour later. They were the sixth and seventh \nhomicide victims in Hartford this year.\n  They had been dating for about 2 years, and they had a 2-year-old \ndaughter. He had just celebrated his 22nd birthday. His cousin said:\n\n       [Josh] was a great kid. He turned his life around for the \n     better. He had a rough start, but he was doing a complete 360 \n     for his baby girl.\n\n  His cousin said that he was just wrapping up a jail diversionary \nprogram at the time of his death and that he was ``committed to the \nprogram,'' making every appointment and following every regulation.\n  Two days later, across the country in Iowa, Senquez Jackson was 15 \nyears old when his 13-year-old friend accidentally fired a small .38-\ncaliber semiautomatic pistol. His friend thought the gun was unloaded \nwhen he pulled the ammo clip from the handle. He killed his friend, \nSenquez, who was 15 years old, and now that 13-year-old boy has been \ncharged with involuntary manslaughter. In addition, they layered on \ncharges of obstructing prosecution and carrying a weapon.\n  Senquez is remembered by his friends and family as being a great \nathlete. He loved basketball. He dreamed of playing in the NBA. He \nalways told his auntie that he was going to be just like LeBron James.\n  One speaker at his funeral said that they had never met another child \nwith more gratitude than Senquez. He had deep gratitude for the things \nhe had been given. He died from an accidental gunshot wound on March \n18.\n  Earlier in the year, Romell Jones was standing outside the Alton \nAcres housing complex with a group of kids his age in Alton, IL. He was \n11 years old. They were waiting to get picked up to go to basketball \npractice. While they were waiting outside, a red car pulled up and \nsomeone inside the car fired multiple shots into this group of kids, \nand Romell was killed.\n  His friends remember him--frankly, like Senquez--as always having a \nbasketball in his hands. The middle school coach, Bobby Everage, who \nwas planning on coaching this incredibly talented kid, said:\n\n       This young man's life was cut short and he had so much \n     potential. I know he was a good kid and has a lot of friends. \n     When life ends that way, it is so sad.\n\n  His fifth grade teacher said that Romell was well liked by all of his \nteachers and all of his classmates.\n\n       He was always happy, sensitive, and an excellent student. \n     As a fifth grader he mentored younger students at our school.\n\n  He was only 11 years old when he was killed while waiting to go to \nbasketball practice.\n  At the end of last year--this is a story I pulled out of the dozens \nthat were killed in Connecticut cities--Antoine Heath was 29 years old \nwhen he was shot in the chest while sitting in a parked car on the \noutskirts of Edgewood Park in New Haven. His wife of 4 years and mother \nof his two children, ages 4 and 3, said that her husband was a family \nman. ``He was loving and hard working.''\n  Antoine's nickname was ``Champ,'' in large part because he was such a \nchampion of causes in and around his community. A childhood friend \nsaid:\n\n       He tried to get me to see things clear. He made sure \n     everybody was all right. He just wanted his family to be \n     together.\n\n  He had big plans for the weekend just following his death. He was \ngoing to be baptized. His sister said:\n\n       He was ready to give his life over to God, and he made the \n     decision on his own. That was something he wanted to surprise \n     the family and do.\n\n  Those are just four stories--four voices--of victims of gun violence. \nAs the Presiding Officer and many of my colleagues know, I try to come \nto the floor every week or couple of weeks to tell a handful of stories \nof the 31,000 a year, 2,600 a month, and 86 people a day who are killed \nby guns, resulting from a variety of reasons. Most of these are \nsuicides, many of them accidental. They happen in large numbers and \nsmall. Last year we had 372 mass shootings, which I categorize as 4 or \nmore people being shot at any one time. Many of these are domestic \nviolence incidents or gang-involved incidents. There are a lot of \ndifferent stories as to why this happens.\n  I come to the floor to talk for a moment today on a specific aspect \nof our path forward on addressing gun violence. Tomorrow Senator \nCassidy and I will host a summit here in Washington on mental health \nreform. Senator Cassidy and I, with the help of 16 of our colleagues--\neight Democrats and eight Republicans--have introduced a bipartisan \ncomprehensive mental health reform act that we think, if it passes, \nwill dramatically improve the experiences of individuals who are trying \nto seek help for their mental illness.\n  Given the fact that we are going to have hundreds of people at this \nsummit tomorrow, that many of us are living with the daily \nramifications of unchecked gun violence, and that we are continuing to \npress for legislation on this floor--as I know the Presiding Officer \nis--I want to talk about the mistakes I think we make in how we talk \nabout the intersection between mental health and the epidemic of gun \nviolence.\n  I will talk about it for a second through the lens of Sandy Hook. On \nthe same day that Adam Lanza walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School \nand murdered 26 children and educators, another mentally ill man in \nHenan, China, walked into a school and attacked 22 students--almost the \nsame number. Now, in Sandy Hook, every single child who Adam Lanza \nfired a bullet at and hit died. In China, every single student \nsurvived. Both assailants were unquestionably deeply mentally ill, but \nonly one incident resulted in a worldwide tragedy. The difference is \nthat Adam Lanza walked into that school with a semiautomatic rifle, and \nthe attacker in China walked into that school with a knife.\n  Our Nation has seen the horror that unfolds when mental illness and \ngun violence intersect in devastating ways and the cycles of shock, \ndespair, horror, and grief that accompany mass shootings are still a \nuniquely American routine. We can't fathom what would drive someone to \ncommit such horrifying acts. It is easy for society to blame that \nshooting in Newtown or in Aurora or wherever the next one may be on the \nmental illness. If we truly want to stop these mass shootings and do \nsomething about the 86 people who are murdered every day, we have to \nstop ourselves for a second and ask why this epidemic of gun violence\n\n[[Page S3152]]\n\ndoesn't happen in any other industrialized country the way it happens \nhere. We have to ask ourselves: Is it because more Americans suffer \nfrom mental illness? No, the statistics don't tell us that. Is it \nbecause the mentally ill in America are more violent than the mentally \nill in a place like Europe? No, the data doesn't tell us that. Do other \ncountries spend more money on treating mental illness than the United \nStates does? Is it that their systems are more adequate than ours? No, \nthe data doesn't tell us that either.\n  What is the difference between the United States and every other \ndeveloped nation? Why is our gun homicide rate 20 times higher than the \naverage OECD nation? Why don't other countries that experience the same \nlevel of mental illness and spend the same amount of money treating it \nhave a comparable number of shootings--mass and individual shootings? \nWell, one of the differences is guns. The difference is that in America \nwe are awash in illegal guns--high-power military-style assault \nfirearms that are designed to kill as many people as quickly as \npossible. The reality is that whoever shot that couple in Hartford or \nthat father New Haven didn't have to try very hard to find a weapon. It \nwas either in their house or around the corner or at a friend's \napartment.\n  There are a lot of people who would like to very easily conflate the \nconversation about gun violence with the conversation about fixing our \nmental health system. Let's just think about two States: Wisconsin and \nWyoming. These are States that have very similar mental health systems \nand spend the same amount of money. Yet one State, Wyoming, has a gun \nhomicide rate that is twice that of Wisconsin. There is no data that \nsuggests that mental illness explains the difference between those two \nStates, just like there is no evidence that mental illness explains the \ndifference between two countries.\n  This argument about an inadequate mental health system being the \nreason for epidemic rates of gun violence has become a very convenient \npolitical fate that is perpetrated by people who don't want to get to \nthe question of whether our gun laws have something to do with these \nepidemic murder rates.\n  There is no doubt that the mental health system in this country is \nbroken. It is dramatically under-resourced. People have to wait for \nmonths to get an outpatient appointment. We have closed down 4,000 \nmental health inpatient beds in this country just in the last 5 years \nalone. It is ridiculously uncoordinated. We have built up a system in \nwhich your body from the neck down is treated in one system, and then \nyou have to drive two towns over if you want to get treatment for your \nbody from the neck up. People with mental illness die 20 years earlier \nthan people without mental illness because those two systems are not \ncoordinated.\n  The stigma around mental illness is still crippling. I know we passed \na law that requires insurance companies to say on your statement of \nbenefits that you have coverage for mental illness. Everybody knows \nthat when you actually try to access those benefits, bureaucrats put up \nbureaucratic hurdles in front of your actually getting reimbursed for \nmental health care that they never would if you were trying to get \nreimbursed for a broken leg or heart surgery.\n  Now, fortunately, the Mental Health Reform Act, which this summit \nwill cover tomorrow, really does start to unlock many of these most \ndifficult problems. The Mental Health Reform Act will properly \ncapitalize our mental health system by putting back into it funding for \ninpatient beds and starting to marry the physical health system with \nthe mental health system. It attacks this stigma by requiring insurance \ncompanies to administer benefits in the spirit of parity and not just \nsay that you have a mental health benefit. It invests in prevention and \nearly intervention and treatments so that we are not just hitting the \nproblem at the back end. It gets into tough issues, like how our HIPAA \nlaws unfortunately stand in the way of caregivers actually being part \nof the treatment plan for their seriously mentally ill young adults.\n  The Mental Health Reform Act is a path forward to fixing our broken \nmental health system. But pretending that mental health reform is a \nsufficient response to gun violence is not only wrongheaded, it is also \ndangerous because the facts are incontrovertible that individuals \ncoping with serious mental illness commit less than 5 percent of all \nviolent acts in this country.\n  Let me say that again. People with mental illness commit less than 5 \npercent of all violent acts in this country. They are frankly far more \nlikely to be the victims of gun violence than they are to be the \nperpetrators of it.\n  Obviously, people like Adam Lanza, Jared Lee Loughner, and James \nHolmes had complicated and devastating behavioral health disorders. \nThere are Adam Lanzas, Jared Loughners, and James Holmeses in every \nother country in the world, but in these other societies mental illness \ndoesn't lead to mass murder. Something is different in America such \nthat people who are coping with mental illness turn to a weapon. This \ncelebratory culture of firearms and violence, this easy access to \nweapons of war that enable men and women with a severe mental illness \nto instantly transform themselves into mass murderers is unique in this \ncountry.\n  Even if Congress passed a bill today that magically eliminated all \nmental illness in the United States, our country would still have more \ngun violence and shooting deaths than any other country in the \ndeveloped world. Given that only 5 percent of these crimes are \nperpetrated by people with severe mental illness, curing mental illness \nwould be a remarkable achievement, but it wouldn't solve this problem.\n  It is even worse than that because draping the scourge of gun deaths \naround the necks of everyday Americans who are struggling with mental \nillness just increases the stigma I was talking about that surrounds \ndisorders of the mind. Scapegoating the 44 million Americans with \nmental illness just reinforces the idea that they should be feared \nrather than treated.\n  We have a mental health crisis in this Nation, and we have a gun \nviolence crisis as well. These two epidemics overlap--there is no doubt \nabout that--but solving one, the mental health epidemic, doesn't solve \nthe other. And conflating mental illness and gun violence may serve the \npolitical ends of those who don't want to have a conversation on this \nfloor about background checks or assault weapons or more resources for \nthe ATF, but it is not going to make America any demonstrably safer.\n  I think this is a very important conversation to have, and I don't \nwant to shy away from these intersections that exist, but I want to get \nit right. In the end, I want this body to commit itself to solving our \nmental health crisis and then doing what is additionally necessary to \ndo something about the 31,000 a year, 2,600 a month, and the 86 a day \nwho are killed by guns in this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, while the Senator from Connecticut is \nstill here, I want say through the Chair that I am glad I had a chance \nto hear his remarks. I agree with him that there is a mental health \ncrisis, and I congratulate him for his leadership, especially with the \nSenator from Louisiana, Mr. Cassidy, in focusing the Senate's attention \non dealing with it this year. I think he has a very passionate and \npractical way of making the argument that while there may not be a \nconsensus on what we do about guns, there is a consensus, I believe, in \nthis body on what we do about mental health or at least an important \nstep in the direction of dealing with the crisis. If we are able to do \nit, Senator Murphy, Senator Cassidy, and Senator Murray, the ranking \nDemocrat on the HELP committee, will deserve great credit for that \nhappening. I plan to attend for a while the summit tomorrow that \nSenators Murphy and Cassidy are hosting. It will help to draw attention \nto the efforts that the Senators made.\n  Last year the full Senate passed the Mental Health Improvement Act. \nThis year, working with the Senators from Connecticut and Louisiana, \nand the Senator from Washington, Senator Murray, we have incorporated \nthat into the Mental Health Reform Act. We are very hopeful we can pass \nthat legislation on the Senate floor in June and work with the House to \nturn it into a law this year.\n\n[[Page S3153]]\n\n  No doubt we will have more to do on the mental health crisis after \nthat, and we will have more debates on this floor about what the \nSenator from Connecticut calls the gun crisis. But there is no reason \nwe cannot move ahead with what we already have a consensus on in mental \nhealth. I am committed, as I know Senator Murray is, and so are other \nMembers on this side of the aisle. I know that Senator Blunt from \nMissouri feels passionate about mental health needs. Senator Cornyn is \nworking on helping us resolve this legislation. And Senator McConnell \nhas said that if we can find a consensus among ourselves and reduce the \namount of time it takes to put it on the floor, he will interrupt the \nappropriations process, put it on the floor, and try to get a result \nthis year.\n  So I am glad I had a chance to hear the Senator. I pledge to continue \nto work with him to get a result on the Mental Health Reform Act that \nhe has played such a key role in fashioning.\n\n\n                     21st Century Cures Legislation\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to speak on another issue that the \nSenator from Connecticut has also played a role in because he is an \nimportant Member of the HELP committee in the Senate, and that is what \nwe call the 21st Century Cures legislation. This legislation, in which \nPresident Obama is interested and which we have mostly finished in \nterms of our committee work in the Senate, has already passed the \nHouse.\n  A little over a week ago, the New York Times Magazine published a \nspecial health issue on the new frontier in cancer treatment--how \ndoctors and researchers are trying new tips, new drugs, even new ways \nof thinking about cancer. This month the photographer Brandon Stanton, \nwho documents the stories of ordinary people in his popular photography \nblog, ``Humans of New York,'' turned his lens on the pediatrics \ndepartment of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City \nto help raise money for cancer treatment and the research hospital \nthere.\n  Also this month, two former U.S. Senators, both of them physicians \nand one a cancer survivor--Dr. Bill Frist and Dr. Tom Coburn--wrote an \nop-ed in the Wall Street Journal about what the Senate is doing to help \nbring safe treatments and cures to doctors' offices, patients, and \nmedicine cabinets more quickly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe op-ed by Dr. Frist and Dr. Coburn at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  In the New York Times Magazine issue, one oncologist writes:\n\n       [For patients] for whom the usual treatments fail to work, \n     oncologists must use their knowledge, wit and imagination to \n     devise individualized therapies. Increasingly, we are \n     approaching each patient as a unique problem to solve. Toxic, \n     indiscriminate, cell-killing drugs have given way to nimbler, \n     finer-fingered molecules that can activate or deactivate \n     complex pathways in cells, cut off growth factors, accelerate \n     or decelerate the immune response or choke the supply of \n     nutrients or oxygen. More and more, we must come up with ways \n     to use drugs as precision tools to jam cogs and turn off \n     selective switches in particular cancer cells. Trained to \n     follow rules, oncologists are now being asked to reinvent \n     them.\n\n  The article continues:\n\n       Cancer--and its treatment--once seemed simpler. . . . A \n     breakthrough came in the 2000s, soon after the Human Genome \n     Project, when scientists learned to sequence the genomes of \n     cancer cells.\n       Gene sequencing allows us to identify the genetic changes \n     that are particular to a given cancer. We can use that \n     information to guide cancer treatment--in effect, matching \n     the treatment to an individual patient's cancer.\n\n  In another Times story, the reporter writes:\n\n       Today, a better understanding of cancer's workings is \n     transforming treatment, as oncologists learn to attack tumors \n     not according to their place of origin but by the mutations \n     that drive them. The dream is to go much deeper, to give an \n     oncologist a listing of all a tumor's key mutations and their \n     biological significance, making it possible to put aside the \n     rough typology that currently reigns and understand each \n     patient's personal cancer. Every patient, in this future \n     situation, could then be matched to the ideal treatment and, \n     with luck, all responses would be exceptional.\n       This idea, more broadly, has been called precision \n     medicine: the hope that doctors will be able to come to a far \n     more exact understanding of each patient's disease, informed \n     by genetics, and treat it accordingly.\n\n  I am here today to insert these important stories from the New York \nTimes Magazine, the ``Humans of New York'' blog, and Drs. Frist and \nCoburn's Wall Street Journal op-ed into the Record and to remind \neveryone that this year the Senate HELP Committee has passed 19 \nbipartisan bills that will help drive medical innovation. I am working \ntoday with Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on \nthe committee, on an agreement that will give the National Institutes \nof Health a surge of funding for the President's Precision Medicine \nInitiative, which will map 1 million genomes and give researchers a \ngiant boost in their efforts to tailor treatments to a patient's \nindividual genome. It will also provide funding for the Cancer \nMoonShot, which the Vice President is heading, to try to set us on a \nfaster course to a cure.\n  To raise money for cancer researchers at Sloan Kettering, Bradley \nStanton used photos on his ``Humans of New York'' blog, Facebook, and \nInstagram accounts. He writes: ``The study of rare cancers involves \nsmall and relentless teams of researchers. Lifesaving breakthroughs are \nmade on very tight budgets. So your donations will make a difference. \nThey may save a life.''\n  The fundraiser wrapped up this past weekend. More than 103,000 people \ndonated more than $3.8 million to help fight pediatric cancer. More \nthan $1 million was donated in the last day of the campaign in honor of \na young boy named Max to help research and cure DIPG, the brain tumor \nthat ended his short life.\n  Stanton shared photos and stories of Sloan Kettering patients and \ntheir parents, as well as the doctors and researchers working to treat \nand cure them--many stories hopeful, all difficult to read. As Stanton \nput it: ``These are war stories.''\n  In one post, a researcher at the pediatric center says:\n\n       In the movies, scientists are portrayed as having a \n     ``eureka moment''--that singular moment in time when their \n     faces change and they find an answer. . . . [I]t's hard to \n     say what a ``eureka moment'' would look like in my research. \n     Maybe it's when I'm finally able to look patients and parents \n     in the eye and say with confidence that we have what's needed \n     to cure them.\n\n  In another, a doctor at the center says:\n\n       It's been twelve hours a day, six days a week, for the last \n     thirty years. My goal during all these years was to help all \n     I could help. I've given 200%. I've given transplants to over \n     1200 kids. I've published as many papers as I could. . . . \n     But now I'm almost finished. It's time for the young people \n     out there to finish the job. They're going to be smarter than \n     us. They'll know more. They're going to unzip the DNA and \n     find the typo. They're going to invent targeted therapies so \n     we don't have to use all this radiation.\n\n  How do we make good on these dollars? How do we ensure that these \nremarkable new discoveries of targeted therapies are able to reach the \npatients that need to be reached?\n  We must give the Food and Drug Administration the tools and the \nauthority it needs to review these innovations and ensure that they are \nsafe and effective, that they get to the patients who need them in a \ntimely way. That is exactly the goal of our Senate Cures Initiative \nthat I am committed to seeing through to a result.\n  Dr. Francis Collins, Director of the National Institutes of Health--\nhe calls it the National Institutes of Hope--a Federal agency that this \nyear funds $32 billion in biomedical research, offered what he called \n``bold predictions'' in a Senate hearing last month about major \nadvances to expect if there is sustained commitment to such research.\n  Listen to what he said. One prediction is that science will find ways \nto identify Alzheimer's before symptoms appear, as well as how to slow \nor even prevent the disease. Today, Alzheimer's causes untold family \ngrief. It cost $236 billion a year. Left unchecked, the cost in 2050 \nwould be more than our Nation spends on national defense.\n  Dr. Collins' other predictions are equally breathtaking. Using \npluripotent stem cells, doctors could use a patient's own cells to \nrebuild his or her heart. This personalized rebuilt heart, Dr. Collins \nsaid, would make transplant waiting lists and anti-rejection drugs \nobsolete.\n  I had a phone call from Doug Oliver in Nashville, 54 years old, a \nmedical technician. Vanderbilt Eye Institute pronounced him legally \nblind. They said: No treatment, no cure, but check the Internet. Last \nAugust, he went to\n\n[[Page S3154]]\n\nFlorida for a clinical trial. The doctors took cells from his hip bone \nusing an FDA-cleared device, put them through a centrifuge, and \ninjected them into both eyes. Within 2 days, he was beginning to see. \nHe now has his driver's license back. He is ready to go back to work.\n  He is sending us emails about our legislation urging us to pass it \nand give more Americans a chance to have the kinds of treatments he had \nthat have restored his sight.\n  Continuing with Dr. Collins' predictions for the next 10 years, he \nexpects the development of an artificial pancreas to help diabetes \npatients by tracking blood glucose levels and by creating precise doses \nof insulin.\n  He said that a Zika vaccine should be widely available by 2018 and a \nuniversal flu vaccine--flu killed 30,000 people last year--and an HIV/\nAIDS vaccine available within a decade.\n  Dr. Collins said that to relieve suffering and deal with the epidemic \nof opioid addiction that led to 28,000 overdose deaths in America in \n2014, there will be new nonaddictive medicines to manage pain.\n  Our Senate HELP Committee has approved 50 bipartisan strategies \ndesigned to make predictions like these of Dr. Collins come true. These \ninclude faster approval of breakthrough medical devices, such as the \nhighly successful breakthrough path for medicines enacted in 2012, and \nmaking the problem-plagued electronic health records system \ninteroperable and less burdensome for doctors and more available to \npatients. We would make it easier for the National Institutes of Health \nand the Food and Drug Administration to hire the experts needed to \nsupervise research and evaluate safety and effectiveness. We approved \nmeasures to target rare diseases and runaway superbugs that resist \nantibiotics.\n  As Drs. Frist and Coburn--the former Senators--wrote in their Wall \nStreet Journal op-ed that this 21st century cures legislation ``touches \nevery American'' and that ``[m]illions of patients and the medical \ncommunity are counting on Congress.''\n  The House has already passed by a vote of 344 to 77 companion \nlegislation called 21st century cures, including a surge of funding for \nthe National Institutes of Health. The President has his Precision \nMedicine Initiative. The Vice President started his Moonshot to cure \ncancer. The Senate HELP Committee has passed 19 bipartisan bills, as I \nsaid, either unanimously or by a wide margin.\n  There is no excuse whatsoever for us not to get a result this year. \nIt would be extraordinarily disappointing to millions of Americans if \nwe did not. If the Senate finishes its work and passes these bipartisan \nbiomedical innovation bills, as well as a surge of funding for the \nNational Institutes of Health, and takes advantage of these \nadvancements in science, we can help more patients live longer and \nhealthier lives and help more researchers who want to look the parent \nof a small child in the eye and say: We found a cure.\n  I notice that the Senator from Pennsylvania has come to the floor. I \nam ready to yield my time, but before I do--and I see the Senator from \nMissouri as well--before I do, I want to say of both of them, the \nSenator from Pennsylvania has been a critical component of the 21st \ncentury cures committee work in the Senate. Several of the 19 bills \nthat our committee approved were sponsored by him. I thank him for his \nwork. The Senator from Missouri--I spoke a little earlier about the \nmental health focus and consensus that we are developing and how we \nhope to get a result this year on mental health in the Senate, as well \nas 21st century cures. The Senator from Missouri has been key in both \nof them. Last year, working with Senator Murray, he was the principal \narchitect of a boost of $2 billion in funding to the National \nInstitutes of Health. This year, he is pushing hard for advances in \nmental health. So with this kind of bipartisan cooperation, we ought to \nbe able to get a result in June or early July, and I am pledged to try \nto do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 11, 2016]\n\n                 Streamlining Medicine and Saving Lives\n\n                      (By Bill Frist & Tom Coburn)\n\n       As doctors, patients and former U.S. senators, we've seen \n     firsthand how medical innovation benefits patients. Those on \n     our operating tables and in our practices--and we ourselves \n     when we've needed medical care--have benefited from \n     breakthroughs in science and newly approved treatments that \n     translate into better health and longer lives.\n       Yet, tragically, millions of Americans are still suffering \n     and dying from untreatable diseases or the lack of better \n     treatment options. Now is the time to pass legislation that \n     we know will safely speed treatments to patients in need. \n     Lives are at stake.\n       Before the Senate is a powerful medical-innovation package \n     of 19 bills--a companion to the House-approved 21st Century \n     Cures Act--that will streamline the nation's regulatory \n     process for the discovery, development and delivery of safe \n     and effective drugs and devices, bringing the process into \n     the new century.\n       Today, researchers and developers spend as much as $2 \n     billion to bring a new drug or therapy to market and the \n     regulatory process can take more than 10 years. That's too \n     long and too expensive for the five million Americans \n     suffering from Alzheimer's; the 1.6 million who will be \n     diagnosed with cancer this year; the 60,000 Americans with \n     Parkinson's; and the nearly 800,000 people who die from heart \n     disease each year.\n       This legislation, crafted by the Senate's Health, \n     Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, touches every \n     American. Each of us has personal health battles or knows \n     family members and friends who are fighting against \n     devastating diseases. Passing this package will help ensure \n     that patients' perspectives are integrated into the drug-\n     development and approval process and speed up the development \n     of new antibiotics and treatments for those who need them \n     most. It will also give a big boost to President Obama's \n     cancer ``moonshot'' and his Precision Medicine Initiative, \n     which will map one million genomes and help researchers \n     develop treatments for diseases more quickly.\n       The U.S. has invested more than $30 billion in electronic \n     health records over the past six years. Yet the majority of \n     systems still are not able to routinely exchange patient \n     information. This legislation will improve interoperability \n     and electronic-information sharing across health-care \n     systems, playing a fundamental role in improving the cost, \n     quality and outcome of care. It encourages the adoption of a \n     common set of standards to improve information sharing. It \n     also allows patients easier access to their own health \n     records and makes those records more accessible to a \n     patient's entire health team so they can collaborate on \n     treatment decisions.\n       The legislation will also improve the Food and Drug \n     Administration's ability to hire and retain top scientific \n     talent, which is vital to accelerating safe and effective \n     treatments and cures. Additional provisions in the bills will \n     improve the timeliness and effectiveness of processes for \n     developing important combination products, such as a heart \n     stent that releases medication into the body.\n       Alzheimer's is already the most expensive disease in \n     America, and the number of people diagnosed with this \n     debilitating neurological condition is expected to nearly \n     triple to 13.8 million by 2050. This legislation will help \n     advance our understanding of neurological diseases and give \n     researchers access to more data so they can discover new \n     therapies and cures--giving families hope for the future.\n       Collectively, these 19 bills are expected to deliver new, \n     safe and effective treatments. Any political impediments to \n     this should be overcome immediately. We believe, along with \n     patients, providers, innovators and policy makers, that the \n     nation's current process for developing and delivering drugs \n     and devices to cure life-threatening diseases must change.\n       Millions of patients and the medical community are counting \n     on Congress to help make that change. After 10 committee \n     hearings and more than a year's work crafting bipartisan \n     legislation, it's time for a Senate vote.\n       American lives depend on it.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I mentioned what incredible leadership Mr. \nAlexander, the Senator from Tennessee, provides on these issues. I was \npleased, as he was pleased, and I know the Presiding Officer was also, \nthat last year, for the first time in 12 years, we were able to have an \nincrease in NIH research.\n  The future statistics that the Senator from Tennessee talked about on \nAlzheimer's and other things can be disrupted. In fact, that 2050 \nnumber of twice the defense budget spent on Alzheimer's alone with tax \nmoney--if you could delay the onset of Alzheimer's by an average of 5 \nyears, you would reduce that number by 42 percent. So those research \ndollars not only have the impact we want to have on families and the \nindividuals involved in that and other diseases we are dealing with now \nbut also have an incredible impact on taxpayers, have an incredible \nimpact on what we can do with the rest of the health care revolution \nthat is occurring.\n  The mental health effort the Senator from Michigan, Ms. Stabenow, and \nI\n\n[[Page S3155]]\n\nwere able to work on together a few years ago is about to produce at \nleast eight States--and hopefully more--where, at the right kinds of \nfacilities, mental health will be treated just like all other health.\n  This Congress is talking about doing the right things. We are making \nimportant steps in that direction.\n  Mr. President, I want to talk today about another thing that really \nimpacts families--in this case, military families. I have this bill on \nmy desk, the National Defense Authorization Act. I notice it is only on \nthe desk of half of the Members of the Senate. Members on this side of \nthe floor are ready to get to this bill and get this work done. Maybe \nthere is a message on the other side of the floor that this bill is not \nthere. We had hoped to get to it this week. We have not yet. But \ncertainly we should get to it as soon we return to our work after the \nend of this week.\n  In the National Defense Authorization Act--I am really glad that bill \nincludes the Military Family Stability Act, a measure that I introduced \nwith Senator Gillibrand to provide more flexibility for military \nfamilies. Today we have the most powerful military in the world, but we \nalso recognize that our military men and women do not serve alone. The \nformer Chief of Staff of the Army, GEN Ray Odierno, often said that the \nstrength of our Nation is in our military, but the strength of our \nmilitary is in its families. So our military families need to be \nunderstood, recognized, appreciated, helped.\n  Those families have changed a lot over the years. They have \nsacrificed much. In the last 15 years, those families have dealt with \npersistent conflicts somewhere in the world and the likelihood of \ndeployment to that conflict. But more importantly, the stress that puts \non those families generally is what matters to them--maybe not more \nimportantly in the greater context of what is going on but very \nimportant to them.\n  More military spouses are working today than ever before. In the \nworld we live in today, this is good news. But all too often, military \nspouses sacrifice their own careers to meet the needs of the spouse who \nis in the service. Frequent redeployments, frequent deployments, and \nfrequent relocations really have an impact on those careers.\n  According to a study done by the Military Officers Association of \nAmerica, 90 percent of military spouses--that is more than 600,000 men \nand women--are either unemployed or underemployed. More than half cite \nthe concerns about their spouse's service and the deterrent of moving \nfrom job to job--a deterrent not only for employers but a deterrent in \nthat they sometimes have a hard time having the kind of recognition for \nthe skills they bring to a new State or a new location that they need.\n  It is unfair to our military families for the spouse to needlessly \nhave problems that could be avoided. Clearly, if you decide to pursue a \nmilitary career--and that, by necessity, means relocation from time to \ntime--this is not going to be the same career as if you went to work \nand you had every likelihood that you would work there for the next \nseveral years.\n  These frequent and sometimes abrupt relocations take a heavy toll on \nstudents as well. Research shows that students who move at least six \ntimes between the 1st and 12th grades are 35 percent more likely to \nfail a grade. I am not sure that exact research applies to military \nfamilies. That is an overall number of what happens when people move. \nBut the average military family will move six to nine times during a \nchild's time in school--three times more often than the nonmilitary \nfamily.\n  These relocations of military families means that we need to find a \nbetter way to deal with those challenges for working families, and the \nMilitary Family Stability Act does that. The costs of needlessly \nmaintaining two residences so that someone can finish school or someone \ncan complete a job are the kinds of things that this act and this \ninclusion in the National Defense Authorization Act gives us a chance \nto deal with in a different way. It would allow families to either stay \nat the current duty station for up to 6 months longer than they \notherwise would be able to stay or to leave and go to a new location \nsooner.\n  This probably is most easily understood in the context of school. If \nyou only have a month left in school and your family could stay there \nwhile the person serving in the military goes ahead to the next post \nand is responsible for their own housing during the time they are there \nas a single serving individual--often they are going to find space \navailable on the post itself for one person while the family stays \nuntil that school year works out better.\n  A job could be the same. One person we had who came and testified--\nMia, who now lives in Rolla, MO--is married to a soldier who was being \nreassigned from Hawaii to Fort Leonard Wood, MO. That reassignment was \nsupposed to occur in June, so she applied for a Ph.D. program at St. \nLouis University that would begin in August. She applied for a teaching \nposition at Missouri Science and Technology at Rolla that would begin \nin August. Then her husband's transfer did not happen in June and it \ndid not happen in July, but she needed to be there in August.\n  Under this change, moving the family household could easily occur in \nAugust and her husband could follow in October, as he did, but all of \nthe expense of her going early was on her. She really had two options: \nOne was to not pursue her graduate school class when it started, and \nthe other was to not have a teaching job. Neither of those was a very \ngood option. She went ahead and moved. Her husband essentially couch-\nsurfed, but they had to pay for the move rather than the way that \nnormally would have happened. This would not have to happen otherwise.\n  When Senator Gillibrand and I introduced this bill last year, we were \nalso joined by Elizabeth O'Brien, who coached Division 1 college \nbasketball for 11 years, with stints at West Point, Hofstra University, \nand the University of Hawaii. But she married into the Army, and \nbecause of the lack of flexibility, she gave up her coaching career.\n  The story she wanted to tell that day was that when she and her \nfamily were in Germany, where her husband was serving, her two children \nwere in a German public school. They needed 2 more months to finish \nthat year in the German public school. There really wasn't a very good \ntransition when he was sent back to the Pentagon. There were no German \npublic schools where they could have finished the classes in the \nWashington area. Basically, they wound up having to finish that year as \nhome schoolers and then start another year the next year.\n  It would have been very easy for him to move on ahead, if that is \nwhat the family wanted to do, and for the family to stay in Germany for \n2 months so the children could finish that school year in a way that it \ncouldn't possibly be finished anywhere else, and then the family would \nmove. That is the kind of thing that would happen under this \nlegislation.\n  The day after we introduced this legislation, I happened to be \nhosting a breakfast for people who are supportive of Fort Leonard Wood \nand working at Fort Leonard Wood. I sat down at a table with two \nofficers. One of their wives, a retired master sergeant, mentioned that \nwe had proposed this legislation the day before. All three of them \nimmediately had a story about how this would have benefited their \nfamily if at some time at a specific moment in their career, they could \nhave stayed another 30 days or if the family could have gone forward 30 \ndays earlier.\n  I am proud this bill has widespread support, including from the \nNational Military Family Association, the Military Officers Association \nof America, the Military Child Education Coalition, Veterans of Foreign \nWars, the American Legion, Iraq And Afghanistan Veterans of America, \nBlue Star Families, the National Guard Association, and the Veterans \nSupport Foundation.\n  After more than a decade of active engagement around the world, \nfrankly, at a time when military families have a lot more challenges \nthan military families may have had at an earlier time, this is exactly \nwhat we ought to do.\n  We have had hearings on other issues over the last year. Over and \nover again, I have asked people who were testifying, representing the \nmilitary, what they think about this. Usually these are admirals and \ngeneral officers. In all cases, a story from their career immediately \ncomes to mind. Universally,\n\n[[Page S3156]]\n\nthey say: We have to treat families different than we used to treat \nfamilies because too often the failure to do that means we are losing \nsome of our most highly skilled people, who are still willing to serve \nbut are no longer willing to put an unnecessary burden on their spouse \nor their children.\n  The Military Family Stability Act goes a long way toward removing one \nof those unnecessary burdens. I am certainly pleased to see it included \nin the National Defense Authorization Act and look forward to dealing \nwith this important bill at the earliest possible date.\n  I see Senator Isakson on the floor, and I yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                              Memorial Day\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, as chairman of the Senate Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, I thank Senator Casey of Pennsylvania for giving me \na couple of minutes to come to the floor of the Senate to pay tribute, \npreceding Memorial Day, to those men and women--less than 1 percent of \nour population--who have sacrificed, fought, and died on behalf of the \npeople of the United States of America. We would not be where we are \ntoday had it not been for veterans who died on the battlefield so we \ncould have free speech, democracy in government, and so our people \ncould peacefully decide whom their leaders were and leave it up to us \nto lead the country.\n  I want to put a personal face on Memorial Day for just a moment.\n  First, I wish to talk about a guy named Tommy Nguyen. Tommy Nguyen is \nmy legislative staffer on military affairs information. He volunteered \nfor the U.S. Army Guard. He went to Fort Benning, GA, and graduated No. \n1 in his class. You know what that means at Fort Benning. Right now he \nis deployed in Afghanistan and has been deployed for the past 5 months.\n  While we sit here in peace and relative security in our country, \npeople like Tommy are protecting us all over. I am grateful for Tommy. \nHe is in my prayers every night. He is exemplary of all the other \npeople who have gone before us and sacrificed.\n  I wish to mention three people who are gone and aren't here any more, \nbut they are the faces of Memorial Day, as far as I am concerned. I \nhonor them at this time.\n  The first is Jackson Elliott Cox III. Jackson Elliott Cox III is from \nWaynesboro, GA, Burke County, the bird dog capital of south Georgia. He \nwas my best friend at the University of Georgia in the 1960s. One night \nhe came into the fraternity house--in his junior year, my senior year--\nand sat down beside me and a few other guys at the dinner table and \nsaid: Guys, I just did something this afternoon. I volunteered to go to \nOCS in the U.S. Marine Corps, go to Parris Island, and fight in Vietnam \nfor the United States of America.\n  We all did the first thing all of you would do. We said: Well, Jack, \nhave you thought this through? Is this really what you think you ought \nto do?\n  He said: You know, I have had everything as a young man to age 22. It \nis time that I fought to help defend the United States of America. I am \ngoing to become a marine officer, I am going to Vietnam, and I am going \nto help the United States win.\n  Jack did become an officer, and he did go to Vietnam. In the 12th \nmonth of his 13-month tour, he was killed by a sniper. Alex Crumbley, \nPierre Howard, who was later the Lieutenant Governor of the State of \nGeorgia, and I spent a week with his family as we waited for his body \nto come back from Southeast Asia.\n  The most meaningful afternoon of my life was the afternoon we sat up \nwith Jack and his mother and father reminiscing about all the good \ntimes but deep down in our hearts knowing all the good times that would \nnever be for Jack Cox because he had sacrificed the ultimate sacrifice \nfor me, for you, and for all America.\n  Second, I wish to talk about LT Noah Harris, the Beanie Baby soldier \nin Iraq. Noah Harris was a cheerleader his junior year at the \nUniversity of Georgia. He cheered on the Saturday before 9/11/2001. As \neverybody did, he watched the horror of the attack that day and all the \npeople who were killed.\n  He went down to the ROTC building at the University of Georgia and he \nsaid: I want to volunteer to go after whoever those people were who \nattacked America in New York City.\n  The head officer said: Well, son, it is at least a 2-year commitment \nin ROTC, and you only have a year and a half to go. We cannot take you.\n  He said: I will make up the difference if you let me volunteer. I \nwant to become an officer. I want to go after them, and I want to find \nthem wherever they are.\n  The Army relented. Noah Harris volunteered. He went to OCS, and he \nwent to Iraq in the surge on behalf of the United States of America. He \nbecame known as the Beanie Baby because he took Beanie Babies in his \npockets and he won over the children of Iraq by handing out the Beanie \nBabies as he dodged bullets and put himself in harm's way.\n  About 6 months into his tour, he was hit by an IED while in a humvee. \nNoah Harris was killed that day in Iraq, and we have missed him ever \nsince. To his father Rick and his mother Lucy--God bless them. Noah was \nan only child, and his memory is burned deep in their hearts and deep \nin my mind. They are so proud of what he did for you, for me, and for \nall of America.\n  Lastly, I wish to talk about Roy C. Irwin.\n  These three people are the faces of why we have Memorial Day. I get \nemotional because I went to the Margraten Cemetery in the Netherlands a \nfew years ago as a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee to pay \ntribute to those soldiers who died in the Battle of the Bulge and the \nBattle of Normandy. Margraten in the Netherlands is where most of the \nsoldiers who were not brought home from the Battle of the Bulge are \nburied.\n  On that Memorial Day in Margraten, my wife and I walked between the \ngraves, stopping at each one, looking at the name, and saying a brief \nprayer for the soldier and a family. Then all of a sudden, in row 17, \nat grave No. 861, I stopped dead in my tracks and I looked down and saw \non the white cross: Roy C. Irwin, New Jersey, Private, U.S. Army, 12/\n28/44.\n  Roy C. Irwin died on December 28, 1944, in the Battle of the Bulge. \nThat was the day I was born. So there I was, a U.S. Senator looking at \nthe grave of someone who died on the day I was born so I could be a \nU.S. Senator 64 years later. That is what the ultimate sacrifice is all \nabout.\n  Selflessly, these people went into harm's way, fought for Americans, \nfought for liberty, fought for peace, and fought for prosperity. So \neverything we do today we owe in large measure to them--a small \npercentage of our population but a population that loves America and \nAmerica's people.\n  So this Monday when you are at the lake or at the beach or with your \ngrandchildren, wherever you might be, stop a minute, grab the hand of \none of your grandchildren, and just bow and say a brief prayer, because \ngoing before all of us were men and women who volunteered and lost \ntheir lives so you and I can do what we are doing today.\n  We live in the greatest country on the face of this Earth. You don't \never find anybody trying to break out of the United States of America; \nthey are all trying to break in. If there is a single reason that \ndifferentiates us from everybody else--when duty calls, we go and we \nfight.\n  As Colin Powell said in the U.N., before the request for the surge \nwas approved, America has gone to every continent on Earth, sent her \nsons and daughters to fight for democracy, liberty, and peace, and when \nwe have left, all we have asked for is a couple of acres to bury our \ndead.\n  I had the chance to walk a couple of those acres in Margraten, the \nNetherlands, and stand at the grave of Roy C. Irwin, who died the same \nday I was born. That memory is burned indelibly in my heart and \nindelibly in my mind, and I will always remember Roy C. Irwin. I never \nknew him, I never met him, and I never saw him, but I know his spirit. \nHis spirit is the spirit of the United States of America.\n  This Monday, I hope God will bless each of you. Have a wonderful \nvacation and a wonderful holiday. But I hope you will pause and say \nthanks for the men and women who made it possible for you to do what \nyou do today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n[[Page S3157]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. CASEY.

Madam President, I \nwish to first say . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: Mr. CASEY. Madam \nPresident, I wish to first say . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n\n\n                         Miners Protection Act\n\n  Madam President, I rise to talk about coal miners and the promise--\nthe obligation the U.S. Government has to coal miners on a range of \nissues but especially when it comes to their pensions and their health \ncare.\n  Many Americans remember Stephen Crane as the author of the novel \n``The Red Badge of Courage,'' but he also wrote something that probably \nnot many Americans have read, but I have because it was about a coal \nmine near my hometown of Scranton. He wrote it just before the turn of \nthe last century. For me, the pertinent parts were in terms of his \ndescription of what a coal mine looks like and all the dangers that are \nin that kind of work. His words in describing a mine were as follows. \nIn describing the mine, he described it as a place of ``inscrutable \ndarkness, a soundless place of tangible loneliness,'' and then he went \non to catalog in horrific detail all the ways that a miner could be \nkilled or could be adversely impacted by his work.\n  I am thinking about those dangers today when I speak about what coal \nminers have been through over many generations and what they confront \ntoday because of the pension issue we are going to discuss today. I am \ngrateful to be joined by Senator Manchin of West Virginia, Senator \nBrown of Ohio, Senator Warner of Virginia, and Senator Wyden of Oregon.\n  Senator Wyden, as the leader of the Democrats on the Finance \nCommittee, worked to have a hearing on this issue. It was in March, and \nI had the pleasure at that time of meeting two Pennsylvania coal \nminers, Tony Brusnak of Masontown, PA, which is in Fayette County, and \nDave Vansickle of Smithfield, PA, also in Fayette County. Tony and Dave \ncame to Washington to attend the Finance Committee hearing on pensions. \nI commend Senator Wyden for helping us have that hearing and also for \nhis work in negotiating with Chairman Hatch to hold that hearing and \nhis continued efforts to get a markup in committee.\n  Those of us who attended the hearing heard United Mine Workers \npresident Cecil Roberts testify about that promise I referred to \nbefore, the promise this Nation made to our coal miners, and how the \nMiners Protection Act carries out or carries through on that promise. \nIt is one of the ways to fulfill that promise we made to coal miners.\n  At the time of that hearing, they were joined by mine workers from \nWest Virginia, Ohio, Virginia, and Alabama on that particular day.\n  As I mentioned, Tony Brusnak from Fayette County had a 40-year work \nlife in the mines, starting in the 1970s at J&L; in Bobtown, PA. He is a \nmember of the United Mine Workers Local 2300, and he is still active. \nHe works at the harbor as a dockman now, and he is also a veteran.\n\n  Dave Vansickle began working in the coal mines about the same time, \nmaybe a few months before Tony, so they are both 40-year miners. Dave \nworked at the Cumberland Mine and is a member of the United Mine \nWorkers, Local 2300, as is Tony. Over his 40 years in the mine, Dave \nVansickle has had numerous jobs, ranging from 20 years working on the \nlong wall--miners know what that is--to working at the prep plant and \nalso doing a range of other work in the mine. Dave Vansickle lost a \nfinger doing that work, and he lost partial use of his right hand as \nwell as several other fingers. So there is a price that has been paid \nby him and so many others.\n  These are very difficult jobs, and we know the men and women--women, \nI should add--who descend into the depths and the darkness of these \nmines assume a substantial personal risk and they work long hours. They \nstay in these jobs as long as they do, in part, because they have been \ngiven a promise--a promise by our government--that when they retire, \nthey will have a pension and, most importantly, they will also have \ngood health insurance so they are covered for the ailments they have \nsustained over the years of service.\n  The Miners Protection Act, which Senator Manchin and I have \nintroduced, along with a bipartisan coalition of Senators, allows \nexcess amounts from the Abandoned Mine Lands Fund to be used to \npreserve both coal miner pensions and retiree health care, as needed.\n  In Pennsylvania, we have more than 12,000 mine workers who are \nimpacted by this--to be exact, 12,951 mine workers in Pennsylvania who \nare counting on us to pass this legislation. Here is the breakdown in \nsome of our counties: just about 2,500 in Cambria County, PA, where \nJohnstown is; about 2,100 in Fayette County, where Tony and Dave have \nlived and worked; 1,900 in Indiana County; 1,500 in Washington County; \nand 1,000 in Westmoreland County.\n  Without passage of this legislation, something on the order of 20,000 \nretirees and 5,000 Pennsylvanians, their dependents or widows could \nlose their promised lifetime retiree health care within a matter of \nmonths.\n  Without the legislation, the United Mine Workers Act 1974 Pension \nPlan, which is the largest of the plans in the country, providing \npensions to nearly 90,000 pensioners across the country and of course \ntheir surviving spouses, could be on an irreversible path to insolvency \nby next year.\n  Our coal miner men and women live on small pensions, averaging just \n$530 per month, plus Social Security. They rely greatly on the health \ncare benefit they have negotiated and earned through their years of \nhard work in the coal mines. So these aren't just numbers, these are \npeople. These are families who have worked very hard for Pennsylvania \nand worked very hard for our country. They have children and they have \ngrandchildren. The Federal Government made them a promise and we must \nnot rest until we fulfill that promise.\n  In 1990, a Federal blue-ribbon commission, the so-called Coal \nCommission, established by then-Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole, \nfound that ``retired miners have legitimate expectations of health care \nbenefits for life; that was the promise they received during their \nworking lives, and that is how they planned their retirement years. \nThat commitment should be honored.''\n  So said Secretary Dole's Commission in 1990.\n  It is important to note that the 1974 plan I mentioned has been well \nmanaged, with investment returns over the last 10 years averaging 8.2 \npercent per year. So despite being about 93 percent funded just before \nthe financial crisis in 2008, losses sustained during the financial \ncrisis placed the 1974 pension plan on the path to insolvency. That is \nbecause the financial crisis hit at a time when this plan had its \nhighest payment obligations. That, coupled with the fact that 60 \npercent of the beneficiaries are orphan retirees whose employers are no \nlonger in the coal business and the fact that there are only 10,000 \nactive workers for 120,000 retirees, has helped to place the plan on \nthe road to insolvency.\n  The 1974 plan's Actuary projects the plan will become insolvent in \nthe years 2025-2026, absent passage of the Miners Protection Act. So we \nneed to pass this legislation. We have made it very clear to Senators \nin both parties and more recently to the majority leader that we need \nto get this done.\n  By making small adjustments to existing law, the bill will allow us \nto fulfill that obligation, that promise I spoke of earlier. At the \nsame time, even as we are working to pass the miners' pension \nlegislation, we also have to be mindful of--and I will not spend time \ntoday talking about this in detail--and keep working on miner safety \nand of course those affected adversely by black lung.\n  So whether it is safety and health, health care itself, or whether it \nis retiree benefits of any kind--but especially the promise we made to \nminers with regard to their pensions--we have an obligation. This body \nneeds to get on a track to pass this legislation before we leave in \nJuly.\n  I am honored to be part of this coalition, and I certainly thank and \ncommend and salute the work done by Senator Manchin.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n[[Page S3158]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, let me first of all say thanks to my \ndear friend Senator Casey from Pennsylvania. If you don't come from a \ncoal-mining region or a coal-mining State, you probably don't \nunderstand the culture of coal mining, the people who do this work, and \nthe families who support them. It might be hard to explain it, but we \nare going to try to give you a picture of the most patriotic people in \nAmerica.\n  What I mean by that is they have done the heavy lifting. They have \ndone everything that has been asked of them by this country to \nbasically make us the greatest country on Earth--the superpower of the \nworld, if you will. That has been because of the energy we have had \ndomestically in our backyard and the people willing to harvest that for \nus.\n  So when you look at this country and you look at how we are treating \npeople who have done the job and heavy lifting for over 100 years, the \ncoal miners in West Virginia feel this way: They feel like the \nreturning veterans from Vietnam, the returning servicemen who came from \nVietnam--a war that was not appreciated and soldiers who were treated \nless than honorably for doing the job they did in serving their \ncountry. Americans now want to cast them aside. It is just unfair--\ntotally unfair.\n  This country was so dependent upon this industry that in 1947--which \nwill be 70 years tomorrow--President Harry S. Truman and John L. Lewis, \nhead of the United Mine Workers--and back then, in the 1940s, anybody \nwho mined coal was a member of the United Mine Workers of America \nbecause it was all unionized--made a commitment and a promise they \nwould get their benefits. It would be their health care, and they would \nget their pensions, which were so meager--so meager--just to keep \nworking and to keep the country energized after World War II. If they \nhad shut down and gone on strike, the country would have fallen on \nextremely hard times coming off of World War II.\n  That is how important this is. It is the only agreement where you \nhave an Executive order by a President committing the United States of \nAmerica to keeping its promise to our coal miners doing a job that made \nour country as great as we are today. Yet here we are, about ready to \ndefault on that, and we can't get people to move on it for whatever \nreason.\n  The miners are facing multiple pressures on their health care, \npension, and benefits as a result of the financial crisis and corporate \nbankruptcy. This is not because of something they have mismanaged \nthemselves. As we heard Senator Casey mention, the 1974 pension plan \nwas 94 percent funded, which is extremely healthy and solvent, up until \n2008, when the financial collapse happened. It was not their fault, but \nnow they are thrown into disarray.\n  Most of the people still collecting these pensions are widows. A lot \nof the husbands have died from black lung. These people are depending \non a very meager amount of support for any type of quality of life, and \nwe have it paid for also. We have had it paid for. We are talking about \nthe excess AML money that could basically take care of this. Also, \nthere is another pay-for. There is a $5 billion fine that Goldman Sachs \npaid the DOJ for their financial shenanigans during this financial \ncollapse that could go to pay for this. I mean, it is Wall Street that \ncaused the problem. It wasn't the miners, basically the miners' pension \nfund or the plan that was being managed at all.\n  When you couple this with the fact that 60 percent of the \nbeneficiaries are orphan retirees, which has been explained, and that \nwe have 10,000 active workers for 120,000 retirees, that has placed the \nplan on the road to insolvency. I think everyone understands that.\n  The Miners Protection Act is not only important to all miners in all \nStates--my good friend here Senator Warner from Virginia has a \ntremendous mining community in Southwest Virginia, along with our \nentire State. Pennsylvania is the home of anthracite coal. The coal \nindustry really got started there. We have Senator Brown in Southeast \nOhio, which butts up to West Virginia and is a major mining area. So it \nis important to my State and all the other States that have retired \nminers.\n  People are asking about the nonunion. I am concerned about the \nnonunion miners, and I will do everything and commit myself to helping \nthem also, but if we can't even keep our commitment to the United Mine \nWorkers of America that was basically signed by President Harry S. \nTruman in 1947, we are not sincere or intent on helping anybody. This \nis something that must be done and must be done immediately. I have \nsaid that, and I have been preaching this, so I hope we all come to our \nsenses and do something as quickly as possible about this.\n  These retirees--as far as basically their medical, runs out the end \nof this year. The following year they lose their pensions too. That is \nhow desperate this is and what we are dealing with.\n  To address these issues the Miners Protection Act would simply do \nthis: It would amend the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act to \ntransfer funds in excess of the amounts needed to meet existing \nobligations under the Abandoned Mine Land Fund to the UMWA 1974 Pension \nPlan to prevent its insolvency; second, make certain retirees who lose \nhealth care benefits following the bankruptcy or insolvency of his or \nher employer eligible for the 1993 Benefit Plan. These assets of \nVoluntary Employment Benefit Association, created following the Patriot \nCoal bankruptcy--and if you don't know about the Patriot Coal \nbankruptcy, I will give you a minute or two on this one.\n  Patriot Coal came out of Peabody. Peabody spun Patriot off and put \nall of their liabilities--all of their liabilities--which were \nbasically doomed to fail, into Patriot. They threw all of the union \nworkers into this liability. And guess what. They went bankrupt. It \nwent bankrupt. It was designed to go bankrupt so they could be shed of \nall the liabilities.\n  It is our responsibility to keep the promise to our miners who have \nanswered the call whenever their country needed them. They have never \nfailed us. When our country went to war, these miners powered us to \nprosperity.\n  A lot of these young people we have here today don't understand that \nbasically coal mining was so important to this country, when we entered \nWorld War II, if you were a coal miner, it was more important for you \nto stay and mine the coal to power the country--the coal that made the \nsteel, that built the guns and ships--than it was to go on the \nfrontlines and fight. They were on the frontlines every day. They never \nleft the frontlines.\n  When our economy was stagnant, the miners fueled its growth and \nexpansion. After the war, there was so much buildup, the economy \nstarted dipping. You had to continue to work and produce in order to \nmake that happen, and we needed energy to do that, so the coal miners \ndid that.\n  They kept their promise to us, and now it is time for us to keep our \npromise to them. We need to honor the commitment. We need to honor the \nExecutive order signed by the United States of America to make sure \nthey get their pension and make sure they get their health care.\n  Senator Casey and I introduced the Robert C. Byrd Mine Safety \nProtection Act to, among other things, make it a felony for mine \noperators to knowingly violate safety standards.\n  Six years and 1 day after 29 brave miners were tragically killed at \nthe Upper Big Branch Mine in West Virginia, former Massey Energy CEO \nDon Blankenship received 1 year in prison, the maximum allowable \nsentence, for willfully conspiring to violate mine safety standards.\n  Put simply, the penalty does not fit the crime committed there, and \nwe aim to change that. I stood with the families of the beloved miners \nin the days following the devastating tragedy at Upper Big Branch. \nThrough moments of hope and despair, I witnessed again and again the \nunbreakable bonds of family that are as strong or stronger than \nanything I have ever seen. While no sentence or amount of jail time \nwill ever heal the hearts of the families who have been forever \ndevastated, I believe we have a responsibility to do everything we can \nin Congress to ensure that a tragedy like this never, ever happens \nagain.\n  I thank Senators Casey, Brown, Warner, Wyden, and all of my \ncolleagues for putting these miners first and keeping the promise that \nwe made\n\n[[Page S3159]]\n\nto them. It is vitally important that we hold executives who are \nwilling to put the health and lives of our workers at risk accountable \nfor their actions. We must hold everybody responsible. We must hold \nourselves responsible first to do the right thing. That is what we are \nstanding here talking about today. If we don't stand up for the people \nwho basically have stood up and defended us, powered a nation and did \nthe heavy lifting and if we can't keep the promise that was made 70 \nyears ago, then God help us in the Senate and the Congress.\n  I hope we do step up and do the right thing. I tell all of my \ncolleagues that this is not a partisan issue. This is truly bipartisan. \nThis is truly bipartisan. These people work for all of us, not just for \npart of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I am pleased to join my friends--Senator \nCasey, who led this debate; Senator Manchin, who has worked on this \nlegislation and devoted much of his career to the people that go down \ninto the mines and provide the coal and electricity for much of the \neastern half of the United States; Senator Warner, for his work with \nSenator Casey and Senator Wyden on the Finance Committee. Thanks to all \nof them.\n  I want to talk about two pension issues starting with what happened 2 \nweeks ago, when hundreds of thousands of Teamsters and their families \nreceived exciting news that the U.S. Treasury was rejecting the Central \nStates Pension Fund's plan to cut the pensions and benefits they had \nearned through a lifetime of hard work. This was a win for all of us \nwho urged Treasury to reject these cuts. More importantly, it was a win \nfor the thousands of union members, their families, their supporters, \nand their friends who worked so hard to protect what their union had \nspent decades fighting for. That rejection, to be sure, is not the end \nof the fight for the benefits that workers have earned. It was just the \nlatest battle in the fight to protect workers' pensions.\n  While Central States' 47,000 Teamsters in my State and tens of \nthousands in other States may have gotten a reprieve, we have more work \nto do. As Senator Manchin just spoke about, our Nation's retired coal \nminers are on the brink of losing their health care and retirement \nsavings, and it is within the power of Congress to pull them back.\n  The health care and pension plans of the United Mine Workers of \nAmerica cover some 100,000 mine workers, about 7,000 of them living in \nmy State, mostly in Southeast Ohio. The plans were almost completely \nfunded before the financial collapse in 2008, but the industry and its \npension funds were devastated by the recession. The plan has too few \nassets, too few employers, and too few union workers now paying in. If \nCongress fails to act, thousands of retired miners could lose their \nhealth care this year, and the entire plan could fail as early as next \nyear. This would be devastating for retired mine workers, like my \nconstituent, Norm Skinner.\n  I met Norm in March before a Finance Committee hearing on pension \nplans that are under threat. Norm is a veteran. He started working as a \nminer for what became Peabody Coal in 1973. He worked for 22 years and \nretired in 1994. For every one of those years, he earned and \ncontributed to his retiree health care plan and his pension plan.\n  Since he retired, Norm has had nearly constant health challenges--not \nthat unusual for people who work in some of the most dangerous \nconditions in American business. He had triple bypass surgery in 2010. \nThree years later, they inserted stents, and he had angioplasty. Norm \ntold me that 60 percent of his colleagues at the mine have died of \ncancer because of the chemicals. When they closed the mine, teams of \npeople wearing hazmat suits came in to clean it. His entire shovel crew \nhas died of cancer. Some were in their fifties when they passed away. \nBut now, after putting in decades in this dangerous mine, Norm is in \ndanger of losing the health care that has kept him alive.\n  I also met with David Dilly, who worked in the same SIMCO mine. David \nis also a veteran, and he worked for 14 years at the mine before it \nclosed down in 1989. He was a UMWA member, even serving as president of \nLocal 1188 for a couple of years, and he serves as recording secretary \nstill.\n  Mining is hard, backbreaking work. It is dangerous. It is dangerous \nevery day in the mine. It is dangerous for the air and the chemicals \nthat mine workers ingest. They knew that when they signed up for the \njob. But that work has dignity. It is crucial to us and in our national \ninterest as a country. It is a dignity rooted in providing security and \nopportunity for their family.\n  We used to have a covenant in this country that said: If you work \nhard, if you put in the hours, if you contribute to retirement and your \nhealth care, you will be able to support yourself and your family. What \nthey are doing is giving up union negotiations and also giving up wages \ntoday to take care of themselves and their family in later years so \nthat government or friends or other family members don't have to. What \nis more honorable than that? It is what made this country great. It is \nwhat built the middle class. So when earned benefits like collectively \nbargained pensions and health care can be cut, we are going back on a \nfundamental promise that our country has made to tens of millions of \nAmerican workers.\n  There is a bipartisan solution proposed by the two Senators from West \nVirginia and supported by leaders in both parties. The bill uses the \ninterest and surplus from an existing source of money, the Abandoned \nMines Reclamation Fund, and funnels that money into the health care and \npension plans. This is a fund for reclaiming the land of retired coal \nmines. So it makes sense to use the surplus to support retired coal \nmine workers and their families.\n  If this bipartisan legislation was brought to the floor today, it \nwould pass with an overwhelming majority. It is time for the Senate to \nact. This legislation has been blocked by one Republican leader in this \nbody. The support of Senator Wyden, Senator Warner, and Senator Casey \nand in the committee seems to be unanimous from the chairman on down. \nWe are just looking to the Republican leader to give us a vote on this \nbecause we are absolutely certain it would pass.\n  Miners worked in dangerous conditions their entire lives to put food \non the table, to send their kids to college, and to help power this \ncountry. I have worn on my lapel a pin given to me at a workers' \nmemorial day in the late 1990s, on an April day, where we were \nmemorialized workers who had been killed or injured on the job in the \nsteel industry. This is a depiction of a canary in a birdcage. In the \nearly 1900s, the mine workers would take a canary down in the mines. If \na canary died because of lack of oxygen or toxic gas, the mine workers \nknew they had to get out of the mine. Yet, in those days, there was no \nunion strong enough to protect them and they had no government that \ncared enough to protect them. We are in the situation today where it is \nup to us to be that canary. It is up to us to provide for those \nworkers--who have earned these pensions, who have earned this health \ncare for themselves and, in far too many cases, for their widows--and \nto step up and do the right thing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am proud to stand here with my \ncolleagues and friends--Senator Manchin from West Virginia, Senator \nCasey from Pennsylvania, Senator Brown from Ohio, and, shortly after \nme, Senator Wyden from Oregon--to echo what has already been said.\n  Senator Brown said it best. He wears that canary pin. If we don't act \nnow, if we don't hear that call and respond to it, then the basic \npromise and premise that so much of our country is founded on will \nreally be crushed.\n  I join my colleagues in standing up and urging the Senate to pass the \nMiners Protection Act. We have mines--just as in Pennsylvania, Ohio, \nand West Virginia--in southwest Virginia. Quite honestly, I think, as \ndo my colleagues, that no one fully understands what it is like to mine \ncoal until you have been underground, until you see the enormous \nchallenges and conditions that men and women--mostly men--worked under \nfor decades to power our Nation.\n  Senator Manchin often recites the history of this proud industry. But \nthat industry has gone through dramatic changes. Some of those changes \nare due\n\n[[Page S3160]]\n\nto activities of certain companies that may or may not have been \nresponsible. Some of these changes are because of a desire of many of \nus, frankly, on this side of the aisle, to make sure that we find \ncleaner ways to use energy. In a way, that is good. But it has meant \nthat many of these coal companies and many of these operators that \ncontinue to mine what powered America are under enormous fiscal stress. \nThe result is not enough miners, coal companies that went bankrupt, \nand, unfortunately, the pension funds that would protect these miners \nare now in jeopardy.\n  So now, through no fault of their own, these workers who have \nsacrificed their bodies, their health, and their livelihoods--when it \ncomes to the U.S. Government to uphold our end of the deal to make sure \nthat these workers or, more specifically, as my colleagues have pointed \nout, more often it is their widows, as so many of these miners have \npassed on due to things like black lung disease--are going to get the \nhealth care and pensions that were promised and whether we are going to \nbe able to honor that commitment.\n  The UMWA 1974 Pension Fund affects about 100,000 miners and close to \n10,000 in the Commonwealth of Virginia. They are looking to us and \nwhether we are going to honor our commitment.\n  As Senator Brown mentioned, I met a number of these miners, who are \ndirect beneficiaries, when we had our most recent hearing. Many of \nthese miners I had worked with and supported when I was Governor of \nVirginia, and I saw the challenges their communities had gone through. \nIf we don't do our job, these communities that have been hard hit all \nthroughout Appalachia--if these widows don't get the health care and \ntheir pensions, communities that have already been devastated will be \nfurther devastated. If we allow this pension fund to go bankrupt and go \ninsolvent, it will put additional strains on the PBGC, which is already \nunder enormous strain.\n  The truth is, as Senator Manchin has pointed out, there is a \nsolution, and there is funding available for this miner pension act. It \nis critically important that we act. It is critically important, \nmorally and economically. I would ask any of my colleagues to speak to \nany of these widows and explain why we wouldn't keep our end of the \nbargain when, come the end of this year, if we don't act, these health \ncare benefits will disappear. I hope we will act on this bipartisan \nlegislation. The Senator from Ohio has indicated it would pass this \nbody overwhelmingly.\n  I appreciate all of my colleagues' work. I see and turn the floor \nover to the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee. He doesn't \nhave a lot of coal in Oregon, but he understands that, when a \ncommitment is made--particularly a commitment that was initially made \nby the President of the United States, President Truman, back in 1946--\nthose commitments need to be honored. I look forward to continuing to \nwork with his leadership to get this legislation out of the Finance \nCommittee, get it to the floor of the Senate, get it passed, and make \nsure these miners' and their widows' health care pensions are honored.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Virginia, Senator \nCasey, Senator Brown, and Senator Manchin. They have been relentless in \nputting this issue of justice for the miners in front of the Finance \nCommittee.\n  Week after week, month after month, they have been saying: When is \nthis going to get done? When is the Congress--particularly the Senate--\ngoing to step up and meet the needs that these workers richly deserve \nto have addressed? We have had this documented again and again. I heard \nSenator Casey talk about it--how difficult this work is. We have had \nthat put in front of the Senate Finance Committee. Yet there has been \nno action.\n  Senator Warner is right--my home State of Oregon does not mine coal. \nWe do have a lot of communities with economies that over the years have \nbeen driven by natural resources. They have been up and down the boom-\nand-bust roller coaster. A lot of those communities are experiencing \nthe very same kind of economic pain you see in the mining towns Senator \nCasey and our colleagues represent.\n  You don't turn your backs on workers and retirees in these struggling \ncommunities, these struggling mining towns, just because the times are \ntough. These workers have earned their pensions. They have earned their \nhealth care benefits. But the fact is, if Congress does not act soon, \nall of this could be taken away.\n  There is a broader crisis in multi-employer pensions that I have \ntalked about on the floor and in the Finance Committee. Part of this \ncrisis goes back to a bad law that passed, over my opposition, in 2014. \nIt gave a green light to slashing benefits for retirees and multi-\nemployer pension plans. It said that it was OK to go back on the deal \ncompanies made with their workers and to take away benefits--benefits \npeople had earned through years of hard work. So there are a lot of \nseniors now walking an economic tightrope every day, and this law \nthreatens to make their lives even harder.\n  Now you have the mine workers' pensions--the pensions Senator Casey \nand colleagues have been talking about--in such immediate danger, there \nis enormous financial pressure being put on the Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation. That is because the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation is an economic backstop for millions of retirees. It \ninsures the pensions belonging to mine workers and more than 40 million \nAmericans. But the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation is in danger of \ninsolvency if the Congress doesn't step up and find a solution for the \ntroubles facing multi-employer pension plans. And fixing the mine \nworkers' pension plan is a critical component of any solution for the \nPension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's insurance program. If you don't \ncome up with a solution there, you are going to put in place a \nprescription for trouble for generations of retired workers across the \ncountry.\n  Senator Manchin has worked strenuously for this cause, reaching \nacross the aisle to Senator Capito. I mentioned my colleagues on the \nFinance Committee. There is now a bipartisan proposal ready to go to \nprotect retired mine workers' health benefits and bolster their pension \nplan. It would stave off the threat of financial ruin for more than \n100,000 workers and their families and would help safeguard the Pension \nBenefits Guaranty Corporation and the millions of Americans who count \non it to insure their livelihoods. We understand that if you want to do \nsomething important in the Senate, it has to be bipartisan, so we have \nreached out to the majority to find a way to advance this proposal.\n  The mine workers are not facing some imaginary policy deadline. Their \nlivelihoods are on the line. Their health care is on the line. The \neconomic security of entire communities is on the line. So it is time \nfor the Congress to step up.\n  I again thank my colleagues.\n  I wish to note that I have some additional remarks to make, and I am \ngoing to wait to give those remarks because I understand Senator \nHeitkamp, Senator Donnelly, and Senator Coats are going to go \nbeforehand. I see our friend from North Dakota on her feet.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, let me add my voice to those of my \ncolleagues who have come here to plead the case for mine workers and \nfor equity for widows, equity for people who have worked their entire \nlives with their hands and now have their future jeopardized by the \nlack of attention to this critical issue of their pensions.\n\n\n                              Student Debt\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to talk about another very important \nmiddle-class economic issue and one that we have been talking about \never since I got here; that is, the overwhelming burden of student \ndebt.\n  Earlier this week I spoke at Envision 2030 in Bismarck. It was a \nconvening of academic and political leaders in my State to discuss the \nneeds of students who will be embarking on and graduating from college \nin the next 15 years. Incredible amounts of time was spent on college \naffordability. I challenged many of the education leaders to take a \nlook at what it is going to take to reduce costs so that students do \nnot have to borrow so much money as they are pursuing their higher \neducation opportunities.\n\n[[Page S3161]]\n\n  Like the rest of the country, North Dakota's students are getting \nbogged down in debt before they even graduate from college. This debt \nimpacts their futures, their families, and their communities.\n  I would argue that this debt is endangering the economic viability of \nour country. According to the Institute for College Access and Success, \nthe average amount of student debt a person in North Dakota owes has \nnow risen above $27,000. North Dakota students have some of the highest \nrates of indebtedness in the country, as 83 percent of the class of \n2011 graduated with some form of debt. That is more than any other \nState in the country for that year.\n  Across the country, these statistics paint a bleak picture. I want to \npoint that out as we are looking at debt and what debt can do to an \neconomy. Certainly, we talk a lot about the debt we have in this \ncountry. If you take a look at this chart, you will understand that \nthis peak in debt here is really right after the debt crisis. There was \nrising consumer debt in credit cards. Here is student loans. This is \nmortgage debt, obviously, at a peak. This is auto loan debt.\n  Notice this: Everything went down and has come down in terms of \ndebt--percentage of balance that is 90 days or more delinquent--except \none category, and that is student loan debt.\n  We like to tell the story honestly. These people who have credit card \ndebt and mortgage debt are not deadbeats; they want to pay their \nobligations. These students also want to pay, but they are finding it \nvirtually impossible to pay this amount of student debt with the lack \nof economic opportunities and with the rising number of challenges they \nhave in meeting these obligations.\n  A lot of people think: Well, this is just a problem for kids in their \ntwenties. That is not going to be a problem. They will work their way \nthrough it. That opportunity will be available to them.\n  Take a look at this. If you go back to 2004, 42 percent of everybody \nimpacted was in their twenties, and now it is 32 percent. That growing \nimpact goes not only into your thirties but also into your forties, and \nwe have the highest percentage increase, probably, in the number of \npeople 60 and older who are burdened by student debt.\n  This chart tells an incredible story of the burden all of this \nstudent debt is having on the economy. Well, what do we do about it? I \nhave signed on many pieces of legislation here that would do one simple \nthing: It would help refinance this student debt.\n  We have record-low interest rates in this country. We have never \nbefore seen the continuity and consistency of low interest rates. \nAmazing. If you have a high interest rate and you have a car loan, you \nrefinance it. If you have a high interest rate and you have a home, you \nrefinance your mortgage. But can you refinance your student debt? You \nwill never take advantage of this.\n  Well, in North Dakota we have an institution called the Bank of North \nDakota. It might shock people here, given the kind of attitude I see \ntoward the Export-Import Bank, but the Bank of North Dakota is owned by \nthe people of the State of North Dakota. About a third of their capital \nis invested in students. It is an opportunity to develop our State. We \nmake home mortgage loans. We make beginning-farmer loans. We \nparticipate with local banks in economic development loans. We have \nsome great economic development programs at the Bank of North Dakota.\n  I am still in the ``we'' mode because when I was attorney general, I \nused to serve on their board of directors. Senator Hoeven ran the Bank \nof North Dakota. It is an amazing institution.\n  When we find our citizens crippled with debt, what do we do? We try \nto figure out how to help them. We don't say: We are going to make more \nmoney on you by keeping our interest rates at 6.8 percent and not \nletting you refinance. We say: You know what, that is not helpful to \nour economy.\n  Let me tell you about the results of the consolidation program the \nBank of North Dakota runs. First of all, there are qualifiers. The \nfirst qualifier is that you have to be a U.S. citizen. You can't be \nattending school any longer. You must have been a North Dakota resident \nfor 6 months. And if this gets out, we may see a flood of young people \ncoming to our State. You must meet Bank of North Dakota credit criteria \nor have a creditworthy cosigner.\n  Your loan options are any student loan that you have or your parents \nhave or your grandparents have can be consolidated into this program. \nWe will take Stafford; Perkins; parent loans for undergraduate \nstudents, which is called PLUS in North Dakota; Grad PLUS in North \nDakota; and DEAL, which is another student loan program that they run \nat the Bank of North Dakota; and any private lending from any other \ninstitution.\n  What do we do? We consolidate all of that debt and refinance it into \nlower interest rates and offer people a number of different packages.\n  Let me tell you what the consequences are. Let's take a look at \nsomeone who is in a student loan program that charges 6.8 percent per \nannum for that student debt. If you have a loan amount of $35,000 at \n6.8 percent and your repayment term is 300 months--think about that, \n300 months. What is that in terms of a lifetime? That is a lot of \nmonths for a lifetime. Your monthly payment is $242 or almost $243. The \ntotal interest you will pay traditionally, without consolidation and \nwithout refinancing, is about $38,000.\n  Under this refinancing program, you can do it one of two ways: You \ncan refinance on a fixed rate or you can refinance on a variable rate.\n  You may say: Oh, variable rates--isn't that what has gotten so many \nconsumers in trouble?\n  What the bank does is they say you can only raise the rate 1 percent \na year under the variable rate and you are capped at 10 percent. So you \nwill never pay more than 10 percent. Or you can opt to lock in at our \nfixed rate, which at the time this chart was done was 4.71 percent. If \nyou use the variable rate, you can lock in at just slightly above 2 \npercent.\n  Let's take those same payment terms--300 months. Your monthly \npayments for the Deal One fixed rate would be less than $200, compared \nalmost to $250. Your total interest paid would be $13,000 less over the \nlifetime of that loan. If you go with the variable rate, assuming we \ndon't see a dramatic increase in interest rates, you will pay $150 a \nmonth. It is almost $100 less. The total interest you will pay at these \nlow rates is $10,000, compared to $37,000. Think about that. Think \nabout what that means to a family.\n  If we take this even further and we speed up payments under the DEAL \nProgram--let's try to do this in less months because no one wants to be \nlocked in for 300 months of their life. If you look at going to a fixed \nrate for 157 months, you can greatly reduce your overall interest paid \nto about $12,000. Your monthly payment would be $300, and the total \namount you will pay--let's compare that to the fixed rate going to 300 \nmonths; you pay almost $60,000. If you go to a shorter period of time, \nalmost cut that time in half and increase your payments to $300 a \nmonth, you will only pay $47,000 on a $35,000 loan going with the fixed \nrate we currently have. If you go with variable, assuming the interest \nrates stay low, a $35,000 variable loan amount gets you down to just \nunder $40,000.\n  Why can't we do this for every student in America? When I hear that \nthe solution to the student debt problem is that we ought to limit the \namount of repayment to 15 percent or we ought to forgive it after so \nmany years, I don't think that is a solution for a lot of good North \nDakotans who want to repay their debt. But to simply say we will not \nconsolidate, we will not give an opportunity for students to take \nadvantage of low interest rates is incredibly irresponsible. It is tone \ndeaf to the impact that it has on whether we can start a new business, \nwhether we can get a mortgage for a home, whether we can buy a car, \nwhether we can save for our retirement so we don't have pension \nproblems in the future, and whether we can save for our kids' college \neducation.\n\n  Why aren't we doing this? Someone answer that question for me. If we \ncan make this for students in the State of North Dakota, why can't we \nmake this happen for students all across this country? That is the \nquestion I have come to ask because I think a lot of people talk about \nthe ideas of restructuring student debt and what we can do\n\n[[Page S3162]]\n\nto help students, and a lot of it is about debt forgiveness. You know \nwhat. I think people want to pay their debt in America. If they signed \na piece of paper that says they will repay it, they want to repay it. \nLet's give them a chance to do that without continuing to mortgage \ntheir future and make them slaves to student debt.\n  I have a personal story. My niece and her husband were able to use \nthis program. They continued to pay the same amount as they were paying \nwhen they had four or five different loans and they consolidated. They \nare spending the same amount on their student loan, and guess what. \nThey have cut the time for payment of their student debt in half. They \nare now able to save for their children's future and college education.\n  People say it can't be done. You bet it can be done. We are doing it \nin North Dakota, and if we can do it in North Dakota, we can do it in \nthis country. Let's step up and recognize this for the economic problem \nthat is not just for families but for this country, and let's do \nsomething. Let's quit talking about student debt and actually do \nsomething about that.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/senate-section/article/S3135-2"}, {"day": "25", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3162-S3163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RECOGNIZING THE 100TH RUNNING OF THE INDIANAPOLIS 500 MILE RACE\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am on the floor with my colleague from \nIndiana Senator Donnelly to talk about something that is very special \nto the State of Indiana which happens to be coming up this weekend. On \nSunday, May 29, the 100th running of the Indianapolis 500, the greatest \nspectacle in racing, will take place in the town of Speedway, IN, a \nsmall town within the confines of the borders of Indianapolis.\n  The Indianapolis 500-mile race is the largest single-day sporting \nevent in the world. It is almost staggering to think about this small \ntown of Speedway, IN, hosting 350,000 fans this year. It is a \nlogistical challenge that the city and security people have met year \nafter year. It is something to see.\n  Since the first race in 1911, race fans from around the world have \npacked the grandstands and the speedway's expansive infield to enjoy \nthe race and take in the experience of being at one of the world's most \nfamous motor sports events.\n  I can't begin to describe the dimension of a 2\\1/2\\-mile track and \nthe infield. There is a golf course--and a significant part of it is in \nthe infield--that only takes up part of that infield. The 2\\1/2\\-mile \ntrack, with 350,000 people, is a spectacle you will not see anywhere \nelse.\n  For those of us who are from Indiana, the Indy 500 is a celebration \nof our State, and along with basketball, is what it means to be a \nHoosier. Timeless traditions, like the singing of ``Back Home Again in \nIndiana,'' are embedded into the fabric of Hoosier culture. When the \nannouncer says the phrase ``Gentlemen, start your engines,'' as was \nsaid for many years, 33 cars' engines start to roar to the cheers of \nthe crowd. Today that same phrase is now ``Gentlemen and ladies, start \nyour engines'' because the race has brought women to the track to also \nrace.\n  Thirty-three cars start the pace laps, and off the third or fourth \npace lap, as the pace car races down the straightaway and pulls aside, \n33 cars come roaring around the fourth turn and hurtling down the home \nstretch at over 200 miles per hour to plunge into the first turn while \n350,000 people stand there holding their breath, maybe saying a prayer, \nand saying: How in the world can those 33 cars at 200 miles an hour \npile into that very small banked first turn without cataclysmic \nconsequences? But they do it, and it is a testament to the agility of \nthe drivers and the technology that has been incorporated into the \ncars. It is something to see.\n  The roots of all of this date back to 1909, when a group of \nbusinessmen, led by Hoosier entrepreneur Carl Fisher, purchased the 320 \nacre Pressley Farm--that is not Elvis Presley, by the way--just outside \nIndianapolis and began construction of the gravel-and-tar racetrack.\n  At that time, Indianapolis and Detroit were competing to be America's \nautomotive capital, and Fisher believed that a large speedway, where \nreliability and speed could be tested, would give Indianapolis an upper \nhand.\n  Fisher and other speedway founders hired a New York engineer and \nasked him to design a 2\\1/2\\-mile track with a banked corner, a unique \ndesign that still endures today. The first track surface proved to be \nsomewhat problematic so Fisher and his partners needed a way to pave \nit. They settled on bricks, and covering the 2\\1/2\\-mile oval required \nan astonishing 3.2 million bricks at a cost of $400,000, which was no \nsmall change back then. That is why it is called the brickyard.\n  As time wore on, bricks didn't become the ideal surface, and when the \ncurrent surface was put in place, we retained 1 yard of bricks at the \nfinish line. If you are watching the Indianapolis 500 on Sunday--and I \nknow all of these pages will be tuning into that spectacle after \nSenator Donnelly and I are through convincing you that this is \nsomething you really want to see--that yard of bricks is there and \nsymbolizes what that track has been.\n  With the bricks laid, about 80,000 spectators gathered around the \ntrack on Memorial Day weekend in 1911 for the inaugural Indianapolis \n500 race. They witnessed Ray Harroun win the race in his yellow No. 32 \nMarmon ``Wasp'' at an average speed of 74.6 miles an hour--about what \nSenator Donnelly and I try to drive when we are on the interstates in \nIndiana and going no faster than that so we don't get a speeding \nticket, which wouldn't help our careers.\n  Initially, the cars had two people. One was the driver and the other \nwas a mechanic. This is early on in 1911. We were still developing \ncars, and of course the impacts the car had to absorb going around a \ntar-and-gravel track caused many stops, so the mechanic would jump out, \nmake the fix, put on a new tire, and help with the fueling. Ray Harroun \nsurprised everybody by showing up without a mechanic. He was the only \nperson in the car. It was the first such instance that had happened. \nWhat they did see in the car was something they hadn't seen on any of \nthe other cars--a rearview mirror being used in an automobile. That is \nthe first instance that we know of that automobiles used a rearview \nmirror. Since that first race, the Indianapolis 500 has occurred on \nevery Memorial Day since 1911, with the exception of 1917 and 1918 when \nthe United States was involved in World War I, and there was an \nexception from 1942 to 1945 when the United States was involved in \nWorld War II.\n  When the soldiers came home after the war was over, they looked at \nthe track and it was in a state of despair. It simply was not ready to \nbe used. It had been neglected, understandably, through the war years \nand was broken down. At that time, the talk was let's close it down, \nbut Terre Haute, IN, native Tony Hulman purchased the Indianapolis \nMotor Speedway, and under his leadership the facility was restored and \nrebuilt.\n  Beginning in 1946 until today, the Indianapolis 500 restarted with \nmassive crowds and the event has only grown over time. In the decades \nsince, the speedway has been owned by the Hulman-George family and all \nrace fans are indebted to this family for their passion for Indy 500 \nand careful stewardship of the world's most famous racetrack.\n  As the years passed, the technology used at the Indianapolis Motor \nSpeedway has progressed and so has the speed. In 2013, Tony Kanaan set \nthe record for the fastest Indianapolis 500, winning the race in 2 \nhours 40 minutes, at an average speed of 187.4 miles per hour. Think \nabout that. Think of driving for 2 hours 40 minutes, at 187 miles per \nhour, including yellow lights, when everybody has to slow down \nsignificantly because of an accident on the track, a loose tire or \nsomething that causes the race to have to slow down, and the pit stops \nwhere they have to change the tires and fuel the cars--230 miles per \nhour is an extraordinary speed, and you have to run at that top speed \nalmost continuously while you are on the track in order to achieve that \n187-miles-per-hour record.\n  There is nothing like being there and seeing cars at that speed so \ndeftly handled by drivers in very difficult situations. The \nIndianapolis 500 is a showcase of ingenuity, human achievement,\n\n[[Page S3163]]\n\nand the continuous pursuit of racing immortality.\n  Racing legends like A.J. Foyt, Mario Andretti, Rick Mears, Al Unser, \nand Bobby Rahal have become synonymous with the Indianapolis 500. The \nrace is a source of great pride for all citizens of our State, and we \nare all very excited about the 100th running on Sunday.\n  I am pleased to be joined by my Indiana colleague Senator Donnelly in \nrecognizing--through a Senate resolution, which we will offering after \nSenator Donnelly speaks--the tremendous occasion of the 100th running \nof the Indianapolis 500.\n  I am more than happy to yield to my colleague, Senator Donnelly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague \nSenator Coats. He is truly an institution in our State.\n  I rise with Senator Coats to commemorate the 100th running of the \nIndianapolis 500. Think about that. What a long and storied history. \nThe Indy 500 is more than a Memorial Day weekend tradition, and it is \nmore than just a sporting event. It has a storied history, and the list \nof winners includes some of the most legendary drivers in motor racing \nhistory--names like Foyt, Mears, Unser, Andretti, and the legendary \nfamily who has been such good friends to our State and such good \nstewards of the track, the Hulman-George family.\n  The Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Indianapolis 500 are a sight to \nsee, with its iconic 2\\1/2\\-mile oval and the buzzing atmosphere \ncreated by hundreds of thousands of cheering fans. As my colleague and \ndear friend Senator Coats said, the singing of ``Back Home Again in \nIndiana,'' the winner drinking milk in victory lane, and raising the \nBorg-Warner trophy, this is defined by career-making victories as well \nas heartbreaking crashes and down-to-the-wire finishes.\n  The Indy 500 is more than just the greatest spectacle in racing. It \nis about a whole lot more than just that. It is about bringing people \nand families together. More than 300,000 people will come to watch the \nrace in the city of the speedway this weekend. It boosts local \nbusinesses and gives Central Indiana an opportunity to showcase \nourselves to the rest of the world.\n  Over its history, the Indy 500 has been part of the fabric of our \nHoosier State. It has endured through economic booms, depressions, and \ntimes of turmoil at home and abroad. Through it all, the Indy 500 has \nbecome one of the biggest sporting events in the world. It brings \ntogether people of all different backgrounds. As the race has grown, it \nhas drawn spectators from across the United States and from around the \nworld--diehard racing fanatics and casual fans alike. Donald Davidson, \nthe track historian, told the Indianapolis Star earlier this week:\n\n       There is nothing else like it. It just took off. There was \n     Christmas, there was Easter, and there was the Indianapolis \n     500.\n\n  It is a special event, unlike any other. I have had the privilege of \nattending the 500 many times, and I am looking forward to attending \nSunday's 100th running of the race. You can't help but be struck by the \ntalent of the drivers and the team.\n  Earlier this month, I visited the Andretti Autosport, where I saw \nfirsthand the craftsmanship and extensive preparations that go into \nbuilding a single Indy car for the Indy 500. They were building a \nnumber of them. The dedication and teamwork is remarkable. Each piece \nis an intricate creation, and the driver of each car has to have \ncomplete trust in the team that designed and built this car, before it \neven rolls onto the track. The team has to have that same confidence in \nthe driver, that he or she can bring that car into Victory Lane.\n  For thousands of Hoosier families and racing fans, the Indy 500 is a \ntime for creating lifelong memories. Joining together with friends and \nneighbors, the race is a chance to showcase the best in Hoosier \nhospitality and the best our State has to offer. To win the Indy 500, \none needs all of the things that we Hoosiers hold dear: determination, \nhard work, ingenuity, an unwillingness to give up in the face of \nadversity, and, sometimes, a little bit of luck.\n  To win you have to be able to overcome setbacks, get back up, dust \nyourself off, and put your nose back to the grindstone. That is the \nHoosier way.\n  I wish the best to our drivers, to the crews, and to the teams and \nowners competing in Sunday's 100th running of the Indy 500. May it be a \nsafe and competitive race. May God bless all those involved. God bless \nIndiana, and God bless America.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS.

Mr. President, I have waited to give this speech for \nweeks, waited for the rhetoric to die down after the untimely and \nunexpected passing of Justice Scalia, and waited to speak about the sad \nstate of affairs out of a hope that no more words would be necessary \nbefore this Senate acted.\n  It was my fervent hope that the initial reaction to Justice Scalia's \ndeath was due to the shock and the grief at the loss of a conservative \nicon.\n  I, like many of my colleagues, were publicly mourning the loss, and I \nassumed that my colleagues were simultaneously realizing that after \ndecades of trending to the right, it was now more than likely that the \nSupreme Court was going to shift back to a more centrist, progressive \npoint of view.\n  But now it appears that the Senate has descended into an ``Alice in \nWonderland'' world where the Senate cannot even agree on how many \nSupreme Court Justices make the Court functional. Throughout our \nhistory, in the Senate there have been previous attempts to attack the \nCourt by, on the one hand, denying it members, or, on the other hand, \npacking the Court. In those instances, this once august body has stood \ntogether and always protected the sanctity of the Court--but not today.\n  The Senate is not only displaying contempt for the Court, but it is \ndemonstrating contempt of its constitutional responsibilities. It is \nhard for the people we are honored to represent to make sense out of \nmuch of what goes on here--who serves on the subcommittee that always \nsounds like the subcommittee on acoustics and ventilation, what a \nmotion to table the amendment to the amendment to the amendment \nactually means--but this is an issue the American people get.\n  We know there are supposed to be nine Supreme Court Justices and the \nSenate ought to do its job and ensure that the Court can function \nwithout wasting years of people's lives and dollars by allowing cases \nto be undecided through deadlock.\n  I can state that I am going to be home this weekend for townhall \nmeetings. At these townhall meetings, I hear from citizens who are \nexasperated.\n\n[[Page S3164]]\n\nThey tell me this in the grocery store, in the gym, and in other places \nwhere Oregonians gather. They cannot understand how a U.S. Senator can \nignore the responsibility to advise on a Supreme Court nominee and \nremain true to his or her oath.\n  Here is what Oregonians know for sure. They understand that the \nPresident of the United States is elected to a 4-year term, not a 3-\nyear term and some number of days--4 years. We learn it in the first \nquarter of high school civics class. Oregonians and Americans \nunderstand that it is the President's job during that 4-year term to \nfill vacancies on the Court, and Oregonians understand that it is the \nSenate's job to advise and consent on the nomination by holding \nhearings and then having an up-or-down vote.\n  The President has fulfilled his duty. The Senate is utterly failing \nits responsibility. We have a nominee--an eminently well-qualified \nnominee. Our President pro tempore in the Senate, who is widely \nrespected, called him ``highly qualified'' and described him this way:\n\n       His intelligence and his scholarship cannot be questioned. \n     . . . His legal experience is equally impressive. . . . \n     Accordingly, I believe Mr. Garland is a fine nominee. I know \n     him personally, I know of his integrity, I know of his legal \n     ability, I know of his honesty, I know of his acumen, and he \n     belongs on the Court. I believe he is not only a fine \n     nominee, but is as good as Republicans can expect from this \n     administration. In fact, I would place him at the top of the \n     list.\n\n  Those are the exact words of our President pro tempore with respect \nto this nominee.\n  The then-chairman of the Judiciary Committee called him ``well \nqualified,'' even though he objected to bringing the Court he was being \nappointed to up to its full complement of Justices.\n  But despite having a fully qualified judge vetted and praised by many \nof their colleagues, this intemperate rhetoric about blocking the Court \nhas now solidified into an indefensible position. That is why after \nwaiting for weeks, I am on the floor this evening.\n  The first blow is now well known and often quoted. The majority \nleader said:\n\n       The American people should have a voice in the selection of \n     their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy \n     should not be filled until we have a new President.\n\n  This was said at a time when other officials were releasing \nstatements offering condolences to the Justice's family, which includes \n26 grandchildren.\n  In some respects this reaction should have been expected. When \nPresident Obama took office, it seemed that the goal of some was to \noppose anything he did, however reasonable. Senators such as myself who \nhave been here long enough to see the ebbs and flows of the Senate \nfigured that this stance was probably just a temporary slump. Senators \nput in long hours and travel endlessly to make a difference on issues \nthat are important to them and to their States. Even if the solemn \nresponsibility and constitutional duty with which they are entrusted \nweren't enough to encourage action in this serious situation, it would \nseem, for the sake of our country and our people, that many here hoped \nthis body would find its way back again.\n  Unfortunately, that has not been the case. So the majority leader's \nresponse to the death of Justice Scalia becomes yet another example of \nthe scorched-Earth approach to politics the far-right has taken since \nthe very beginning of the Obama Presidency. It is a sad and unworthy \nresponse to Americans who expressed their will at the ballot box.\n  Many Americans list choosing a Supreme Court Justice as one of their \nleading reasons for choosing a Presidential candidate. Sometimes--many \ntimes--this is given as the most significant reason for voting for a \nPresident. In the last Presidential election, the American people chose \nBarack Obama as the duly elected President of the United States. I \nstate this because, for many of my colleagues, that fact somehow seems \nto have just vanished from their minds, or perhaps there is just a \nrefusal to recognize the results of the 2012 election. Americans chose \nPresident Obama to be the Commander in Chief, to administer the laws, \nand, yes, to appoint a new Supreme Court Justice for any vacancies that \noccur between January 20, 2013, and January 20, 2017. The unanimous \nposition or near unanimous position of the majority is that elections \ndon't really seem to matter, that the rule of force becomes the rule of \nlaw, and saying ``no, we will not'' is an acceptable response for being \nasked to fulfill constitutional responsibilities. Basically, this \nposition disenfranchises the constitutionally ratified choice of more \nthan 65 million Americans because the majority in the Senate simply \ndoesn't agree with them.\n  This is not a response worthy of U.S. Senators. It is choosing party \nand ideology over the needs of our country, and it is a political \nchoice that many of my colleagues are beginning to understand they \ncannot support.\n  My colleagues have said: It is not the position; it is the principle. \nBut this is a position without principle. It is really pure politics--\npure politics of the worst kind. It calls into question whether \nperpetrators can effectively do their jobs as Senators going forward.\n  Today the Senate, this venerable institution, continues to find \nitself in the hands of the most insidious form of politics--small ``p'' \npolitics. It is the kind of politics that seems just devoid of reason, \nrevolving around what seems to most Americans to be a truly \nstraightforward portion of the Constitution.\n  Article II, section 2, paragraph 2, of the Constitution states:\n\n       [The President] shall have Power, by and with the Advice \n     and Consent of the Senate, to . . . nominate, and by and with \n     the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . \n     Judges of the Supreme Court. . . .\n\n  Now, I am a lawyer in name only. I don't profess to be a \nconstitutional scholar. But at this point, I am one of the longer \nserving Members of the Senate, and I have placed a special priority on \nworking with colleagues across the aisle, trying to find common ground, \nrecognizing that the Senate is at its best when colleagues work \ntogether. But to my mind, the current approach taken by the majority \ntoward the President's duty to nominate a Supreme Court Justice and the \nduty the Senate has to advise and consent on the nominee has led this \nSenate to an unprecedented and dangerous situation. It seems to me that \nby denying Judge Garland a hearing, we are denied the opportunity to \nask the nominee questions to which the American people are owed \nanswers.\n\n  The current position of refusing to ask those questions and hear \nthose answers is an insult to our form of government, one understood by \noriginalists, strict constructionists, and liberal interpreters alike. \nThe Senate's decline has been particularly vivid in the case of \njudicial appointments. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia is the primary judicial forum for appeals of Executive and \nregulatory actions prior to the Supreme Court. As such, it has become \nthe focus of ideologues who oppose environmental regulations, consumer \nregulation, anti-trust, and many other hallmarks of our system of \ngovernment for the past century.\n  When three vacancies opened on this court and Presidential \nappointments were made, Senate Republicans proceeded to filibuster each \nand every one of those nominees, claiming--in my view ridiculously--\nthat the President was engaged in ``court packing.''\n  Now, in the interest of fairness, court packing is the reprehensible \ncourse of action chosen by a liberal icon, President Franklin D. \nRoosevelt, when faced with a court that opposed his will. That attempt \nwas a dangerous time for our constitutional system of checks and \nbalances and must be remembered, lest it be repeated.\n  Not only was it dishonest to apply this term to the regular process \nof filling existing vacancies, the accusers were, in fact, attempting \nto accomplish FDR's same goal of bending a Federal court to their will \nin a blatant attack on our system of checks and balances.\n  Today, we are witnessing another attack on the Constitution in this \nrefusal to do our job and proceed to the confirmation process for Judge \nGarland.\n  This is a grave assessment, and maybe I am being a bit too harsh to \ncolleagues in laying their refusal to duty on purely political grounds. \nSo I want to just take a couple of minutes to unpack some of the \njustifications that have been given for what we have heard. Some \nMembers have argued there is a longstanding tradition that the Senate \ndoes not fill a Supreme Court vacancy during a Presidential election \nyear. This has been referred to as an ``80-year precedent'' and as \n``standard practice.''\n\n[[Page S3165]]\n\n  Unfortunately, that turns out not to be the case. There is no such \nprecedent. Or, I would say, there is no such precedent unless you \ndefine your terms so narrowly that the concept of precedent becomes \nmeaningless. This can be contrived, for example, by limiting the \ndiscussion to nominations made during a Presidential election year \nrather than nominations considered during a Presidential election year.\n  However, that is like saying: We never previously filled a Supreme \nCourt vacancy in a year in which Leonardo DiCaprio won an Oscar and \nDenver won the Super Bowl. This is true enough, but it covers such a \nsmall set of cases that it provides no meaningful guidance. If \nanything, the relevant historical precedent favors the Senate \nconsidering a nomination to fill the current vacancy.\n  Since 1912, the Senate has considered seven Supreme Court nominations \nduring Presidential elections. Six of the nominations were confirmed: \nMahlon Pitney in 1912; Louis Brandeis and John H. Clarke in 1916; \nBenjamin Cardozo in 1932; Frank Murphy in 1940; and the most recent \nexample, Anthony Kennedy in 1988, who was nominated by President Reagan \nand confirmed unanimously by a Senate in which Democrats held the \nmajority.\n  In one other case, that of Abe Fortas in 1968, the nomination was \nrejected in an election year. However, even then, the Senate did its \njob. It held hearings, reported the nomination from committee, voted on \nwhether to invoke cloture on the nomination on the Senate floor.\n  In the face of this historical record, some Senators have argued \nanother point. They have invoked the so-called Biden rule, based on a \nspeech that Vice President Biden gave on the Senate floor in 1992 when \nhe was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In that speech, \naccording to some Members, Senator Biden established a binding rule \nthat the Senate should never consider Supreme Court nominations during \nPresidential election years.\n  First, as discussed above, there is no such thing as a binding Senate \nrule. We make them. We break them. We change them. It is the \nflexibility of this institution that has allowed it to continue to \nserve Americans for 225 years and the current inflexibility of my \ncolleagues that threatens to bring it to harm.\n  Now, let's look at Senator Biden's 1992 comments in perspective. He \ngave a speech, perhaps intemperate, but in 1988, as I just described, \nhe led the Senate in confirming Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n  Further, in 1987 and 1991, when Presidents Reagan and Bush submitted \nthe highly controversial nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence \nThomas, the Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by then-Senator Biden, \nheld hearings on the nominations and took them to the floor for up-or-\ndown votes. So when Senator Biden chaired the Judiciary Committee, he \nalways provided a Republican President's Supreme Court nominees with a \nhearing, a vote in committee, and a vote on the Senate floor.\n  It is also important to consider the overall point that Senator Biden \nwas making in 1992. The Supreme Court was about to adjourn, which is a \ntime when Justices frequently announce their retirement. Senator Biden \nwas arguing that there should not be a trumped-up retirement, designed \nto create a vacancy for which the President would submit an \nideologically extreme nominee as ``part of a campaign to make the \nSupreme Court an agent of an ultra right conservative social agenda \nwhich would lack support in the Congress and the country.''\n  Senator Biden was arguing against partisanship. He was counseling \nrestraint. He said that ``so long as the public continues to split its \nconfidence between branches, compromise is the responsible course both \nfor the White House and for the Senate.''\n  Noting his support of the nominee, though nominated by an opposing \nPresident, Senator Biden was urging both sides to step back from \npartisan ideological warfare. Senator Biden urged Congress to develop a \nnomination confirmation process that reflected divided government by \ndelivering a moderate, well-respected nominee who would be subject to a \nreasonable, dignified nomination process.\n  Senator Biden went on to say, ``If the President consults and \ncooperates with the Senate or moderates his selections absent \nconsultation, then his nominees may enjoy my support, just as did \nJustices Kennedy and Souter.''\n  That is precisely the approach that President Obama is following \nhere--moderating his selection. In nominating Judge Garland, the \nPresident has not politicized the process. The President has not \nnominated some left-wing ideologue who thrills progressives but angers \nconservatives. You already heard what I quoted directly from our \nesteemed friend, the President pro tempore of the Senate, Senator \nHatch. The President has gone to the middle, seeking compromise. He has \nnominated someone who is widely regarded as sound and moderate and \ncapable. Indeed, not long ago, leading Republican Senators cited Judge \nGarland as the very example of the type of person they were hoping the \nPresident would nominate.\n  Judge Garland is the kind of person about whom my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle said: This is the kind of person we would \nreally like to see for this job.\n  Now, there have been other attempts to defend the indefensible, and \nthey all go back to the facts that I have just outlined. No matter the \npolitics, no matter your concern about a primary challenge from the \nright, no matter the faint hope that a Member of your party might win \nthe White House and nominate an ideological kindred spirit, no matter \nthe pressure to choose party over country, it is time to do our \nconstitutional duty, hold hearings, ask questions, get answers, and \nvote on the nominee.\n  Perhaps, as with Abe Fortas, the nominee will be rejected. If that is \nthe Senate's will, so be it. But denying a duly nominated candidate a \nresponsible and dignified confirmation process is choosing to further \nendanger the people we serve and the body that we serve in.\n  Finally, every Republican Member must know that having a meeting or \ncalling for hearings and a vote without taking any action to make it so \nis pretty much naked politics, and Americans are not going to be \nfooled. If Members of the majority actually wish to see the Senate do \nits job, they can force the Senate to make it happen by denying the \nleadership the ability to act on other less pressing matters until they \ntake up this responsibility.\n  To go home and claim that you would like hearings--that you would \nlike a vote--without taking action to make it happen is simply lip \nservice to the constitutional responsibility of a Senator.\n  I am going to close with just a couple of last thoughts. My \ncolleagues have the opportunity to redeem this body. My colleagues have \nrepeatedly said: It is not the position; it is the principle. But it \nwas understood during FDR's time, and it should be understood now, that \nthreatening the makeup of the Supreme Court is a position without \nprinciple.\n  Intemperance appears to be the hallmark of political rhetoric in this \nday. Somehow, if it is loud and intemperate, that is what people are \ngoing to pay attention to. But this sort of intemperate rhetoric is \ncertainly corrosive to this institution.\n  The Senate still has an opportunity to sober up, regardless of what \nwas said, buckle down, get to work, hold hearings, and vote on a \nnominee. Political rhetoric can be forgiven. Allowing intemperate \nrhetoric to control the solemn responsibility of every Senator is \nunforgivable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the National \nDefense Authorization Act of 2017, or the NDAA. This bill was reported \nout of committee 2 weeks ago with 100 percent support from our friends \nacross the aisle and nearly unanimous support from the majority party.\n  I am thankful for the leadership of Chairman McCain and Ranking \nMember Reed. I think they have done a marvelous job. These are two \nveterans who have served their country well before becoming Members of \nthis body. As Members of this body, they have worked very hard to find \nconsensus between Republicans and Democrats with regard to how we work \nto prepare an authorization bill for funding for our military.\n\n[[Page S3166]]\n\n  The reason I am here today is I think it is important to share my \nthoughts about the need to move forward with a discussion of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act on the floor of the Senate in an \nappropriate timeframe.\n  For those individuals who wonder how the Senate works, sometimes we \nfind it frustrating because we would like to move on. And as my friend \nthe Senator from Oregon just indicated, they would like to have votes. \nIn this particular case, he was suggesting a vote on the Supreme Court, \nbut on that one there are challenges and there are concerns on the part \nof Members of the majority party.\n  But in the case of the National Defense Authorization Act, this is \none which has been passed out of the Senate, passed by the House, and \nsigned by the President for 54 years in a row. It is a bipartisan work \neffort. It is one in which we have agreement; we find consensus. It \nseems only appropriate that we try to move forward on this particular \nbill before Memorial Day, the day in which we honor those individuals \nwho have given the ultimate sacrifice.\n  Let me share with you what we understand has happened. I understand \nthat when the majority leader had asked for a unanimous offer or an \nagreement that we take up this bill early--take it up and begin to \ndebate it; not pass it, but debate it and accept amendments to this \nparticular bill about how to appropriately direct our military for the \ncoming year--the minority leader objected, which is his right, and said \nhe would not allow us to move forward, even to debate the bill.\n  In fact, we had to file what they call cloture or a closure of the \ntime with a 30-hour period, which we are in right now, before we can \neven take up the bill. That seems inappropriate. At least to me, it \nseems that if we really wanted to show we honor those individuals--and \nwe talk about the memory of those who lost their lives serving our \ncountry--the least we could do would be to move forward with this \nparticular one in some sort of a united effort since there does not \nappear to be anything that is of a challenge in passing the bill.\n  I think about Memorial Day because I lost an uncle. As a matter of \nfact, I am named for him. My name is Marion Michael. I go by Mike, but \nI was named for an uncle who died in World War II on the island of \nOkinawa in May of 1945. He never had a chance to vote, never had a \nchance to have a family. My family lost something. He lost his life, \nbut we lost an uncle, a brother.\n  This is the time period in which we remember what these folks--these \nsoldiers, sailors, and warriors--have given to our country. It seems \nappropriate that this would have been a great time to make an example \nof our working together. That sense of sacrifice didn't stop in World \nWar II; it continues on.\n  I had the opportunity, the privilege, to work as Governor of South \nDakota during the time in which we were sending young men and women off \nto wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. I remember one time in particular that \nwas an example of the generations supporting our country. It happened \nto be with a mobilization ceremony in the little town of Redfield. When \nwe send young men and women off in South Dakota, we have a mobilization \nceremony that is attended by literally the entire town. In this case it \nwas the 147th Field Artillery, 2nd Battalion. I was working as Governor \nat the time, and when we came into this town, we went to the high \nschool gymnasium. You couldn't park win three blocks of that gymnasium \nbecause it was filled.\n  When we walked inside, there were people everywhere. They were even \nsitting on the window sills because there were a little over 105 \nsoldiers who were being deployed, and they were going to Iraq.\n  I remember it specifically because as we finished the ceremonies for \ndeployment in this packed crowd, we went down the line, and we started \nthanking each soldier for their service. I walked through the line \nsaying: Thank you. We appreciate your service. Be careful. Come back \nsafely.\n  I looked at one of the soldiers and looked at his last name. He was \ngray haired, clearly he was a sergeant, and he was one of the leaders. \nI said: Thank you for your service. Do your job, but bring these guys \nhome safely.\n  He said: Yes, sir.\n  The next man in line--I looked at his name, and it was the same name \nas the individual ahead of him. I looked at him and I said: Is that \nyour dad?\n  He said: No, sir, that is my uncle. My dad is behind me.\n  Three generations, three separate members of the same family were \nserving in the 147th, three of them offering their own and their \nfamilies' time to support our country. I don't know whether they were \nRepublican or Democrat. All I know is that they were wearing the \nuniform of the United States of America.\n  Sometimes, as we talk about what we do, we have to remind ourselves \nthat when these young men and women deploy, they are not deploying as \nRepublicans or Democrats. They really don't care about how we see the \nprogression of the votes that we take here. What they look at is \nwhether or not we are united as Americans.\n  This would be a very appropriate time for the minority leader to \nperhaps consider giving back some of the time that he is holding for \ndebate on this bill to begin. Let's begin the debate on this bill \nbefore we leave for Memorial Day. Let's begin the process of letting \nthese families know that this is important to us, too, and that we \nunderstand the significance of Memorial Day.\n  For that particular family I talked about in Redfield, this is \nespecially important this year because that young man came back and \ncarried the Cross of War with him. They lost him earlier this year. \nThis year, Memorial Day means a little bit more.\n  What I would ask today is that we send a message to all of the men \nand women who wear the uniform. Politics is gone. We will debate the \nbill, we will spend time on the bill, we will make it better, but we \nwill not hold it hostage. We will do what they want us to do as \nAmericans protecting our country and honoring the memory of those who \nhave given everything in defense of our country.\n  This is the time to vote--to vote for those who died before they ever \nhad a chance to vote. This is a chance to share our strong belief that \nwhen it comes to the defense of our country, we are Americans first, \nRepublicans and Democrats last.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                    Water Resources Development Act\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, tonight I rise to speak about the pressing \nneed to invest in our aging infrastructure across this great country, \nespecially drinking water infrastructure.\n  What makes the ongoing crisis in Flint so tragic is that it was \npreventable. Steps could have and should have been taken over months \nand even years that would have prevented the poisoning of the citizens \nof Flint. Because these steps were not taken, efforts to mitigate the \neffects of lead exposure and repair the damage will be necessary for \nmany years to come.\n  Our drinking water supply is largely dependent on systems built \ndecades ago that are now deteriorating. Many of the pipes in some of \nour older cities were installed before World War II, and many are made \nof lead. The EPA estimates about 10 million homes and buildings are \nserviced with lead lines.\n  The American Water Works Association has said that we are entering \n``the replacement era.'' Water systems are reaching the end of their \nlifespan, and we must replace them. We have no choice.\n  If we want to simply maintain our current levels of water service, \nexperts estimate a cost of at least $1 trillion over the next two \ndecades. That is why it is so important that we pass a new Water \nResources Development Act, or WRDA. We now have the opportunity and the \nability to dedicate resources to Flint and to communities dealing with \ninfrastructure challenges all across our country.\n  The Environment and Public Works Committee listened to water experts, \nState and local elected officials, and the shipping industry, as well \nas stakeholders, to craft a WRDA bill that makes crucial infrastructure \ninvestments in drinking and wastewater projects as well as our ports \nand our waterways.\n  My friend Senator Debbie Stabenow and I were proud to work with \nSenator Jim Inhofe and Senator Barbara Boxer to include bipartisan \nmeasures that would include emergency aid to\n\n[[Page S3167]]\n\naddress the contamination crisis in Flint and provide assistance to our \ncommunities across our country facing similar infrastructure \nchallenges.\n  The Flint aid package included in the bipartisan WRDA bill includes \ndirect funding for water infrastructure emergencies and critical \nfunding for programs to combat the health complications from lead \nexposure. This includes a drinking water lead exposure registry and a \nlead exposure advisory committee to track and address long-term health \neffects.\n  Additionally, funding for national childhood health efforts, such as \nthe childhood lead prevention poisoning program, would be increased in \nthis bill.\n  The Water Resources Development Act also includes funding for secured \nloans through the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, or \nWIFIA program. This financing mechanism was created by Congress in 2014 \nin a bipartisan effort to provide low-interest financing for large-\nscale water infrastructure projects. These loans will be available to \nStates and municipalities all across our country.\n  There are also a number of other important provisions in this year's \nWRDA bill. It promotes restoration of our great lakes and great waters, \nwhich include ecosystems such as the Great Lakes, Puget Sound, \nChesapeake Bay, and many more.\n  In fact, the bill includes an authorization of the Great Lakes \nRestoration Initiative through the year 2021, which has been absolutely \nessential to Great Lakes cleanup efforts in recent years. It is \nimportant to know that the Great Lakes provide drinking water for over \n40 million people.\n  The WRDA bill also will modernize our ports, improve the condition of \nour harbors and waterways, and keep our economy moving.\n  A saying attributed to Benjamin Franklin rings especially true with \nthis WRDA bill. He said: ``An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of \ncure.'' If we make the necessary infrastructure investments now, we \nwill preserve clean water, save taxpayer money in the long run, and \nprotect American families from the dangerous health impacts of aging \nlead pipes.\n  The Environment and Public Works Committee passed the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act with strong, overwhelming bipartisan support last \nmonth. This bill is ready for consideration by the full Senate, and \ncommunities across our country--including the families of Flint--are \nwaiting for us to act.\n  I am hopeful that this body will do just that in the coming weeks, \nand I urge my colleagues to prioritize this commonsense, bipartisan \ninfrastructure bill for a vote on the Senate floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/senate-section/article/S3163-1"}, {"day": "25", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ROUNDS.

Mr. President, nearly 150 years ago, Congress determined \nthat a fully functioning Supreme Court should consist of nine Justices. \nFor more than 100 days, however, the Supreme Court has been unable to \noperate at full strength as a result of unprecedented obstruction by \nSenate Republicans. Under Republican leadership, the Senate is on track \nto be in session for the fewest days since 1956. Senate Republicans \nsimply refuse to do their jobs. If Senate Republican leadership has its \nway, this seat on the Supreme Court will remain unnecessarily vacant \nfor more than a year.\n  President Obama nominated Chief Judge Merrick Garland 70 days ago. \nBased on the timing of the Senate's consideration of Supreme Court \nnominees over the past four decades, Chief Judge Garland should be \nreceiving a confirmation vote on the Senate floor today. Instead, \nRepublican Senators are discussing a hypothetical list of nominees \nissued by their presumptive nominee for President.\n  Senate Republicans should be responsible enough to address the real \nvacancy on the Supreme Court that is right now keeping the Court from \noperating at full strength. Chief Judge Garland has received bipartisan \nsupport in the past, and there is no reason other than partisan \npolitics to deny him the same process the Senate has provided Supreme \nCourt nominees for the last 100 years. The chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee recently suggested we put down on paper how the Senate treats \nSupreme Court nominees. I did just that with Senator Hatch in 2001 when \nwe memorialized the longstanding Judiciary Committee practice that \nSupreme Court nominees receive a hearing and a vote, even in instances \nwhen a majority of the Judiciary Committee did not support the nominee. \nThe chairman and all Republicans should go back to that letter to use \nas roadmap for considering Chief Judge Garland's nomination now.\n  Republicans have been dismissive about the need for a fully \nfunctioning Supreme Court with nine Justices, but as we have already \nseen this term, the Supreme Court has been repeatedly unable to serve \nits highest function under our Constitution. Without a full bench of \njustices, the Court has deadlocked and has been unable to address \ncircuit court conflicts or resolve cases on the merits. The effect, as \nthe New York Times reported recently, is a ``diminished'' Supreme \nCourt. In a bid to appeal to moneyed interest groups, Republicans have \nweakened our highest Court in the land, both functionally and \nsymbolically.\n  In the face of this obstruction, some Supreme Court justices have \ntried to put on a brave face, proclaiming things are going along just \nfine. The facts show, however, that the opposite is true. As another \nrecent news article notes, the Supreme Court is on pace to take on the \nlightest caseload in at least 70 years. At least one Supreme Court \nexpert has suggested that the eight Justices currently serving may be \nreluctant to take on certain cases when they cannot be certain they \nwill reach an actual decision on the merits without deadlocking. As \neach week passes and we see the Court take a pass on taking additional \ncases, the problem gets worse and the Court is further diminished.\n  In some instances, the Court has issued rare and unprecedented \nfollow-up orders to try to reach some kind of compromise where they \notherwise cannot resolve the issue with eight Justices. This happened \nin Zubik v. Burwell, which involved religiously affiliated employers' \nobjections to their employees' health insurance coverage for \ncontraception. In that case, the Court took the unusual step of \nordering supplemental briefing in the case, seemingly to avoid a 4-4 \nsplit and to reach some kind of compromise. Even with the extra \nbriefing, the Court could not make a decision. Instead, it sent the \nissue back to the lower courts expressing ``no view on the merits of \nthe cases.'' The reason we have one Supreme Court is so it can issue \nfinal decisions on the merits after the lower courts have been unable \nto do so in a consistent fashion. But the Supreme Court has recently \npunted cases back down to the lower courts for them to resolve the \nissue, possibly in different ways, because of its diminished stature. A \nSupreme Court that cannot resolve disputes among the appellate courts \ncannot live up to its name.\n  The Court has been unable to resolve cases where even the most \nfundamental right is at stake, that of life and death. Former Judge \nTimothy K. Lewis of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals warned us of \nthis earlier this month when he spoke at a public meeting to discuss \nthe qualifications of Chief Judge Garland. Sadly, these warnings have \nbecome a reality. In one death row case, the Supreme Court has not yet \ndecided whether to review it despite the fact that, at trial, an expert \ntestified that the defendant was more likely to be dangerous in the \nfuture because of his race. The prosecution later conceded this \ntestimony was inappropriate, but continued to raise procedural defenses \nin Buck's case. Such a case about whether a person sentenced to death \nhas received due process is at the very heart of our democracy; yet our \ndiminished Supreme Court has been unable to make a decision in this \ncase and could deadlock on others.\n  There are some who suggest a deadlocked decision may be beneficial \nwhen\n\n[[Page S3168]]\n\none supports the lower court's ruling, but that is both shortsighted \nand contrary to role of the courts in our constitutional system. A \ndeadlocked decision postpones an actual decision from the final arbiter \nof law under our Constitution. This results in less certainty for all \nof us.\n  I hope that Republicans will soon reverse course and put aside their \nobstruction to move forward on Chief Judge Garland's nomination to be \nthe next Supreme Court Justice. Their failure to act is having a real \nimpact on the American people. It is up to the Republican majority to \nallow this body to fulfill one of its most solemn duties and ensure \nthat justice is not delayed for another year. Judge Garland deserves \nfairness. He should be given a public hearing and a vote without \nfurther delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/senate-section/article/S3167-2"}, {"day": "25", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               OBAMACARE\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would like to get into the numbers on \nsomething that folks in Wyoming are having to deal with. The number I \nwould like to highlight is one. As an accountant, I am sure you thought \nI was going to get much more complicated, but it is important for my \ncolleagues to hear that there is one health insurer in Wyoming offering \nexchange plans this year--one.\n  In October last year, people around Wyoming read the news that \nWINHealth, one of two major medical insurers operating in the State, \nwould close down. That was bad news, and I had constituents who were in \na tough spot.\n  They say that misery loves company, and, unfortunately, we have \ncompany now. This year, Alaska and Alabama join us--one insurer on the \nState exchanges, thousands of people losing their plans.\n  Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wyoming has been working to provide \noptions, but the fact remains that we have fewer choices now.\n  If I think back to the ObamaCare debate, President Obama and my \ncolleagues across the aisle promised that ObamaCare would bring more \noptions, security, lower costs.\n  The majority leader at the time, Harry Reid, said: [W]e are bringing \nsecurity and stability to millions who have health insurance . . . What \nwe will do is ensure consumers have more choices and insurance \ncompanies face more competition.\n  I think it is safe to say that that hasn't quite materialized.\n  What we are witnessing is another broken promise, the failure of \nObamaCare to deliver again.\n  Some of my colleagues have been on the Senate floor talking about \ninsurance premiums going up, and they are going up, at shocking rates. \nObamaCare has been quite a comprehensive reform of health care. Now \nyour costs are higher, and you may have no choice in your insurer or \nthe structure of your insurance plan--sounds like a great deal.\n  ObamaCare has weighed down health insurance with unworkable plans, \nhigh costs, and a risk pool that is significantly sicker than expected; \nand now, somehow, people seem surprised to find that we have insurers \nleaving the market, either by choice or because they have gone \nbankrupt.\n  Look at the national carriers that have left the exchanges: \nUnitedHealth, Humana, and Aetna in some States. These folks have looked \nat the exchanges and said, We can't anymore.\n  We could look at the co-ops that have closed. Twelve have closed--\nmore than half.\n  Look at the States that may have some counties with only one \ninsurance option. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation's tracking, \nmore than 650 counties may have just one insurer for the exchanges in \n2017 in Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arizona, and Oklahoma.\n  What answer do my Democratic colleagues have for this absolutely \nunacceptable situation? I have mostly heard silence.\n  The people we represent deserve more than silence or rhetorical \nfinger pointing. They need relief, and they need real, meaningful \nchanges that will let people buy health insurance in a free market \nwithout a government chokepoint at every turn.\n  Let's be clear: This is not a failure of the free market. These are \nnot open marketplaces that have failed. They are government-run \nexchanges selling government-mandated and government-approved health \ninsurance.\n  I encourage my colleagues to consider what the option is if we fail \nto roll back this damaging law. What will we be left with?\n  I extend an open hand to work with any of my colleagues who want to \nmake reforms to our health care system that will truly deliver on the \npromises of more options, security, and lower costs.\n  Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/senate-section/article/S3168-1"}, {"day": "25", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3168-S3169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONGRATULATING MONTENEGRO ON 10 YEARS OF INDEPENDENCE AND SUPPORTING \n                      MONTENEGRO'S NATO MEMBERSHIP\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, 10 years ago this month, voters in \nMontenegro went to the polls to determine the future of their country. \nThese voters were faced with a single question: ``Do you want the \nRepublic of Montenegro to be an independent state with full \ninternational and legal subjectivity?'' When the dust settled on the \nevening of May 21, 2006, the referendum passed with 55.5 percent of \nvoters choosing to peacefully dissolve their union with Serbia. Shortly \nthereafter, the international community recognized the newest country \nin the world. In a region riddled with bullets and bombs, this moment \nmarked the beginning of a praiseworthy chapter in regional and \ntransatlantic history.\n  As a number of global security challenges occupy the top of our \nforeign policy agenda--not least the threat posed by ISIS and the most \nsignificant refugee crisis since World War II--it is easy to overlook \nMontenegro's tenth anniversary. But we would be remiss if we did not \nuse this occasion to reflect on the importance of U.S.-Montenegro \nrelations and the role this country of 600,000 can play to advance \nregional and transatlantic security moving forward.\n  Early on, the country's leaders made a clear decision to align with \nthe United States and pursue membership in Euro-Atlantic institutions. \nMontenegrin troops sacrificed their lives supporting the U.S.- and \nNATO-led mission in Afghanistan. Montenegro has demonstrated its \ncommitment to deterring Russian aggression by voluntarily joining the \nEU sanctions regime against Russia and rebuffing Moscow's offers for \nmilitary cooperation. And since the beginning, the United States has \nbeen there supporting Montenegro's progress, with direct assistance to \nhelp the country fight organized crime and corruption, strengthen its \ncivil society and democratic structures, and provide stability in the \nstill-fragile Balkans region.\n  In October 2014, I had the privilege to visit Montenegro as then-\nchairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European \nAffairs. I met with our Ambassador and Montenegrin Government officials \nand opposition leaders to discuss the challenges of the region and the \ncountry's progress. I also sat down with U.S. investors to hear why \nMontenegro is currently an attractive country for foreign investment.\n  Above all else, I came away from this visit convinced that Montenegro \nshould be granted NATO membership. The opportunity to join the world's \nforemost military alliance has been a powerful incentive for reform. \nMontenegro has come a long way, but if the prospect of joining NATO is \nno longer on the table, we can expect to see an erosion of Montenegro's \ncommitment to democratic governance and arguments that Montenegro is \nbetter served by an alliance with Russia.\n  Last week, NATO Foreign Ministers gathered in Brussels to sign \nMontenegro's Accession Protocol, paving the way to Montenegro's formal \nmembership. Each member country must now ratify the agreement. This \nimportant decision will help counter Russian aggression in the region, \neliminate a strategic NATO gap along the Mediterranean, and ensure that \nMontenegro's young democracy continues to develop under the alliance's \numbrella.\n  At the same time, no country should receive an invitation until it is \nprepared to meet the highest standards of NATO membership. Montenegro \nhas\n\n[[Page S3169]]\n\ntaken significant steps to address concerns that have delayed \nmembership in the past. The government has strengthened the rule of \nlaw, undertaken intelligence sector and defense reforms, and increased \npublic support for NATO membership in recent years. Notably, the \nMontenegrin Parliament passed legislation in November 2014 to reform \nthe judicial sector, including the establishment of a special \nprosecutor's office for organized crime and an anti-corruption agency. \nThis legislation is now being implemented, with the special \nprosecutor's office carrying out a high-profile arrest of former \nPresident of Serbia and Montenegro Svetozar Marovic on corruption \ncharges in December 2015. We need to see continued high profile arrests \nto prove the rule of law will be fully respected, but this is an \nimportant signal.\n  Montenegro's democracy is young, but it is on the right track. There \nis no doubt Montenegro needs to continue making progress to uphold the \nrule of law, fight organized crime, tackle corruption, and foster a \nfree and independent media environment. I believe American engagement \nwill be critical helping Montenegro achieve these goals. On the tenth \nanniversary of Montenegro's historic independence, I will continue to \npush for a strong transatlantic partnership between our countries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/senate-section/article/S3168-2"}, {"day": "25", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING SERGEANT ROBERT WILSON III\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today we pay tribute to Sergeant Robert \nWilson III of the Philadelphia Police Department, who sacrificed his \nlife to protect innocent civilians during an armed robbery at a store \ncalled GameStop in north Philadelphia in March 2015.\n  Sergeant Wilson was there buying a present for his son when he \nconfronted two armed robbers. He moved to draw attention away from the \narea where the civilians were standing in what ended up being a fatal \nexchange of gunfire.\n  For his exceptional bravery and selflessness in the face of danger, \nPresident Obama awarded Sergeant Wilson with the Public Safety Officer \nMedal of Valor, 1 of 13 officers who received the award and the first \nmember of the Philadelphia Police Department to earn such an honor.\n  No medal or distinction can adequately pay tribute to Sergeant \nWilson's sacrifice and the horror his family has gone through over this \nlast year. Sergeant Wilson's grandmother, Constance, who accepted the \nmedal on his behalf, said of the pain of losing her grandson, ``a big \nhole was put in my heart.''\n  Sadly, the Wilson family is not alone in its sacrifice: 128 police \nofficers were killed in the line of duty in 2015, including five in \nPennsylvania. To paraphrase something President Lincoln once said, they \ngave the ``last full measure of devotion'' to the communities they \nserved.\n  As public officials, we have a deep and abiding obligation to support \nthose serving in law enforcement. Our support must be in deed and in \nword, which means making sure those law enforcement officers have the \nresources they need to keep our communities and themselves safe. All \npublic officials must pray and ask humbly whether our actions are \nworthy of the valor of those who serve.\n  On the Senate floor today, we express our profound gratitude for the \nservice of Medal of Valor recipient Sergeant Wilson and the sacrifice \nof his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/senate-section/article/S3169-1"}, {"day": "25", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR.

Mr. President, I would like to recognize the upcoming \ninauguration of Dr. Andrew Gurman of Hollidaysburg, PA, as the 171st \npresident of the American Medical Association on June 14, 2016.\n  Dr. Gurman is an orthopaedic hand surgeon who maintains a private \npractice in Altoona, PA. He is the first hand surgeon and only the \nsecond orthopaedic surgeon to have been elected to serve as president \nof the AMA.\n  Dr. Gurman graduated from Syracuse University and received his \nmedical degree from the State University of New York Upstate Medical \nUniversity, Syracuse, in 1980. After completing his surgical internship \nand residency in orthopaedic surgery at the Montefiore Hospital/Albert \nEinstein program in New York City and a fellowship in hand surgery at \nthe Hospital for Joint Diseases Orthopaedic Institute, Dr. Gurman \nentered practice in central Pennsylvania and became active in local \nmedical societies, having served as both speaker and vice speaker of \nthe Pennsylvania Medical Society. He was also a member of its board of \ntrustees and executive board. Dr. Gurman has also served as the chair \nof the Altoona Hospital bylaws committee and orthopaedic surgery peer \nreview committee, as well as the chair of orthopaedic service.\n  I want to congratulate Dr. Gurman on his election and inauguration as \nthe president of the American Medical Association and wish him well. I \nlook forward to working with him in his new role to craft policies that \nwill improve access to affordable, high-quality health care and make a \ndifference in the lives of countless patients across the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/senate-section/article/S3169-2"}, {"day": "25", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3169-S3170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO FRED AND CONNIE TAYLOR\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I would like to take the opportunity to \nsing the praises of Fred and Connie Taylor, two incredibly talented and \ndedicated members of the Casper community. Fred serves as the choir \ndirector and his wife, Connie, serves as the organist and director of \nthe handbell choir at the Shepherd of the Hills Presbyterian Church in \nmy hometown of Casper, WY. Through music, Fred and Connie Taylor have \nhelped our congregation share in God's love, grace, and teachings for \n24 years. Last Sunday marked their last service in leading the musical \nministry of the church as they start their well-earned retirement.\n  Fred and Connie Taylor have been married for over 50 years. Since \nthey first met at the University of Dayton, this lovely couple has been \ncelebrating life and music together. In fact, music brought them \ntogether. The couple met when Fred was performing in the role of Elijah \nin Mendelssohn's ``Elijah'' and Connie was assigned to be his \naccompanist. Since that day, they have been performing together and \nsharing their musical talents in schools and churches across the \nnation.\n  The Taylors fell in love with Wyoming during a trip to our great \nState in 1979. A short time later, Fred and Connie moved to Hanna, WY. \nFred got a job as band director at the school and Connie took the \nposition as the choir director. In 1986, they moved to Casper, WY. Fred \nbecame bass trombonist and assistant conductor of the symphony. Connie \ndevoted herself to inspiring and spreading the love of music to \nchildren in the Casper schools.\n  While they are a dynamic team, Fred and Connie also have significant \nindividual accomplishments. Connie graduated from the University of \nDayton with a bachelor of science in music and earned a master of music \nfrom Indiana University. Connie is a concerto level pianist. She has \nperformed as an accompanist for the Joffrey Ballet. Her musical \nexpertise has been critical in ensuring the success of numerous \nperformances in our community. As a longtime elementary school teacher \nin Casper, she taught her students to appreciate the beauty and joy of \nmusic. Connie has helped ensure the love of music lives on in the \nfuture generations of our State.\n  Fred's passion for music is best explained by his proclamation that, \n``Music is part of my soul.'' He was born in New York City in 1938. As \na baby, he would rock and sway along to the sounds of the world's most \nbeloved symphonies. As a young boy, he started singing at his church \nand in the boys' choir. After serving our Nation in the U.S. Army, Fred \nearned his bachelor of science in music education from the University \nof Dayton and a master of music in conducting from Indiana University. \nFred is the bass trombonist for the Wyoming Symphony Orchestra and \nfounder of the Casper Brass and Storm Door Company. He has composed \nover 600 pieces of music. In addition, Fred has performed in and \ngreatly contributed to the Casper College Band, the Casper Municipal \nBand, and the CC Jazz Band.\n  Fred explains how his love for music and the state of Wyoming \nperfectly intertwine stating, ``I have a wonderful church choir to \nconduct; I have a symphony orchestra to play in; everything\n\n[[Page S3170]]\n\nI write gets performed.'' He also said, ``Outside of that, the air is \nclear and the fish in the river don't have to cough, and my \ngrandchildren live right around the corner.''\n  The passion for music is part of the family. The love of music and \nability to bring the notes on the page to life extends to every member \nof their family; Lisa Rich, Steven Rich, Chris Taylor, Nancy Taylor, \nand their grandchildren Alex Rich, Jeremy Rich, and Abigail Madden.\n  My wife, Bobbi, joins me in extending our appreciation for the \nmusical talents of Fred and Connie Taylor which inspire and delight so \nmany people in our community and across the Nation. We are also deeply \ngrateful for their amazing ability to lift our hearts and share the \nWord of God through music. As quoted in the Bible, I say to each of \nthem, ``Well done, good and faithful servant.'' All of us privileged \nenough to know them are blessed. We wish them the best as they embark \non their next adventure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/senate-section/article/S3169-3"}, {"day": "25", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  TRIBUTE TO JACK AND GEORGETTA TAYLOR\n\n Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, Kansans work hard to make a \ndifference in our communities, our State, and our Nation. Two of those \nwho exemplify this are Jack and Georgetta Taylor who, for the past 48 \nyears, have called Liberal, KS, home.\n  The Taylors are true ambassadors for southwest Kansas. During visits \nto Liberal for the annual Pancake Day or a Kansas Listening Tour stop, \nthey would make certain Robba and I had seen every new business, \nrestaurant, and development. Their pride for Liberal is contagious and \nmakes all under their spell want to call it home. Every time I have \nvisited Liberal, the Taylors were there to make me feel welcome and \nappreciated.\n  Jack and Georgetta are also the type of individuals who will drop \neverything to help others. In fact, a few years ago during Pancake Day, \nJack literally gave the shoes off his feet so members of my staff could \nfully experience the race.\n  Through their involvement in a myriad of community organizations \nincluding the chamber, the Baker Arts Center, and the Booster Club, the \nTaylors have been important leaders in the Liberal community. They also \nworked to make certain our Nation's veterans living in Kansas are cared \nfor through constant communication to recruit a fulltime physician to \nthe local community-based outpatient clinic.\n  Jack has been a relentless advocate for expanding and improving U.S. \nHighway 54, one of the most heavily trafficked two-lane highways in the \nUnited States. A self-described troublemaker, Jack always approaches \ntough issues with a charming smile and humorous narratives. His \nfriendly demeanor, work ethic, and patience epitomize Kansans' approach \nto resolving tough issues.\n  While improving their community has always been a top priority, as \nthey approach 63 years of marriage next month, it is obvious they have \nalways put family first. Relocating to Lawrence will allow them to \nspend time with their kids and grandkids; yet they will be close enough \nto visit and cherish the friendships and memories made in southwest \nKansas.\n  By investing their time and talents in the community where they \nlived, the Taylors made a difference one life at a time. They taught \nthrough their actions that satisfaction in life comes from what you do \nfor others rather than what you do for yourself, which is the legacy we \nwant to leave behind for the next generation. While impossible to \nreplace, the Taylors worked tirelessly to bring another generation of \nleaders to Liberal and southwest Kansas.\n  Good things continue happening in our State because of individuals \nlike Jack and Georgetta, and I wish them the very best as they move to \nLawrence to spend precious time with their family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/senate-section/article/S3170-1"}, {"day": "25", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:02 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 897.

A bill to extend the sunset of the Iran Sanctions Act of \n1996 in order to effectuate the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in \nguaranteeing that all nuclear material in Iran remains in peaceful \nactivities; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce with my colleague \nSenator Murphy, a bill that extends the sunset of the Iran Sanctions \nAct, ISA, of 1996 until the President certifies to Congress that the \nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy Agency has reached \na broader conclusion that all nuclear material in Iran remains in \npeaceful activities.\n  Currently, ISA expires on December 31st, 2016. Tying ISA's extension \nto Iran's compliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, \nJCPOA, will provide the administration additional leverage to ensure \nthat a ``snap back'' of sanctions would have significant effect on \nIran's economy. Since its enactment in 1996, ISA has been a pivotal \ncomponent of U.S. sanctions against Iran's energy sector and other \nindustries and remains a critical foundation of our overall sanctions \narchitecture.\n  Administration officials have indicated that extending ISA, with its \ncurrent waiver authorities, would not violate the JCPOA, as it imposes \nno new sanctions. Additionally, ISA is about more than Iran's nuclear \nprogram, but also its support for international terrorism, which \nendangers the national security and foreign policy interests of the \nUnited States and those countries with which the United States shares \ncommon strategic and foreign policy objectives. ISA addresses this \nissue by denying Iran money to finance international terrorism.\n  By specifying in the bill that the extension of ISA ``effectuates the \nJCPOA,'' the intent is to support Congressional actions in line with \nthe deal negotiated by the P5+1 and Iran, particularly following \nCongress's comprehensive review of the deal and decision to move \nforward under the Iran Nuclear Review Agreement Act of 2015.\n  I am proud to introduce this bill with Senator Murphy to make sure \nthat ISA is in place during the JCPOA to signal to the commitment of \nCongress to vigorously enforce Iran's compliance and to make clear that \nshould Iran break the terms of the agreement, there will be clear \nconsequences, including the re-imposition of sanctions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. King):\n  S. 2990. A bill to prohibit the President from preventing foreign air \ncarriers traveling to or from Cuba from making transit stops in the \nUnited States for refueling and other technical services based on the \nCuban Assets Control Regulations; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr President, I rise to introduce bipartisan legislation \nwith my colleague from Maine, Senator King, to permit foreign air \ncarriers traveling to or from Cuba to make non-traffic, transit stops \nin the United States. Enactment of this legislation will create new \nopportunities for U.S. workers and airports.\n  For decades U.S. airports, including Bangor International Airport in \nMaine, have lost out on additional revenue because the current travel \nban on Cuba prevents them from providing transit stop services to \nflights departing from or en route to Cuba.\n  During these transit stops, passengers do not disembark the plane and \nno new passengers board the aircraft. Yet, these stops are valuable for \nairports and their employees who can offer fuel, de-icing, catering, \nand crew services. Under the current travel ban, however, foreign air \ncarriers are forced to make transit stops in Canada rather than the \nUnited States, and any potential profit for U.S. airports flies right \nacross the border along with the planes.\n  The current disparity means that airports like Bangor not only lose \nrevenue related to flights to or from Cuba, but also from transit stops \nfor European flights to and from many other destinations in North \nAmerica, Central America, and the Caribbean. That is because if foreign \nairlines cannot use Bangor for all of their flights, it is simply \neasier and more efficient for them to refuel at one airport that can \nmeet all of their needs.\n\n[[Page S3175]]\n\n  The purpose of economic sanctions was to limit hard currency to \nCuba--not to harm American workers and cities. Allowing U.S. airports \nto provide these services could support additional jobs for families in \nMaine and other areas throughout the country.\n  Allowing such transit stops would also be consistent with existing \ninternational air transportation agreements. For example, in 2007 the \nU.S. and the EU signed an Air Transport Agreement that granted airlines \nof one party the right to make stops in the territory of the other \nparty for non-traffic, transit purposes.\n  Likewise, the Chicago Convention, to which there are 191 parties, \nrecognizes the right to refuel or carry out maintenance in a foreign \ncountry, including the United States. The United States should fulfill \nits obligations and permit such transit stops at U.S. airports, no \nmatter the destination.\n  Our bill would provide American airports and workers the opportunity \nto compete with Canadian airports and would bring the United States \ninto compliance with international air travel agreements.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this commonsense, bipartisan \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/senate-section/article/S3173-1"}, {"day": "25", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 474--PROHIBITING CONSIDERATION OF APPROPRIATIONS THAT \n                           ARE NOT AUTHORIZED\n\n  Mr. FLAKE (for himself, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Lee, Mr. Rubio, and Mr. \nCruz) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                              S.

Res. 477\n\n       Whereas the origin of the National Minority Health Month is \n     National Negro Health Week, established in 1915 by Dr. Booker \n     T. Washington;\n       Whereas the theme for National Minority Health Month in \n     2016 is ``Accelerating Health Equity for the Nation'';\n       Whereas, through the ``National Stakeholder Strategy for \n     Achieving Health Equity'' and the ``HHS Action Plan to Reduce \n     Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities'', the Department of \n     Health and Human Services has set goals and strategies to \n     advance the safety, health, and well-being of the people of \n     the United States;\n       Whereas a study by the Joint Center for Political and \n     Economic Studies, entitled ``The Economic Burden of Health \n     Inequalities in the United States'', concludes that, between \n     2003 and 2006, the combined cost of ``health inequalities and \n     premature death in the United States'' was \n     $1,240,000,000,000;\n       Whereas the Department of Health and Human Services has \n     identified 6 main categories in which racial and ethnic \n     minorities experience the most disparate access to health \n     care and health outcomes, including infant mortality, cancer \n     screening and management, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, \n     HIV/AIDS, and immunizations;\n       Whereas, in 2012, African American women were 10 percent \n     less likely to have been diagnosed with, yet were almost 42 \n     percent more likely to die from, breast cancer than non-\n     Hispanic White women;\n       Whereas African American women are twice as likely to lose \n     their lives to cervical cancer as non-Hispanic White women;\n       Whereas African Americans are 50 percent more likely to die \n     from a stroke than non-Hispanic Whites;\n       Whereas, in 2013, Hispanics were 1.4 times more likely than \n     non-Hispanic Whites to die of diabetes;\n       Whereas Latino men are 3 times more likely to have either \n     HIV infections or AIDS than non-Hispanic White men;\n       Whereas Latina women are 4 times more likely to have AIDS \n     than non-Hispanic White women;\n       Whereas, in 2014, although African Americans represented \n     only 13 percent of the population of the United States, they \n     accounted for 43 percent of HIV infections in that year;\n       Whereas, in 2010, African American youth accounted for an \n     estimated 57 percent of all new HIV infections among youth in \n     the United States, followed by 20 percent of Latino youth;\n       Whereas Asian American women are 18.2 percent more likely \n     to be diagnosed with HIV than non-Hispanic White women;\n       Whereas Native Hawaiians living in Hawaii are 5.7 times \n     more likely to die of diabetes than non-Hispanic Whites \n     living in Hawaii;\n       Whereas, although the prevalence of obesity is high among \n     all population groups in the United States, 48 percent of \n     African Americans, 31.8 percent of Hispanics, and 11 percent \n     of Asian Americans are obese;\n       Whereas, in 2012, Asian Americans were 1.6 times more \n     likely than non-Hispanic Whites to contract Hepatitis A;\n       Whereas among all ethnic groups in 2012, Asian Americans \n     and Pacific Islanders had the highest incidence of Hepatitis \n     A;\n       Whereas Asian American women are 1.5 times more likely than \n     non-Hispanic Whites to die from viral hepatitis;\n       Whereas Asian Americans are 5.5 times more likely than non-\n     Hispanic Whites to develop chronic Hepatitis B;\n       Whereas, in 2013, 80 percent of children born infected with \n     HIV belonged to minority groups;\n       Whereas the Department of Health and Human Services has \n     identified heart disease, stroke, cancer, and diabetes as \n     some of the leading causes of death among American Indians \n     and Alaskan Natives;\n       Whereas American Indians and Alaskan Natives die from \n     diabetes, alcoholism, unintentional injuries, homicide, and \n     suicide at higher rates than other people in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas American Indians and Alaskan Natives have a life \n     expectancy that is 4.4 years shorter than the life expectancy \n     of the overall population of the United States;\n       Whereas African American babies are almost twice as likely \n     as non-Hispanic White or Latino babies to be born at low \n     birth weight;\n       Whereas American Indian and Alaskan Native babies are twice \n     as likely as non-Hispanic White babies to die from sudden \n     infant death syndrome;\n       Whereas American Indian and Alaskan Natives have 1.5 times \n     the infant mortality rate as that of non-Hispanic Whites;\n       Whereas American Indian and Alaskan Native babies are 50 \n     percent more likely to die before their first birthday than \n     babies of non-Hispanic Whites;\n       Whereas marked differences in the social determinants of \n     health, described by the World Health Organization as ``the \n     high burden of illness responsible for appalling premature \n     loss of life [that] arises in large part because of the \n     conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and \n     age'', lead to poor health outcomes and declines in \n     longevity;\n       Whereas the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \n     (Public Law 111-148; 124 Stat. 119) provides specific \n     protections and rights for American Indians and Alaskan \n     Natives, 23 percent of whom lack health insurance;\n       Whereas, despite the substantial improvements in health \n     insurance coverage among women overall, women of color are \n     more likely to be uninsured;\n       Whereas, in 2013, 15.9 percent of African Americans were \n     uninsured, as compared to 9.8 percent of non-Hispanic Whites;\n       Whereas African American women are more likely to be \n     uninsured or underinsured, at a rate of 19 percent;\n       Whereas \\1/4\\ of Latinas live in poverty and Latinas have \n     the greatest percentage of uninsured women in any racial \n     group at a rate of 31 percent; and\n       Whereas community-based health care initiatives, such as \n     prevention-focused programs, present a unique opportunity to \n     use innovative approaches to improve health practices across \n     the United States and to sharply reduce disparities among \n     racial and ethnic minority populations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate supports the goals and ideals of \n     National Minority Health Month, which include bringing \n     attention to the severe health disparities faced by minority \n     populations in the United States, such as American Indians, \n     Alaskan Natives, Asian Americans, African Americans, Latino \n     Americans, and Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/senate-section/article/S3176-1"},

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) On April 2, 2015, President Barack Obama said, ``Other \n     American sanctions on Iran for its support of terrorism, its \n     human rights abuses, its ballistic missile program, will \n     continue to be fully enforced.''.\n       (2) On July 7, 2015, General Martin Dempsey, then-Chairman \n     of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said, ``Under no circumstances \n     should we relieve the pressure on Iran relative to ballistic \n     missile capabilities.''.\n       (3) On July 29, 2015, in his role as the top military \n     officer in the United States and advisor to the President, \n     General Dempsey confirmed that his military recommendation \n     was that sanctions relating to the ballistic missile program \n     of Iran not be lifted.\n       (4) The Government of Iran and Iran's Revolutionary Guard \n     Corps have been responsible for the repeated testing of \n     illegal ballistic missiles capable of carrying a nuclear \n     device, including observed tests in October and November 2015 \n     and March 2016, violating United Nations Security Council \n     resolutions.\n       (5) On October 14, 2015, Samantha Power, United States \n     Ambassador to the United Nations, said, ``One of the really \n     important features in implementation of the recent Iran deal \n     to dismantle Iran's nuclear program is going to have to be \n     enforcement of the resolutions and the standards that remain \n     on the books.''.\n       (6) On December 11, 2015, the United Nations Panel of \n     Experts concluded that the missile launch on October 10, \n     2015, ``was a violation by Iran of paragraph 9 of Security \n     Council resolution 1929 (2010)''.\n       (7) On January 17, 2016, Adam Szubin, Acting Under \n     Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, stated, \n     ``Iran's ballistic missile program poses a significant threat \n     to regional and global security, and it will continue to be \n     subject to international sanctions. We have consistently made \n     clear that the United States will vigorously press sanctions \n     against Iranian activities outside of the Joint Comprehensive \n     Plan of Action--including those related to Iran's support for \n     terrorism, regional destabilization, human rights abuses, and \n     ballistic missile program.''.\n       (8) On February 9, 2016, James Clapper, Director of \n     National Intelligence, testified that, ``We judge that Tehran \n     would choose ballistic missiles as its preferred method of \n     delivering nuclear weapons, if it builds them. Iran's \n     ballistic missiles are inherently capable of delivering WMD, \n     and Tehran already has the largest inventory of ballistic \n     missiles in the Middle East. Iran's progress on space launch \n     vehicles--along with its desire to deter the United States \n     and its allies--provides Tehran with the means and motivation \n     to develop longer-range missiles, including ICBMs.''.\n       (9) On March 9, 2016, Iran reportedly fired two Qadr \n     ballistic missiles with a range of more than 1,000 miles and \n     according to public reports, the missiles were marked with a \n     statement in Hebrew reading, ``Israel must be wiped off the \n     arena of time.''.\n       (10) On March 11, 2016, Ambassador Power called the recent \n     ballistic missile launches by Iran ``provocative and \n     destabilizing'' and called on the international community to \n     ``degrade Iran's missile program''.\n       (11) On March 14, 2016, Ambassador Power said that the \n     recent ballistic missile launches by Iran were ``in defiance \n     of provisions of UN Security Council Resolution 2231''.\n       (12) Iran has demonstrated the ability to launch multiple \n     rockets from fortified underground facilities and mobile \n     launch sites not previously known.\n       (13) The ongoing procurement by Iran of technologies needed \n     to boost the range, accuracy, and payloads of its diverse \n     ballistic missile arsenal represents a threat to deployed \n     personnel of the United States and allies of the United \n     States in Europe and the Middle East, including Israel.\n       (14) Ashton Carter, Secretary of Defense, testified in a \n     hearing before the Armed Services Committee of the Senate on \n     July 7, 2015, that, ``[T]he reason that we want to stop Iran \n     from having an ICBM program is that the I in ICBM stands for \n     intercontinental, which means having the capability to fly \n     from Iran to the United States, and we don't want that. \n     That's why we oppose ICBMs.''.\n       (15) Through recent ballistic missile launch tests the \n     Government of Iran has shown blatant disregard for \n     international laws and its intention to continue tests of \n     that nature throughout the implementation of the Joint \n     Comprehensive Plan of Action.\n       (16) The banking sector of Iran has facilitated the \n     financing of the ballistic missile programs in Iran and \n     evidence has not been provided that entities in that sector \n     have ceased facilitating the financing of those programs.\n       (17) Iran has been able to amass a large arsenal of \n     ballistic missiles through its illicit smuggling networks and \n     domestic manufacturing capabilities that have been supported \n     and maintained by Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps and \n     specific sectors of the economy of Iran.\n       (18) Penetration by Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps into \n     the economy of Iran is well documented including investments \n     in the construction, automotive, telecommunications, \n     electronics, mining, metallurgy, and petrochemical sectors of \n     the economy of Iran.\n       (19) Items procured through sectors of Iran specified in \n     paragraph (18) have dual use applications that are currently \n     being used to create ballistic missiles in Iran and will \n     continue to be a source of materials for the creation of \n     future weapons.\n       (20) In order to curb future illicit activity by Iran, the \n     Government of the United States and the international \n     community must take action against persons that facilitate \n     and profit from the illegal acquisition of ballistic missile \n     parts and technology in support of the missile programs of \n     Iran.\n\n     SEC. 1283. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the ballistic missile program of Iran represents a \n     serious threat to allies of the United States in the Middle \n     East and Europe, members of the Armed Forces deployed in the \n     those regions, and ultimately the United States;\n       (2) the testing and production by Iran of ballistic \n     missiles capable of carrying a nuclear device is a clear \n     violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 \n     (2015), which was unanimously adopted by the international \n     community;\n       (3) Iran is using its space launch program to develop the \n     capabilities necessary to deploy an intercontinental \n     ballistic missile that could threaten the United States, and \n     the Director of National Intelligence has assessed that Iran \n     would use ballistic missiles as its ``preferred method of \n     delivering nuclear weapons''; and\n       (4) the Government of the United States should impose tough \n     primary and secondary sanctions against any sector of the \n     economy of Iran or any Iranian person that directly or \n     indirectly supports the ballistic missile program of Iran as \n     well as any foreign person or financial institution that \n     engages in transactions or trade that support that program.\n\n     SEC. 1284. EXPANSION OF SANCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO EFFORTS BY \n                   IRAN TO ACQUIRE BALLISTIC MISSILE AND RELATED \n                   TECHNOLOGY.\n\n       (a) Certain Persons.--Section 1604(a) of the Iran-Iraq Arms \n     Non-Proliferation Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-484; 50 U.S.C. \n     1701 note) is amended, in the matter preceding paragraph (1), \n     by inserting ``, to acquire ballistic missile or related \n     technology,'' after ``nuclear weapons''.\n       (b) Foreign Countries.--Section 1605(a) of the Iran-Iraq \n     Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-484; 50 \n     U.S.C. 1701 note) is amended, in the matter preceding \n     paragraph (1), by inserting ``, to acquire ballistic missile \n     or related technology,'' after ``nuclear weapons''.\n\n     SEC. 1285.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON RUSSIAN MILITARY AGGRESSION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On May 25, 1972, the United States and the Soviet Union \n     signed the Agreement Between the Government of The United \n     States of America and the Government of The Union of Soviet \n     Socialist Republics on the Prevention of Incidents On and \n     Over the\n\n[[Page S3202]]\n\n     High Seas (the ``Agreement''). Russia and the United States \n     remain parties to the Agreement.\n       (2) Article IV of the Agreement provides that ``Commanders \n     of aircraft of the Parties shall use the greatest caution and \n     prudence in approaching aircraft and ships of the other Party \n     operating on and over the high seas, and . . . shall not \n     permit simulated attacks by the simulated use of weapons \n     against aircraft and ships, or performance of various \n     aerobatics over ships''.\n       (3) On January 25, 2016, a Russian Su-27 air-superiority \n     fighter flew within 15 feet of a United States Air Force RC-\n     135U aircraft flying a routine patrol in international \n     airspace over the Black Sea.\n       (4) On April 11, 2016, the USS DONALD COOK, an Arleigh-\n     Burke-class guided-missile destroyer, was repeatedly buzzed \n     by Russian Su-24 attack aircraft while operating in the \n     Baltic Sea. United States officials described the low-passes \n     as having a ``simulated attack profile''.\n       (5) On April 12, 2014, a Russian Su-24 again conducted \n     close-range low altitude passes for about 90 minutes near the \n     DONALD COOK.\n       (6) The United States European Command expressed ``deep \n     concerns'' about the April 11 and 12, 2016, Russian close-\n     range passes over the DONALD COOK and stated that the \n     maneuvers were ``unprofessional and unsafe''.\n       (7) On April 14, 2016, a Russian Su-27 barrel-rolled over a \n     United States reconnaissance aircraft operating in \n     international airspace over the Baltic Sea, at one point \n     coming within 50 feet of the United States plane. The \n     Pentagon condemned the maneuver as ``erratic and \n     aggressive''.\n       (8) On April 20, 2016, Russian Permanent Representative to \n     the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Alexander \n     Grushko accused United States military aircraft and vessels \n     operating in international waters as attempting ``to exercise \n     military pressure on Russia'' and promised to ``take all \n     necessary measures [and] precautions, to compensate for these \n     attempts to use military force''.\n       (9) On April 29, 2016, another Russian Su-27 performed \n     another barrel-roll over a United States Air Force RC-135 \n     reconnaissance plane, this time coming within approximately \n     100 feet of the aircraft.\n       (10) The commander of the United States Cyber Command, \n     Admiral Mike Rogers, warned Congress during a Senate hearing \n     that Russia and China can now launch crippling cyberattacks \n     on the electric grid and other critical infrastructures of \n     the United States.\n       (11) Russia's military build-up and increasing Anti-Access/\n     Area Denial capabilities in Kaliningrad and its expanded \n     operations in the Black Sea, the eastern Mediterranean Sea, \n     and in Syria aim to deny United States access to key areas of \n     Eurasia and often pose direct challenges to stated United \n     States interests.\n       (12) The United States has determined that in 2015, Russia \n     continued to be in violation of obligations under the Treaty \n     between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet \n     Socialist Republics on the Elimination of their Intermediate-\n     Range and Shorter-Range Missiles (the ``INF Treaty''), signed \n     in Washington, D.C. on December 8, 1987, and entered into \n     force June 1, 1988, not to possess, produce, or flight-test a \n     ground-launched cruise missile with a range capability of 500 \n     km to 5,500 km, or to possess or produce launchers of such \n     missiles.\n       (13) Russia is adding multiple, independently targetable \n     reentry vehicles or MIRVs to existing deployed road-mobile \n     SS-27 and submarine-launched SS-N-32 missiles thereby \n     doubling the number of its strategic nuclear warheads and \n     exceeding the 1,550 permitted under the Treaty between the \n     United States of America and the Russian Federation on \n     Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of \n     Strategic Offensive Arms (the ``New START Treaty''), signed \n     April 8, 2010, and entered into force February 5, 2011\n       (14) General Philip Breedlove, Commander of United States \n     European Command, stated that ``we face a resurgent and \n     aggressive Russia, and as we have continued to witness these \n     last two years, Russia continues to seek to extend its \n     influence on its periphery and beyond''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--\n       (1) condemns the recent dangerous and unprofessional \n     Russian intercepts of United States-flagged aircraft and \n     vessels;\n       (2) calls on the Government of the Russian Federation to \n     cease provocative military maneuvers that endanger United \n     States forces and those of its allies;\n       (3) calls on the United States, its European allies, and \n     the international community to continue to apply pressure on \n     the Government of the Russian Federation to cease its \n     provocative international behavior; and\n       (4) reaffirms the right of the United States to operate \n     military aircraft and vessels in international airspace and \n     waters.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4172.

EVANS WHO PERISHED ON JUNE 3, \n                   1969.\n\n       (a) Finding.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On June 3, 1969, 74 sailors aboard the U.S.S. Frank E. \n     Evans perished when their vessel was struck in the South \n     China Sea during a Southeast Asia Treaty Organization \n     exercise. The U.S.S. Frank E. Evans had been providing fire \n     for combat operations in Vietnam prior to the exercise that \n     resulted in this catastrophic accident and was scheduled to \n     return upon completion of the exercise.\n       (2) The families of the lost 74 have been fighting for \n     decades for their loved ones to receive the recognition they \n     deserve. Exceptions have been granted to inscribe names on \n     the Vietnam Memorial Wall for other members of the Armed \n     Forces who were killed outside of the designated combat zone, \n     including in 1983 when President Reagan ordered that 68 \n     Marines who died on a flight outside of the combat zone be \n     added to the Wall. Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus also \n     expressed support for the inclusion of the 74 names of those \n     lost on the U.S.S. Frank E. Evans in June 1969.\n       (3) Those crewmembers aboard were essential to United \n     States military efforts in Vietnam, and their presence in the \n     South China Sea was directly related to their combat \n     deployment. This heroism and sacrifice should not go \n     unrecognized because of an arbitrary line on a map, as their \n     combat-related service deserves comparable acknowledgment. \n     The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall is a symbolic beacon of \n     reflection and healing for generations. It is a sanctuary of \n     honor for our members of the Armed Forces and family alike.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall provide \n     the Required Review of Vietnam Era Ships detailing the \n     findings of the ship logs and operational analysis of the \n     U.S.S.

Mr. ROUNDS (for Mr. Schatz) proposed an amendment to the \nresolution S. Res. 416, recognizing the contributions of Hawaii to the \nculinary heritage of the United States and designating the week \nbeginning on June 12, 2016, as ``National Hawaiian Food Week''; as \nfollows:\n\n       Strike the preamble and insert the following:\n       Whereas when individuals first came to the Hawaiian islands \n     more than 1,500 years ago, there was little to eat other than \n     birds and a few species of ferns, but the individuals found \n     rich volcanic soil, a year-round growing season, and abundant \n     fisheries;\n       Whereas the history of Hawaii is inextricably linked with--\n       (1) foods brought to the Hawaiian islands by the first \n     individuals who came to Hawaii and successive waves of \n     voyagers to the Hawaiian islands;\n       (2) the agricultural and ranching potential of the land of \n     Hawaii; and\n       (3) the readily available seafood from the ocean and coasts \n     of Hawaii;\n       Whereas the food cultures initially brought to Hawaii came \n     from places including French Polynesia, China, Japan, \n     Portugal, North Korea, South Korea, the Philippines, Puerto \n     Rico, and Samoa;\n       Whereas the foods first brought to Hawaii were simple, \n     hearty fare of working men and women that reminded the men \n     and women of their distant homes;\n       Whereas individuals in Hawaii, in the spirit of Aloha, \n     shared favorite dishes with each other, and as a result, the \n     individuals began to appreciate new tastes and learned how to \n     bring new ideas into their cooking;\n       Whereas the blend of styles in Hawaiian cooking evolves as \n     new groups of individuals make Hawaii their home;\n       Whereas the fusion of dishes from around the world creates \n     a unique cuisine for Hawaii that is as much a part of a visit \n     to Hawaii as the welcoming climate, friendly individuals, and \n     beautiful beaches in Hawaii;\n       Whereas the food of Hawaii is appealing because it came \n     from hard-working communities of individuals that farmed, \n     fished, or ranched for their livelihoods, which are core \n     experiences of individuals throughout the United States; and\n       Whereas the growing appreciation for the food of Hawaii \n     comes from hard-working and ingenious farmers, fishers, \n     educators, ranchers, chefs, and businesses that innovate and \n     export the taste of Hawaii all over the world: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4231.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 477, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 477) promoting minority health \n     awareness and supporting the goals and ideals of National \n     Minority Health Month in April 2016, which include bringing \n     attention to the health disparities faced by minority \n     populations of the United States such as American Indians, \n     Alaskan Natives, Asian Americans, African Americans, Latino \n     Americans, and Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my Senate colleagues \nto join me in recognizing--belatedly--April as National Minority Health \nMonth. For over 30 years, this commemorative event has provided us the \nopportunity to celebrate the progress we have made in addressing \nminority health disparities and related issues in our Nation, and to \nrenew our commitment to continue this critically important effort.\n  The theme of this year's National Minority Health Month observance, \n``Accelerating Health Equity for the Nation,'' reflects both a sense of \nurgency and determination in moving the country forward toward health \nequity. Minorities now make up more than 35 percent of the American \npopulation and that number is expected to rise in the future. Studies \nhave shown, however, that disparities persist for minority populations \nand are evident in higher rates of diabetes, heart disease, hepatitis \nB, HIV/AIDS and infant mortality, among other conditions. For instance, \nover 29 million Americans suffer from diabetes. But African Americans \nare twice as likely to be diagnosed with, and to die from, diabetes \ncompared to non-Hispanic Whites. In addition, nearly one-half of all \nAfrican Americans and Latinos experience the highest rates of adult \nobesity.\n  This year marks the 30th anniversary of the Department of Health & \nHuman Services Office of Minority Health, which leads the Nation in \nraising awareness about minority health disparities, their causes, and \nthe impact they have on minority communities and the Nation as a whole. \nTo commemorate this occasion, a renewed effort is underway with public \nand private stakeholders to accelerate achieving health equity for all \nAmericans through the development of research, community programs, and \nlegislation. We owe it to our constituents to advance this national \nmovement. For these reasons, I am proud my colleagues, Senators Hirono, \nBlumenthal, Brown, Menendez, and Schatz have joined me in introducing a \nresolution recognizing April as National Minority Health Month.\n  In our country, we are incredibly fortunate to have the National \nInstitutes of Health (NIH), which works tirelessly to improve the \nhealth of all Americans. Within the NIH, the National Institute for \nMinority Health & Health Disparities (NIMHD) has the specific mission \nof addressing minority health issues and eliminating health \ndisparities. I am proud of my role in the establishment of the NIMHD, \nwhich supports groundbreaking research at universities and medical \ninstitutions across our country. This critically important work ranges \nfrom enhancing our understanding of the basic biological processes \nassociated with health disparities to applied, clinical, and \ntranslational research and interventions that seek to address those \ndisparities.\n  Today, because of the steadfast work of committed leaders and \nindividuals\n\n[[Page S3228]]\n\nwe have made significant strides to achieving health equity for all. \nThanks to innovative reforms such as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), we \nhave made health coverage more accessible and affordable than it has \nbeen in decades. By reducing the number of uninsured Americans across \nthe country, the ACA is helping to address health inequalities. In \nMaryland, due to increased funding as a result of the ACA, over 300,000 \nMarylanders--a majority of which come from minority communities--now \nhave access to community health clinics and life-saving health care.\n  Every community across this great Nation deserves optimal health. \nOne's ethnic or racial background should never determine the length or \nquality of life. As we belatedly recognize April as National Minority \nHealth Month, let us renew our commitment to ensuring all Americans' \naccess to affordable, high-quality health care and renew our pledge to \ndo everything possible to eliminate health disparities and ultimately \nachieve health equity for all.\n  Mr. ROUNDS. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am back with my increasingly scuffed \nand battered ``Time to Wake Up'' sign now for the 138th time to urge \nthat we stop sleepwalking through history. Climate change, as we know, \nis already harming our oceans and our farms, our health and our \ncommunities. Yet here in the Senate we continue to just stand idly by \nas carbon pollution piles up in the atmosphere, driving unprecedented \nchanges in our States. I urge us again to wake up and to act with \nurgency.\n  Just 3 years ago the monitoring station atop Hawaii's Mauna Loa \nmeasured a significant milestone--400 parts per million of carbon \ndioxide in the atmosphere.\n  This chart of the data from Mauna Loa illustrates the negligible \nmarch upwards of our carbon levels. And it is not just at this one spot \nin the Pacific. The World Meteorological Organization maintains a \nglobal atmosphere watch network of atmospheric monitoring stations that \nspans 100 countries, including stations high in the Alps, Andes, \nHimalayas, as well as in the Arctic and Antarctic. Earlier this month, \nthe Cape Grim Station--perhaps aptly named--in remote northwestern \nTasmania saw its first measurement above 400 parts per million. A few \ndays later, Casey Station in Antarctica measured carbon dioxide \nconcentrations above 400 parts per million.\n  What is significant about 400 parts per million? The Earth has \nexisted in a range between 170 and 300 parts per million of carbon \ndioxide for at least the last 800,000 years--probably millions of years \nbut at least the last 800,000 years. Homo sapiens as a species have \nonly been around for about 200,000 years, so 800,000 really goes back a \nways. Primitive farming began only about 20,000 years ago. Before that, \nwe were just hunter-gatherers. So 800,000 in that context is a long, \nsafe, comfortable run for this planet that has been very good to \nhumankind in that carbon concentration window of 170 to 300. Since the \nIndustrial Revolution, when the great carbon dump began, we have \ncompletely blown out of that range.\n  At the bottom of this chart is 300.\n  What is also apparent in this chart is the breathing, if you will, of \nthe planet. The sawtooth effect of this line comes from carbon dioxide \nlevels changing as spring triggers the collective inhale of trees and \nother plant life in the Northern Hemisphere.\n  This is another version of the same data. The line at the border \nbetween the white and the lavender is the carbon data for the year \n2011--between 388 and 393 parts per million, going up and then going \nback down and then going up as the Earth inhales and exhales the carbon \ndioxide. In 2012, this was the line, up above 2011. In 2013, this was \nthe line. In 2014, this was the line. In 2015--it is hard to see, but \nit is right here where my finger is tracing and then onward from here. \nAnd this is 2016 to date, and then the data stops. It is going to \ncontinue. That shelf is just the data ending because of the time of \nyear we are in. So every single year we see the carbon dioxide levels \nmarching up and up and up.\n  Dr. Ralph Keeling is director of the Mauna Loa CO2 Program \nat the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and a sort of hero among \nscientists. He has said that he doubts carbon dioxide levels at Mauna \nLoa will ever again dip below 400 parts per million.\n  As our carbon pollution accumulates, we can actually measure the \nchange in the amount of energy trapped by the atmosphere from the Sun. \nNOAA calls this the ``Annual Greenhouse Gas Index,'' and the latest \nedition shows that in just the past 25 years, our carbon emissions have \nincreased the heat-trapping capacity of our atmosphere by 50 percent \nabove preindustrial levels. That is our doing.\n  The director of NOAA's Global Monitoring Division, Dr. Jim Butler, \nsaid: ``We're dialing up Earth's thermostat in a way that will lock \nmore heat into the ocean and atmosphere for thousands of years.''\n  Last week the Washington Post reported that both NOAA and NASA found \nApril 2016 to have been the warmest April ever recorded. What is \nremarkable is that April was the 12th consecutive month in a row in \nwhich that month was the warmest ever recorded for that month. That is \na full year's worth of months that topped every previous such month for \ntemperature, and it is the longest streak ever in NOAA's 137-year \ntemperature record.\n  One thing we know about all of this excess heat is that the oceans \nhave absorbed more than 90 percent of it. You think things are weird \nnow with the weather, imagine if the oceans had not absorbed more than \n90 percent of that excess heat. That is a measurement, not a theory. \nUnless we are going to repeal the laws of physics, we know that when \nwater warms from absorbing that 90-plus percent of the heat energy, it \nexpands. That is the law of thermal expansion. As a result, sea levels \naround the world are measurably rising because oceans are warming and \nexpanding, as well as because of ice sheets and glaciers melting.\n  Sea level rise is a serious matter for my constituents and for all \ncoastal communities. We measure approximately 10 inches of sea level \nrise at Naval Station Newport, RI, since the 1930s. Higher sea levels \nerode our shoreline. They push saltwater up into our marshes. Worst of \nall, from our human perspective, the big storms that get launched in \nthis weather come riding ashore on higher seas, and they inflict more \ndamage and worse flooding in our homes.\n  A couple of years ago, I visited South Florida with our friend \nSenator Nelson. In parts of Miami and Fort Lauderdale, sea water \ncontinues to flood streets and homes at high tide on perfectly calm and \nsunny days. It is not rain. These flooding events are occurring because \nsea level is rising.\n  A study published in February by Climate Central determined climate \nchange was to blame for approximately three-quarters of the coastal \nfloods recorded in the United States between 2005 and 2014, most of \nwhich were high-tide floods. The blue is the natural floods they \nexperienced and the red is the flooding that was driven by climate \nchange.\n  Dr. Ben Strauss, who led this analysis, said: ``[T]his is really the \nfirst placing of human fingerprints on coastal floods, and thousands of \nthem.'' And the body of science revealing those human fingerprints from \nclimate change is growing. In the past, I have said that climate change \n``loads the dice'' for extreme weather, but it is hard to link a \nparticular event to climate change. That is beginning to change as the \nscience continues to develop and the evidence continues to pile up.\n  In March, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and \nMedicine released a report outlining a rigorous science-based system \nfor attributing extreme weather events to climate change with \nstatistical confidence. In other words, scientists are now able to \nassess how the risk of an extreme weather event has changed since these \nheat-trapping greenhouse gases have altered our climate.\n  Certain kinds of extreme events are relatively straightforward to \nassess and attribute heat waves, heavy rains, certain types of drought. \nOther kinds of extreme events, such as tornadoes, wildfires, and the \nfrequency and intensity of hurricanes, are more complicated to dissect.\n  For example, heat waves are expected to become more common, more \nintense, and longer lasting because of the increase in heat-trapping \ngases in the atmosphere. An analysis of an extreme heat wave last May \nin Australia found it was made 23 times more likely to have happened \nbecause of climate change. When the odds in favor have\n\n[[Page S3230]]\n\nbecome so great, it is fair to say, according to one scientist \nassociated with that report, that ``some episodes of extreme heat would \nhave been virtually impossible without climate change.'' The \nattribution to specific events is closing in.\n  Dr. Heidi Cullen, chief scientist at Climate Central and a \ncontributor to the National Academies report, has said:\n\n       The days of saying no single weather event can be linked to \n     climate change are over. For many extreme weather events, the \n     link is now strong.\n\n  Australian researchers have determined that the ocean warming that \nled to widespread and devastating coral bleaching on the Great Barrier \nReef in March was made not 23 times more likely but 175 times more \nlikely by human-caused climate change. Average water temperatures in \nthe Coral Sea are up about 1.5 degrees Celsius since 1900. We measure \nthat. And about one-half of that 1.5 degrees is due to natural \nvariability, and 1 whole degree of it is from greenhouse gas emissions.\n  David Kline, a coral reef scientist at the Scripps Institution of \nOceanography, has said: ``We've had evidence before'' that ``human-\ninduced climate change is behind the increase in severity and frequency \nof bleaching events. But this is the smoking gun.''\n  By the way, a bleaching event on a coral reef is like a heart attack \nin a human. The reef may survive it, but it will take a long time to \nrecover, and very often the reef simply dies. With all of that \nhappening, here we are in this Chamber, sitting on our hands, helpless. \nWe have a responsibility, not only to the voters of today but to the \ngenerations who will follow us and inherit the world as we leave it to \nthem.\n  Here is how Professor of Oceanography, Dr. Laura Faye Tenenbaum, at \nNASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, describes her predicament:\n\n       As a college professor who lectures on climate change, I \n     will have to find a way to look into those 70 sets of eyes \n     that have learned all semester long to trust me and somehow \n     explain to those students, my students--who still believe in \n     their young minds that success mostly depends on good grades \n     and hard work, who believe in fairness, evenhandedness and \n     opportunity--how much we as people have altered our \n     environment, and that they will end up facing the \n     consequences of our inability to act.\n\n  Where do we look for leadership? Not to one of the leading \nPresidential contenders. This character says he is just ``not a great \nbeliever in man-made climate change.'' So there. Like the science cares \nwhat his opinion is. All the science? The decades of research by \nthousands of scientists across the globe, the pride of the scientific \nprofession? It is a ``hoax,'' he said, a ``con job,'' \n``pseudoscience,'' and ``BS.'' I guess in that latter characterization, \nhe can claim some real expertise. To my Republican colleagues, I have \nto ask: Is that really the line that we want to have about this \nproblem? Is this your guy? Are you going to stand by him on this stuff?\n  But wait, it actually gets better. Yesterday POLITICO reported the \nNew York billionaire is also applying for permission to build a \nseawall. He is a wall-building kind of guy, and he wants to build a \nseawall to protect his seaside golf resort. What does he want to \nprotect his golf resort from with a wall--rapist Mexicans coming across \nthe border? No. What he wants to defend his seaside golf resort from \nwith a wall is ``global warming and its effects.''\n  Remember the sea level rise I talked about? That is correct. That is \nwhat he said. Climate change is a hoax when his political interests \ndictate, but then it is real and a threat when his economic interests \nare involved. Throughout the discussion of climate change, how often we \nsee this--say one thing, do another.\n  I have to close by reminding my colleagues that my home State of \nRhode Island is the Ocean State. We cannot fail to take climate change \nseriously. If this is uncomfortable for my colleagues, I apologize, but \nI don't care. I have obligations to my State that I must discharge. We \nin Rhode Island are going to stand with America's leading research \ninstitutions and scientists, we are going to stand with our national \nsecurity experts, we are going to stand with the great American \ncorporations such as Apple, Google, Mars, and National Grid, we are \ngoing to stand with President Obama, and we are going to stand with \nPope Francis to do everything we can to face this climate challenge \nhead-on. I hope that soon one day it will be time when we can all wake \nup and stand together.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/25/senate-section/article/S3229-2"}, {"day": "25", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
