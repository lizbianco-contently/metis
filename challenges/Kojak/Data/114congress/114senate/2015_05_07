Mr. President, I am honored to be here today to welcome His\n\n[[Page S2700]]\n\nHoliness Aram I, Catholicos of the Great House of Cilicia.\n  Since 1995, His Holiness has served as the leader of Armenian \ncommunities across the globe, including many members of the Armenian \ndiaspora in my State of Rhode Island.\n  His Holiness will be visiting Sts. Vartanantz Armenian Apostolic \nChurch in Providence on May 30, and members of the Armenian community \nin Rhode Island look forward to welcoming him.\n  He is an accomplished scholar, a devoted humanitarian, and a strong \nspiritual shepherd.\n  Recently, we marked the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, \nwhich claimed the lives of nearly one and a half million Armenians, \nexiled over a half a million survivors, and deeply impacted all \nArmenians throughout the world.\n  On this centennial, we reflect on this exceptionally grave tragedy, \nand looking to the future, continue to work to promote both peace and \nhuman rights worldwide.\n  And there is no one better to help us do so.\n  It is indeed an honor to welcome His Holiness, to hear his words of \nprayer and reflection, and to go forward knowing that he is a powerful \nforce for tolerance and decency. I thank him for being here today and \nfor sharing his words of wisdom with the Senate and the Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is good to see the Senate----\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could ask the distinguished majority \nleader if he would be willing to go into a quorum call for a brief \nconversation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act and Bipartisan Congressional Trade \n                   Priorities and Accountability Act\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is good to see that the Senate will \nsoon be passing another important piece of bipartisan legislation.\n  The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act offers the best chance for our \nconstituents, through the Congress they elect, to weigh in on the White \nHouse's negotiations with Iran. And make no mistake--they need to have \nthat opportunity.\n  The American people were led to believe these negotiations would be \nabout ending Iran's nuclear program and--and--its enrichment \ncapabilities. But the current interim agreement makes one thing very \nclear: These talks have devolved into something else altogether. \nInstead of ending Iran's nuclear program, the interim agreement would \nactually bestow international blessing for Iran to continue it. Rather \nthan meaningfully roll back Tehran's enrichment capability and \ndismantle its nuclear infrastructure, the interim agreement would \nactually permit Iran to become a nuclear threshold state poised right \nat the edge of obtaining a nuclear weapon.\n  Iran would love nothing more than for the international community to \nrecognize its threshold program. The Iranian regime would also love to \nbe rid of the crippling sanctions that forced it to the table in the \nfirst place. Iran would, of course, divert those new funds to support \nthe Assad regime, finance terrorist proxies such as Hezbollah, \nmodernize its conventional capabilities, and further support the \nHouthis in Yemen. This would only reaffirm the fears of moderate Sunni \nallies that America is withdrawing--withdrawing--in the face of Iran's \ndetermined effort to expand its sphere of influence.\n  For all this, what would the United States gain from such an \nagreement from Iran? We would have given up our best leverage over the \nregime. And for what? That is a very good question--a very good \nquestion.\n  If a final agreement is reached that looks much like the interim \nagreement we have seen, it is not hard to perceive the possibilities of \nnegative consequences. But let me be clear. A bad agreement seems far \nmore likely to eventually lead to the kind of military conflict \neveryone wants to avoid than no agreement at all. President Obama would \nalso be leaving the task of dealing with violations of an agreement to \nhis successor.\n  I say all this to underline the need for the bipartisan Iran Nuclear \nAgreement Review Act which is before us today.\n  If we didn't face the threats of filibusters or the blocking of \namendments or the specter of Presidential vetoes, this bill would be a \nheck of a lot stronger, I assure you. But the truth is, we face all \nthose things. We do. That is the frustrating reality. The response to \nthis should not be to give the American people no say at all on a deal \nwith Iran; the response should be to overcome these challenges in a way \nthat will give Congress and the American people the best possible \nchance to review any possible deal and affect its outcome.\n  So I would urge Members of both of our parties here in the Senate to \njoin me in supporting this bill. And make no mistake--that will not be \nthe end of the story, either. This Congress is determined to pursue \nother avenues to address Iran's aggressive campaign of expansion and \nintimidation in the months to come.\n  On the topic of aggressive campaigns in pursuit of expansion and \nintimidation, there are several other countries around the world that \ncome to mind--China, for one. China is determined to dominate its \nneighbors. China wants to diminish American influence in the Pacific. \nAnd China wants to substitute American-style rules of global economic \nfair play for Chinese-style rules of monopolistic cartels and \nmercantilism. That is not an outcome any American should be willing to \naccept.\n  We are a Pacific nation. We have important allies in the region--\nnations such as Japan, Australia, South Korea, and New Zealand--that \nare today just as much of a modern, democratic, and market-oriented \nWest as we are.\n  The 21st century also promises to be an Asia-Pacific century. If we \ncare about preserving and extending American leadership globally, then \nwe cannot cede the most dynamic region in the world to China. One way \nto preserve our leadership would be to invest in the weapons systems \nand platforms that would fulfill the Obama administration's would-be \npivot to Asia. Another important way would be to demonstrate our \neconomic leadership. That is just one more reason why passing the \nBipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act is so \nimportant.\n  The United States is currently negotiating an agreement with a whole \nhost of Pacific nations--not just Japan and Australia but also \ncountries such as Canada and Chile--that would cement and enhance our \nrole in the world's fastest growing region. The so-called Trans-Pacific \nPartnership would lower unfair trade barriers to American-made goods \nand American produce sold in the Pacific. That would represent a huge \nwin for American workers and American farmers, to say nothing of the \nfar-reaching geopolitical implications for our country. But our trade \nnegotiators cannot bring this Pacific agreement back to Congress for \ncareful review and deliberation unless Congress assures our trading \npartners that the agreement is going to get a fair up-or-down vote. \nThat is just what the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and \nAccountability Act would do.\n  This bipartisan bill would also force America's trade negotiators to \nmeet congressional objectives and consult with Congress regularly \nthroughout the process. It would ensure that an agreement such as the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership could not be enacted without explicit \ncongressional approval.\n  It is a commonsense bill that was supported by a large number of \nRepublicans and Democrats in committee, passing by a vote of 20 to 6. \nSo there is no reason we shouldn't turn to this bill and then pass it.\n  The other countries in the region have made clear that they will have \nregional trade agreements with or without us, whether we participate or \nnot. And if we walk away, China will step right in, no question about \nthat.\n  So we will soon turn to the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities \nand Accountability Act, and when we do, we will have a choice to make:\n\n[[Page S2701]]\n\nWould we rather seen Chinese workers and Chinese farmers or American \nworkers and American farmers reap the economic benefits of selling more \nto this dynamic region?\n\n\n                         Tribute to Don Ritchie\n\n  Mr. President, on one final matter, I would like to bid a fond \nfarewell to one of the smartest guys around here, Don Ritchie, who will \nbe leaving us later this month. He has been the Senate's Historian \nsince 2009. Don is only the second one we have ever had. His immediate \nand only predecessor, Richard Baker, hired him when the Senate \nHistorical Office came into being in the mid-1970s. There were a lot of \napplicants to be Baker's No. 2 back then, but Don quickly rose to the \ntop of the heap. Baker said he received ``several extremely heartfelt \nletters'' of recommendation for Don that were just literally ``over the \ntop.'' One, he said, was from ``a leading diplomatic historian . . . \nwho said that in his whole 30-odd years of teaching he had never \nencountered a more perceptive or diligent . . . [or] brighter student \nthan Don.''\n  ``No more superlatives,'' he said, ``could have been used.'' \nApparently, no more superlatives were needed because Don Ritchie got \nthe job, and, so it is clear, he hasn't disappointed, even though he \ndid have to wait three decades for the big promotion.\n  Don came into the Senate with all the hype of New Coke, but his \nperformance and staying power have had more of a Coke Classic feel. Don \nlikes to say he has ``a front-row seat to the best show in town.''\n  Don is the only one we turn to when we want to learn more about where \nthe Senate has been so we can chart a better course for where it is \ngoing. He has been a great resource for my staff and me over the years. \nDon's office is there as a resource for the American public, too. He is \nthe guy you see on TV explaining the historical significance of events \nsuch as swearing-in ceremonies and inaugurations.\n  I don't think any of us would want to face him on ``Jeopardy.'' His \ndepth of knowledge really is something to behold. I am sure he has \ngained a lot of that knowledge from the part of his job he loves the \nmost, which is conducting the Senate Historical Office's Oral History \nProject. He has interviewed just about everyone you could imagine, from \nSenators, to clerks, to police officers. He even got to interview a man \nwho once worked as a congressional page--listen to this--during the \nPresidency of William Howard Taft. That page provided ``some very good \ninformation,'' Don said, even if he kept ``falling asleep several times \nduring the interview.''\n  Here is how Roll Call once described Don Ritchie: the Senate's \n``memory keeper.''\n  It is fitting, then, that the Senate voted recently to designate Don \nRitchie as Historian emeritus. It is not as though he plans to slow \ndown in retirement, anyway. ``Historians never retire,'' Don says, \n``they just have more time to research.''\n  Along with research, Don also plans to spend more time with his three \nbeloved grandchildren and to do some traveling with his wife Anne. The \nSenate wishes him the very best in retirement and sends its heartfelt \ncongratulations to a man who has been an institution around here for \nfour decades--four decades.\n  The Senate would also like to offer its congratulations to Betty \nKoed, who has just been announced by the Secretary of the Senate as our \nnext Senate Historian. We also wish Kate Scott well in her promotion to \nAssociate Historian.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Don Ritchie\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, three decades ago, when Senator Robert Byrd \nbegan drafting a series of lectures on the history of the United States \nSenate, to whom did he go for help? Don Ritchie. Ten years ago, when \nDan Brown, the popular author of the best-selling ``DaVinci Code,'' \nwanted information about the Capitol for his new novel, to whom did he \ngo? Don Ritchie. Even now, when famed historian and biographer Robert \nCaro needs facts for his five-volume work on Lyndon Johnson, he goes to \nDon Ritchie. Well, for 39 years, any person needing valuable insight \ninto the United States Senate and its history has known where to go--\nthe Senate Historian, Don Ritchie. And Don has obliged, sharing his \nwealth of knowledge with anyone who asked--Senators, staff, authors, \nhistorians, and visitors.\n  But after four decades of service, Don will officially retire from \nthe Senate Historical Office at the end of this month.\n  As the senior Senator from Kentucky stated, from his first day here \nin the Senate, Don Ritchie made this institution a better place. The \nfirst-ever Senate Historian, Don's predecessor, Richard Baker, once \nsaid, ``March 8, 1976--that's a date, like my wedding anniversary, that \nI remember.'' Indeed, that was the day Don Ritchie was hired as an \nAssociate Historian in the newly formed Senate Historical Office.\n  Don Ritchie, a former marine, was fresh out of graduate school at the \nUniversity of Maryland, having received his Ph.D. in history just a \nyear earlier. He was getting his start in the profession, driving all \nover the DC area, teaching at George Mason, Northern Virginia Community \nCollege, and University College. He was also working part time with the \nAmerican Historical Association. When offered a job in the Senate \nHistorical Office, he jumped at the chance. The rest is, as they say, \nhistory.\n  Don has served honorably as Senate Historian. Prior to that, he \nworked as Associate Senate Historian for 33 years. Over the combined 40 \nyears of service, Don has authored 12 books, 3 textbooks, and a fourth \nis now on the way. He has lectured on Senate history at just about \nevery major historical society in America. He has become a fixture on \nC-SPAN. But his crowning achievement would be his development of the \nSenate Oral History Project. Don has recorded countless interviews with \npeople who worked in the Senate, from Parliamentarians, to clerks, to \npages. Future generations of historians will better understand the \nSenate of the 20th and 21st centuries because of Don Ritchie's Oral \nHistory Project. That is an accomplishment which will stand forever.\n  On a more personal note, I have so appreciated Don's insight and \nexpertise. Every week, I begin my caucus by calling on the Senate \nHistorian, and he talks to us about so many fascinating things, things \nwe do not ordinarily know about, but they are all interesting, whether \nit is Prohibition, whether it is events that took place in the first or \nsecond Roosevelt administration--it does not matter what it is. These \nare times I look forward to, and, quite frankly, it shuts up my caucus. \nWhen he shows up, they are suddenly attentive. I would like to think \nthey are not more attentive to him than to me, but I would think that \nis the case. As I said, our lunches can be fairly boisterous, and they \nstop all conversation to listen to Don Ritchie. That is because so \noften Senators walk away from his lectures with a better understanding \nand appreciation of the Senate.\n  He has been invaluable to me and every other Senate Democrat. As we \nheard from the majority leader, he also has been very good for the \nRepublicans.\n  As he prepares for a new chapter in his life, I wish him the very \nbest. It is good news that he and his wife Anne will be jumping into \nretirement together. As we have heard, for historians, retirement only \nmeans more time to pore through books and find out what someone else \nmissed and try to take another run at writing something that is \ninteresting.\n  After a successful career as an archivist and historian, his wife \nAnne is retiring from the National Gallery of Art. Together, Anne and \nDon will have plenty of time to spend with their two daughters, \nJennifer and Andrea, and their three grandchildren, Cami, Jack, and \nBoone.\n  Even in retirement, Don will continue reading and researching about \nthis institution he and I love so dearly--the Senate. After all, as Don \nhimself points out, ``Historians don't retire''--as Senator McConnell \nsaid--``they just get more time to research.''\n  Thank you, Don Ritchie, for your four decades of service to the \nSenate and your country. You really will be missed.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S2702]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, may I ask the minority leader if it would \nbe possible to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in a quorum call.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Through the Chair, I ask my friend from Indiana how long \nthe Senator wishes to speak as in morning business.\n  Mr. COATS. No more than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I do not care. I would just like to know. That is fine.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Indiana be recognized \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the minority leader for this opportunity.\n\n\n                   Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act\n\n  Mr. President, recently on this floor, I spoke about the need to pass \nthe Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act with robust, veto-proof, \nbipartisan majorities. That is asking a lot, but I did so because this \nis the only chance we have to prevent President Obama from having a \nfree and totally independent hand to conclude a flawed agreement with \nthe Government of Iran. We cannot allow that to happen.\n  This Congress has pleaded for and worked for and will achieve the \nopportunity to play a major role in this decision, which is a decision \nof historic consequence.\n  Let me repeat what I just said. This bill is the only chance we have \nnow to prevent President Obama from having a completely free hand, with \nno opportunity to address it in a bipartisan way, to achieve success in \nrejecting a bad agreement.\n  Passage of the bill before us will result in either forcing critical \nand absolutely necessary improvements in the deal now being cooked with \nour Secretary of State and the President and his people or defeating a \nbad deal if a bad deal is presented to us.\n  The stakes in this game are beyond calculation. I personally regard \nthis as the most consequential issue of my entire public career. Our \nfailure to have an opportunity to have this Congress--the \nrepresentatives of the American people--bring before the American \npeople what is in this deal and the consequences if this deal is not a \ngood deal that will prevent Iran from having nuclear weapons \ncapability--this is absolutely essential. The only chance we have to \nexercise our constitutional right, which I believe, but our right to \naddress something of this consequence is to pass the Corker-Cardin \nbill.\n  It is not the perfect bill. It is not the bill that I think perhaps \neven Senator Corker would have preferred. But it is where we are. The \nonly way we could get here and get bipartisan support for this was to \ndo this.\n  This gives us the opportunity to do the following: A Congressional \nreview period will be provided before implementation. An opportunity \nfor Congress to vote on the agreement will be provided under Corker-\nCardin.\n  A limitation on the President's use of waivers to suspend sanctions \nthat have been put in place by this body will be taken away. A \nrequirement that Congress receive the final deal will be lost. The \nrequirement that the President certify that Iran is complying will be \ntaken away. A mechanism for Congress to rapidly reimpose sanctions in \nthe event of violations will be lost. Reporting on Iran support for \nterrorism, ballistic missile development, and human rights violations \nwill be lost. All of this is lost if we do not stand together and \ninsist on the right to engage in this. We must pass this or the defeat \nwill be of historical consequence.\n  This bill is the only chance, as I said, that Congress has to weigh \nin on a potential agreement. The stakes are too high. The consequence \nis too great to engage in changes. Many well-intended statements have \nbeen made by my colleagues, and I endorse every word of what has been \nsaid. Amendments have been offered that, had they not been offered by \nsomeone else, in a different fashion, I would have wanted to offer. We \ncan still offer those going forward.\n  But in order to achieve the bipartisan support necessary to deny the \nPresident the opportunity to have a free hand in cutting any deal he \nwants and the concessions already given--this should raise alarms in \neach of us in terms of support for this bill which is before us.\n  What are the stakes? What are the consequences? Former Secretaries \nKissinger and Shultz and other foreign policy experts did a recent Wall \nStreet Journal piece and said this:\n\n       If the Middle East is ``proliferated'' and becomes host to \n     a plethora of nuclear-threshold states, several in mortal \n     rivalry with each other, on what concept of nuclear \n     deterrence or strategic stability will international security \n     be based?\n\n  They continue:\n\n       It is in America's strategic interest to prevent the \n     outbreak of a nuclear war and its catastrophic consequences. \n     Nuclear arms must not be permitted to turn into conventional \n     weapons. The passions of the region allied with weapons of \n     mass destruction may impel deepening American involvement.\n\n  In closing, I want to address statements offered by some who argue \nthat passing this bill is unnecessary because in 2017 we will have a \nnew President in the White House and that President will be a \nRepublican. Well, I hope that is so, but there is obviously no \nguarantee of that. But in the meantime--in the meantime--Iran will \nachieve a free hand to go forward with newly acquired wealth, the will \nto achieve and the technical capability to achieve nuclear weapons \ncapability.\n  Let me conclude by supporting a statement that was made by Max Boot, \na respected foreign policy analyst:\n\n       Skeptics about the looming nuclear accord with Iran may be \n     taking comfort from the promises of Republican presidential \n     candidates to tear up the treaty as soon as they reach the \n     Oval Office. They shouldn't be. Even assuming a Republican \n     wins the White House next year--\n\n  Which, as we know, is not a certainty. Hopefully, from our \nstandpoint, we hope that is the case--\n\n     pulling out of the agreement won't necessarily fix its \n     defects. In fact, it could make the situation even worse.\n       The U.S. would then get the worst of both worlds: Iran \n     already would have been enriched by hundreds of billions of \n     dollars of sanctions relief--and it would be well on its way \n     to fielding nuclear weapons with de facto permission from the \n     international community. To avoid this nightmare scenario, \n     the best play from America's standpoint could well be to keep \n     the accord in place to at least delay Iran's decision to \n     weaponize.\n       In short, don't expect salvation in 2017. If the accord is \n     signed its consequences will be irrevocable. Whatever a \n     future president does or does not do, Iran's hard-line regime \n     will be immeasurably strengthened by the agreement. That \n     makes it all the more imperative to stop a bad agreement \n     now--not two years from now.\n\n  I urge my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to vote to give \nCongress--this Congress--the right and the opportunity to scrutinize \nevery single word of what is being negotiated with the Iranians, to \ninform the American people, and then achieve what I would hope would be \nan overwhelming rejection of the agreement if it does not achieve the \ngoal of denying Iran its nuclear weapons capability. This is a very \nimportant vote before us. I think we need to look at what the end goal \nis and how we can best get there under the circumstances which we now \nare in. We would all like to be in a different position. But to achieve \nand get to this particular point, we are looking at this particular \nbill to give us a say--a meaningful say--and an opportunity to reject a \nbad agreement which at this particular point in time, in my view, does \nnot achieve what we need to achieve and should be thoroughly \nscrutinized by us and the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation Of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

He has done \nso much to further this cause of us having a congressional review on \nwhatever is negotiated with Iran. All of us want a good agreement, but \nwe want to ensure that we play a role in ensuring that is the case. I \ncannot thank the Senator enough for his leadership on this issue and so \nmany other issues that matter relative to our national interests around \nthe world and the safety of our citizens. Again, I thank the Senator so \nmuch.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule \nXXII, the Senate vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the pending \nsubstitute amendment at 2 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Baltimore and CVS Health\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, yesterday, I took the floor to talk about \nthe events in Baltimore over the last 10 days, 2 weeks, and I spoke \nabout how Baltimore is coming together and recognized that in order to \nmove forward, there are two pillars we need to work on, and one of \nthose is public safety and justice. I talked about some initiatives we \nare looking at, including legislation that I filed that will eliminate \nprofiling by police and how we need to deal with the restoration of \nvoting rights and other issues that deal with accountability of police.\n  I also talked about rebuilding and dealing with the core issues of \nour urban centers. I just want to supplement those remarks with a \nconversation we had with CVS Health. I mention that because it was the \nCVS pharmacy that was destroyed a week ago Monday night in Baltimore. I \nthink that was seen not only in this country but around the world. It \nwas one of the major assets in a community that for too long a period \nof time did not have access to a pharmacy. It was tragic to see that it \nwas destroyed during the events in Baltimore.\n  I wish to bring to my colleagues' attention that CVS has spoken about \nthat episode, and they have made a commitment to restore the two \npharmacy locations, which will be rebuilt in the same communities in \nwhich they were destroyed. They are committed to return to the \ncommunity as quickly as possible with those services which are \ncritically important to those communities.\n  I just want to point that out that they have gone further than that. \nPreviously, I said we need the Federal Government's help in rebuilding \nand dealing with the core problems, we need State and local \ngovernments, and we need the private sector to step up and help us. CVS \nhas listened to that.\n  First, one of the things they are doing is providing a $100,000 \ndonation to the United Way of Central Maryland's Maryland Unites Fund \nand the Baltimore Community Foundation. These are funds that will be \nused to help rebuild Baltimore.\n  This is a quote from the CVS release:\n\n       These funds will help provide immediate and longer-term \n     support to people in hard-hit areas and give those \n     communities much-needed resources.\n\n  I also wish to point out what CVS did, and I think this is very \nimportant.\n  This is also a quote.\n\n       To help minimize the financial impact of the store closing \n     for its Baltimore employees, CVS/pharmacy paid them their \n     regularly scheduled hours the week of the protests, whether \n     or not they were able to work. All displaced employees who \n     want to work in other CVS/pharmacy locations will able to do \n     so.\n\n  To me, that is part of rebuilding and dealing with the problems in \nour community; that those employees, through no fault of their own, \ncould have been at a tremendous disadvantage and will get their full \npaychecks. They have a job to return to, and we are going to have those \npharmacies relocated in the communities which desperately need \nthat. That is the private sector helping us in rebuilding and dealing \nwith the problems in our city. I just wanted my colleagues to know \nabout the work of CVS Health.\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            ISIL and Authorization for Use of Military Force\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate an anniversary, \nas well as to challenge my colleagues in Congress.\n  Today marks the completion of 9 months of America's war against ISIL. \nTomorrow, May 8, starts the 10th month of this war.\n  In the war on ISIL, here is what has happened so far. We have \ndeployed thousands of troops far from home to support military \noperations in Iraq and Syria. A significant number of them are from \nVirginia, including the Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group based in \nNorfolk.\n  We have conducted more than 3,000 U.S. air strikes on ISIL from land \nbases in the region as well as from aircraft carriers.\n  We have spent more than 2 billion American taxpayer dollars--and \ncounting.\n  We have lost the lives of American servicemembers and seen American \nhostages killed by ISIL in barbaric ways.\n  And while we have seen some significant progress on the battlefield \nin Iraq, we have also witnessed ISIL spread and take responsibility for \nattacks in Afghanistan, Libya, and Yemen. We have seen other terrorist \ngroups, such as Nigeria's Boko Haram, pledge alliance to ISIL. We have \nseen acts of terrorism in Europe and now in the United States that have \nbeen influenced or at least inspired by ISIL.\n  All of this has happened in 9 months.\n  Here is what hasn't happened. Congress, the article I branch whose \nmost solemn power is the duty to declare war, has not done its job, has \nnot debated this war, has not taken any formal step to authorize what \nwas started unilaterally by the President 9 months ago.\n  As of today, ISIL has no indication whether Congress cares one iota \nabout the ongoing war. Our allies in the region who are most directly \naffected by\n\n[[Page S2704]]\n\nthe threat of ISIL have no indication whether Congress cares one iota \nabout the ongoing war. And most importantly, the thousands of American \ntroops serving in the region and serving in the theater of battle have \nno indication whether Congress cares one iota about this ongoing war.\n  In the Senate there has been no authorization vote or even debate on \nthe floor. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee did report out a war \nauthorization in December, but it died without floor action at the end \nof the 113th Congress. In the House, there has been no debate or \nauthorization on the floor. In fact, there has been no action in any \nHouse committee during the 9 months of this war.\n  The silence of Congress in the midst of this war is cowardly and \nshameful. How can we explain to our troops, our public, or ourselves \nthis complete unwillingness of Congress to take up this important \nresponsibility?\n  President Obama maintains that the authorizations voted on by \nCongress in 2001 and 2002 give him the power to wage this war without \nCongress. Having reviewed the authorizations carefully, I find that \nclaim completely without merit. The 2001 authorization allows the \nPresident to take action against groups that perpetrated the attacks of \n9/11. ISIL was not a perpetrator of the 9/11 attack; it was not formed \nuntil 2 years after the attacks, in 2003. It is not an ally of Al \nQaeda; it is now fighting against Al Qaeda in certain theaters. The \nonly way the 2001 authorization could be stretched to cover ISIL is if \nwe pretend that the authorization is a blank check giving the President \nthe power to wage war against any terrorist group. But that was \nprecisely the power that President Bush asked for in 2001, and Congress \nexplicitly refused to grant that broad grant of power to the President, \neven in the days right after the 9/11 attacks.\n  The 2002 authorization to wage war in Iraq to topple the regime of \nSaddam Hussein also has no relevance here. That regime disappeared \nyears ago.\n  The War Powers Resolution of 1973 does grant the President some \nability to initiate military action for 60 to 90 days prior to \ncongressional approval, but it also mandates that the President must \ncease military activity unless Congress formally approves it. Here we \nhave blown long past all of the deadlines of the act, Congress has said \nnothing, and yet the war continues.\n  So the President does not have the legal power to maintain this war \nwithout Congress. Yet Congress--this Congress--the very body that is so \nquick to argue against President Obama's use of Executive power, even \nthreatening him with lawsuits over immigration actions and other \nExecutive decisions, is strangely silent and allows an Executive war to \ngo on undeclared, unapproved, undefined, and unchecked.\n  So 9 months of silence leaves the impression that Congress is either \nindifferent about ISIL and the threat that it poses or lacks the \nbackbone to do the job that it is supposed to do.\n  That is why I rise today to challenge my colleagues to take this \nseriously and promptly debate and pass an authorization for military \naction against ISIL. We should have done this months ago. By now, all \nknow that ISIL is not going away soon. This problem will not just solve \nitself.\n  I am given some hope by recent actions of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee and this body on the pending matter, the Iran \nNuclear Agreement Review Act. On a challenging and important national \nsecurity issue, because of strong leadership by Senators Corker, \nCardin, and Menendez, we have shown the ability to act in a bipartisan \nway to assert an appropriate congressional role in reviewing a final \nnuclear deal with Iran. We are taking an important stand for the \ncongressional role in matters touching upon diplomacy, war, and peace, \nand we have fought off thus far the temptation to play politics with \nthis important matter.\n  This gives me some hope that we might do the same with respect to the \nwar on ISIL, because the role of Congress in war is undisputable. The \nFramers of the Constitution were familiar with a world where war was \nfor the Monarch, the King, the Sultan or the Executive. But they made a \nrevolutionary decision to choose a different path and place the \ndecisions about the initiation of war in the hands of the people's \nelected legislative branch.\n  They did so because of an important underlying value. The value is \nthis: We shouldn't order young servicemembers to risk their lives in a \nmilitary mission unless Congress has debated the mission and reached \nthe conclusion that it is in the Nation's best interest. That value \nsurely is as important today as it was in 1787.\n  To conclude, I hope we will remember that right now in places far \nfrom their homes, thousands of members of the American Armed Forces are \nrisking their lives on behalf of a mission that Congress has refused to \naddress for 9 long months. Their sacrifice should call us to step up, \ndo our job, and finally define and authorize this ongoing war.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I want to echo the sentiments of my \ncolleague from Virginia, who is also my colleague in the Foreign \nRelations Committee, for taking action on authorization for use of \nmilitary force against ISIL. This is an issue that has confronted us \nfor a while, and the Senator from Virginia has stood up forcefully time \nand again to insist that Congress fulfill its necessary role here, and \nyet we have not.\n  As he mentioned, the United States has led a multination coalition \nsince September of last year to achieve the President's stated \nobjective to ``degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.'' The White House \ninsisted when operations began that it didn't need an AUMF for this \nmission because it was on solid legal footing by using the AUMF which \nCongress had passed in 2001--2001--14 years ago. That authorization for \nuse of force went after Al Qaeda and the Taliban in the wake of the 9/\n11 attacks. Many of us took umbrage with the assertion at the time, and \nwe pushed for the administration to work with Congress to authorize a \nmission against ISIL. It was important then and it remains important \nnow for Congress to voice its support for the mission and to signal to \nour allies, as well as our adversaries, as well as our troops who are \nin harm's way, that our commitment will not change based on prevailing \npolitical winds.\n  It wasn't until the Foreign Relations Committee took initiative to \nconsider its own view on that, that the administration was forced to \nengage with Congress. The President submitted a draft AUMF to Congress \nin February of this year and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nheld hearings thereafter. Yet movement of this vital piece of \nlegislation has seemingly stalled. It remains a stalemate because the \nmajority and minority parties can't agree on how to address the use of \ncombat troops in this conflict. This is damaging to the effort to \ndefeat ISIL. Frankly, it is also damaging to the credibility and \nrelevance of this institution with regard to the conduct of foreign \naffairs.\n  The war against ISIL has been waged continuously since September of \nlast year with Congress appropriating funds for its operations. Yet \nCongress has yet to authorize the mission itself. What kind of message \ndoes that send to our allies? What kind of resolve does it provide to \nISIL? And what does it portend for others who are out there watching to \nsee what Congress will do?\n  Members of both parties in the House and the Senate pushed the \nPresident to send us an AUMF so we could authorize this mission, and in \nthe end we were successful. The White House did send language in \nFebruary of this year. When we demand engagement from the President on \nthis issue--an issue as vital as this one--and then we disengage \nourselves due to internal discord, it provides those who would choose \nnot to take Congress seriously, perhaps, further reason to avoid it.\n  Those who might be watching, whether at the White House or anywhere \nelse in the world, might be left wondering whether this Congress means \nwhat it says. Last Congress, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nmarked up and voted on two authorizations for use of military force: \none to address Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons and the other \nto authorize the mission against ISIL. Both resolutions went no further \nthan recorded votes in committee. That would lead some to question the \nrelevance of the committee, when resolutions as grave\n\n[[Page S2705]]\n\nand as important as these are simply allowed to languish.\n  The committee needs to reassert itself. We need to reassert our \nrelevance by marking up a resolution to authorize military force \nagainst ISIL and to advance it to the floor where it can get a strong \nbipartisan vote. We all know this needs to be a bipartisan product. I \nam convinced that working with other Members of the committee, we can \narrive at a bipartisan product. Obviously, I look forward to working \nwith my colleague from Virginia on this matter.\n  When we look just over the past couple of years at the engagements \nthat we have had overseas, particularly at Libya, where we had for \nseveral months a bombing campaign without Congress weighing in at all, \nwould we not have benefitted with a fulsome debate on that engagement \nand for Congress to speak and delineate our involvement there? Now we \nare faced with a situation where we have basically a failed state that \nspawns terrorists. We cannot continue to do that. We have to take \nourselves more seriously and this institution more seriously by taking \naction on this AUMF.\n  Along with the Senator from Virginia, I have been encouraged by the \nactions of the committee and this Congress recently on the Iran review \npackage that we will likely vote on later today. That vote bodes well \nfor bipartisanship here. We need to return to the time, to the extent \npossible--and we are not naive to those who believe that partisanship \ncan always stop at the water's edge--but we have to have a situation \nwhere we have a bipartisan foreign policy and where the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee takes its traditional role in formulating that \npolicy in authorizing these engagements.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Debt, Defense, and Directives and the Work Ahead\n\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, it is my honor to represent my family, \nmy neighbors, and the millions of people in my very diverse State of \nOklahoma. I am an ordinary Oklahoman. I do not come from a prominent \npolitical family or from any kind of political machine. My wife of 23 \nyears, Cindy, is here in the Gallery today. We have walked through life \ntogether and have raised two incredible girls who love God and love our \nNation. Stepping into this body was a high cost for my family. We took \nthis on together.\n  We have a tremendous staff, both here in Washington, DC, and in \nOklahoma, who sacrifice incredible time and energy for the future of \nour Nation. Every day they work incredibly hard to solve the issues \nthat we face as a nation. I am grateful to serve in this Chamber and \nfor this to be my very first time to be able to speak in this Chamber. \nThere are a few issues that I want to be able to raise and address in \nour conversation today.\n  I have the opportunity to be able to live in a heritage of \ndistinguished Oklahomans who have served in this Chamber. I serve \nalongside Senator Jim Inhofe, who has stood for conservative principles \nin this body for two decades. I am humbled to follow the irreplaceable \nDr. Tom Coburn. For those of us who are Dallas Cowboy fans, my coming \nhere is kind of like being Danny White after Roger Staubach.\n  There have been 17 other Senators from Oklahoma, great names such as \nDon Nickles, Henry Bellmon, Robert S. Kerr, David Boren, and Mike \nMonroney, just to name a few. I have the honor to sit at the same desk \non this Chamber floor used by fellow Republican Senators Tom Coburn, \nDewey Bartlett, and Edward Moore.\n  In the 1930s, Oklahoma's favorite son and humorist, Will Rogers, \nsaid:\n\n       Congress is so strange. A man gets up to speak and says \n     nothing. Nobody listens, and then everybody disagrees.\n\n  This is my first official moment to join the ranks of those who step \nup to speak, but I want to speak about a few things that I consider \nessential to the work ahead for all of us--what I call the three Ds, \nwhich I talk about all the time: debt, defense, and directives.\n  Let me take those in reverse order. The directives. People ask me all \nthe time: What do Oklahomans want from their Federal Government? The \nanswer is simple. They want to be left alone. They do not want someone \nelse, over 1,000 miles away, telling them what to do, how to run their \nbusiness, and how to run their lives. It is not that people in Oklahoma \nare antigovernment--far from it. We have a strong patriotism that \ndrives us to serve our Nation and honor those who give their lives to \npublic service.\n  Twenty years ago, Oklahoma and the Nation were devastated by a truck \nbomb in the Oklahoma City Federal building, killing 168 people, most of \nthose Federal employees. We are grateful for people in government who \nserve faithfully every day.\n  But we also understand that our Federal Government has a task, and it \nalso has a territory. Federal officers should do their task efficiently \nwith great transparency and accountability, but they also stay out of \nother people's tasks and do theirs with great effectiveness. When I \nstep into a restaurant, I may have an idea for a new recipe. But I \ncannot just wander back into the kitchen and start cooking and changing \nthe way the restaurant works. Neither can a Federal regulator drift \ninto every business and decide they are going to redo how that business \nis done. That is not their territory. That is not their job.\n  But today in America, if you want to start or run a business, you \nwill find out that the government has already made most of the \ndecisions for you about how you will run your business. Well, an \nOklahoma company recently paid a fine for not reporting to a Federal \nagency that they had nothing to report. Now, I am fairly confident that \nthe Founding Fathers, when they were envisioning a country of the \npeople, by the people, and for the people, were not envisioning that \ncitizens of the country would pay fines to their government for \nreporting they have nothing to report.\n  In the past week, I have started a bipartisan initiative called the \nCut Red Tape Initiative to try to identify ways to streamline \ngovernment, to return decisions back to individuals and local \ngovernments, and clear the clutter of regulations that benefit the \ngovernment but slow down business. Just so that people would know that \nthis process is difficult, I have faced weeks of red tape here in the \nSenate to start an initiative called Cut Red Tape. We will work through \nthat.\n  In the past few years, over 30,000 pages have been added to the \nFederal Register. Nothing in American life does not face a Federal \nregulation. To make sure the government considers the cumulative effect \nof all of those regulations, agencies are required to do a regulatory \nlookback to evaluate problem regulations each year. But most don't take \nit seriously.\n  The Department of Labor has 676 regulations and rules. This year, \ntheir regulatory lookback includes 4 regulations--4 of 676. That is not \na serious review. The new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has no \naccountability to the American people, and it has no limit to its \nauthority. They are becoming a fourth branch of government with no \nchecks or balances.\n  The EPA spends their time looking for gray areas of law in places \nwhere they can reinterpret old laws to fit their new agenda. Consent \ndecrees and novel interpretations of statutes have superseded \nconsistent rulemaking and statutory and State primacy of enforcement. \nAgencies now write rules, interpret their rules, enforce their rules, \nand establish the punishment for not following their rules. Many people \nwant to blame this administration. I disagree. This administration has \nbecome expert at pushing the boundaries; that is true. But the rise in \nthe regulatory state is not new. For decades, the Congress has \ndelegated responsibilities to agencies and given them very few \nboundaries.\n  Since the 1970s, in the Chevron case, the courts have increased the \npower of the regulatory agencies by allowing them to have deference to \ndetermine their own rules. This is not a Republican or Democrat issue. \nIt is an American issue, which will not improve until this body demands \nits constitutional authority back and clarifies to the courts that the \nConstitution states\n\n[[Page S2706]]\n\nthat all legislative authority shall lie in Congress--not in an agency.\n  The American people want to give the Federal Government their own \ndirective: Leave us alone. Now, I am willing to work with anyone who is \nwilling to work on some of these issues. So far this session, I have \ncoauthored or cosponsored bills and worked on ideas with Ted Cruz, \nElizabeth Warren, Gary Peters, John Cornyn, Heidi Heitkamp, Dianne \nFeinstein, Orrin Hatch, Mike Lee, Steve Daines, Tim Scott, Rob Portman, \nTom Carper, Angus King, Rand Paul, Jeanne Shaheen, John McCain, Mike \nEnzi, Kelly Ayotte, Mark Kirk and Ron Johnson, just to name a few.\n\n  I did not have to sacrifice my conservative values, but I did have to \nadmit that anyone can have a good idea. Just because we disagreed on \none thing does not mean I have to belittle people. I told my wife \nseveral years ago, when I first came to the House of Representatives, \nthat I had this deja vu moment, thinking I had felt this way before. I \nhave never been in politics or Congress, but I know this feeling. After \nabout 6 months I called her and I said: I finally figured out what this \nfeeling is to be in Congress. It is the emotion you have in middle \nschool lunch. It is that feeling that I get more popular by sitting at \nmy table and making fun of everyone else at everyone else's table. And \nif I ever say something nice about someone else at another table, my \ntable shakes their head and says: Why would you do that? But if I ever \nsay something unkind, everybody says: Way to go. Welcome to Congress.\n  Only we can turn this around. We will strongly disagree on areas, but \nwe should find the areas of common ground where we do not have to \nsacrifice our values and be able to find ways to work together.\n  The second issue is defense--directives and defense. Our freedom is \nforeign to most of the world, and it is a threat to them, not because \nthe United States is an aggressor nation--far from it--but because the \nliberty we export is so powerful they know well it can depose their \ndictatorships and weaken their control. Many government leaders around \nthe world would rather keep their people poor and closely managed than \nallow them to be prosperous and free.\n  Iran is on the rise. Since the 1979 revolution, Iran has exported \nterrorism around the world. I am convinced that some individuals--even \nin this administration--trust Iran's words more than they trust \nhistory, the facts on the ground or even their own intuition. We cannot \nallow the largest exporter of terrorism in the world to have nuclear \nweapons. We cannot do that.\n  Dictatorial governments around the world and totalitarian Islamic \nleaders consistently test our mettle, probe our infrastructure and \ncomputer systems, test our passion for freedom and our resolve for the \ndignity of every person. By the way, that is one of our core values. \nEvery person--even people we disagree with--is valuable. It is why the \nissue of race--just as a side note--is so important to us in America--\nbecause we understand that in many parts of the world if you are from \nthe wrong family, the wrong tribe, the wrong race or the wrong faith, \nyou cannot get a job, you cannot get government services, you cannot \nget housing--all of those things.\n  That is how other places do it. That is not us. We have chosen not to \nbe like that as a nation. Where injustice exists, we want to bring \nfreedom and equality--within our boundaries or around the world.\n  We believe every person is created equal and is endowed by their \nCreator with certain inalienable rights--every person. When brutal \nthugs attack innocent nations, we have the moral high ground to call \nout the aggressor and to stand with the oppressed. We always work with \nresolve to solve the issues peacefully. We understand this proverb: ``A \ngentle answer turns away wrath.''\n  Our diplomacy leads the way. But when nations and philosophies will \nnot stop their aggression, they learn that we do not bear the sword for \nnothing. I have the privilege--and I do count it as a privilege--of \nserving thousands of men and women and their families who faithfully \nprotect our Nation every day in all branches of the military--first \nresponders on our streets, in the intelligence community, at our ports, \nin the air, training, equipping, and protecting hundreds of thousands \nin Oklahoma. In fact, without Oklahoma, just so this body will know, \nour Nation could not sustain our Air Force, train our pilots, rearm our \nmunitions, fire artillery or rockets, talk to our subs, train our young \nsoldiers, refuel our aircraft, control battlefield airspace or deliver \nsupplies. So you are welcome for what happens in Oklahoma every day.\n  Our Guard and Reserve units have fulfilled everything that has been \nasked of them by their Nation, some of them to their last full measure \nof devotion. But in Oklahoma our patriotism also challenges us to deal \nwith military waste when it takes money, especially directly from the \nwarfighter. Why would we call waste in defense patriotism? Let's solve \nit. We want the intelligence community to be well equipped. We want \nthem to be attentive to the issues around the world, but we also want \nour Fourth Amendment freedoms protected. Remember, Oklahomans like to \njust be left alone.\n  The third issue is our debt--directives, defense, and debt. Our \neconomy runs on increasing debt. That is how we are actually managing \nlife day to day nowadays. We gamble every year that interest rates will \nnot go up and the rest of the world will still want our bonds. This \nyear we paid $229 billion in interest payments. Think about that for a \nminute--$229 billion.\n  The highway trust fund is short just $10 billion, and we are spending \n$229 billion just in interest payments this year. CBO estimates that we \nwill spend over $800 billion in interest payments by the end of the 10-\nyear window. That is more than we spend on all defense spending, \neducation, transportation, and energy combined--what we will do just in \ninterest payments in the years ahead.\n  We need to fix two things in this budget hole: efficiently manage \nFederal spending and a growing economy, duplication in programs. All \nthese things need to be resolved.\n  Let me take a couple of these things. Efficiency in the Federal \nGovernment. We need to deal with the tremendous fraud and waste and \nduplication. Where we see it, we should go after it. For the past 2 \nweeks, I have held a bill that funds a grant program for bulletproof \nvests.\n  I am not opposed to the program. I am opposed to the fact that we \nhave two programs that do the same thing--two different applications, \ntwo different sets of processes, two programs that do the same thing. \nIf we see it, we should solve it. Yesterday, we marked up and passed a \nbill in committee that I authored called the Taxpayer Right to Know \nAct, which will identify duplicative programs, the administrative cost, \nthe number of full-time staff, and how and if programs are evaluated.\n  It is a commonsense thing to do that, and it passed by a voice vote \nout of the committee. In the days ahead, I hope we will use that tool \nwisely to be able to actually identify where we have duplication, and \ninstead of complain about it, we solve it as a body. The goal is to \nfind those and eliminate them.\n  A friend of mine in Oklahoma is a former marine. His name is Hank. \nHank runs a small business. Hank is a guy who if you see him, you need \nto brace yourself because when he shakes your hand you know it. Hank \nruns his small business from a desk in his unair-conditioned garage.\n\n  When I think about the way we spend money, I often think of Hank. \nHank is not a guy who wants to have our government suffer or our Nation \ndo something weak. Hank is an incredible patriot, but he wants us to \nspend money wisely, and when we find waste, he would expect us to get \nrid of it. He does. He would expect that we do.\n  A good example of that may be Social Security disability. It is a \ndifficult issue for us to talk about because we want a safety net for \nthe truly vulnerable, but we all know there is incredible waste in that \nprogram, and there are people who are ripping off the system. To have a \nstrong safety net for the vulnerable doesn't mean we allow people to \nfreeload off the top. Disability is designed for people who cannot work \nin any job in the economy, not someone who just doesn't want to.\n  Let's find a way to protect our vulnerable but incentivize those who \nare freeloading off the system to engage them back into work. We need \npeople to work.\n\n[[Page S2707]]\n\n  The earned-income tax credit is another one of those. We read the \nreports every year: a 24-percent fraud rate, the highest fraud rate in \nthe Federal Government. Last year, there was $14.5 billion in loss; one \nprogram, $14.5 billion.\n  We have to pay attention to this. We have to get the economy going or \nwe will never fix the debt. We can't just fix it by reducing spending. \nWe all know that well. Tax reform seems to be the elusive dream of our \neconomy. I can only hope that as a body we will not continue to strive \nfor large-scale tax reform and fail to do some things that are \nsignificant and possible.\n  Banking reform must be done. Dodd-Frank is choking out lending. Now, \nI don't want to attack any individual who voted for it, but I am very \nwell aware that there are many unintended consequences that have come \ndown, especially on community banks.\n  People can feel our economy tightening and the lending tightening. \nThey don't know why. Main Street community banks are dealing with \nuncertain regulations. We have to get our community banks back in \nbusiness. We can do that by exempting traditional banks from heavy \nregulatory burdens that complex banks face and replacing simple capital \nrequirements. This isn't controversial or complicated. We just need to \nwork on some simple things while we still work on the complex.\n  Trade. We are a nation that believes in trade. Quite frankly, our \nNavy was created in the infancy of our Republic to protect our trade. \nIn fact, one of our grievances that we had with King George in the \noriginal Declaration of Independence was the King was cutting off our \ntrade with all ports of the world. Trade has been a big deal to us as a \nnation since before we were a nation.\n  Currently, this ongoing debate about whether we will be a nation of \ntrade seems to be a little odd to me. Yes, we are going to be a nation \nof trade. We always have been. Let's work it out and let's continue to \ngrow our economy.\n  Energy issues. The past 6 years the brightest star in our economy has \nbeen energy. If we want to have the economy grow, energy is going to be \na major part of that formula. If anyone disagrees with that, I would \nlove to get a chance to meet them because I can show you all the job \ngrowth that has happened in America just circled around energy. But we \nall know EPA policies make energy development harder and increase the \nenergy cost of everything for every person in America.\n  Energy jobs are great-paying jobs, but they are suddenly fading away \nbecause of this mixture of low oil prices and bad energy policy. A few \nyears ago, America was led to believe they were running out of oil and \ngas and our supplies were going away. Now our supplies are at record \nnumbers and we keep finding more.\n  In the past 6 months, America has lost 100,000 jobs because we have \nstopped drilling because our tanks are full and the prices have \ncollapsed. If we could only sell that oil, what a difference that might \nmake to our economy. You see, we can sell our coal and we can sell our \nnatural gas, but for whatever reason we as a nation are still thinking \nwe can't sell oil. Now, we can sell gasoline, just not oil. It would be \nkind of like saying you can sell flour, but you can't sell wheat.\n  Currently, we import about 27 percent of our crude. Most of that is \nheavy oil that is imported. Most of that is done by foreign ownership, \nforeign ownership of refineries. They are bringing in their own oil. \nMost of our new finds are in light sweet oil, a different type of oil \nthat our refineries don't need. Do you know who needs this? Mexico \nneeds it, Canada needs it. So, literally, while our storage tanks are \nat maximum capacity and the prices continue to drop in America, the \nrest of the world is craving our oil, and we are debating whether that \nis a good idea. It is the ultimate irony right now that the \nadministration is in negotiations to open the sale of Iranian oil to \nthe world market, and we cannot sell oil from America on the world \nmarket.\n  Let's pay attention to American jobs. Let's get our economy going. \nThere are some basic things we can do.\n  All this talk about security, economy, and liberty boils down to one \nthing, though--our families. Nothing is bigger in our Nation than our \nfamilies--nothing. We are not a nation of wealth, we are a nation of \nfamilies. The rise of government is directly connected to the collapse \nof families. It is not that government is pushing down families, it is \nthat families are collapsing and government is trying to rise to fix \nthat. It will not fix it. Government can't fix a family, but we can \nmake sure there is no marriage penalty in our tax law. We can make sure \nwe don't incentivize broken families and our social welfare programs. \nWe can actually use our moments in our times when we speak to state the \nobvious. America is strongest when American families are strong. Let's \nnot be afraid to step out and protect what we know works. We don't live \nin a nation with no hope. We live in a nation of incredible hope.\n  The seeds are all still there. It is a matter of how much we are \ngoing to engage in those things, whether we are going to be an exporter \nof freedom and of our basic values. That is what I think we should do.\n  We should export our freedom to the world. We should export our \nvalues to the world. We will do that best as we protect our families \nand as we rise to speak about the things we know are right.\n  There is a tremendous diversity of American opinion, freedom of \nspeech, but before the Framers even mentioned free speech, they \nmentioned the free exercise of religion. It is popular culture now for \npeople to be intolerant of people of faith and people who live their \nfaith. You can say you have faith, but you are pushed down if you \nactually practice the faith you say you have. I served 22 years in \nministry before I came to Congress. I have a little different \nperspective than some on that. I see our Nation with a great spiritual \nhunger. I don't criticize Washington, though, in the process. Quite \nfrankly, I believe Washington perfectly reflects our culture, and to \npeople who are frustrated with what Washington has become, I remind \nthem, this is who we are as a nation.\n  What we are going to do about it becomes the big issue. What are we \ngoing to become? While we beat ourselves up, we lose track that the \nrest of the world still looks at us, and they still want to be us.\n  Last September, I was in Central America for a few days meeting with \nsome of the leaders there talking about immigration. I don't know if \nanyone has noticed, but there are a few issues about immigration now. \nWe had this conversation about immigration and started talking about \nwhat are we going to do and how are we going to limit the number of \nthese unaccompanied minors coming in and what is actually driving them \nto come.\n  One of the leaders there said: Sir, I don't know if you have noticed, \nbut you are the United States of America. Everyone in the world wants \nto go there. There doesn't have to be a driving factor to go to your \nnation. Everyone wants to be your nation.\n  We do not have open borders, nor should we. But it was another lesson \nlearned that while we argue among ourselves, we have the opportunity to \nbe able to serve in the greatest Nation, in the greatest body in the \nworld. We still lead the world with our values. We should represent \nthat well. That is our greatest export, our values.\n  This is the National Day of Prayer, and I thought it would be \nentirely appropriate to be able to end this conversation with both a \nreminder to call our Nation to prayer and to remember Psalm 46:1-2:\n\n       God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in \n     trouble. Therefore we will not fear.\n\n  So we not only remember that, but let us actually call this Senate to \npray.\n  Let us pray.\n  Our Father, I pray for our Nation. I pray that You would give us \nwisdom and direction. I pray for this body, incredible men and women \nwho have set aside their families, their careers, and their life, to \ncome serve their Nation. I pray that You would give us unity of \nattitude and diversity of opinion and that You give us the capacity to \nbe able to solve the issues ahead of us.\n  I pray for President Obama, for Vice President Biden, the Supreme \nCourt, for the House of Representatives, for the men and women around \nthe world right now who are serving quietly in ways of intelligence, \npublically as first responders and leaders, and our military scattered \nacross the Earth. God,\n\n[[Page S2708]]\n\nwould You protect them and would You allow us, as families and as \nleaders, to represent You and the values of our Nation to a world that \nneeds our leadership still.\n  God, use this time. Use us. As broken as we are, we know that You are \nan ever-present help in time of trouble, and we will not fear.\n  Thank you, Jesus. Amen.\n  Madam President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). The majority leader.\n\n\n                    Congratulating Senator Lankford\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I wish to say to my new colleague \nfrom Oklahoma, what an insightful assessment of the challenges facing \nour country and an extraordinary list of solutions to those challenges, \nnot to mention reminding us all that we are the envy of the world.\n  So I congratulate our new colleague from Oklahoma. I wish him well \nand thank him for his fine remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the time from 11:30 a.m. until 12:50 p.m. \nwill be equally divided, with the majority controlling the first half \nand the Democrats controlling the second half.\n\n\n                      NSA Counterterrorism Program\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, since the unlawful leaks of NSA \nprograms, opponents of our counterterrorism program have painted a \ndistorted picture of how these programs are conducted and overseen by \nexploiting the fact that our intelligence community cannot discuss \nclassified activities. So what you have is an effort to characterize \nour NSA programs, and the officials who conduct them cannot discuss the \nclassified activities. So they are clearly at a disadvantage.\n  Since September 11, 2001, FISA has been critically important in \nkeeping us safe here in America. According to the CIA, had these \nauthorities been in place more than a decade ago, they would likely--\nlikely--have prevented \n9/11. Not only have these tools kept us safe, there has not been a \nsingle incident--not one--of an intentional abuse of them.\n  The NSA is overseen by the executive, legislative, and judicial \nbranches of our government. They are not running rogue out there. The \nNSA is overseen by the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of \nour government. The employees of NSA are highly trained, supervised, \nand tested.\n  The expiring provisions of FISA are ideally suited for the terrorist \nthreats we face in 2015. These provisions work together to protect us \nfrom foreign terrorists abroad who use social and other media to \nconspire and eventually plan attacks inside the United States.\n  ISIL uses Facebook, uses Twitter, its online magazine, and other \nsocial media platforms to contact and eventually radicalize recruits \nonline. If our intelligence community cannot connect the dots of \ninformation, we cannot stop this determined enemy from launching \nattacks.\n  Under section 215 authority, the NSA can find connections--find \nconnections--from known terrorists overseas and connect that to \npotential terrorists in the United States. But the NSA cannot query the \ndatabase, which consists of call data records such as the number \ncalling, the number called, and the duration, without a court order.\n  Let me say that again. NSA cannot query the database, which consists \nof call data records such as number calling, the number called, and the \nduration, without a court order. Under section 215, the NSA cannot \nlisten to phone calls of Americans at all. Under section 215, the NSA \ncannot listen to the phone calls of Americans at all.\n  Despite the value of the section 215 program and the rigorous \nsafeguards that govern it, critics of the program either want to do \naway with it or make it much more difficult to use. Many of them are \nproposing a bill--the USA FREEDOM Act--that they say will keep us safe \nwhile protecting our privacy. It will do neither. It will neither keep \nus safe nor protect our privacy. It will make us more vulnerable and it \nrisks compromising our privacy.\n  The USA FREEDOM Act would replace section 215 with an untested, \nuntried, and more cumbersome system. It would not end bulk collection \nof call data. Instead, it would have untrained--untrained--corporate \nemployees with uncertain supervision and protocols do the collecting. \nSo it switches this responsibility from the NSA, with total oversight, \nto corporate employees with uncertain supervision and protocols. They \nget to do the collecting. It would establish a wall between the NSA \nanalysts and the data they are trying to analyze. At best, the new \nsystem envisioned by the USA FREEDOM Act would be more cumbersome and \ntime consuming to use when speed and agility are absolutely crucial. At \nworst, it will not work at all because there is no requirement in the \nlegislation that the telecoms hold the data for any length of time. Put \ndifferently, section 215 helped us find the needle in a haystack, but \nunder the USA FREEDOM Act, there may not be a haystack to look through \nat all.\n  In short, the opponents of America's counterterror programs would \nrather trust telecommunication companies to hold this data and search \nit on behalf of our government. These companies have no programs, no \ntraining or tools to search the databases they would need to create, \nand if that isn't bad enough, we would have to pay them to do it. The \ntaxpayers would have to pay them to do it.\n  In addition to making us less safe, the USA FREEDOM Act would make \nour privacy less secure. The section 215 program is subject to rigorous \ncontrols and strict oversight. Only a limited number of intelligence \nprofessionals have access to the data. There are strict limits on when \nand for what purpose they can access the data. Their access to the data \nis closely supervised with numerous--numerous--levels of review. These \nsafeguards will not apply to the untried and novel system under the USA \nFREEDOM Act, and rather than storing the information securely at NSA, \nthe information would be held by private companies instead.\n  There was an excellent editorial today in the Wall Street Journal \npointing out the challenges we face. It was entitled the ``Snowden \nBlindfold Act.'' The ``Snowden Blindfold Act'' was the headline in the \nWall Street Journal today.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a copy of that article.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 7, 2015]\n\n                       The Snowden Blindfold Act\n\n       Congress moves to weaken antiterror surveillance while \n     France expands it.\n       At least one of the gunmen who shot up a Texas free speech \n     event on Sunday was known to the FBI as a potentially violent \n     radical and was convicted in 2011 on a terror-related charge. \n     The Islamic State claimed credit for this domestic attack, \n     albeit an unproven connection. So it is strange that Congress \n     is moving to weaken U.S. surveillance defenses against the \n     likes of shooters Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi.\n       Two years after the leaks from Edward Snowden's stolen \n     dossier, a liberal-conservative coalition is close to passing \n     a bill that would curtail the programs the National Security \n     Agency has employed in some form for two decades. Adding to \n     this political strangeness, France of all places is on the \n     verge of modernizing and expanding its own surveillance \n     capabilities for the era of burner cell phones, encrypted \n     emails and mass online jihadist propaganda.\n       The Patriot Act expires at the end of the month, and a \n     fragile House-negotiated compromise on reauthorization would \n     end NSA sweeps of telephone metadata--the date, time stamps \n     and duration of calls. The content of those calls isn't \n     collected without a separate warrant. The measure also \n     includes mostly cosmetic nuisance changes such as a panel of \n     outside amicus lawyers to advise the secret Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) that supervises and \n     approves NSA activities.\n       But the metadata eulogies are premature before what ought \n     to be a sturdy debate in the Senate. Majority Leader Mitch \n     McConnell introduced a ``clean'' extension of current law as \n     a base bill that the chamber will open to amendments later \n     this month. The Senate narrowly defeated a bill similar to \n     the House measure last year, and we hope it does so again.\n       Senators should think carefully about the value of metadata \n     collection, and not only because the technical details of the \n     House bill are still being parsed by security experts. In \n     January 2014, President Obama\n\n[[Page S2709]]\n\n     tried to suppress the Snowden wildfire by pronouncing the end \n     of ``bulk metadata program as it currently exists,'' via \n     executive order. Civil libertarians rejoiced. Yet NSA \n     transparency disclosures show the FISC court approved 170 \n     search applications of the database in the same calendar \n     year.\n       Presumably the NSA continued to analyze metadata--despite \n     pro forma White House opposition--because these details \n     provide intelligence that is useful for uncovering plots, \n     preventing attacks and otherwise safeguarding the country. \n     The NSA must demonstrate to FISC judges a ``reasonable, \n     articulable suspicion'' to gain approval for each \n     ``selector,'' or search query.\n       In other words, there is little invasion of privacy because \n     the searches are narrow. The NSA isn't even using automated \n     algorithms to reveal suspicious patterns the way that credit \n     card companies and retailers mine consumer data every day. \n     The NSA's 170 metadata searches involved merely 160 foreign \n     targets and 227 known or presumed U.S. citizens.\n       There is still no evidence that the data have been abused. \n     The Supreme Court has held since Smith v. Maryland in 1979 \n     that the Constitution provides no guarantee of metadata \n     privacy. Domestic police and prosecutors in routine criminal \n     investigations enjoy more warrantless access to metadata well \n     beyond even the NSA status quo.\n       The House bill pretends not to undermine intelligence \n     collection by requiring telecom and tech companies to retain \n     metadata business records. The NSA could then request these \n     documents with FISC consent or unilaterally in an emergency. \n     But assembling this information retroactively may be too slow \n     in a true crisis--in return for little or no added privacy \n     protection. After the hacking breaches at Sony, Target and a \n     string of health insurers, Americans may reasonably wonder if \n     their data are safer fragmented across many private third-\n     party repositories.\n       The Members of Congress who know the most about \n     intelligence know all this, but they say that ending metadata \n     collection is the price of blocking a political stampede that \n     might also kill more important provisions such as Section 702 \n     that authorizes foreign-to-foreign wiretaps. That might have \n     been true immediately after the Snowden heist, but it may not \n     be true after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo and in Texas by \n     Islamic State-inspired jihadists.\n       Those shootings show that surveillance is more crucial than \n     ever to prevent mass murder on U.S. soil by homegrown or \n     foreign radicals. The French understand this, which is why \n     they are widening their intelligence reach. No prevention can \n     ever be perfect. But the House measure is a deliberate effort \n     to know less and blind U.S. spooks to potentially relevant \n     information. This self-imposed fog may be politically \n     satisfying now, but deadly if there is another attack.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Finally, I would like to ask the senior Senator from \nNorth Carolina, who is the chairman of the Select Committee on \nIntelligence, the following question: Why was it necessary to enact the \nprovisions of the PATRIOT Act after the attacks of 9/11/2001, and why \nare they relevant today given the threat we face from ISIL and Al \nQaeda?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I appreciate the question the leader has \nasked, and, also, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a colloquy with \nmy Republican colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. The leader raises a great question, and it is really the \npurpose for which section 215 was created. It is the reason the NSA \nlooked at ways to effectively get in front of threats that take us back \nto 9/11 and the attacks.\n  As we reacted, through our law enforcement tools within the United \nStates, we used an instrument called a national security letter. They \nproduced a national security letter. They had to go to the telecoms and \nask that they search their systems for this information.\n\n  The leader alluded to the fact that many looking back to pre-9/11 \nsaid that had we had the tools we have today, we might have stopped \nthis attack. But over a series of years, Congress, the executive \nbranch, the Justice Department, and our intelligence community worked \nto refine the tools we thought could effectively be used to get in \nfront of a terrorist attack.\n  That brings us to where we are today. Over those years, we created \nsection 215, the ability to use bulk data. What is bulk data? Bulk data \nis storing telephone numbers--we have no idea to whom they belong--that \nare foreign and domestic. The whole basis behind this program is that \nas a cell phone is picked up in Syria and we look at the phone numbers \nthat phone talked to, if it is someone in the United States, we would \nlike to know that--at least law enforcement would like to know it--so \nwe can understand if there is a threat against us here in the homeland \nor somewhere else in the world.\n  Section 215 allows the NSA to collect, in bulk, telephone numbers \nwith no identifier on them. We couldn't tell you who that American \nmight be. And if for a reason they believe they need to look at that \nnumber because of an Executive order from the President, they go to a \njudge, and the judge is the one who gives them permission to search or \nquery that data. If, in fact, they find a number that connects with one \nof a known terrorist, they have to go back to the court and prove there \nis reason for them to know whose number that is and the duration of \ntime of the conversation. Further information requires further judicial \naction.\n  Why are we here today? Because this expires on May 31. Some would \nsuggest it is time to do away with it.\n  Over the same period of time, we added something the American people \nhave been very close to. It is called the TSA. Every time we go to an \nairport, we go through a security mechanism. Americans have never \ncomplained about it. Why? Because we know that when we get on the \nairplane, there is a high degree of likelihood that there is not a \nterrorist, a bomb, or some type of weapon that is going to be used \nagainst us.\n  The leader said there has not been a single instance of a breach of \nprivacy. Yet, those who suggest we need to change this do it 100 \npercent on the fact that privacy has been invaded. Let me say to all my \ncolleagues, to the public, and to both sides of the Hill, today every \nAmerican now has a discount grocery card on their key chain. They go \nand buy groceries and they proudly scan that card because it gets them \na discount, it gets them coupons, it gets them a gas reduction. Here \nare the facts: Your grocery store collects 10 times the amount of data \nthat the NSA ever thought about collecting on you.\n  There is a big difference between the NSA and your grocery store: The \nNSA doesn't sell data; your grocery store does. From the data they \ncollect, they could do a psychological profile on an individual. They \ncould tell you how old they are, what their health is, where they live, \nhow often they shop, therefore when they work. We are not in the \nbusiness of doing that. They are. But I don't hear anybody complaining \nabout the grocery stores' discount card because you get a discount, so \nyou are willing to do that.\n  What we haven't shared with the American people is, what do you get \nthrough this program? You get the safety and security of knowing we are \ndoing everything we possibly can to identify a terrorist and the act \nand to stop it before it happens.\n  So we are here today with a choice. The choice is whether we are \ngoing to reauthorize this program, which has been very effective, with \nthe same conditions the President has in place--you have to go to a \njudge--and with important controls on privacy by professionals with \nrules, or whether we are going to roll it back to the telecoms. Make no \nmistake about it--the compromise legislation rolls us back to the same \nthing we were doing pre-9/11.\n  So whether we let it expire or we reauthorize it, those are the two \nchoices because this compromise bill actually forces it back to \ntelecoms--very cumbersome, time-consuming, and, I would say, fraught \nwith privacy issues, as the leader pointed out. It is my choice to \ncontinue the program because the program has worked.\n  NSA only has less than three dozen people who have the authority to \nlook at this data. I will bet there would be more people in every \ntelecom company who are authorized to search data.\n  Let me suggest this to my colleagues: If their argument is valid, \nthen they should be on the floor with a similar bill eliminating the \nTSA. I am not sure anybody invades my privacy any more than the TSA \nprocess. When I go through, they x ray me, they look at my luggage. In \nsome cases, they stop me and wand me and, in some cases, hand-check me. \nI am not sure there are any more blatant privacy concerns than that. \nBut they are not in here suggesting we do away with TSA because they \nknow the public understands the safety TSA provides to aviation.\n  Our big mistake is we haven't been out here sharing with the American \npeople why it has been so long since there has been an attack. We were\n\n[[Page S2710]]\n\nlucky this week in Garland, TX--lucky because 40-some Texas law \nenforcement officers happened to be at a museum, and everybody there \nwas carrying. We are not going to be lucky every time.\n  I remind my colleagues and the public, in the same week, ISIL went on \nsocial media networks and said: America, don't think that you have got \nthis in your rearview mirror. There are over 70 terrorists that we have \nin America in 15 States, and it is a matter of time before it happens.\n  Why in the world would we think about rolling back the tools that are \nthe only tools that put us post-9/11 versus pre-9/11?\n  The threat is greater today domestically and around the world than it \nhas ever been, and the argument we will be consumed with is whether we \ndo away with tools that have been effective for law enforcement to \nprotect America.\n  I would suggest that we reauthorize this bill for 5.5 years as is and \nthat we make the same commitment to the American people we do when we \nreauthorize and fund the TSA: No matter where you are, we have \ncontrols. We are going to keep America safe. We are not going to let it \nrevert back to where we are susceptible to another 9/11.\n  With that, I turn to Senator Cotton, my distinguished colleague from \nArkansas, and ask whether he agrees that the collection of telephone \nand call data does not raise any reasonable expectations of privacy \nunder the Fourth Amendment.\n  Mr. COTTON. Madam President, I thank the Senator from North Carolina, \nand I appreciate his work and the majority leader's work on this \ncritical issue. I have been working hand in glove with them all along.\n  I would say the answer to the question is, no, this does not raise \nany reasonable concern about privacy. In fact, the program does not \ncollect any content. It does not surveil any phone call. It doesn't \neven include any personally identifiable information.\n  I have spent hours with the intelligence officers and the FBI agents \nwho are responsible for administering these programs--not merely the \ngeneral counsels or the directors of these agencies but the men and \nwomen who administer them. I have asked them what they think poses a \ngreater risk to their privacy--the discount grocery card the Senator \nfrom North Carolina mentioned or the fact that e-commerce Web sites \nhave their name, address, credit card number, and personal history? And \nto a person, every one of them said a greater threat to their privacy \nis commercial marketing practices, not this program.\n  The program has been approved 40 times by 15 different independent \nFederal judges based on 36 years of Supreme Court precedent and has \nbeen approved by two Presidents of both parties. If President Obama \nwanted to end the program tomorrow, he could, but he hasn't. That is \nbecause this program is lawful, it is faithful to the Constitution, it \nis smothered with safeguards against abuse, and it is needed to fight a \nrising terrorist threat that we face today. In fact, those threats \ntoday are greater than they were on \n9/11. And that is not my opinion; that is the testimony of this \nadministration's senior intelligence officials.\n  The rise of Al Qaeda affiliates in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula \nand the broader Middle East illustrates the metastasis of Al Qaeda \nfollowing its retreat from Afghanistan. These groups are larger and \nmore spread out than their predecessors. They are also more \ntechnologically and operationally savvy, developing new, nonmetallic \nbombs, recruiting westerners, and using the Internet to spread their \nhatred. They even publish ``how to'' manuals for becoming a successful \nterrorist at home.\n  Of course, there is the Islamic State--the Obama-described ``JV \nteam''--which has cut the heads off of innocent Americans, is torturing \nand murdering Christians and other religious minorities, and has \nsadistically burned people alive. More than 20,000 foreigners have gone \nto Syria and Iraq to join this enemy. Some have returned to their home \ncountries, including the United States, some have remained in their \nhome countries, becoming more radicalized and ready to inflict harm \nagainst Americans.\n  We don't have to look any further than this past week, when two \nIslamic State-inspired jihadists decided to open fire in Texas. Press \nreports indicate that one of the attackers was in contact with an ISIS \nsupporter currently located in Somalia. This conduct illustrates why \nthis program is so important. It helps close the gap that exists \nbetween foreign intelligence gathering and stopping attacks here at \nhome. This is the gap that contributed in part to our failure to stop \nthe 9/11 attacks.\n  There are also open source reports of ISIS cells in Virginia, \nMaryland, Illinois, California, and Michigan. As a member of the \nIntelligence Committee, I receive regular briefings on such threats, \nand I invite all my colleagues to receive these briefings if they doubt \nthat the wolves are at the door or even in our country.\n  This highlights one challenge of this debate: Most of the information \nsurrounding the plots and the programs is classified. The intelligence \ncommunity has been very accommodating in providing classified briefings \nto Members of the Senate and the Congress. The issue, though, is often \ngetting Members to attend or to visit with the agencies. That is why I \nbelieve the Senate may have to enter a closed session as we debate \nthese programs, so that Members are not woefully ignorant of the \nthreats America faces.\n  Under consideration in the House and proposed in the Senate is the \nso-called USA FREEDOM Act, which will eliminate the essential \nintelligence this program collects. Proponents of the bill claim that \nit provides alternative ways for the intelligence community to obtain \ncritical information needed to stop terrorist attacks and that it \ndoesn't compromise our counterterror efforts. But let me be clear. This \nis wrong. The alternatives to the current program do not come close to \noffering the capabilities we now have that enable us to protect \nAmericans.\n  One alternative offered by opponents is to have phone companies \nretain control of cell data and provide the NSA only the data \nresponsive to searches phone companies would run on the agency's \nbehalf. This isn't technologically feasible.\n  At the request of the President's own Director of National \nIntelligence, the independent National Research Council examined this \nproposal, and its experts concluded that the technology does not \ncurrently exist that would enable a system spread among different \ncarriers to replace the capabilities of the current NSA metadata \nprogram. Any such system would create holes in our ability to identify \nterrorist connections.\n  First, phone companies don't store the data for longer than 180 days \nand oftentimes for much shorter periods, and nothing in the USA FREEDOM \nAct requires them to store it any longer. The current NSA program, \nhowever, stores data for 5 years, which allows the NSA to discover \npotential terrorist links during that time period. A system that keeps \ndata with multiple carriers that store their data for much shorter time \nperiods is close to useless in discovering terrorist network and \nsleeper cells, many of which lie in wait for years before launching an \nattack.\n  Second, a system that tries to search multiple carriers and then \ncollects and unifies their responses is cumbersome and time-consuming. \nIn many investigations, the loss of valuable minutes, hours, and days \nmay mean the difference between stopping an attack or seeing it \nsucceed.\n  Third, data stored with phone companies rather than the NSA is more \nvulnerable to hackers who would seek to abuse queries of the stored \nmetadata.\n  Fourth, the costs are unknown, and the American people will bear \nthem--either as taxpayers if the telecom companies ask to be reimbursed \nor as consumers as the companies pass along the costs on your phone \nbill, perhaps as an NSA collection fee.\n  Fifth, to those people who say that this is technologically feasible \nand that we can easily execute it, I would remind you that this is the \nFederal Government that brought you healthcare.gov.\n  A second alternative offered is to pay a third-party contractor or \nquasi-private entity to store data and run the program. I would argue \nthat this is untested and unworkable.\n  First, the proposal would also require an indefinite stream of \ntaxpayer dollars to fund it.\n\n[[Page S2711]]\n\n  Second, the private entity may be subject to civil litigation \ndiscovery orders as it may hold information relevant to cases, which \nwould expose Americans' data to judicial proceedings with no connection \nto national security and without the security and privacy protections \nin place today.\n  Third, a new organization will create the need for heavy security, \ntop-secret clearances for employees, and strong congressional \noversight. As more resources are devoted to such an entity, what we end \nup with is a reconstituted NSA program but at additional cost to \ntaxpayers and greater threats to privacy.\n  As I mentioned, I have taken the opportunity in recent months to go \nand visit the men and women who work at the NSA and FBI. I can tell you \nall that they are fine Americans with the highest character. I spent \nhours with the very small number of men and women at Fort Meade who are \nallowed to search this data. I would ask how many critics of the \nprogram have actually done that.\n  Let's examine in detail how these men and women search this data. An \nindependent Federal court regularly approves NSA's authority to collect \nand store the data in the first place. But for these men and women to \neven look at the data, it must go through a multistep process that \nincludes approval by four different entities at the NSA, numerous \nattorneys at the Department of Justice, and those very same judges who \nsit on that court. Even if a search request is granted, not just anyone \nat the NSA can access the data; access is limited to this small group \nof men and women, all of whom undergo regular background checks, drug \ntests, and are subject to regular polygraphs, many of whom are military \nveterans.\n  To prevent abuse of the program in retrospect, searches of the data \nare automatically recorded and regularly audited by both the inspector \ngeneral and the Department of Justice, with strict penalties for anyone \nfound to have committed abuse.\n  Moreover, I, the Senator from North Carolina, and other members of \nthe intelligence committees of both Houses of this Congress participate \nin these reviews. This is a robust and layered set of protections for \nAmericans, their privacy, and these protections would not exist under \nthe proposed USA FREEDOM Act.\n  There are also protections that almost definitely will not be adopted \nby private telecom providers, which some wrongly suggest might retain \nexclusive control of this data.\n  These multiple safeguards are why to date these programs have a \nsterling record, with no verified instances of intentional abuse, not a \nsingle one.\n  In conclusion, in the wake of the traitorous Snowden disclosures, \nSenator Chambliss and Senator Feinstein showed great leadership when \nthey came together to defend these programs as both legal and \neffective. As Senator Feinstein wrote when she was chair of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, to end this program will substantially increase \nthe risk of another catastrophic attack in the United States. That is a \nproposition with which I wholeheartedly agree.\n  I now see my colleague from the Judiciary Committee on the floor. He \nis a former U.S. attorney and State attorney general, and I wonder if \nhe agrees that this program is both constitutional and does not differ \nin substantial ways from the traditional tools prosecutors can use \nagainst criminals while also providing adequate safeguards to American \nprivacy.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, that is an important question. First, \nI would like to thank the Senator for volunteering to serve in the \nforces of the United States to protect the security of our country and \nthe Middle East and dangerous areas.\n  We do need to protect our national security. We lost almost 3,000 \npeople on 9/11. The Nation came together. I was a member of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee at the time, and we evaluated what to do about it. \nWe worked together in a bipartisan way and in a virtually unanimous \nagreement passed the PATRIOT Act to try to help us be more effective in \ndealing with international terrorism.\n  What I have to tell you is what we were facing. Many people were \nshocked to see the improper obstacles that were placed in the way of \nour intelligence community as they sought to try to figure out how to \nidentify and capture people who wanted to do harm to America. It was \nstunning. There was a wall between the CIA, which did the foreign \nintelligence, and the FBI. They could not say to the FBI: We have \nintelligence that this person might be a terrorist. The FBI has \njurisdiction within the United States. That wall was eliminated when we \ndeveloped these intelligence tools. And we did other things in an \noverwhelmingly bipartisan way.\n  As a person who spent 15 years as a prosecutor, I would say there is \nnothing in this act that alters the fundamental principles of what \npowers investigators have to investigate crime in America.\n  A county attorney can issue a subpoena from any county in America--\nand they do every day by the hundreds of thousands--including subpoenas \nto phone companies for telephone toll records. Those toll records have \nthe name, the address, and the phone numbers called and how many \nminutes. What is maintained in this system basically is just numbers.\n  Not only can a county attorney, who is a lawyer, but also a drug \nenforcement agent and an IRS agent can issue an administrative subpoena \non the basis that there is information in telephone toll records \nregarding John Doe that are relevant to the investigation they are \nconducting. They can get that information. It is done by law, and there \nis a written document, but that is the way it is done every day in \nAmerica. There does not have to be a court order to get those records. \nWe are talking about hundreds of thousands of subpoenas for telephone \ntoll records.\n  In every murder case, virtually every robbery case, every big drug \ncase, the prosecutor wants to use those toll records to show the \nconnection between the criminals. It is extremely valuable for a jury. \nThis is part of daily law practice in America.\n  To say that the NSA analysts have to have a court order before they \ncan obtain a telephone toll record is contrary to everything that \nhappens every day in America. I am absolutely amazed that the President \nhas gone further than the law requires and is requiring some form of \ncourt order.\n  Apparently, this bill would go even further, this FREEDOM Act. It is \nnot necessary. You do not get the communications. All you get is--the \nperson may be a terrorist in Yemen, and they are making phone calls to \nthe United States, and you check to see what those numbers are and who \nthey may have called. You might identify a cell that is inside the \nUnited States that it is on the verge of having another 9/11, hijacking \nanother airplane to blow up the Capitol. I mean, this is real life.\n  I think we only had a couple hundred queries. I think that is awfully \nlow. One reason is, I am sure, we have such a burden on it.\n  I would say, let's not overreact on this. Please, let's not overreact \non this.\n  Former Attorney General Mukasey, a former Federal judge himself, has \nreally pushed back on this, and he believes it is the wrong kind of \nthing for us to be doing at this time.\n  This is what he said:\n\n       To impose such a burden on the NSA as the price of simply \n     running a number through a database that includes neither the \n     content of calls nor even the identity of the callers is \n     perverse. The president said that this step may be dispensed \n     with only in a ``true emergency,'' as if events unfold to a \n     musical score with a crescendo to tell us when a ``true \n     emergency'' is at hand.\n\n  He was talking about the additional requirements the President put on \nit.\n  One more thing. This is the way the system works and has worked for \nthe last 50 years--40 years at least. A crime occurs. A prosecutor or \nthe DEA agent investigates. They issue a subpoena to the local phone \ncompany that has these telephone toll records--the same thing you get \nin the mail--and they send them in response to the subpoena. They send \nthose documents. They maintain those records.\n  Now the computer systems are more sophisticated. There are more phone \ncalls than ever. The numbers are by the tens of millions, probably \nalmost billions of calls. So they are reducing the number that they are \nmaintaining in their computers--I believe Senator Cotton said it was 18 \nmonths. Maybe\n\n[[Page S2712]]\n\nthey abandon or they wipe out all these records. Well, an investigation \ninto terrorism may want to go back 5 years.\n  The government downloads the records, they maintain them in this \nsecure system, and they are accessible just as they had been before but \nactually with less information than the local police get when they \nissue a subpoena.\n  I believe this would be a big mistake.\n  Senator Burr.\n  Mr. BURR. I thank the Senator from Alabama.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes on \nthe majority side and 5 additional minutes on the minority side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I am very curious to hear what my \ncolleague Senator Rubio has to say and whether he is in agreement with \nwhat we have said on the floor to this point.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I think my colleagues have made an \nexcellent point today in outlining all the details of how this program \nworks. Let me back up and point out why we are even having this debate, \nother than the fact that it is expiring. It is because the perception \nhas been created--including by political figures who serve in this \nChamber--that the U.S. Government is listening to your phone calls or \ngoing through your bills as a matter of course. That is absolutely \ncategorically false.\n  The next time that any politician--Senator, Congressman--talking \nhead, whoever it may be, stands up and says ``The U.S. Government is \nlistening to your phone calls or going through your phone records,'' \nthey are lying. It is not true, except for some very isolated \ninstances--in the hundreds--of individuals for whom there is reasonable \nsuspicion that they could have links to terrorism.\n  Those of us in this culture in our society are often accused of \nhaving a short attention span. We forget that less than a year ago, \nRussian separatists shot down a commercial airliner armed by the \nRussians. Maybe even the Russians themselves did it. We forget that it \nwas not long ago that Assad was using chemical weapons to slaughter \npeople in Syria. The world moves on.\n  What we should never forget is what happened here on the 11th of \nSeptember of the year 2001. There are a number of seminal moments in \nAmerican history that people always remember. They remember when \nPresident Kennedy was assassinated. Everyone in this room remembers \nwhere they were and what they were doing on that morning of the 11th of \nSeptember of the year 2001 when the World Trade Center was attacked and \nthe subsequent attacks happened.\n  Here is the truth. If this program had existed before 9/11, it is \nquite possible we would have known that 9/11 hijacker Khalid Al Mihdhar \nwas living in San Diego and was making phone calls to an Al Qaeda safe \nhouse in Yemen. There is no guarantee we would have known. There is no \nway we can go back in time and prove it. But there is a probability we \nwould have; therefore, there is a probability American lives could have \nbeen saved.\n  This program works as follows: If the intelligence agencies of the \nUnited States believe there is an individual who is involved in \nterrorist activity--a reasonable belief--and that individual might be \ncommunicating with people as part of a plot, they have to get an order \nthat allows them access to their phone bill. The phone bill basically \ntells you when they called, what number they called, and how long the \ncall was. Why does that matter? Because if I know that subject X is an \nindividual who is involved in terrorism, of course I want to know whom \nthey are calling. I would not be as interested in the calls to Pizza \nHut or the local pharmacy, but I would be interested in calls overseas \nor calls to other people because they could be part of the plot as \nwell. That is why this is such a valuable tool.\n  My colleagues have already pointed out that if the IRS wants your \nphone bill, they just have to issue a subpoena. If virtually every \nagency--any agency of American Government--if your local police \ndepartment wants your phone bill--in fact, if you are involved in a \nproceeding in a civil litigation and they want access to your phone \nbill because it is relevant to the case, they can just get a subpoena. \nIt is part of the record. The intelligence agencies actually have to go \nthrough a number of hoops and hurdles, and that is fine. That is \nappropriate because these are very powerful agencies.\n  I will further add that the people who are raising hysteria--what is \nthe problem we are solving here? There is not one single documented \ncase, not one single documented case--there is not one single case that \nhas been brought to us as an example of how this program is being \nabused. Show me the story. Give the name to the world. Show us who this \nindividual is who is going out there and seizing the phone records of \nAmericans improperly. There is not one example of that--not one. And if \nthere is, that individual should be fired, prosecuted, and put in jail. \nThe solution is not to get rid of a program at a time when we know the \nrisk of homegrown violent extremism is the highest it has ever been.\n\n  We used to be worried about a foreigner coming to the United States \nand carrying out an attack, and then we were worried about an American \ntraveling abroad and coming back and carrying out an attack. Now we are \nworried about people who may never leave here, who are radicalized \nonline and carry out an attack.\n  This is not theoretical. Just last weekend two individuals who were \ninspired by ISIS tried to carry out an attack in the State of Texas. \nOne day--I hope that I am wrong--there will be an attack that is \nsuccessful. The first question out of everyone's mouth will be: Why \ndidn't we know about it? And the answer better not be because this \nCongress failed to authorize a program that might have helped us know \nabout it. These people are not playing games. They don't go on these \nWeb sites and say the things they say for purposes of aggrandizement. \nThis is a serious threat, and I hope we reauthorize this bill.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I thank my colleagues for their \nparticipation, and I thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nfor their accommodation.\n  I will conclude by saying that in the very near future this Congress \nwill be presented two choices: to reauthorize a program that works or \nto roll back our tools to pre-9/11. I don't believe that is what the \nAmerican people want, and I don't believe that is what Members of \nCongress want.\n  I urge my colleagues to become educated on what this program is, what \nit does, and more importantly, how effective it has been implemented.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n      Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act\n\n  Mr. UDALL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing Senators be added as cosponsors to S. 697, the Frank R. \nLautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, a bill to reform \nthe Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976: Senators Barrasso, Booker, \nCornyn, Cotton, Isakson, Kaine, McCaskill, Merkley, Murkowski, Murphy, \nRubio, Scott, Shaheen, and Whitehouse.\n  There is a substantial list here that brings the total up to 36 \ncosponsors on this piece of legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL. Madam President, I came from a press conference on the \nthird floor, with Chairman Inhofe, Senator Vitter, Senator Whitehouse, \nand Senator Merkley, about the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for \nthe 21st Century Act. So I thought I would talk a little bit about what \nwe are trying to do and where we are headed.\n  Americans trust that when they go to the grocery store or when they \nare in their own homes, the products they reach for are safe. The \ncurrent system fails that trust. It fails to provide confidence in our \nregulatory system, and it fails to provide confidence in our consumer \nproducts. We cannot let that failure continue.\n  I rise today to urge support for the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical \nSafety for the 21st Century Act. It is the best chance we have--\npossibly for many years--to protect our kids from dangerous chemicals.\n  The Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, or TSCA, is supposed to \nprotect\n\n[[Page S2713]]\n\nAmerican families. It does not. There are over 84,000 known chemicals \nand hundreds of new ones every year. Of all of these chemicals, how \nmany have been regulated by the EPA? Less than half a dozen. The EPA \ncannot even regulate asbestos, a known carcinogen, since losing a court \nbattle in 1991. So for decades, the risks and the dangers are there, \nbut there is no cop on the beat.\n  Some States are trying to fill the gaps by regulating a few \nchemicals. But my home State of New Mexico, and the vast majority of \nother States, have no ability to test chemicals. They have no \ndepartment to write regulations. Without a working Federal law, they \nhave no Federal protection--no protection at all.\n  Even in the 7 years since California--which probably has the greatest \ncapacity of all States to test and regulate--passed a law to regulate \nchemicals, it has only begun the process on three. We have an \nopportunity and an obligation to reform our broken chemical safety law. \nThat is why I and others have worked so hard to find compromise. That \nis why I introduced the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the \n21st Century Act.\n  I have been privileged to work with Senator Vitter on this bill. I \nthank the Senator from Louisiana and our colleagues who have worked \nwith us. This is a true bipartisan effort. We don't always agree, but \nwe have one goal. Reform is overdue--40 years overdue.\n  Our esteemed former colleague, the late Senator Lautenberg, led the \nway for many years with great determination. His bipartisan effort with \nSenator Vitter to reform TSCA was the last major legislation he \nintroduced.\n  Two years ago, the New York Times endorsed the Lautenberg-Vitter \nbill. The Times said correctly that previous efforts at reform had gone \nnowhere and the bill ``deserves to be passed because it would be a \nsignificant advance over the current law.''\n  I was honored to take over as the lead Democrat on the bill. Since \nthen, I have listened to concerns, I have reached across the aisle, and \nI have brought everyone into the room--or at least tried to. With \nSenator Vitter we have improved the bill.\n  By working with three of our colleagues on the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee--Senators Whitehouse, Merkley, and Booker--we made more \nprogress. I thank them and Senator Vitter for coming to the table and \nworking with us.\n  I also thank our cosponsors. We are up to 36 cosponsors from both \nsides of the aisle--half Democrats, half Republicans. This is a big \naccomplishment.\n  The bill is even stronger now with more protections for consumers and \na stronger role for States to play in keeping their citizens safe.\n  I want to talk for a moment about how this bill moves forward. First, \nthe manufacturer of a new chemical cannot begin until the EPA approves \nit. More than 700 new chemicals come into commerce each year. Our bill \ngives the EPA the time it needs and keeps these chemicals out of \nAmerican homes in the meantime.\n  Second, the current TSCA has no requirement for evaluating existing \nchemicals--none. Our bill does and includes deadlines even more \naggressive than the EPA itself said it was ready for.\n  Third, we require a stronger safety standard for all chemicals to be \nevaluated. No longer will the EPA be required to choose the least \nburdensome regulation. Its criteria will be safety, science, and public \nhealth--never costs or convenience.\n  Fourth, our bill requires, for the first time, that the EPA protect \nour most vulnerable populations--pregnant women, infants, the elderly, \nand workers--from chemicals in commerce or manufacturing.\n  Fifth, TSCA is silent on animal welfare and testing. The Lautenberg \nact minimizes animal testing and develops a strategy to do so.\n  Finally, we limit the protection of confidential business information \nso that businesses cannot hide information from the public.\n  Let's be clear. We have a choice. We can continue with a law that has \nfailed, we can continue to leave the American people unprotected or we \ncan actually make a difference. I believe the choice is obvious. Our \nbill will make Americans safer--and not just for Americans fortunate \nenough to live in States with protections. All Americans, no matter \nwhere they live, will be protected.\n  For those Americans in States with existing safeguards, that will not \nchange. Those safeguards will stay in place. Any regulations in place \nas of August of this year will remain. And there is a role for States \nto play to help with the thousands of chemicals that the EPA will not \nbe able to evaluate. But the EPA has the largest staff on chemical \nsafety of any country in the world. They should be able to put that \nstaff to good work. To do otherwise is wasted opportunity and continued \nfailure.\n  This has not been an easy process, but it has been a necessary one. I \nbelieve it will result in a good bill. We welcome a healthy debate, we \nwelcome constructive amendments, and at the same time we should not \nlose sight of the key goal to actually pass a bill.\n  I believe we can do this, and Senator Lautenberg, who was a great \nenvironmental champion, believed we could as well. He used to talk a \nlot about his children and grandchildren and that this bill might save \nmore lives than anything he had ever done.\n  We have a historic opportunity to create a chemical law that works \nand provides American families with the protections they expect and \ndeserve. Let's work together. Let's make that happen. Let's not wait \nanother 40 years.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I may speak again after Senator Durbin has finished his statement on \nthe floor.\n  I thank Senator Durbin. I have had some very good exchanges with him \non this bill. I look forward to working through the issues that \nIllinois has. I know that Illinois is a big State, and the Senator \ncares about chemicals and chemical safety. I want to make sure the \nSenator is comfortable with what we have in this bill and will try to \nwork with my colleague as we move down the road.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I commend my colleague from New Mexico. \nIt is difficult to put in words the way I feel about his effort on this \nsubject.\n  It was first brought to my attention when there was a series in the \nChicago Tribune about fire retardant chemicals in furniture. It turned \nout that many people who were making furniture were putting fire \nretardant chemicals in the fabric of the upholstery, as well as in the \ncushions of chairs and couches.\n  After further examination, we found that these chemicals were not, in \nfact, fire retardant, and secondly, they had properties that were \ndangerous and, frankly, should not be in our homes.\n  I thought about that series over and over again because my wife and I \nhave two of the cutest grandkids on Earth who are a little over 3 years \nold. I thought to myself: Every time I plop down on the couch to play \nwith the kids, I am pushing down on that cushion and spraying those \nchemicals into the room. I thought long and hard about it. I didn't \nknow what those chemicals meant, what they could do to my grandkids or \nwhat they could do to innocent people. It never crossed my mind.\n  Senator Udall has taken on what is in many ways a thankless task but \na very important one--to try to come up with some standards for new \nchemicals so they are reviewed and so we know they are safe for \nAmericans and for families.\n  He has taken his share of grief in the process. I may have given him \na little of grief along the way because it is a critically important \nsubject. But he is right to invoke the name of Senator Frank \nLautenberg.\n  The Senator's widow, Bonnie Lautenberg, was in to see me yesterday. \nWe talked about Frank and all the things he had done over the years. He \nwas my Senate sponsor when I was a House originator of the bill banning \nsmoking on airplanes 25 years ago. Frank Lautenberg carried the flag \nover here in the Senate. He was my partner.\n  One of the last press conferences I ever had with him was on this \nsubject, the toxic chemicals and the review of these chemicals. I \nremember that it was right outside.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico for continuing this. I am not one \nof\n\n[[Page S2714]]\n\nthe cosponsors, but I might be. I have three or four issues I want to \nsit down and go over with my friend and make sure I understand them and \nmaybe suggest some changes. But I commend the Senator for sticking with \nthis. I know it has not been easy. There are those who disagree with \nhim, even within our own caucus.\n  Again, I thank the Senator for trying, on a bipartisan basis, to deal \nwith an issue that we should deal with as a nation. I commend the \nSenator for that. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his \nleadership.\n\n\n                  For-Profit Colleges and Universities\n\n  Madam President, for several years I have been coming to the floor \nand giving speeches--which some of the staff here can repeat because \nthey have heard them so often--about the for-profit colleges and \nuniversities in America. I always preface my talk about these for-\nprofit colleges and universities by saying: I am going to give you \nthree numbers that are going to be on the final. So get out your pen \nand paper, students, because this will be on the final.\n  Ten percent of college students go to for-profit colleges and \nuniversities. Who are the for-profit colleges and universities? The \nbiggest ones are the University of Phoenix, Kaplan University, DeVry \nUniversity, and many others that I will mention. Ten percent of college \nstudents go to these colleges and universities that are run for profit. \nHow do they find them? They cannot avoid them. Ask a high school \nstudent when the last time was that they logged in on the Internet with \nthe word ``college'' or ``university'' and whether they were not \ninundated for ads to go to for-profit schools. They are on billboards \nand on television. They are everywhere. So 10 percent of students go to \nthese schools. That is the first question on the final.\n  The second question: What percentage of Federal aid to education goes \nto for-profit colleges and universities? The answer is 20 percent--20 \npercent of Federal aid to education. Why so much? Ten percent of the \nstudents and 20 percent of the Federal aid? These schools aren't cheap. \nThey charge a lot of money. Students have to borrow a lot more money to \ngo to school.\n\n  So the Federal aid to education, which includes student loans to for-\nprofit schools, is 20 percent. Ten percent of the students; 20 percent \nof the Federal aid to education.\n  But here is the important number: 44. Forty-four percent of all of \nthe student loan defaults in the United States are from students at \nfor-profit colleges and universities. Why? Well, there are two \nreasons--maybe more but two that are obvious. They accept everyone. If \na student is low income--particularly a minority student--they can't \nwait to bring them in the door. Why? Because they automatically qualify \nfor about $5,000 in Pell grants that the school can get right away, and \nthey automatically qualify for college loans because their family \ndoesn't have a lot of money. So those are the great opportunity \nstudents: low-income students.\n  What happens to those students? They start in these schools. They \nsign up and pay to the schools what they can afford. They take their \ngrant money and give it to the schools, and then they sign up for \nstudent loans and they start their classes. Then they find, for a \nvariety of reasons, they can't continue. Maybe they are not ready for \ncollege. Maybe--just maybe--they start adding up all of the loans they \nhave taken out and say, I have to stop; it is getting too much--because \nthe indebtedness of students coming out of for-profit colleges and \nuniversities is twice what it is for those who go to public \nuniversities. It is a very expensive undertaking.\n  Then there is the other category: those who finally finish at these \nfor-profit colleges and universities but can't get a job. One of them \nwas at a press conference with me last Monday in Chicago--a sweet young \nwoman who was born in West Virginia and raised in Eastern Kentucky. She \nmoved to Chicago, went to Everest College in Chicago, a for-profit \nschool owned by Corinthian Colleges. She didn't quite finish, but she \nspent several years there. Then she learned something after she went \nout looking for a job. The employers would look at her and say: \nCorinthian, that is not a good college. Why did you go there? Don't put \nthat on your resume. Stop putting that on your resume because it makes \nyou look bad.\n  Here she is in debt $20,000 to this for-profit college and her \nemployers are saying stop putting that on your resume; it is not a real \ncollege.\n  This poor young woman, now in City Colleges, is trying, at a very \nyoung age, to put it back together again.\n  So that is where we start: for-profit colleges and universities, 10 \npercent of the students, 20 percent of the Federal aid to education, \nand 44 percent of all of the student loan defaults.\n  I have been giving this speech on the floor for literally years \nsaying something is wrong. Why are we accrediting these schools that \nhave such dismal records? Why are we looking the other way when the \nstudents who go to these schools have massive debt and can't pay back \ntheir student loans? When are we going to wake up as a Federal \nGovernment and stop shoveling hundreds of millions--and billions--of \ndollars at this industry?\n  For-profit colleges and universities' share of Federal aid to \neducation--if it were a separate line item in the Federal budget, would \nbe the ninth largest Federal agency. That is how much money we send to \nthese people. These are for-profit, private sector companies--baloney. \nTheir revenues--80 to 95 percent of their revenues come right from the \nTreasury. This is the most heavily subsidized industry in America.\n  But now something historic has happened. Corinthian Colleges, one of \nthe largest for-profit colleges and universities, announced its \nbankruptcy last week, and that isn't the end of the story. Yesterday, \nCareer Education Corporation, headquartered in my home State of \nIllinois, announced it would teach out, which means close, its 14 \nSanford-Brown institutions across the country and online. This follows \nthe decision to close its Harrington College of Design in Chicago and \nto look for a buyer for its Le Cordon Bleu culinary schools. Ever heard \nof those? I can guarantee my colleagues that high school kids have \nheard of them. I have run into students at these places.\n  Harrington College of Design. I cannot tell my colleagues how many \nstudents went there, took out the loans, and found out it was \nworthless, and then contacted my office and asked, What are we supposed \nto do next?\n  I had a hearing on for-profit colleges and universities in Chicago \nand there were students from these for-profit colleges picketing \n``Durbin is unfair.'' I went out to the students and I said: Where do \nyou go to school?\n  One student said: I go to the Institute of Art of Chicago. Now, there \nis a Chicago Art Institute, but this play on words turned out to be \nsignificant.\n  I said: What are you studying there?\n  The student said: I am going to be a super chef.\n  Oh, really. How much is it going to cost you to take the culinary \ncourses to be a super chef?\n  It is $54,000 in tuition.\n  To be a chef? I have asked the major restaurants in Chicago; they \ndon't even want to see those degrees. They don't look for them. They \ndon't value them. These poor kids, these young men and women who watch \nthese cooking shows on TV and get all caught up in it and say, That is \nfor me, end up getting suckered into these schools.\n  Le Cordon Bleu is another one. Le Cordon Bleu--doesn't that sound \ngreat? My wife has a cookbook that says that on it. These students \nquickly sign up for this French-sounding culinary school and get in \ndebt and deeply in trouble. Now they are in more trouble because the \nschool is in the process of going out of business.\n  In a public statement about their decision, CEO Ron McCray of Career \nEducation Corporation blamed a more difficult higher education \nenvironment and challenging regulatory environment. Do people know what \nthe challenge is? The Department of Education is finally challenging \nthese schools when they say to the Department, Oh, our kids all get \njobs--when they graduate, they all get jobs.\n  When they challenged Corinthian Colleges, here is what they found \nout. Corinthian graduates would be employed--check the box--after they \ngraduate for about 30 days, sometimes less. Corinthian had cooked a \ndeal with employers to hire their graduates for 30 days, and it paid \nthem to do it, and they were caught redhanded and eventually went out \nof business. Fraud--\n\n[[Page S2715]]\n\nfraud in reporting to the government, fraud on the taxpayers leading to \nthe collapse of Corinthian Colleges.\n  Career Education Corporation, incidentally, is under investigation--\nthis for-profit school--by 17 different State attorneys general \nrelating to recruitment practices and graduate placement statistics, \namong other things. In 2013, this company, Career Education \nCorporation, settled with the New York attorney general for 10 million \nbucks. The company is on the Heightened Cash Monitoring list, meaning \nthey are suspect, of the U.S. Department of Education.\n  What else happened yesterday? This is all within the last 2 weeks.\n  Education Management Corporation--EDMC--announced that it was going \nto close 15 of these art institute campuses. Remember that one? I told \nmy colleagues about that costs $54,000 tuition to become a cook? They \nare going to close 15 of these campuses, including reportedly one in \nTinley Park, IL. They have been financially faltering for some time. \nThey had recently tried to do a debt restructuring which apparently \ndidn't work. They are currently being sued by the Department of Justice \nfor false claims violations.\n\n  The Justice Department alleges that this one, Education Management \nCorporation, falsely certified compliance with provisions of the \nFederal law that prohibit the university from paying financial \nincentives to its admissions staff that is tied to the number of \nstudents they recruit. We made it a law that said you can't pay a \nbounty for bringing in kids and signing up in the school. They did it \nanyway.\n  In addition, this company is under investigation by 17 State \nattorneys general, just like the other one, related to, among other \nthings, marketing and recruitment. EDMC is also on the Department of \nEducation's Heightened Cash Monitoring list.\n  Let me say a word about ITT Tech. We have to watch the names of these \nplaces because they sound like real schools. We have an Illinois \nInstitute of Technology that is a real university, one of the best in \nthe Nation--one of the best in the world--when it comes to engineering \nand science. So along comes a for-profit school and makes a little \nchange. It is ITT Tech, hoping the Illinois students will not catch it. \nThey are another company under heavy scrutiny.\n  They have been sued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for \npredatory lending to students. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \nalleges that ITT pushed students into high-cost private loans that they \nknew were going to end in default. Sometimes these students are still \neligible for government loans at low interest rates and good terms and \nthese schools don't care. They push them into private loans with high \ninterest rates.\n  Do my colleagues know how high the interest rates on the student \nloans were from private lenders to these kids at ITT Tech? How about \n16.25 percent. Think about that for a minute. At a time when the \ninterest rates in our country are at rock bottom, these kids were \npaying 16 percent to the lenders for private loans.\n  There is something else we should know. Unlike virtually any other \nloan that we take out in America, student loans are not dischargeable \nin bankruptcy. No matter how deep a hole these kids get into--and their \nfamilies--no matter how deep the hole, if they go bankrupt over student \nloans, they can't discharge them in bankruptcy. Student loans follow \nyou to the grave. That is what these kids at age 19 and 20 are getting \ninto. Sadly, these for-profit schools are dragging them in that \ndirection.\n  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau believes ITT misrepresented \nthe basics, including how often you can get a job, the quality of the \ndiploma. Does this sound familiar? It is a recurring theme in this \nindustry. ITT is under investigation by everybody in sight: 15 State \nattorneys general, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the New \nMexico attorney general is suing them, and ITT is on the Department of \nEducation's Heightened Cash Monitoring list.\n  What happens when these schools go bankrupt, when they close or teach \nout and finish? Well, Corinthian ended up closing many of their \ncampuses a week or so ago and now the students who are in debt because \nthey went to school there have an opportunity. They can walk away from \nthe credits they earned at a Corinthian college and then walk away from \ntheir college debt associated with them since their school closed. But \nsome of these other students will not be so lucky. They will have ended \ntheir education at these worthless schools and have a mountain of debt \nto show for it and the school will go out of business.\n  This isn't fair. There comes a point where we are supposed to step \nin, the government is supposed to step in. This is our money, hundreds \nof millions of dollars from taxpayers going to these rotten schools \nthat are abusing students, leaving them deeply in debt and then going \nout of business.\n  We shouldn't be surprised to learn that the CEOs of these schools do \nquite well. The CEO of Corinthian College that went bankrupt: $3 \nmillion a year--not bad for what turned out to be a fraudulent \nenterprise.\n  That is why this week I joined several of my colleagues and sent a \nletter to the Department of Justice. The Department of Education said \nwe don't know how to go after these individual wrongdoers at these for-\nprofit college corporations. So we said to the Attorney General: We \nhope you will investigate this. Take a look at it. If you cheat on your \nincome tax or you defraud the government, you are going to be held \nresponsible for it. Why shouldn't these people who took hundreds of \nmillions of dollars not only from Federal taxpayers but at the expense \nof students now burdened with the debt of their schools also be \ninvestigated? I think it only stands to reason they should be.\n  Madam President, I have another statement to make, but I see two of \nmy colleagues. I will come back a little later in the day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL. Madam President, I would ask the Chair to notify me when I \nhave consumed 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. UDALL. Madam President, I rise to support the President's \nnegotiations with the P5+1 and Iran and to speak about the tremendous \nwork--especially at our national laboratories--to create a framework \nagreement that meets the scientific requirements to prevent Iran from \nacquiring a nuclear weapon.\n  I also wish to express my support for the Corker-Menendez bill as \npassed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Congress must have an oversight role; there is no doubt about that. \nWhile I do not believe this bill is necessary to have such a role, I do \nbelieve it is the best compromise to ensure a congressional oversight \nrole without weakening the President's hand to continue critical \nnegotiations.\n  First, let's be clear, we all agree on one basic point: a nuclear-\narmed Iran is a serious threat. No one doubts this. No one questions \nthe history of Iran's deception. That history is well documented and \nthe danger is evident. This is the greatest nuclear nonproliferation \nchallenge of our time. It is of tremendous import to our Nation, to the \nMiddle East region, and to our ally, Israel. It is a challenge we must \nmeet. We do not disagree on the danger; we disagree on the response.\n  The Corker-Menendez bill is truly bipartisan. It passed the Foreign \nRelations Committee on which I am proud to serve unanimously. I wish to \nthank Chairman Corker and Ranking Member Cardin for their leadership \nand all of their hard work to find a compromise solution. This is a \nsolid bill. It gives Congress the opportunity to review a final \nagreement, to hold hearings and ask tough questions, and it creates an \norderly method for Congress to approve or disapprove of any final \nagreement, providing more than enough time for both.\n  The administration still has work to do and needs time to do it. I \nbelieve the framework agreement has promise to stop Iran from acquiring \na nuclear weapon, to protect Israel, and to prevent a new war in the \nMiddle East. And it would take longer for Iran to secure the nuclear \nmaterials needed to make a bomb. As a result the United States and its \nallies would have much more time to respond if Iran attempted to break \nout and build a nuclear weapon.\n  This is not speculation. This is not wishful thinking. Energy \nSecretary\n\n[[Page S2716]]\n\nMoniz and Secretary of State John Kerry make this commitment clear. If \nanyone doubts this, visit our nuclear security experts at the labs in \nNew Mexico, California, and Oak Ridge, TN, or Argonne in Illinois. Talk \nto the engineers and scientists who know the most about nuclear weapons \nand what is needed to make them.\n  The Secretary said in his recent op-ed in the Washington Post:\n\n       An important part of the parameters is a set of \n     restrictions that would significantly increase the time it \n     would take Iran to produce the nuclear material needed for a \n     weapon--the breakout time--if it pursued one. The current \n     breakout time is just two to three months . . . that would \n     increase to at least a year for more than 10 years, more than \n     enough time to mount an effective response.\n\n  Secretary Moniz goes on to say: ``The negotiated parameters would \nblock Iran's four pathways to a nuclear weapon--the path through \nplutonium production at the Arak reactor, two paths to a uranium weapon \nthrough the Natanz and Fordow enrichment facilities, and the path of \ncovert activity.''\n  These negotiations must continue. The President and his team must \nhave room to proceed. Let's not kid ourselves. This process is complex. \nIt is daunting. Success is not guaranteed.\n  I will oppose any amendments to the Corker-Menendez bill that would \ntie the President's hands. Efforts such as the letter sent by 47 \nMembers of this body and other efforts to derail negotiations only \nserve to confound and weaken our position. Politics must stop at the \nwater's edge.\n  The Senate will have ample time to review any agreement and to \napprove or reject any agreement. But our debate is within these halls. \nIt is with each other and with our fellow Senators and with our \nPresident. The Ayatollah has no place in that debate. The Congress \nshould give the President the room he needs to negotiate. This is a \nworld of imperfect choices. And if negotiations fail, make no mistake, \nour options are limited and likely costly.\n  We are dealing with an unstable region. Use of force or regime change \nhas unforeseen consequences. That path may seem simple. It is not. Both \nrecent history in Iraq and the history of our interactions with Iran in \nthe 20th century surely have taught us that much.\n  Senators Corker and Cardin have given us a solid bill, one that is in \nthe best tradition of the Senate and in the best interest of our \ncountry. I commend them for this, and I urge my colleagues to support \nthe bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise to speak on the Corker-Menendez \nIran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. As I have said from the start, \nbipartisanship on this legislation has always been the key to making \nsure that Congress has the ability to review any agreement with Iran--a \nnation that we cannot trust. It is critically important that \nbipartisanship is preserved.\n  As we head to a 2 o'clock vote on cloture to move forward on this \nbill, let me just say I want to thank Chairman Corker for his \nleadership. I want to thank Ranking Member Cardin for taking up the \ncause and for helping to bring this legislation to this point, starting \nwith a unanimous vote out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. At \nthe end of the day, we can pass a bipartisan bill almost as Senator \nCorker and I first envisioned it.\n  It has been a long and difficult process. There has been debate, \ndisagreement, and some amendments, but we have almost reached the \nfinish line. Despite the good intentions--and I would say the good \nintentions of many of the amendments, some which I agree with--we \ncannot risk a Presidential veto. And we cannot at the end of the day \nrisk giving up congressional review and judgment.\n  That is the critical core issue before the Senate. Will we have \ncongressional review and judgment on probably the most significant \nnuclear nonproliferation national security--global security--question, \nI think, of our time? We cannot risk having no oversight role, and \nwithout the passage of this legislation, we will have missed an \nopportunity to send a clear message to Tehran.\n  As we near the finish line and, hopefully, agree to govern as we \nshould, I believe we will ultimately pass legislation without \ndestroying what Senator Corker and I carefully crafted and was passed \nunanimously out of the committee. From the beginning, we fashioned \nlanguage to ensure that Congress plays a critical role in judging any \nfinal agreement. I want to also recognize Senator Kaine, who had \nsignificant input as we were devising the bill, for his support.\n  The bill we crafted was intended to ensure that if the P5+1 and Iran \nultimately achieved a comprehensive agreement by the June deadline, \nCongress would have a say in judging that agreement. A core element of \nthe framework agreement that is the foundation of the negotiations \nleading into June is about sanctions relief as a core point, at least \nfrom the Iranian perspective. The sanctions relief that the \nadministration is proposing is at the heart of these negotiations from \ntheir perspective. For us, it is about their nuclear infrastructure and \ntheir drive for a nuclear weapon. Why are they seated in negotiations \nin the first place? As the administration itself recognized, it is \nbecause of the sanctions. Well, the sanctions were crafted by Congress \nand enacted by Congress, and we should be the ones to make a \ndetermination as to whether or not it is appropriate to relieve those \nsanctions.\n\n  I have to say, as one of the authors of those sanctions, I never \nenvisioned a wholesale waiver of sanctions against Iran without \ncongressional input and without congressional action. The message I \nbelieve we can send to Iran--and I hope we will do it powerfully--is \nthat sanctions relief is not a given and it is not a prize for signing \non the dotted line.\n  Make no mistake. Having said that I hope we can have a strong \nbipartisan vote on this bill, I have serious questions about the \nframework agreement as it stands today, from the different \nunderstandings that both sides have of the agreement--which is, I \nguess, part of the challenge of not committing it to one document in \nwriting--and about the pace of sanctions relief. I increasingly get \nalarmed that there is a suggestion that there will be greater upfront \nsanctions relief. I don't believe that Iran should get a signing bonus. \nI am concerned about the recent statement by the President that he \ncould consider greater sanctions relief coming upfront for Iran. I have \nreal questions about where the spectrum is of Iran's research and \ndevelopment authority as we move forward and how far they can advance \ntheir research and development as it relates to nuclear power. Greater \nresearch and development means, among other things, more sophisticated \ncentrifuges that can spin faster and dramatically reduce breakout time \ntowards a nuclear bomb.\n  I am concerned about the ability to snap back sanctions if there are \nviolations of any agreement. Certainly, what I have seen in the first \ninstance--which sounds like a committee process--doesn't guarantee that \na snapback will take place or that it will be done in a timely fashion. \nUltimately, snapback, in and of itself, is a challenge because it \ndoesn't recognize the time it takes for sanctions actually to take \neffect. So even if you snap them back and say that we won't have to go \nto the law again to have them take place, to have them take effect and \nto pursue enforcement, we have learned that it takes time, and time is \nsomething that is ultimately not on our side.\n  I am concerned about the International Atomic Energy Administration's \ninability to obtain at any time and place snap inspections. We have \nalready heard the Iranians say they are balking at that. They are also \nbalking about the possibility that the IAEA believes that such a \nlocation might be on a military installation. They are saying: Oh, no, \nwe are not going to allow any of our military installations to be \ninspected. That is a surefire way to guarantee that if you want \nultimately to violate a deal, then do it at a military site where you \nare not allowing inspections to take place.\n  I am concerned that I hear the administration is trying to \ndifferentiate between the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and the Quds \nForce to provide greater sanctions relief. Both, as far as I am \nconcerned, are terrorist groups. As far as I am concerned, they are \nclearly covered by U.S. law. So trying to get the Treasury Department \nto differentiate is really problematic and concerning.\n  I am deeply disturbed that the agreement does not speak to the long-\nestablished condition that Iran must come\n\n[[Page S2717]]\n\ncompletely clean on the question of their possible weaponization of \ntheir nuclear program. We need to know how far along Iran has \nprogressed in their weaponization so that we can understand those \nconsequences as it relates to other breakout time issues.\n  Above all, I am concerned that when you read about the framework \nagreement, while it does talk about something in longer timeframes, the \ncore question as to when Iran could advance its nuclear program in a \nway they want to--and which I think is problematic--is that the \nexpiration is 10 years. Does that mean we are ultimately destined to \nhave Iran as a nuclear weapons State after that period of time? That \ncannot be and should not be the ultimate result.\n  I state all of those concerns to say to my colleagues that, even \nthough I passionately believe this legislation is critical for us, it \nis not that I don't have concerns. This legislation is the vehicle by \nwhich we can judge. Now, maybe these issues will be resolved in a \nnegotiation. I don't know. Ultimately, without this vehicle we have no \nfinal say on an agreement, and we have no oversight role with \nestablished parameters for compliance.\n  I am concerned that the sanctions relief comes without what appears \nto be a broader Iran policy, in terms of how we contain its acts of \nterrorism. It clearly is the largest State sponsor of terrorism. We see \nits hegemonic interests. We see it as a major patron of Assad in Syria, \nwhat is happening in Yemen, what is happening in different parts of the \nregion. I am concerned about its missile technology. So there are a lot \nof elements here of concern at the end of the day.\n  I would say to my colleagues who feel passionately about some of \nthese amendments they have offered, this isn't the only bill in which \nwe could consider these issues. I stand ready to work with colleagues \nimmediately on pursuing other concerns, such as missile technology, \nterrorism, their human rights violations, their anti-Semitism, and the \nAmericans who are being held hostage; and to look at either sanctions \nor enhanced sanctions that may already exist on those elements that we \nshould be considering and which are separate and apart from the nuclear \nprogram. I would be more than willing to work with my colleagues to \ndeal with all of those issues.\n  I will say that even as we have worked to give the administration the \nspace to negotiate and believe very passionately in this legislation, \nit bothers me enormously that just last week Reuters reported that \nGreat Britain informed the United Nations sanctions panel on April 20 \nof an active Iranian nuclear procurement network, apparently linked to \ntwo blacklisted firms, Iran's Centrifuge Technology Company, called \nTESA, and Kalay Electric Company, KEC.\n  If what Great Britain brought before the U.N. Security Council \nsanctions panel is true, how can we trust Iran to end its nuclear \nweapons ambitions and not be a threat to its neighbors when, even as we \nare negotiating with them, they are trying to acquire illicitly \nmaterials for their nuclear weapons program in the midst of the \nnegotiations?\n  Forgetting about everything they are doing in Yemen and Syria, \nforgetting about their hostility to ships in the Strait of Hormuz, \nforgetting about their actions of terrorism, this is square-on trying \nto ultimately use front companies to get materials for their nuclear \nprogram. So we cannot build this on trust alone. I know the \nadministration says we are not going to trust them, we are going to \nverify, but it goes beyond that.\n  It can't be a fleeting hope that Iran will comply with the provisions \nand change their stripes. I believe they will not. It cannot be built \nfrom the aspirations or good intentions, like the North Korea deal, not \nwhen Iran continues to sponsor terrorism, not while it asserts its \ninterests from Yemen to Bahrain, from Iraq to Lebanon, not as events in \nSyria continue to worsen.\n  I just had the U.N. relief coordinator in on Syria. This is a human \ntragedy of unimaginable proportions. We have become almost \ndesensitized. We do not hear about it on the Senate floor anymore. It \nis all supported, encouraged, and financed by Tehran, and not while \nIran 's fingerprints remain in the dust of the bombings of Israel's \nEmbassy and Jewish community center in Argentina, even as it seeks to \nbargain with that country's leaders for absolution.\n  That is the Iran we are dealing with. That is the state we are being \nasked to hope will change. Well, hope is not a national security \nsolution when it comes to dealing with Iran. Congress having a say on \nany final agreement is critical to how we deal with Iran. So I urge my \ncolleagues to have a strong vote on cloture and I hope, after that, a \nunanimous vote on passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to address legislation before us, \nthe Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015, which sets up a \ndeliberate process for congressional review of a final nuclear \nagreement with Iran. The United States, our citizens, our President, \nand probably every Member of the Senate and House stand united in our \ncommitment to prevent Iran from securing a nuclear weapon.\n  Nuclear proliferation is a huge danger to human civilization on our \nplanet. The more nations that possess nuclear weapons, the more \nopportunities there are for misunderstandings between nations to \ntrigger first use of a nuclear weapon. The more nations that possess \nnuclear weapons, the more opportunities there are for failures in \ncommand and control to result in the unintended use of a weapon.\n  The more nations that possess nuclear weapons, the more opportunities \nthere are for terrorist groups to gain acquisition of a weapon. \nCertainly, the possibility of Iran possessing a nuclear weapon poses \nspecial security concerns. The Middle East is being torn asunder by \nlongstanding conflicts and challenges. If Iran acquires a nuclear \nweapon, then other nations like Saudi Arabia are likely to also seek to \nsecure a nuclear weapon.\n  Moreover, in the fervent rivalry between Shia Islam and Sunni Islam, \nwhich brings powers into bloody and extensive conflict from Syria, to \nYemen, to Iraq, there are abundant scenarios that could generate \npotential use of a nuclear weapon, either through misunderstandings or \nmisguided perceptions of military advantage. None of us will ever \nforget that the Government of Iran has put forth a steady stream of \ninvectives against our close ally Israel calling for her destruction.\n  Iran's possession of a nuclear weapon would pose a very real threat \nto the existence of the State of Israel. For all of these reasons, \nAmericans are united. Our 100 Senators are united in believing it is \nimperative that Iran does not secure a nuclear weapon, but the question \nwe must debate and resolve is, Which strategy is most effective to \nachieve this outcome? There are three basic options: a negotiated \ndismantlement of Iran's nuclear weapons program with an intrusive \ninspection and verification regime to ensure Iran is keeping its word; \nsecond, a reliance on indefinite extension of tough multinational \neconomic sanctions in hopes that will continue to dissuade Iran from \npursuing a nuclear weapons program; third, a military option designed \nto destroy critical components of Iran's nuclear weapons \ninfrastructure. Of these options, for reasons I will explain in due \ncourse, the first is the far superior option. To understand this set of \npossibilities, however, we have to understand the current situation. \nThe United States has imposed sanctions against Iran since 1979.\n  Many of the sanctions Iran faced in that time from 2008 were \nunilateral. These sanctions, however, were largely ineffective. Iran's \ntrade with the United States was diminished, but sanctions had little \noverall effect because Iran was able to continue trading through other \nnations.\n  President Obama, coming into office in 2009, saw this clearly. He \nrecognized the importance of enforcing existing U.N. resolutions, \npassing stronger ones, and convincing our allies to go beyond those \nresolutions and truly tighten the web of restrictions on Iran's trade \nand finances. The result was coordinated with the P5+1--France, United \nKingdom, Germany, United States, Russia, and China.\n  These multilateral sanctions have come about in several phases. In \n2010, Congress enacted a series of sanctions targeting Iran's banking \nand oil sectors. In 2011, section 1245 of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 was passed. In 2012, we\n\n[[Page S2718]]\n\npassed the Iran Threat Reduction Act and Syria Human Rights Act. In \n2013, we passed the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act. Those \nsanctions--the American sanctions--and the multilateral sanctions have \nhad an enormous impact on the economy of Iran.\n\n  Their crude oil exports fell from around 2.5 million barrels per day \nin 2011 to about 1.1 million barrels per day at the end of 2013. Trade \nbetween Europe and Iran plunged. It plunged from almost $32 billion in \n2005 to about $9 billion today. Iran's economy has taken a huge hit. \nIran's current President was elected on a platform of negotiating with \nthe goal of alleviating the enormous economic impact created by the \nsanctions.\n  The sanctions have accomplished their intended goal. They have \nbrought Iran to the negotiating table in search of an agreement based \non a simple, straightforward formulation. Iran will forgo a nuclear \nweapons program if the international coalition will, in return, lift \nits devastatingly effective sanctions.\n  That is the background to the negotiations underway today between \nIran and the P5+1. But when these negotiations got into full motion, \nthey were not just about talking, they agreed on a set of conditions to \nfree and, to some degree, reverse elements of Iran's domestic nuclear \nprogram, not waiting until the conclusion of the negotiations but as a \ncondition of the negotiations.\n  This Joint Plan of Action or JPA that Iran and the P5+1 agreed to has \na substantial number of elements. I will mention a few. First, Iran has \nto refrain from any further advances of its activities at three \ncritical nuclear facilities: at the Fordow underground uranium \nenrichment facility, at the Natanz underground commercial scale uranium \nenrichment facility, and further activity at the Arak heavy water \nreactor that could--that reactor could, when completed, produce \nplutonium that could be utilized in a bomb.\n  Second, Iran, in this Joint Plan of Action, has agreed to provide the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, with additional \ninformation about its nuclear programs, as well as access to sensitive \nnuclear-related facilities, to which Iran's IAEA safeguards agreement \ndoes not require access.\n  Third, and again as a condition of the negotiations, Iran agreed not \nto produce 20 percent enriched uranium. That is a form of uranium--\nuranium hexafluoride or enriched uranium--in Iran's stockpile that has \ncaused the most concern. Fourth, Iran has agreed to fully eliminate its \nexisting stockpile of 20 percent enriched uranium by diluting half of \nthat stockpile to uranium hexafluoride, containing no more than 5 \npercent of uranium 235, and converting the rest of the material to a \nuranium compound unsuitable for further enrichment.\n  These conditions, in effect as I speak on the floor of the Senate, \nhave not only frozen Iran's nuclear program during the negotiations, \nthey have also given the P5+1 coalition members enormously improved \nunderstanding of Iran's nuclear program. That understanding of Iran's \nprogram has increased the ability of the P5+1 to shape a framework for \na final agreement designed to block all the possible pathways to a \nnuclear weapon.\n  There are four Iranian pathways to a bomb. One pathway is to utilize \nfissile material from the Fordow underground uranium enrichment \nfacility. This is the secret uranium facility--formerly secret uranium \nfacility--built deep underground beneath a base of the Iranian \nRevolutionary Guard, massively reinforced with concrete and steel to \nenable it to withstand most bombing assaults.\n  The second pathway is to utilize fissile uranium made in the Natanz \nunderground enrichment facility. The third pathway is to utilize, at \nsome future point, plutonium processed from spent fuel at the Arak \nheavy water reactor. I say at some future point because this reactor is \nstill under construction. The fourth pathway is to utilize covert \noperations to acquire or to make sufficient fissile material for a \nbomb.\n  On April 2, last month, Iran and the P5+1 coalition announced a \nframework for a joint comprehensive plan of action on Iran's nuclear \nprogram intended to address and block all four of these pathways to a \nbomb. Now, as reported by the State Department, I am going to review a \nfew of those details of this framework. These are essentially the bones \nof the agreement that have to be fleshed out in the weeks to follow.\n  Let's talk first about the Fordow, this deep underground, massively \nreinforced, formerly secret uranium enrichment facility. Iran would \nrepurpose Fordow for peaceful nuclear research. Iran would not retain \nany fissile material at this installation. They would not enrich \nuranium at this facility. Iran would remove approximately two-thirds of \nthe centrifuges. The remaining centrifuges and related infrastructure \nwould be placed under IAEA monitoring.\n  Let's turn to Natanz. Here are a few of the restrictions to the \nsecond pathway--second possible pathway for an Iranian nuclear weapon. \nIran would remove the 1,000 IR-2M centrifuges currently installed at \nNatanz and place them under IAEA monitoring for 10 years. Iran would \nengage in limited research and development with some of its advanced \ncentrifuges according to a schedule and parameters agreed to by the \nP5+1.\n  Iran would use only its less-efficient first-generation centrifuges \nto enrich uranium at Natanz, a process that would be closely monitored. \nBeyond 10 years, Iran would abide by its enrichment R plan submitted \nto the IAEA under the addition protocol, resulting in certain \nlimitations on enrichment capacity.\n  Let's turn to the third pathway. That is the possibility of plutonium \nsecured from nuclear fuel used at this heavy water reactor. To block \nthis pathway to a nuclear bomb, Iran would agree to ship all of its \nspent fuel out of the country and to not build a reprocessing facility \nfor such nuclear fuel.\n  Iran would redesign and rebuild its heavy water reactor in Arak based \non a design that is agreed to by the P5+1.\n  The original core of that reactor, which would enable the production \nof significant quantities of weapons-grade plutonium, would be \ndestroyed or removed from the country, and Iran would not build any \nadditional heavy water reactors.\n  Finally, the framework provides major design--provides high \nconfidence that Iran is not employing covert operations to develop a \nbomb. This is the fourth pathway, the covert pathway.\n  Under the agreement, the IAEA would have regular access to all of \nIran's nuclear facilities, including Natanz and Fordow. Inspectors \nwould have access to the supply chains, starting with the uranium \nmines, the uranium milling. They would have continuous surveillance at \nthe uranium mills. They would have continuous surveillance of Iran's \ncentrifuges.\n  In addition, all of the centrifuges and enrichment infrastructure \nremoved from Fordow and Natanz would be placed under continuous \nmonitoring by the IAEA.\n  Iran and the P5+1 would establish a dedicated procurement channel for \nIran's nuclear program to monitor and approve the supply, sale, or \ntransfer to Iran of certain nuclear-related and dual-use materials and \ntechnology.\n  Iran would be required to grant the IAEA access to investigate \nsuspicious sites or allegations of a covert enrichment facility, \nconversion facility, centrifuge production facility, or yellowcake \nproduction facility anywhere in the country.\n  Iran would implement an agreed set of measures to address IAEA's \nconcerns regarding the possible military dimensions of its program.\n  Many of the framework elements I have just described are to last 10 \nyears. Some have a lifetime of 15, 20, or 25 years under this initial \nframework. So this framework, as many have pointed out, does not lock \ninto place all of these elements for an eternity. But by building a \ndeep cooperation, consultation, and coordination over a 10-year period, \nwe create the best possible chance of forging a long-term enduring \nagreement that will preclude the proliferation of nuclear weapons in \nthe Middle East.\n  The challenge now is to take this framework as articulated by the \nState Department and generate detailed agreement language. That will \nnot be an easy task. Already, you can tell the complexities from just \nthe elements I\n\n[[Page S2719]]\n\nhave mentioned on each of these four pathways.\n  Earlier, I noted that while Senators are united in believing we must \nprevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear bomb, there is disagreement over \nthe best strategy. I have laid out the main elements of the negotiated \nstrategy, but in addition to the negotiated verified dismantling of \nIran's nuclear program, there are two other options that are widely \ndiscussed.\n  One option that has been articulated by Members of this Chamber and \nothers would be simply to end negotiations and try to continue with an \nintensified, multilateral sanctions regime. It is important to note, \nhowever, that if you end negotiations, it means an end to the measures \nthat are currently in place, measures in place today as I speak on this \nSenate floor. It would mean an end to the freeze on construction of the \nArak reactor; an end to the negotiated elimination of stockpiles or the \nmodification of the 20-percent enriched uranium; an end to the \ninspections of Iran's nuclear facilities and infrastructure, which has \nenabled us to learn so much about their activities.\n  Moreover, without any interim agreement on inspections, Iran could \ndecide to vastly expand its nuclear program--an outcome that is in \ndirect contradiction of the security interests of the United States and \nour allies.\n  Furthermore, there is no guarantee that if the United States ends \nnegotiations, multilateral sanctions would survive. If our partners in \nthe P5+1 believe the United States has deliberately undermined the \nsuccess of the negotiations, the partners may very well be unwilling to \nmaintain and enforce a strong, multilateral sanctions regime. And that \nis not just speculation. Representatives from Britain, France, and \nGermany have conveyed strong concerns that to undermine the \nnegotiations to withdraw could fracture the international coalition \nthat has made the sanctions effective.\n  Where are we, then? Without effective multilateral sanctions, Iran \nwould have achieved its top negotiating objectives. Its economy would \nimprove, and the pressure to make concessions on nuclear activities and \ninternational monitoring would evaporate.\n  In short, pursuing aggressive sanctions as an alternative to \nnegotiations could have disastrous consequences, with our major \nobjectives undermined, Iran's economy improved, and Iran's nuclear \nprogram unleashed--an outcome that would further degrade international \nsecurity.\n  The third option discussed in this Chamber is to destroy Iran's \nnuclear infrastructure through military force.\n  Advocates for the use of force point to Israel's 1981 attack on \nSaddam Hussein's Osirak reactor in Iraq and Israel's 2007 destruction \nof a Syrian reactor. Advocates for this military option paint a picture \nin which a small group of American bombers conduct limited strikes \nusing bunker buster bombs. Thus, they argue, the United States could \neasily break key links in a nuclear fuel cycle and set Iran's program \nback by 3 to 5 years.\n  This simplistic analysis is way off the mark. Military experts paint \na very different picture. I encourage all of my colleagues to read the \nanalysis prepared by the Center For Strategic and International Studies \nentitled ``Analyzing the Impact of Preventive Strikes against Iran's \nNuclear Facilities,'' revised September 10, 2012. This analysis \nrecognizes that a competent campaign would involve many complicated \noffensive and defensive elements. Here are a few of them: an extensive \nstrategy to diminish Iranian anti-aircraft radars, missiles, and \nbatteries; an extensive strategy to destroy Iran's ballistic missiles \nand other weapons Iran could use in a retaliatory strike; an extensive \nstrategy for the direct assault on Iran's nuclear facilities; extensive \nrefueling and supply logistics; a rigorous strategy to prevent Iran \nfrom shutting down the Strait of Hormuz; extensive strategies to \nprotect neighboring Gulf States and Israel from retaliatory fights; and \na huge effort to defend against asymmetrical attacks on American assets \nthroughout the world.\n  That is just a modest list of the complexities of the military \noption. I again encourage folks to read the analyses by serious \nmilitary analysts. Hopefully you get the picture. There is nothing \nquick, nothing easy about a military option.\n  Moreover, retaliatory threats to the United States and our allies \nmight come from sources other than Iran. Attacks by Shia groups or a \nnation sympathetic to Iran are a possibility.\n  One thing is clear: The course of war is messy and unpredictable. \nWhat we can be sure of is that in the chaos and complexity of war, \nthere will be significant detrimental developments. We know this \nbecause it is true of virtually every war ever fought.\n  Our recent history provides more than enough evidence that, once \nunleashed, a military option that looks simple in the beginning can be \nvery difficult to control and very costly.\n  Ask yourself this question: Which American leaders thought that our \nefforts to eliminate terrorist training camps in Afghanistan and \ndestabilize that nation's government would lead to a 14-year \noccupation, thousands of deaths, a huge number of life-debilitating \ninjuries, and the loss of vast national treasure exceeding $1 trillion?\n  Ask yourself this question: Which American leaders thought that \nattacking Iraq to eliminate phantom weapons of mass destruction would \nshatter that nation, strengthen Iran, and unleash ISIS?\n  In addition, the military option has a substantial risk of increasing \nrather than decreasing Iran's determination to acquire a nuclear \nweapon. Iranian leaders, after attack, might well decide it is their \ntop national priority to acquire nuclear weapons no matter the cost so \nthat neither the United States nor any other nation would dare to \nattack Iran in such a fashion again.\n  So if the United States chooses a military option, it is most likely \ncommitting to a cycle of war as Iran rebuilds a nuclear program in the \nfuture with more steel, more concrete, and more depth underground.\n  So let's return to the three options before us.\n  A negotiated and verifiable agreement for Iran to dismantle its \nnuclear program promises the possibility of achieving our core security \nobjectives without a massive cost in terms of lives, injuries, and \ntreasure. It addresses uranium, plutonium, and covert pathways to a \nbomb.\n  Compare this to the second option: ending negotiations and resuming \nthe toughest possible sanctions. Under this option, there is a \nsubstantial possibility that the multilateral coalition will fracture, \nending multilateral sanctions, with the additional disadvantage that \nall the uranium nuclear programs that are frozen or diminished under \nthe current negotiating process will be free to operate again.\n  Let's turn to the third option. The third option will be \nextraordinarily expensive in blood and treasure. It could generate a \ncycle of warfare that would diminish rather than enhance the security \nof the United States and our allies. This is an option that could \nmotivate Iran and other nations not to give up their nuclear programs \nbut to redouble their efforts to secure a nuclear weapon.\n  So the single-best option, if achievable, is a negotiated, verifiable \nagreement for Iran to dismantle its nuclear program. Thus, we in \nCongress, we in the Senate Chamber, should do everything possible to \nincrease the likelihood of this option succeeding.\n  One valuable role of this Chamber and of the House is to articulate \nthe need to have key elements of an agreement well designed. My \ncolleague from New Jersey was raising a series of questions. These are \nthe types of questions the State Department negotiations will be paying \nclose attention to so that when an agreement is delivered for our \nconsideration, there will be strong answers.\n  We need ironclad assurances about the dismantlement, storage, and \ncontrol of key materials and equipment; rigorous and enforceable \nboundaries on any ``research'' nuclear program; extensive and effective \ninspection protocols; and strong snapback provisions in the event Iran \nbreaks its obligation.\n  We need an orderly process in which to conduct this assessment of an \nagreement to confirm that it meets these standards. Such a coherent \ncongressional process has several advantages. First, it strengthens our \nPresident's hand in negotiation. The President and his team must strive \nto get all key elements nailed down, knowing they will\n\n[[Page S2720]]\n\nbe reviewed by a sometimes skeptical Congress. Second, such a review \nstrengthens the agreement as an enduring framework that will provide \nthe transition to the next Presidency. This can contribute confidence \nthat phased implementation will be honored by both sides and help \ngenerate the momentum necessary to hammer out the final agreement.\n  Thus, I support the bill reported out in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee unanimously on April 14 and currently under debate before the \nSenate. This bill gives Congress the right to review the agreement and \nclassified and unclassified versions of a verification report Secretary \nKerry must provide to Congress. It gives Congress the right to \ndisapprove of the agreement. It requires the President to provide \nimportant information to Congress, including evidence of material \nbreaches of the agreement, of Iran's involvement in acts of terrorism, \nIran's violation of human rights, and advances in Iran's ballistic \nmissile capabilities.\n  In addition, the President must certify that Iran has not materially \nbreached the agreement or, if they breached, they have cured that \nbreach; that Iran has not taken any action that would advance its \nnuclear weapons program; that the suspension of sanctions is both \nappropriate and proportionate to Iran's efforts under the agreement and \nvital to the national security interests of the United States; and that \nthe agreement does not compromise in any way our enduring commitment to \nIsrael's security.\n  Congress shaped the sanctions regime that put the pressure on Iran \nand forced them to the negotiating table. It is logical, therefore, \nthat Congress should be involved in making sure the results of these \nnegotiations fully serve the security interests of our Nation and our \nallies. What we must not do, however, is turn this bill, this \nstructure, or appropriate and valuable congressional review into an \ninstrument designed to undermine or poison the success of the \nnegotiations in order to pave the path for war.\n  I will oppose the adoption of any poison pill amendment designed to \nundermine the viability of the negotiations. What is at stake is much \nbigger than the ordinary day-to-day politics of this Chamber. The \ncontent of any final agreement with Iran is of profound significance to \nthe national security of the United States, the national security of \nour allies, and to international peace and stability.\n  I urge my colleagues to carry the weight of this responsibility, of \nthis topic, of this process, this concern over nuclear proliferation--\nand particularly, proliferation that could put a nuclear weapon in the \nhands of Iran--and to keep our eyes on the prize.\n  I urge my colleagues to work together in partnership with our \nPresident to develop and implement a tough, verifiable end to Iran's \nquest for nuclear weapons.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n         Committee Examination of Issues in Their Jurisdiction\n\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. I rise today to speak about the importance of \nadditional congressional consideration during the congressional review \nperiod of a final negotiated nuclear agreement. The involvement of \nother committees in examining the issues in their jurisdiction will be \nimportant. I think my distinguished colleague would agree with me that \nextended committee consideration means more American voices in the \nprocess, and an agreement of this significance--and the resulting \nimplications of possible violations--call for supplemental review. \nSenator Corker has reaffirmed the benefits of this process and so I \nthank him for his support.\n  I appreciate the leadership of my colleague and look forward to \nworking with him to further advance constructive, deliberative \nconsideration of an agreement that has multilateral effects on the \nsecurity of our nation and its people.\n  Mr. CORKER. I agree with my colleague, the Senator from Alaska, that \nother committees should consider the relevant issues in their \njurisdiction. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will, of course, \nconsider any resolution of approval or disapproval, but the involvement \nof other committees in the hearing process will certainly assist the \nfull Senate as it debates this issue.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Iran \nNuclear Agreement Review Act.\n  I intend to vote for this bill because it provides appropriate \ncongressional review of a tremendously important executive agreement \nthat is now being negotiated by the world's major powers and Iran.\n  First of all, I want to point out that a final agreement with Iran \nwould not be a treaty. It would be an executive agreement which follows \nagreements in the past going back at least until 1972.\n  In 1972, President Nixon signed the Shanghai Communique, which \nreestablished relations with China.\n  In 1975, the Ford administration signed the Helsinki Final Act, which \neased tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union during \nthe Cold War.\n  In 1986, at Reykjavik, Iceland, President Reagan and Mikhail \nGorbachev discussed the possibility of complete nuclear disarmament. \nEven though no agreement was made, Reykjavik laid the groundwork for \nthe 1987 Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty and the 1991 Strategic Arms \nReduction Treaty.\n  The next year, in 1987, the Reagan administration established the \nMissile Technology Control Regime. To this day it helps restrict the \nproliferation of nuclear-capable missiles and related technology.\n  In 2013, the United States and Russia came together and disarmed \nSyria of its most lethal chemical weapons.\n  Like a potential deal with Iran on its nuclear program, these \nexamples are not treaties and did not require formal ratification by \nthe Senate.\n  That said, I don't believe there has been an agreement in recent \nmemory that has been as difficult or as complicated as the P5+1 \nnegotiations.\n  Perhaps more than any other single subject in the 22 years I have \nbeen in the Senate, there has never been more secure briefings--both \nfor the leadership of national security committees and the entire \nSenate--as we have received on the negotiations with Iran.\n  This constant engagement with Congress has created an opportunity for \nus to get involved in a constructive manner.\n  The elected representatives of this country should have an \nopportunity to weigh-in on and review this agreement.\n  Several bills have been offered by the Banking Committee and the \nForeign Relations Committee, but I believe the bill that was negotiated \nby Senators Corker and Cardin is an appropriate mechanism for Congress \nto review any agreement with Iran.\n  What this legislation is about is an agreement preventing Iran from \ndeveloping a nuclear weapon. Nothing else. To put other issues on this \nbill jeopardizes the agreement taking shape between the United States, \nRussia, Germany, China, France, and the U.K. And that is because the \nonly thing discussed in the negotiation has been a nuclear agreement.\n  Rather than adding extra issues, we should be evaluating the final \nagreement as it comes together over the coming months.\n  The bottom line is that this bill--as currently written--does not \ninterfere with the ongoing negotiations. Adding extra issues at this \ntime, no matter how important they may be, could derail diplomacy. As \nsuch, I will oppose them.\n  If a final agreement is reached, the bill requires Congress to review \nit within 30 days. If Members wish to prevent implementation of the \nagreement, the bill requires two-thirds of the Senate to vote in favor \nof a resolution of disapproval. The bill's requirement of an \noverwhelming majority to disapprove provides significant deference to \nthe President, which is entirely appropriate. If an overwhelming \nmajority of the Congress stands in opposition to an agreement, there is \na high likelihood that the agreement will not work regardless of \npassage, since Congress would likely not vote to lift sanctions--\nsomething that has to be factored in to any long-term agreement.\n  I would like to speak briefly on the framework agreement announced on \nApril 2, 2015. In my view it is strong and deserves to be supported.\n\n[[Page S2721]]\n\n  For me, the technical assessment of Energy Secretary Moniz is \ncritical. Secretary Moniz is an extremely distinguished nuclear \nphysicist and a man I deeply respect. According to Secretary Moniz, the \nframework blocks Iran's four possible pathways to a nuclear weapon. \nThose are the plutonium pathway through the Arak heavy water reactor, \nthe uranium pathway through the Natanz facility, the uranium pathway \nthrough the Fordow facility, and the covert pathway, where Iran \nenriches nuclear material for a weapon in secret.\n  When each of these pathways is explained in detail, the strength of \nthe framework is apparent.\n  First, the agreement requires Iran to redesign the Arak heavy water \nreactor, making it impossible to produce weapons-grade plutonium. Iran \nwill be required to ship the reactor's spent fuel abroad for the life \nof the reactor; prohibited from building another heavy water reactor, \nand indefinitely barred from researching the critical technologies \nneeded to build a plutonium weapon. Under the framework, Iran will be \nprevented from developing a plutonium bomb forever.\n  Second, with regard to the Fordow facility, Iran will not be able to \nstore nuclear material or conduct any enrichment-related research and \ndevelopment at the site. Only 1,000 of Iran's least efficient \ncentrifuges will remain in the facility, about a third of what it has \ntoday. And they will not be used to enrich uranium. The facility, set \ndeep in a mountainside, will become a nuclear medical research center, \nnot a proliferation risk.\n  Third, with regard to Natanz, Iran will operate no more than 5,060 of \nits first-generation centrifuges, and it will enrich uranium far short \nof weapons grade. As Secretary Moniz has said, not only are the 5,060 \ncentrifuges a stark decrease from their current inventory of nearly \n20,000, but they are Iran's oldest and least capable model. Iran will \nplace its more-advanced and more-capable second-generation centrifuges \nin storage under IAEA seal and supervision. Natanz will be the only \nlocation where Iran is permitted to enrich uranium, and solely for \npeaceful purposes.\n  Further, Iran will not be able to stockpile much of the material it \ncan enrich at Natanz. Iran will only retain 300 kilograms of uranium \ngas enriched to 3.67 percent. That is a fraction of the nearly 10,000 \nkilograms of near-5 percent enriched uranium it has today.\n  Finally, the framework agreement blocks Iran's covert pathway to a \nnuclear weapon. The framework requires unprecedented inspection of all \nof Iran's nuclear facilities, including suspect sites.\n  In addition, Secretary Moniz notes that this access applies to ``the \nfull uranium supply chain, from mines to centrifuge manufacturing and \noperation.''\n  Having eyes on Iran's entire supply chain makes it impossible for \nIran to breakout using covert facilities. For instance, if uranium \ncannot be accounted for or if centrifuges go missing, the onus will be \non Iran to explain what happened. If it cannot do so, sanctions can--\nand will--be reimposed. Iran will also be required to implement the \nAdditional Protocol and Modified Code 3.1, which forever increase \nIran's obligations to provide access to all of its nuclear sites \nanywhere in the country.\n  The combination of strict limits on Iran's nuclear program and highly \nintrusive inspections will extend Iran's breakout time--that is the \ntime it would need to develop enough nuclear material for one nuclear \nweapon--from the estimated 2 to 3 months today to a year.\n  Under the framework, the international community will know if Iran \nattempts to skirt its obligations and will have sufficient time to \nrespond.\n  If the P5+1 nations and Iran reach a final accord that reflects the \nframework agreement, Iran will be blocked from developing a nuclear \nweapon.\n  In addition to this important goal, an agreement could possibly \nreopen Iran to the world. It could provide Iran an opportunity to \ndecrease its destabilizing activities in the region. A deal could \npotentially lead Iran to drop its financial and military support for \nHezbollah and other proxies. Perhaps more importantly, the nuclear deal \ncould open the door to soliciting the help of Iran and Russia on an \nintractable and to date unsolvable issue: ending the Syrian civil war.\n  The regime, backed by Iran, of Bashar al-Assad has killed more than \n200,000 of its own people and continues to commit war crimes with \nchemical weapons. Besides the sheer magnitude of the death toll, the \nmanner in which Assad has killed so many--through the continued use of \nchemical weapons, barrel bombs, and even starvation--is abhorrent.\n  Further engagement with Iran could also aid our efforts to rid Iraq \nand Syria of ISIL and its grotesque campaign of terror.\n  It is far from certain that Iran will change its behavior, but it is \nfar more likely with a nuclear deal than without. Without an agreement, \nthe likelihood of a major military confrontation in the Middle East--as \nwell as more chaos and instability--increases dramatically. This is to \nno one's benefit. Without an agreement, Iran's nuclear program would be \nunconstrained, directly jeopardizing the security of our partners and \nallies in the region, including Israel.\n  Mr. President, I intend to vote for this bill so that a comprehensive \nagreement with Iran will be strengthened by congressional review. It is \nmy hope that this bill does not become a vehicle to scrap a verifiable \nagreement capable of preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. \nThe coming months will bear that out.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I just want to clarify a few aspects of \nthis legislation and to make clear the collective understanding of the \nSenate in acting on this bill.\n  First, we should be clear that the bill as it stands would prohibit, \nduring the review period, any sanctions relief that goes beyond the \nJPOA or any materially identical extension, including but not limited \nto any increase in the amount of hard currency or other assets that \nIran has access to under the JPOA.\n  That is, during the review period, the amount of relief available \nunder the JPOA could still be offered, if an extension was agreed to in \nthe timeframe provided for in the bill, but no additional amounts could \nbe provided.\n  Second, the term ``statutory sanctions'' as used in the legislation \nmeans sanctions that Congress has imposed or specifically authorized \nwith respect to Iran, including but not limited to all of the sanctions \nimposed with respect to Iran under the Iran Sanctions Act, the \nComprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of \n2010, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, the \nIran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act, and the National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013.\n  That is, the term statutory sanctions as used in the bill, means all \nof the sanctions contained in these statutes and other Iran-related \nsanctions that Congress has imposed.\n  Finally, as discussed during the committee markup, we all agree that \nthe period for review only begins when all the documents required to be \nsubmitted along with the agreement itself and all of the annexes and \nother materials that are covered by the definition of agreement in the \nbill have been submitted to Congress.\n  That is, the period for review under our bill only begins to run when \nall of the documents that make up the agreement and have to be \nsubmitted with it are submitted to Congress, as provided in the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that if cloture is \ninvoked on the Corker substitute amendment No. 1140, that a point of \norder against all of the pending nongermane amendments be in order and \nbe considered to have been made; that the Corker amendment No. 1179 be \nwithdrawn; that the Senate consider and agree to the Corker-Cardin \ntechnical amendment No. 1219; that the Corker substitute amendment No. \n1140, as amended, be adopted, the cloture motion on H.R. 1191 be \nwithdrawn, and the bill, as amended, be read a third time and the \nSenate vote on passage of H.R. 1191, as amended, with no intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor to speak \nabout the\n\n[[Page S2722]]\n\nrisk Iran poses to the world as a result of the legislation before the \nSenate at this moment.\n  A lot has been talked about in the media over the last months--years, \nquite frankly--about the notion we are going to work out a deal with \nIran that will prevent war. Sadly, I believe the direction the deal is \nheaded almost guarantees war at some point, certainly in our lifetime, \nbut maybe before the end of the decade.\n  Let me back up and first describe the issue at hand. The issue at \nhand is that Iran, run by a radical Shia cleric--its government, I \nshould say. Its people perhaps don't partake in this thought process, \nbut its government whose head and supreme decisionmaker is a radical \nShia cleric has made two decisions: The first is they feel it is their \nobligation to export their Islamic revolution everywhere in the world, \nand of course it begins with the Middle East; two, they have decided \nthey want to become the hegemonic power in the region. They want to \nbecome the dominant nation, the dominant movement in the Middle East \nand in that entire region.\n  So how do you achieve that? First, it requires you to drive the \nAmericans out of the area, which is why we have seen them invest in all \nsorts of asymmetrical capabilities, such as these small little swarm \nboats they sometimes use to harass U.S. naval vessels. That is why we \nsaw them just a week ago basically hijack a commercial vessel in \ninternational waters.\n  The second thing they do is they sponsor terrorism. They have all \nthese proxy groups in all these countries in the region doing their \nbidding. That is also asymmetrical warfare--asymmetrical meaning it is \nnot frontal. It is using some nontraditional method to expand or to \nshow their power. They use groups such as Hezbollah or the Houthis they \nare now involved with in Yemen and other parts of the world.\n  The threat is, if you attack Iran, these terrorist groups will attack \nyou. In fact, we have seen the hand of the Iranian Government in \nterrorist attacks. For example, we saw an attempt to assassinate the \nAmbassador of Saudi Arabia here in Washington, DC. We know that in 1994 \nthere was a bombing in Buenos Aires linked to Iran. So they sponsor \nterrorism.\n  The third aspect of their desire to become the hegemonic regional \npower is a nuclear weapon. What do you need to acquire a nuclear \nweapon? You need three things: The first thing you need is a bomb \ndesign. The truth is you can buy a bomb design. The second thing you \nneed is a delivery system, an ability to deliver the weapon whether it \nis on an airplane or on a missile.\n  That is why Iran is developing long-range rockets. They are expending \na lot of money--despite all the sanctions on them, they are expending a \nlot of money to build these long-range rockets. That isn't for some \nfancy fireworks show or to put a man on the Moon. They are building \nthese long-range rockets because they understand that is the second \ncritical component of a nuclear weapons program.\n  The third thing is you have to be able to get your hands on enriched \nuranium or reprocessed plutonium. No one in the world is going to \nimport to them weapons-grade uranium or plutonium, so they have decided \nto build the infrastructure to do it themselves, and they do it the way \nNorth Korea did it. They do it the way other nations have done it when \nthey tried to hide their programs. They do it by claiming they have a \npeaceful nuclear program they are trying to build. In essence, their \nargument is we don't want to build a weapon. We are just trying to \nbuild a nuclear reactor so we can provide electricity.\n  That argument makes no sense for two reasons: The first reason is \nthis is an oil-rich country. They do not really need nuclear energy in \norder to provide cost-effective energy for their country, and the other \nreason is it costs so much money to build the equipment to enrich and \nreprocess, they could just buy it already reprocessed or enriched. They \ncould bring it into the country the way South Korea does and the way \nother nations do.\n  So if it would be cheaper to bring these things in by simply \nimporting it, as opposed to spending all this money enriching and \nreprocessing it themselves, why are they spending all this money on the \ninfrastructure? The answer is because, at some point in the future, \nthey know they are going to want a nuclear weapon. Now, perhaps they \nhaven't made the decision they need it today, next week or next year, \nbut they certainly, at a minimum, want to have the option to be a \nthreshold nuclear power.\n  I believe, knowing everything we know about them--both open source \nand classified--that whether they have decided to build a nuclear \nweapon or not, they will decide to build a nuclear weapon because it \nprovides for them the sort of regime stability they crave.\n  The radical Shia cleric who heads that country looks at North Korea \nand he looks at Libya and he says: Libya is what happens when you don't \nhave a nuclear capability. North Korea is what happens when you do. \nMuammar Qadhafi is dead and out of power, but North Korea is still run \nby that madman. Why? Because he has a nuclear weapon. You can't invade \nhim or touch him because of what he will do in response.\n  I think they are guided by that principle. They are guided by the \nprinciple that they want to be the regional hegemonic power and nuclear \nweapons gives them that role. They are guided by a third equally \nsinister motivation; that is, the open and repeatedly stated desire to \ndestroy the State of Israel, to wipe it of the face of the Earth. They \nhaven't said this once in passing, the Supreme Leader of Iran has said \nthis on hundreds of occasions.\n  In fact, every Friday in Iran, at government-sanctioned religious \nevents, they chant ``Death to America'' and ``Death to Israel.'' If \nthere is one lesson in history, it is that when a nation or leader \nrepeatedly says that we are going to kill you, you should take that \nseriously. When the nation that says we are going to kill you is using \nits governmental money to sponsor terrorism, you should take that even \nmore seriously. When the nation that is going out saying we are going \nto kill you and wipe you off the face of the Earth is reprocessing \nplutonium or enriching uranium, you have a right to be extremely \nscared.\n  The world understood this 8 years ago, 10 years ago, so it imposed \nU.N. Security Council sanctions on Iran--international sanctions. They \nwere not easy to put together. A lot of countries in Europe had \ncompanies in those countries that were dying to do business in Iran. \nThey didn't want these sanctions, but they did it. They were put in \nplace. Then, about a year and a half or two ago, the President decided \nit was time to try to open up to Iran and try to work out a deal with \nthem.\n  Look, in normal circumstances, there is nothing wrong with that; \nright? Two countries that have a disagreement on some issues can work \nthings out. There is a place for diplomacy in the would. The problem is \nthe issue we have with Iran is not based on a grievance. They are not \nmad we did something and so that is why they are acquiring a nuclear \nweapon and if only we stopped doing what it is that aggrieved them they \nwould go away. This is not a grievance-based problem. This is an \nideological problem.\n  If you read the founding documents of the Islamic Republic, it \ndoesn't describe the Supreme Leader as the leader of Iran. Iran happens \nto be the country from which they operate. It describes him as the \nSupreme Leader of all Muslims in the world. That is why they believe it \nis their mandate, it is their calling to export their revolution to \nevery corner of the planet but beginning in the Middle East, and the \nnuclear weapons capability would give them leverage in carrying out the \ngoal they have. In their mind, nothing would be more glorious than the \ndestruction of the Jewish State.\n  So the President enters these negotiations, and it has been a process \nof constant appeasement, moment after moment. We went from saying no \nenriching or reprocessing, to you can enrich and reprocess at 5 \npercent, to you can enrich up to 20 percent for research purposes. We \nwent from saying no enrichment ever to saying in 10 or 15 years all \nbets are off.\n  There are still items in the negotiations that are not clear. The \nWhite House put out a fact sheet, a piece of paper, and it said this is \nwhat we agreed to. Iran put out a piece of paper just like it except it \nsounded like a totally different deal.\n  For example, the U.S. fact sheet said sanctions on Iran would not \ncome off until Iran complied, but Iran's fact\n\n[[Page S2723]]\n\nsheet said no, no, sanctions come off immediately. Now, when you press \nthe White House on it, they refuse to say that, in fact, it will be \nphased in and not immediate.\n  That is why I filed an amendment. Even though I thought the \nPresident's deal as outlined in the fact sheet was not good enough, I \nfiled an amendment to at least hold them to that. The amendment to this \nbill read very simply. It just said that whatever deal the President \ncrafts has to reflect the fact sheet he provided the Senate, but we \ncouldn't get a vote on it.\n  The other amendment I filed is that any deal with Iran should be \nconditioned on Iran recognizing Israel's right to exist, and here is \nwhy that was so important. That was important because this is not just \nabout the nuclear program. The deal the President is trying to sign is \nabout removing sanctions, meaning money is now going to flow back into \nthe Iranian Government's coffers. What are they going to do with this \nmoney? Are they going to build roads, hospitals, donate it to charity? \nNo. Are they going to buy food and medicine for people hurting around \nthe world, the hundreds of thousands who have been displaced by Assad, \ntheir puppet? No. They will use that money to sponsor terrorism, and \nthe prime target of the terrorism they sponsor is the State of Israel.\n  We couldn't get a vote on that amendment either. Apparently, there \nare Senators terrified of voting against that amendment, so they would \nrather not have a vote at all.\n  So I am deeply disappointed by the direction this debate has taken \nbecause I felt--and I understand this deal was carefully crafted \nbecause I am on the committee that passed it, but I also understand \nthat every Member of the Senate has a right to be heard in this debate. \nUnfortunately, only a couple of amendments were allowed to be voted on, \nwith no one else having an opportunity to get their amendments voted \non, amendments I thought would make this bill much more meaningful.\n  Now we have reached this point where the majority leader has filed \ncloture on the bill because it is time to move on to these other \nissues, and I respect that. We now have to make a decision. The \ndecision is not whether we are going to pass the bill we want or \nnothing at all, the decision is are we better off as a country with \nthis bill or with no bill.\n  If we don't pass a bill, the Senate can still weigh in on the Iranian \ndeal, but the Iranian deal kicks in immediately, and unless and until \nthe Senate acts, the sanctions will be off. At least the U.S. sanctions \nwill be off. There is also no guarantee the White House will even show \nus the agreement if we don't pass a bill.\n  If we pass a bill, it delays the sanctions being lifted for a period \nof time. It requires the White House to submit the deal to us so we can \nreview it, and ultimately it calls for a vote--up or down--on approving \nthe deal or not. It actually requires that the vote will have to \nhappen, and there can't be any procedural process to impede it, for the \nmost part.\n  So at the end of the day, while this bill does not contain the \namendments--we didn't even get a vote on the amendments we wanted--it \ndoesn't contain the different aspects I thought would make it stronger, \nif left with the choice we have now, I don't think there is any doubt \nwe are in a better position if this bill passes because, at a minimum, \nit at least creates a process whereby the American people, through \ntheir elected representatives, can debate an issue of extraordinary \nimportance.\n  If I am troubled by anything, it is that while this issue gets a lot \nof coverage, I am not sure the coverage accurately reflects what a \ncritical moment this is. I said at the outset that I think a bad deal \nalmost guarantees war, and here is why. Because the State of Israel--\nsuch an important ally to the United States--is not thousands of miles \naway from Iran. Put yourself in their position for a moment. This small \ncountry, with a small population, 9 miles wide at its narrowest point--\nwith a neighbor to the north that openly and repeatedly says it wants \nto destroy them and is on the verge of acquiring a nuclear capability--\nfeels like their very existence is being threatened. Faced with that, \nIsrael may very well take military action on their own to protect \nthemselves. I think a bad deal exponentially increases the likelihood \nof that happening.\n  I also think we look at the other nations of the region, because Iran \nis a Shia country--a Shia Persian country--but its Sunni Arab neighbors \naren't big fans of the Shia branch of Islam.\n  For example, Saudi Arabia, an incredibly wealthy country, has already \nsaid: Whatever Iran gets, we are going to get. If Iran gets the right \nto enrich and reprocess, we will enrich and reprocess. If Iran builds a \nweapon, we will build a weapon. And so it creates the very real specter \nthat we will have an arms race--a nuclear arms race--in the Middle \nEast. We are talking about a region of the world that has been unstable \nfor 3,800 years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. RUBIO. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds to \nconclude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. We are talking about a region of the world that could have \na nuclear arms race--one of the most unstable regions of the planet.\n  So I hope we are going to get a good deal. I am not hopeful that we \nwill. But I think we are better off if we have this process in place. \nSo I hope this bill passes here today so that at least we will have a \nchance to weigh in on an issue of critical importance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, my colleague from Florida knows the \npersonal affection I have for him, and I enjoy so much his friendship \nand working with him on issues regarding Florida.\n  I think this is an example of how two Senators from the same State \ncan come to different conclusions, apparently not about this \nlegislation--advancing it, because this Senator will in fact vote to \nmove this legislation forward--but on the ultimate judgment that we \nhave to make.\n  Senator Rubio has correctly stated, in my opinion, that Iran's is a \nregime that is bent on aggression, that they cannot be trusted, that \nIsrael is threatened, and that we are basically the backstop protector \nof Israel. All of those things are very true.\n  But the question is what is in the interest of the national security \nof the United States--which, in most cases, always folds into what is \nin the interest of the national security of Israel as well--and the \nSenator and I come to different conclusions.\n  First of all, we don't know the final details. But we do know a \nframework that was put out, and if that framework is fleshed out, as is \nsuggested, with the details by June 30, then the simple bottom line for \nthis Senator is if it prevents Iran from building a nuclear weapon over \nat least a 10-year period, with the sufficient safeguards, intrusions, \ninspections--unannounced, as well--that prevent them from having a \nnuclear weapon without our getting, conservatively, a year's advanced \nnotice and we know that is a guarantee for a 10-year period--if not 15 \nand 20 years--is that in the interest of the United States? And this \nSenator has concluded that yes, it is.\n  I hope the agreement comes out as suggested by the framework. I will \nbe looking forward to examining that. And, as a result of our passing \nthis legislation today, we will have a guarantee that we will vote on \nparts with regard to the lifting of sanctions, and we will be able to \nweigh in on the specifics.\n  It is interesting how two Senators from the same State can come out \nwith such different conclusions having shared a lot of the similar \ninformation, as this Senator has served on the Intelligence Committee \nfor 6 years and Senator Rubio is on the Intelligence Committee as well.\n  It will be an interesting debate as we get into the details.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, it is interesting that I am not a Senator \nfrom Florida but I am a Senator who was born in Florida.\n  With due respect to my friend, Senator Nelson, there was something \nthe Senator said that I had not thought to\n\n[[Page S2724]]\n\ntalk about, but I think we have to. It has to do with a bit of a shift \nin the thinking of this President, unlike any other President in the \nlast 40 years, since the Ayatollahs have come into power.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for not more than 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I hate to object. There is only 10 minutes \nremaining and all the time on the Republican side has been used up.\n  Would my colleague limit his remarks perhaps to 3 minutes so I could \nhave a little bit of time on our side?\n  Mr. TILLIS. Yes, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, with the limited time, first, I am \nconcerned now that we have gone away from President after President \nsaying that Iran could never have a nuclear weapon, to the words of: \nWell, Iran shouldn't be able to have one at least for 10 years. Or, if \nthey do get one before 10 years, we will know about it a year in \nadvance. That is a fundamental change in the direction of negotiations \nwith this hostile regime.\n  That is the other thing in my limited time that I wish to point out. \nI think those of us who are voting for this bill today are voting in \nlarge part because of a distrust we have for the Supreme Leader and the \nregime in Iran. This is not about the Iranian people. There are tens of \nmillions of Iranians that I believe are concerned with this deal as \nwell. They are concerned that this is going to enable the Iranian \ngovernment to continue to fund terror throughout the world through the \nIran terror network. They are funding even Hamas, a natural enemy, to \ndestabilize the region.\n  We need to worry about what the Prime Minister of Israel said just a \nfew months ago here in this Chamber: This represents a dire threat. \nDoes anyone think that Israel can stand by on their own and allow Iran \nto continue to be unfettered and potentially move forward with a \nnuclear program? I don't think so.\n  But I also want to make sure that the Iranian people know we are also \nconcerned that we have a President who is willing to negotiate with a \nregime that is guilty of human rights violations, that is guilty of \nspreading terror through the world, that is guilty of meddling in the \naffairs of other Middle Eastern nations. And we are sitting along the \nsidelines and saying maybe we can still move this deal through, because \nat least knowing when Iran gets a nuclear weapon is better than the \ncurrent state.\n  I think the current state is working. Sanctions are working. Pressure \non Iran to respect human rights, to get out of the terror business is \nvery important.\n  The last slide I wanted to show and that I wanted to spend more time \non--how on Earth does anyone think that a nation that is not intent on \nlaunching a nuclear missile at some time would invest in this sort of \ninfrastructure to reach different parts of the globe? It is only a \nmatter of time. Now, we have heard that maybe it will only be 10 years \nor maybe a year from when we find out about it. But make no mistake \nabout it. If Iran is left alone, they are going to have the ability to \ndeliver this sort of terror anywhere in the world.\n  That is why I will be supporting the bill, and hopefully, we can \ndefeat any bad deal that comes from the administration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, after 2 weeks on the floor, in a few \nmoments we will have a chance to advance the Iran bill to passage and \nthen vote on passage. I urge my colleagues to support the cloture \nmotion and to support final passage.\n  First, I thank Senator Corker. Senator Corker has been an incredible \npartner, and the two of us have worked in the best interests not only \nof the Senate but in the best interests of our country. We recognize \nthis Nation is stronger when in foreign policy we are united and speak \nwith one voice. That is exactly what we were able to do in the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee by a vote of 19 to 0.\n  This is an extremely controversial area. We understand that. But we \nreached a position where we could get a 19-to-0 vote in the committee. \nWe were able to bring that forward and were able to get the \nadministration to work with us on this. So the bill will be signed by \nthe President of the United States.\n  I just want to thank Senator Corker for his incredible leadership \nthrough these very difficult times so that we could reach this point.\n  It gives us the best chance to accomplish our goal. Our goal is to \nprevent Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons state--pure and simple. We \nwill be in a stronger position to achieve that objective with the \npassage of this legislation.\n  We understand what that means. We understand that it has to be an \nagreement that prevents Iran from a breakout capacity to have a nuclear \nweapon in a period of time where we would be compromised, because we \nknow we have to be able to inspect, we have to be able to see what they \nare doing, and we have to be able to react if they cheat. This bill \nallows us to have that type of an oversight over such an agreement.\n  It spells out the proper role for Congress. It was in the 1990s that \nCongress started to impose sanctions against Iran for its nuclear \nweapons program. Only Congress can remove those sanctions or \npermanently change them. So it is in our interests to be able to have \nan orderly way to review an agreement. And it is an orderly review \nbecause it requires the President to submit the agreement to us so we \nhave opportunities for open hearings and for closed hearings, to do \nwhat we need to in order to make our judgment as to how to proceed. \nThere is no required action, but we could take the appropriate action, \nand we have the time to take the appropriate action.\n  Congress would then have oversight of the agreement. The \nadministration would be required to report to us on a quarterly basis \nthat Iran is in compliance with the agreement. If there is a material \nbreach, there are expedited procedures for us to be able to take action \nto reimpose and strengthen the sanctions regime that is in place.\n  So it really gives us the opportunity not only to have oversight on a \npotential agreement if one is reached but then to monitor to make sure \nthat the agreement is complied with.\n  But we go beyond that. I have heard a lot of my colleagues talk about \nIran and what it is doing on its sponsoring of terrorism, what it is \ndoing on human rights violations, their ballistic missile programs. We \nunderstand that. We require reports from the administration as to their \nactivities in each of these areas. It is very clear, as the President \nmade in his summary of the April 2 framework, that nothing in this \nagreement affects the other sanctions that are imposed against Iran \nbecause of ballistic missiles, because of terrorism or because of human \nrights issues.\n  So I think we have found the right balance.\n  Lastly, let me say we have also made it very clear in this agreement \nthat the security of Israel is critically important, and we have \nspelled that out in our legislation.\n  So for all those reasons, I think the fact that we were able to reach \nthis type of an agreement--we had a couple votes. The votes were pretty \ndecisive as to how they came out on the floor. I thank all our \ncolleagues for the way they cooperated with us on being able to reach \nthis moment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of the time to the chairman of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished ranking member. \nI will be very brief.\n  I thank our ranking member, who could not have been more of a \ngentleman, more of a leader on this issue, and I cannot thank him \nenough for his efforts and his staff's.\n  I thank also Senator Menendez, who before was ranking member of the \ncommittee and is such a leader on this and has been from day one \nrelative to the sanctions on Iran and bringing them to the table.\n  I would also thank Senator Graham. We began this process in July of \nlast year. And so many others have been involved. Senator Graham \nobviously helped drive this. So did Senator Kaine, on the Democratic \nside of the aisle. But we have had so many rocks,\n\n[[Page S2725]]\n\nsuch as Jeff Flake and others who have just been steady in helping make \nthis happen.\n  Since there is only a short amount of time, I do want to encourage my \ncolleagues here in the Senate to support this cloture motion. We have \nbeen on the floor now for 2 weeks, and I know there have been a lot of \nprocess issues that we have dealt with.\n  At the end of the day, without this bill there is no review of what \nhappens relative to Iran. So we worked hard to create a great \nbipartisan balance. I think we have an opportunity to do something that \nreally is in some ways a landmark piece of legislation, in that the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee in a bipartisan way with a 19-to-0 \nvote has basically taken back the power that the President now has to \nwork collaboratively to make sure that we have the opportunity to see \nthe details, as my colleague has mentioned, of any deal that may be \nnegotiated with Iran, that it stand before the Senate and give us time \nto actually go through those details, that we see all the classified \nannexes and everything that go with this. We have the opportunity, \nshould we choose, to pass a resolution of approval or disapproval. And \nthen, very importantly, the President has to certify every 90 days that \nIran is in compliance.\n  So let me just restate that, without this bill, there is no \nlimitation on the President's use of waivers to suspend the sanctions \nCongress has put in place. There is no requirement that Congress \nreceive full details of any agreement with Iran. There is no review \nperiod for Congress to examine and weigh in on an agreement. There is \nno requirement that the President certify Iran is complying. And there \nare really no expedited procedures for Congress to reimpose rapidly \nsanctions should Iran cheat.\n  So, in summary, no bill, no review; no bill, no oversight. I think \nthe American people want the Senate and the House of Representatives on \ntheir behalf to ensure that Iran is accountable, that this is a \ntransparent process, and that they comply.\n\n  With that, I concede that the Presiding Officer wants to move ahead.\n  Again, I thank our ranking member for his distinguished service and \nall of my colleagues who have brought us to this moment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the Corker \n     amendment No. 1140 to H.R. 1191, an act to amend the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 to ensure that emergency services \n     volunteers are not taken into account as employees under the \n     shared responsibility requirements contained in the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n         Mitch McConnell, Bob Corker, Joni Ernst, Rob Portman, \n           Johnny Isakson, Shelley Moore Capito, Thad Cochran, \n           Orrin G.

The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                   Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act\n\n  Before my colleagues leave the floor, let me just offer my \ncongratulations to the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from \nMaryland, who have shepherded this important piece of legislation, the \nIran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, across the Senate floor.\n  I think we are all reminded every time we take up some consensus \nlegislation and find all the traps and obstacles to passage that this \nis not an easy process. But it was not designed to be easy. It was \ndesigned to force consensus before a bill actually is passed into law. \nThanks to the patience and the tenacity of our colleague from Tennessee \nand our colleague from Maryland, we have done that today, and I thank \nthem very much for that.\n  This legislation guarantees that Congress will have the opportunity \nand the time to scrutinize any agreement reached between the \nadministration and the P5+1 nations with regard to Iran's nuclear \nprogram. This is to my mind the single greatest threat--not only to \nregional peace but to world peace--and that is the prospect of an \nIranian nuclear program, a nuclear weapon.\n  This bill prohibits the President from lifting sanctions that \nCongress has worked on for so long during this period of time. That is \nanother important feature. But the most important part of this is the \nfact that Congress will have the right to vote for or against any \nchange in the status quo when it comes to Iran. This bill will serve as \na congressional check if there is a bad deal with Iran, and it will \nallow the American people through their elected representatives to \nconsider carefully whether this potential agreement is a good one.\n  I have been amazed to read in the newspaper and to see on TV that the \nPresident has negotiated a deal. When one asks to read the deal, you \nfind out there is no deal. There is a so-called framework. But if a \ndeal is reached between our negotiating team negotiating with Iran and \nthe P5+1 countries, then Congress will have an opportunity--and through \nus the American people will have the opportunity--to read it and to \nunderstand it. We will have the opportunity then to debate it, and as I \nsaid, we will have the opportunity then to vote up or down on this deal \nonce a deal is struck, if a deal is struck.\n  But I wonder sometimes about the naivete of the administration when \nit comes to negotiating with the world's foremost State sponsor of \ninternational terror. This is a regime that has been killing \nAmericans--mainly by proxy--since the early 1980s. Of course we should \nnot and we cannot trust Iran to do the right thing. It makes it even \nmore necessary for Congress to put all aspects of any deal under a \nmicroscope, as we will.\n  While the President has been negotiating this vague and convoluted \nframework, the Iranian regime has done nothing to earn the trust of the \nAmerican people or our allies. Just the opposite is true. Iran has only \nproven that it is untrustworthy and that it will stop at nothing to \nfurther its influence throughout the Middle East at the expense of the \nUnited States and our allies.\n  You don't have to look any further than the New York Times to find a \nrelevant example of Iran's doublespeak--speaking out of both sides of \nits mouth. Just last month in a New York Times op-ed, Iran's Foreign \nMinister argued that the United States and the P5+1 countries should \nreach a final agreement in order to promote the stability and security \nof the region.\n  The Foreign Minister, Mohammad Zarif, wrote of the need for ``a \nregional dialogue'' to ``promote understanding . . . on a broad \nspectrum of issues,'' among them, ``ensuring freedom of navigation and \nthe free flow of oil and other resources. . . . ''\n  Well, this very article proves that to think we can negotiate with \nIran in good faith is pure fiction. Just this past week, it was \nreported that U.S. Navy warships have had to accompany British and \nAmerican commercial vessels through the Strait of Hormuz, an \ninternational shipping lane that links the Indian Ocean and the Persian \nGulf, after the Iranian navy seized a commercial vessel last week.\n  Reports of another naval scuffle between the United States and Iran \nwas reported yesterday just off the coast of Yemen. Is this how Iran \nhas been working to ensure freedom of navigation in this region?\n  Well, of course this is just one example of Iran's most recent \ndeceptive tactics. This is the kind of regime that has been, as I said, \non our State Department's list as the lead State for sponsorship of \nterrorism since 1984.\n  Now the Obama administration seeks to cut a deal with the regime, a \ncountry that publicly admits wanting to destroy Israel and to build its \nempire and influence in places such as war-torn Syria and Iraq. The \nObama administration's framework does nothing to hold Iran accountable \nfor its proxy wars or for this type of regional adventurism. Even more \nconcerning, this ambiguous understanding that the President released \nlast month would abandon longstanding U.S. policy of preventing a \nnuclear-armed Iran and replace it with a feeble plan to contain it.\n  I remember, as the Presiding Officer no doubt remembers, Prime \nMinister Netanyahu was just here a few weeks ago. He said that rather \nthan prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, this framework would \npave the path toward a nuclear Iran. The deal also forces the American \npeople to trust the Iranian leadership with threshold nuclear \ncapabilities, without allowing for adequate inspections of all of \nIran's nuclear sites by international agencies, both civilian and \nmilitary. This is unacceptable and dangerous. It also underscores why \nthis legislation that we just passed is so important.\n  This legislation is vitally important because it is a congressional \nbackstop against an Iranian regime that is well known for its lies and \ninternational deception. Guaranteeing the time and the opportunity for \nCongress to scrutinize this misguided deal is essential. Providing the \nAmerican people with the kind of transparency they deserve to \nunderstand what has been negotiated on their behalf is absolutely \ncritical.\n  America's elected representatives must be able to get every and any \ndetail on this emerging deal. That is one reason why I think this \nlegislation is so important. We need the time and space to review it. \nThis bill provides for that. It gives us an opportunity to understand \nits terms and debate its implications.\n  I am encouraged by the vote we just had, a near unanimous vote on \nthis legislation. This is important because this President has shown a \npredisposition\n\n[[Page S2727]]\n\nto try to go it alone, not only in foreign affairs and national \nsecurity matters but on immigration, health care, and the like.\n  It is past time for Congress to stand up and tell the President that \nhe cannot act alone. Our Constitution contemplates three coequal \nbranches of government, and Congress on behalf of the American people \ncannot be frozen out of the debate and the decisionmaking when it comes \nto something as important as an Iranian nuclear negotiation.\n  I see another Senator ready to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n     National Day of Prayer and Solving Problems in Our Communities\n\n  Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, today is the National Day of Prayer. It is \na day where we as a nation have an opportunity simply to get on our \nknees and ask God for Divine intervention and ask the Lord for help.\n  Our Nation is, indeed, an amazing nation, a great nation, a nation \nwith a destiny. I think it is important for us to take the time to \nremind ourselves, as part of the foundation of this very Nation, that \nthere is a foundation of faith.\n  As I think about that foundation of faith and the need for prayer, it \nis hard not to remember that the last year has proven to be a difficult \ntime for low-income communities and minority communities throughout \nthis country. It is time for us to have a national conversation about \nsolving some of the problems that we see arising in communities around \nthe Nation. Whether those communities are in Ferguson or Baltimore, \nOhio or Oklahoma or in my hometown of North Charleston, SC, finding \nsolutions is critical.\n  I believe that a part of the puzzle includes body cameras to be worn \nby our officers. Body cameras are simply not a fantasy but a part of a \nlarger puzzle to provide solutions to communities that are distressed. \nI know firsthand that the solutions in my Opportunity Agenda work.\n  As a kid growing up in a single parent household, I drifted in the \nwrong direction. I struggled in school. I had a difficult time. I was a \nhopeless kid in a challenging situation. I will state that as I look \naround the Nation, many of the challenges we see today are kids just \nlike me, growing up in places like where I grew up, looking for hope, \nlooking for leadership.\n  I believe that embedded in my Opportunity Agenda we have some of the \nsolutions that can help heal and restore as well as direct and instruct \nthese communities into places of hope and opportunity. I believe that \ntoo often we see impoverished communities and distressed communities as \nhigh-risk communities. I prefer to see them as high-potential \ncommunities, communities where greatness breeds and lives. We just need \nto find an avenue to harness the potential and move forward.\n  I am hopeful that as we focus on the issues that are embedded in the \nOpportunity Agenda--issues such as education, and I mean a quality \neducation in every ZIP Code in America and that we should have high-\nperforming schools in those ZIP Codes. That includes school choice, \nwhether it is charter or virtual or home schools or public schools. We \nneed to have a serious and robust conversation about school choice.\n  Work skills are so important. In so many of these communities the \nunemployment rate is over 30 percent--a 30-percent unemployment rate. \nWe can challenge those statistics by looking at the work skills and \nalso by looking at apprenticeship programs, where you can earn and \nlearn at the exact same time. We are breathing new hope into these \ncommunities. I also think that when we think about the future, we must \nthink about the chance to save the future of so many of these young \nkids who may be losing hope in our country, who may be losing hope in \ntheir communities, and perhaps losing hope in themselves.\n  We have a chance to make a difference in this next generation.\n  I thank Senator Grassley, our chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nalong with Senator Graham, our subcommittee chair, for agreeing to hold \na hearing on the use of body cameras in the next few weeks. I believe \nthe hearing on body cameras will produce important information on how \nwe can deal with some of the challenges in some of our distressed \ncommunities.\n  I believe we can find ways to restore hope and create opportunities \nfor every single child in America.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 10th Annual \nSennoras of Excellence and Sennores of Distinction Awards Gala hosted \nby the Foundation for Excellence and Distinction in Las Vegas, NV.\n  The Foundation for Excellence and Distinction was created by Sandy \nand Roger Peltyn with the sole purpose of raising funds to award \nscholarships for young Nevada students pursuing excellence in higher \neducation. Over the last 10 years, the Foundation has awarded more than \n700 scholarships through local charities, including the University of \nNevada, Las Vegas, UNLV, Foundation, Nevada State College, Nevada \nHospital Association, the Center for Academic Enrichment and Outreach \nat UNLV, College of Southern Nevada, Puerto Rican Association \nScholarship Fund, HEART for children with AUTISM, Latin Chamber of \nCommerce Scholarship Fund, City Impact Center, and Miss Nevada \nScholarship Organization. These scholarships would have not been \npossible without the support of the people of Nevada and the \nimmeasurable contributions and collaboration from Karen Cashman and \nEllie Hirschfield.\n  The foundation has recognized many strong sennoras and sennores \nthroughout the community for their work to encourage the success of \nfuture generations. A Sennora of Excellence can best be described as a \nwoman who is confident in her beliefs, loyal to family and friends, \naccepts victories and disappointments with grace, and rises above \nlife's challenges. A Sennor of Distinction is a man who bases his life \non principles, raises spirits, never lets people down, and makes \nsacrifices for future generations without expecting to receive anything \nin return.\n  We pay tribute to this year's award recipients and the previous \nhonorees of the Sennoras of Excellence and Sennores of Distinction, \nLifetime Achievement, Corporation of Distinction, and Humanitarian of \nthe Year awards. This year, my dear friend Wayne Newton is the \nrecipient of the Humanitarian of the Year award.

Mr. President, we have reached a tipping point in \nPresident Obama's quest for a ``legacy''. Ukraine is on fire; Senior \nChinese generals openly boast of their desire to settle millennial \nscores with their neighbors; Al Qaeda is stronger than ever; ISIS is \nmassacring Christians with a genocidal savagery the likes of which we \nhave not seen since World War II; and Israel feels abandoned. American \nforeign policy is rudderless, bringing to mind Lewis Carroll's comment \nfrom Alice Through the Looking Glass, ``If you don't know where you are \ngoing any road can take you there.''\n\n[[Page S2728]]\n\n  Now the President has staked his name on reaching a deal with the \nAyatollahs no matter how dangerous or destabilizing the final accord \nis. If the Iranians agree to this, and from their own hegemonic \ninterest they would be foolish not to, the Israeli hand will be forced \nas it was with the Iraqi Osirik reactor in 1981; or at the least, a \nMiddle East nuclear arms race, that pulls in Turkey, Saudi Arabia, \nEgypt and the Gulf States, will begin.\n  Mr. Obama has turned his back on decades of assurances from \nPresidents of both parties that Iran would not acquire nuclear weapons. \nHe has willfully ignored 40 years of hostility from Tehran. If the \nPresident does not recognize that we are at war, the mullahs certainly \ndo. They are the chief sponsor of global terror. They have never \nstepped back from their desire to obliterate Israel and to destroy the \nUnited States. Our Arab friends see Iran creating a satellite ``Shia \nCrescent'' stretching to the Mediterranean and consisting of Iraq, \nSyria, and Lebanon. To their south and west, they see Iran gaining \ncontrol of Yemen. Shia Iran is so obsessed with its race to dominate \nthe Middle East that it is funneling millions of dollars to the Sunni \nterrorist group Hamas, to fund their war against Israel, even though \nthe Sunnis are religious enemies.\n  Tehran has a 9-figure line item in its budget to support terrorism, \nsending hundreds of millions of dollars to various groups each year; \nthe payments to Hezbollah alone are as much as $200 million annually. \nAccording to Canadian intelligence, ``[I]n February 1999, it was \nreported that Palestinian police discovered documents that attest to \nthe transfer of $35 million to Hamas from the Iranian Intelligence \nService (MOIS), money reportedly meant to finance terrorist activities \nagainst Israeli targets.'' Illustrating how such support is part of \nofficial government policy, from 2001 to 2006, Iran transferred $50 \nmillion to Hezbollah fronts in Lebanon by sending funds from its \ncentral bank through Bank Saderat's London office.\n  Mr. President, 40 years ago, Richard Nixon confronted Soviet \nincursions into the Middle East. The so called Nixon Doctrine laid the \nfoundation for a peaceful pro-Western resolution of the various crises \nin the region. Nixon made it clear to everyone that the United States \nwould not abandon Israel. Israel would be backed by the power of the \nUnited States in any conflict with its Soviet backed Arab neighbors and \nagainst the Soviet Union itself. One by one, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi \nArabia, and the Emirates, recognized the futility of armed hostility to \nIsrael and backed away from Moscow and made peace, an imperfect peace \nbut peace nonetheless. Golda Meir called President Nixon ``the best \nfriend Israel ever had.''\n  In the region's west, Nixon promoted a secular pro-Western Iran, \nalbeit under the imperfect leadership of the Shah. Nevertheless, the \nShah bottled the Soviet Navy from entering the Persian Gulf and Iran's \neconomy took off--until Jimmy Carter decided to aid the transfer of the \nAyatollah Khomeini from his Paris exile back to Iran--in the name of \nhuman rights. We have reaped the whirlwind.\n  Now we have the Obama Doctrine. America is the problem. Israel is \nviewed as an obstacle to peace and Iran is treated as another oppressed \nconstituency with legitimate grievances against the West, so much so \nthat when millions of Iranians took to the streets against the mullahs, \nPresident Obama did nothing and said nothing--strengthening the hand of \nthe clerics. When the Egyptian generals overthrew the Muslim \nBrotherhood, who were waging war against Coptic Christians and openly \nspoke of renewing the fight against Israel--the State Department \ncondemned them as ``undemocratic.'' The old American alliances are \ncollapsing in confusion and fear and the only answer from the \nadministration seems to be to clear Iran's path toward a nuclear \nweapon.\n  The greatest concession in the current negotiations has been the \nabandonment of the original U.S. position of preventing Iran from \nhaving a nuclear-weapons capability. This was the stance of the Bush \nadministration. It was also the position of the Obama administration \nuntil November 2013. This is a disaster. Here is what we know as \nacknowledged by the Obama administration negotiators including the \nSecretaries of State and Energy:\n  There will be no limits on Iran's ballistic-missile force, the means \nfor delivering its nuclear weapons. The U.S. position of seeking limits \non the missile force was abandoned when the Supreme Leader objected and \nObama conceded.\n  There will be no resolution of Iran's weaponization activities. Iran \nwill promise once again to cooperate with the IAEA, but no one expects \nanything other than more Iranian obstacles. A resolution of \nweaponization activities was also a precondition for an agreement.\n  Inspections will be based on managed access but only on Iran's terms. \nAt one point, the U.S. insisted that effective verification required \nfull access to facilities and people. Under the Obama plan there will \nbe no inspections of military sites much less suspected covert \nfacilities such as the Lavizan-3 site or the Fordow weapons complex \nburied deep in the Iranian mountains.\n  Obama will allow the Arak heavy-water reactor to be modified but not \nin any way that prevents Iran from using it to produce plutonium for \nweapons. Again, the initial Obama position was that the reactor must be \ndismantled.\n  The economic sanctions, particularly the banking freeze that wrecked \nthe Iranian economy will be lifted. In fact, Tehran has already \nreceived billions of dollars just for continuing the negotiations. It \nhas already freed the Russians to sell the advanced S-300 air defense \nsystem. As agitation against the mullahs was growing we have given them \na lifeline. Squeezing Iran economically, aided by the fall in worldwide \noil prices, was the surest way to force concessions. Once the sanctions \nare lifted it will be nearly impossible to go back.\n  The restrictions on Iran's nuclear program will reportedly be phased \nout after 10 years, a period shorter than the time it has taken to \nnegotiate the agreement. The original U.S. position was that \nrestrictions would be permanent. As Henry Kissinger said, far from \nenabling the President's goal of disengaging from the Middle East, the \nframework will necessitate a deepening involvement in the region under \na complex ``new order'' dictated by a nuclear Iran.\n  Iran will be allowed to operate thousands of centrifuges to enrich \nuranium and to pursue research and development of more advanced \nsystems. The original U.S. position--backed by multiple U.N. Security \nCouncil resolutions demanding complete suspension of all enrichment \nactivities--was zero enrichment and zero centrifuges. Under President \nObama, zero was abandoned as unrealistic, and the number of permitted \ncentrifuges moved up, according to the Secretary of Energy from 1,000 \nto 4,000 to 6,000. Iran has rejected each offer as insufficient, only \nto be rewarded with a better one. That is how the administration \nnegotiates--from behind.\n  In his 1987 State of the Union Address, Ronald Regan warned us:\n\n       Our approach is not to seek agreement for agreement's sake \n     but to settle only for agreements that truly enhance our \n     national security and that of our allies. We will never put \n     our security at risk or that of our allies just to reach an \n     agreement . . . No agreement is better than a bad agreement.\n\n  There you have it. Our allies--Israel, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States, \nJordan, and Egypt--are worried. Tehran is on the march and moving \ncloser to nuclear status. As Charles Krauthammer noted, ``the one great \nhope for Middle East peace, the strategic anchor for forty years'', is \ngiving the green light to both. That is not a legacy of which to be \nproud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/07/senate-section/article/S2728-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2728-S2729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             RECOGNIZING THE NEVADA APPEAL'S 150TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today, I wish to recognize the \n150th birthday of the Silver State's oldest daily newspaper, the Nevada \nAppeal. I am proud to honor this publication that brings high-quality \nnews to Nevada's capital.\n  Growing up in Carson City, this newspaper has played a role in my \nlife since I was a young boy. Each morning, two of my brothers would \ndeliver the Nevada Appeal to the local community. Of course, I was \ntheir No. 1 substitute\n\n[[Page S2729]]\n\nwhenever they were unable to go. During this time, the paper was \nlocated at the Brewery Art Center. We went there each morning to fold \nthe papers and take off to deliver them. These are memories I will \nnever forget. It gives me great pleasure to see this publication \ncelebrate 150 years, making it the longest continuously operating \nbusiness in Carson City.\n  The Nevada Appeal, originally called the Carson Daily Appeal, was \nfounded on May 16, 1865, by local businessmen E.F. McElwin, J. Barrett, \nand Marshall Robinson. Original editor Harry Mighels joined the team \nonly a few days later. Over the next 100 years, the Nevada Appeal would \nsee about 30 competitors. By 1868, Mighels had bought a few of the \nother local publications, and in 1870, he sold to C.L. Perkins and H.S. \nStreet. In February of 1872, John Boothe, a newsman of Gold Hill, \nVirginia City, and Unionville, bought the paper. Following this in \nSeptember of 1872, Mighels re-bought the newspaper and kept it in the \nfamily until 1945, when it was bought by W.L. Davis. In 1947, the paper \nwas sold to Arthur Suverkrup, who changed the name to Nevada Appeal. \nDonrey Media bought out the paper in 1951 and then sold it to an \ninvestor group in 1993. Finally, in 1995, the Nevada Appeal was sold to \nSwift Communications, which remains the owner today.\n  The newspaper is delivered 6 days a week, Tuesday through Sunday, in \nthe mornings and has a daily readership of over 25,000, including \n35,000 on Sundays. It has been recognized by the Nevada Press \nAssociation, Associated Press, and Swift Communications, receiving \nnumerous awards. The accolades are well deserved, recognizing the hard \nwork of the staff and quality of the writing.\n  Throughout its 150 years, the Nevada Appeal has demonstrated \nprofessionalism, commitment to excellence, and dedication to the \nhighest standards of journalism. I am both humbled and honored to call \nthis publication a historic piece of Nevada. Today, I ask my colleagues \nto join me in honoring the Nevada Appeal on its 150th birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/07/senate-section/article/S2729-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONGRATULATING FAVIL WEST\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Favil \nWest, cofounder and president of the Foundation Assisting Seniors, on \nreceiving Nevada Senior Citizen of the Year for 2015. It gives me great \npleasure to recognize his years of hard work and dedication to Southern \nNevada's senior community.\n  Mr. West started the nonprofit organization in 2002, seeking to \nimprove the quality of life for seniors. The foundation assists with \nchallenges during times of illness, recovery, confinement at home, and \ncoping with loss of a loved one, as well as provides assistance with \neveryday tasks such as household maintenance and transportation. Mr. \nWest leads the board of trustees and also works with the foundation \ncommittees to ensure all seniors are being served effectively and \nefficiently. The individual committees provide transportation to drive \nseniors to health service appointments and to the grocery store, \nprovide minor home maintenance services, deliver an inventory of \ndurable medical equipment, and maintain a resource directory with \ninformation on free services. Each year, the foundation responds to \nthousands of requests to care for senior citizens in Southern Nevada. \nMr. West's work in the local community is invaluable.\n  He has contributed greatly to growing the foundation, which now \nserves multiple communities throughout Southern Nevada. He spearheaded \na new program, the HowRU Program, which is designed to minimize risks \nof seniors living alone by maintaining contact with clients. \nSubscribers are contacted daily to eliminate unreported injuries in the \nsenior community. He has also improved outreach to garner more \nvolunteers and community support to aid in transportation, equipment, \nand home maintenance needs.\n  Mr. West received the ``Premier Community Award for Making a \nDifference in Their Neighborhood'' from the city of Henderson in \nDecember of 2014. He also received 8 News Now Acts of Kindness \nrecognition in October 2014 and FOX 5 News Shining Star recognition in \n2013.\n  It is not only Mr. West's work in the senior community that deserves \nrecognition, but also his service to our great Nation as a Vietnam-era \ncombat veteran. I extend my deepest gratitude to Mr. West for his \ncourageous contributions to the United States of America. His service \nto his country and his bravery earn him a place among the outstanding \nmen and women who have valiantly defended our Nation.\n  I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in recognizing Favil \nWest, whose work is both noble and charitable. I am humbled and honored \nto recognize Mr. West for his tireless efforts in helping our senior \ncommunity, and I wish him the best of luck in all of his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/07/senate-section/article/S2729-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING CROWNS 4 KIDS\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, many of our Nation's successful \nsmall businesses started as an idea that took root from big dreams and \neven bigger imaginations. This week's Small Business of the Week, \nCrowns 4 Kids of Madisonville, LA, is an excellent example of how our \nnext generation of Louisianians are dreaming big and influencing the \nworld around them.\n  Earlier this year when Harlan Jackson Adams began painting acrylic \npictures of crowns for his mother, Erica Adams, he had no idea how far \nhis fun, quirky canvases would go. Word quickly spread across his \nmother's social media accounts that her talented son had found a new \nhobby. Friends and family began requesting crown paintings of their \nown, and within 2 weeks, young Harlan had over 200 orders to fill.\n  Demand for Adam's simple, elegant crowns grew so much among friends \nand family that the young entrepreneur decided to share his success \nwith kids in need. Erica was astonished when her 7-year-old proclaimed \nthat he wanted to donate his profits to the cancer center at Children's \nHospital New Orleans. Unaware that Harlan knew about or understood what \ncancer is, Erica was overwhelmingly proud of her son's humility and \ngenerosity when he explained that two kids he knew were battling cancer \nand he wanted to help. Harlan is now an honorary member of the \nDistributive Education Clubs of America, a youth entrepreneurship \norganization, and plans to continue his charitable work.\n  When our young folks take the initiative to help others in the \ncapacity that young Harlan has, we owe them our utmost respect and \nrecognition. It is my great honor to recognize Harlan Jackson Adams and \nCrowns 4 Kids as Small Business of the Week. Thank you for inspiring \nboth kids and adults to dream big and give generously.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/07/senate-section/article/S2729-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/07/senate-section/article/S2729-4", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/07/senate-section/article/S2729-5", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following concurrent resolution was read, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S.

HITE\n\n  Mr. COTTON. Fellow Members, today I recognize a distinguished \nAmerican hero, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Hite of Camden, AK, who died \nlast month at the age of 95.\n  Just months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, on December 7, 1941, a \ngroup of courageous young pilots flew Army Air Forces bombers off the \ndeck of the USS Hornet in the Pacific Ocean to carry out a dangerous, \nlow-altitude bombing attack on Japan's home islands. The Doolittle Raid \nprovided an enormous morale boost for Americans with a crushing blow to \nthe imperial regime in Tokyo.\n  Among these brave men was an Arkansan, Colonel Robert L. Hite. \nColonel Hite had enlisted as an aviation cadet on September 9, 1940. He \nwas later commissioned as a second lieutenant and rated as a pilot on \nMay 29, 1941. Almost bumped from the mission because of space \nlimitations, Colonel Hite was assigned as a copilot ultimately to the \nB-25 ``Bat Out of Hell.'' He rejected his fellow airmen's attempts to \nbuy his spot on the plane and launched his mission on April 19, 1942.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Hite's aircraft successfully carried out a low-\nlevel bombing run on an aircraft factory and fuel depot in Nagoya, \nJapan, but inclement weather forced the crew to bail out over Japanese-\ncontrolled territory as their plane ran low on fuel. Lieutenant Colonel \nHite landed in a Japanese rice paddy field, where he was captured and \nsentenced to execution.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Hite served 40 months in a Japanese prison--38 of \nthem in solitary confinement--where he was tortured and endured brutal \nconditions. Following V-J Day, Lieutenant Colonel Hite was freed on \nAugust 20, 1945. He returned home and married his first wife Portia 1 \nyear later.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Hite later returned to active service, training \npilots overseas during the Korean war from 1951 to 1955. After leaving \nActive Duty, he and Portia moved home to Camden, AR, where he managed \nthe Camden Hotel until 1965.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Hite was widowed in 1999 and later married his \nlate wife, Dorothy.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Hite is survived by two children, five \ngrandchildren, seven great-grandchildren, and two great-great-\ngrandchildren.\n  On April 18, just 2 weeks after his death, and the 73rd anniversary \nof the Doolittle Raid, Lieutenant Colonel Hite and his fellow soldiers \nwere posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal of Honor.\n  Arkansans young and old and all Americans can appreciate Lieutenant \nColonel Hite's service to his family, his community, and his Nation--a \nfine example for us all to emulate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I see my colleague, the Senator from Delaware. I know \nhe asked for time. I didn't ask for time set aside for myself.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank my colleague for his graciousness. I told him I \nwould speak for 10 minutes. It is usually about 10 hours, but I only \nhave 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I rise today on the Senate floor to recognize the \nefforts of many of our Nation's public servants. Since 1985, the very \nfirst week of May has been dedicated to highlighting the millions of \nhard-working Americans who serve our Nation as Federal employees, State \nemployees, county and local government employees, and members of the \nuniformed services, which I have been privileged to be one for some 23 \nyears.\n  This week marks the 30th annual Public Service Recognition Week and \nserves as an important opportunity for those here in the Senate to show \nour appreciation for their dedication and service to our community and \nto our Nation.\n  Throughout my time in public office, including during my time on the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which I have been \na member of now for about 14 years and which I chaired for the last 2 \nyears, I have had the great pleasure of meeting with any number of \ndedicated and accomplished public servants. In talking with them, I \nhave been able to learn more about their work, more about their \nfamilies, learn more about their commitment to public service that they \nshare with all of us.\n  Today, I would like to take a couple minutes to highlight the \noutstanding service of some of our public servants across our Federal \nGovernment. In these cases, their extraordinary service has directly \nimpacted the lives of the\n\n[[Page S2735]]\n\nAmericans they serve. In fact, the two individuals I plan to highlight \ntoday are finalists for something called the Samuel J. Heyman Service \nto America Medals that are awarded by the Partnership for Public \nService each year.\n  As you may know, on October 29, 2012--at least we know in Delaware, \nNew Jersey, and New York--Superstorm Sandy made landfall in the United \nStates. Its impact up and down the east coast was, in a word, \ndevastating. In another word, it was heartbreaking. New York, New \nJersey, and parts of New England were hit particularly hard. My home \nState of Delaware was hit hard, too. Widespread flooding caused severe \ndamage to many homes and businesses. Our transportation infrastructure \nsuffered, too. Roads and bridges were damaged or washed out, hurting \ncommerce and transportation and cutting off access to hospitals, \nschools, and work.\n  What we learned through the difficult recovery that followed is that \nsound and effective mitigation policies should be thoroughly calculated \ninto any recovery effort. Through mitigation, we can get better \nresults, save money, and save lives.\n  Following Superstorm Sandy, Congress passed an almost $11 billion \nspecial transportation appropriations bill. A large portion of that \nfunding--roughly one-third of it, $3.6 billion--was to be used for \nsomething called resilience grants dedicated to protecting the \ninfrastructure repaired after Sandy.\n  A fellow named Adam Schildge--Adam Schildge--senior program analyst \nat the Federal Transit Administration in Washington, DC, was a key \nplayer in developing, implementing, and managing a competitive grant \nprogram to distribute those $3.6 billion in resilience funds. Those \ngrants, once awarded, supported construction projects that will reduce \nthe cost to taxpayers in cleaning up after future storms. They will \nalso reduce the number of lives and properties lost from powerful \nnatural disasters.\n  As you can imagine, the task assigned to him--here is Adam right \nhere, Adam Schildge--the task assigned to Adam was not an easy one. His \nmission was critical. His mission, basically, was to identify projects \nthat, if funded, would get better results, save money, and save lives. \nIn order to determine what projects should receive funding, Adam \nmeticulously combed through grant application after grant application \nto assess the resilience of planned infrastructure projects.\n  When I think of ``resilience,'' I think about how we save money in \nthe future in the event that we have a storm of that nature again. And, \nbelieve me, we will. Because of Adam's painstaking attention to detail, \neye for innovation, and his dedication to the lives at stake during \nfuture storms, Adam was able to grant funding to transportation \nprojects that will serve all Americans for generations to come and to \nendure the forces of extreme weather.\n  According to Adam, he took the position in public service because it \nwas--these are his words--``the greatest opportunity to impact \ncommunities.'' He went on to say: ``I've always known I wanted to work \nfor the public good and I've found a good way now to give back to \ncommunities across the country.'' Those are his words.\n  Our Nation's public servants are making a difference across the globe \ntoo.\n  As the Presiding Officer may remember, less than a year ago, a deadly \nepidemic of the Ebola virus gripped Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, and \nMali. The severity and scale of the outbreak was an unprecedented \nchallenge to the worldwide public health community. The rapid spread of \nthe outbreak reminded us that deadly and infectious diseases know no \nborders.\n  It also sent us an important reminder to remember the parable of the \nGood Samaritan, that we should love our neighbors as ourselves. Jeff, \nmy friend, Senator Sessions over here, knows the Bible pretty well. He \nrecalls in the New Testament where some of the pharisees are trying to \ntrick Jesus. They asked him a question. They said: What is the greatest \ncommandment of all?\n  Jesus responded: It is not just one; there are two. The first is to \nlove the Lord thy God with all our heart, all our soul, all our mind. \nAnd then he said: The second great commandment is to love thy neighbor \nas thyself.\n  The pharisees said: Well, who is our neighbor? He told them the \nparable of the Good Samaritan. That is where we come up with that. But \nin the spirit of the Good Samaritan--and the story goes back a couple \nof thousand years--thousands of public servants were dispatched to \nbattle Ebola at its epicenter, on the ground in Africa.\n  A woman named Mia Beers--there she is. Mia Beers was one of those \ncourageous public servants. As the Director of the Humanitarian Policy \nand Global Engagement Division at the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment, Mia led the U.S. Ebola Disaster Assistance Response Team \ninto the epicenter of the epidemic in Monrovia, Liberia.\n  On the ground, Mia synchronized the efforts of thousands of public \nhealth and emergency response workers across five different Federal \nagencies. Under her leadership, the response team offered training \nsupport and contact tracing to better protect health workers in close \ncontact with this deadly disease.\n  She also worked closely with the State Department to strategize \nresponse efforts in real time, including ways to inform vulnerable \npopulations about the disease as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n  According to Mia's colleagues, her robust leadership and coordination \nhelped to steer the worldwide response out of the crisis mode and to \nstem the tide of the deadly global outbreak. According to Mia, it was \nall because of--these are her words--``the dedication and passion and \nknowledge'' of the people who she worked with.\n  Not long ago I was with Department of Homeland Security Deputy \nSecretary Alejandro Mayorkas, meeting with some Department of Homeland \nSecurity employees at a roundtable. The roundtable was focused on \nemployees and improving the employee morale. During that meeting, he \nreiterated the profound impact that each employee has on his or her \nagency and the mission. All told--Ali Mayorkas told the story of an \nemployee at NASA headquarters who was working late one night into the \nmorning hours. The employee finally gathered himself to leave, and he \ncame across a custodian mopping the floors. He asked the employee: What \ndo you do?\n  The custodian who was mopping the floors replied: I am putting a man \non the moon.\n  Think about that. I am putting a man on the moon. Every day that \ncustodian went to work thinking he was part of an important mission. \nThe same is true for employees across the Federal Government in its \nvarious agencies. These dedicated and hardworking public servants are \njust two among the hundreds of thousands who are making a difference in \nthe lives of their fellow Americans every day.\n  I want to encourage us all to visit a Web site that is called the \nPartnership for Public Service to learn more stories about some \noutstanding public servants and public employees. Today and every day, \nI want to thank these employees--we ought to thank these employees--for \ntheir service, their humble service, their selfless service to our \nNation. I hope they all know how important their work is--everything \nyou do in this work across our country and around the world and that \nyou know what brings joy to you.\n  Let me close with this, if I could. I say through the Presiding \nOfficer to my friend Senator Sessions: I was reading earlier this week \nin the newsclips that come to me from my staff--I was reading the \nresults of an interview, I think, from interviews with maybe 1,500 very \nsenior-level Federal employees. They were basically being asked: How do \nyou like your job? A lot of them, frankly, reported they did not have \nthe sense of satisfaction that they really had hoped for and expected \nthey would have.\n  They were asked: If something could change that would make you feel \nbetter about the work you do and people's appreciation of the work you \ndo, what would help the most?\n  The first question they asked them was this: How about more pay? How \nabout more of this or more of that? Believe it or not, what most of \nthem said they would like to have more of was just to be thanked. For \nsomebody to say: The work that you do is important. We are grateful as \na nation that you do this.\n\n[[Page S2736]]\n\n  That is something all of us can do. I had a conversation here on the \nfloor, I say to Senator Sessions, with Jim Inhofe, our colleague from \nOklahoma. He talked about the TSA employees. When he flies home, back \nto Oklahoma, and flies out of here, either through Reagan--probably \nReagan and on to Dallas and to Tulsa. He has gotten to know the TSA \nemployees there. I think he makes a habit of thanking them for the work \nthey do for all of us.\n  I try to do the same sort of thing when I travel around the country. \nI bump into Coast Guard folks or other people, especially those who are \nassociated with the Department of Homeland Security. It is an easy \nthing to do, just say thank you for the work they do on behalf of all \nof us--especially if we tell them who we are. They will appreciate it, \nand it will make a difference in their lives, and maybe even a \ndifference in their performance going forward. Thank you so much. God \nbless.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we have a lot of good people in the \nSenate, and Senator Carper is one of the best. He does, indeed, live by \nthe Golden Rule, and it is an inspiration to us--as I have told him \nmore than once--when we have had hot debate in the Senate. He always \nkeeps his good nature, his loving spirit, and always sets a good \nexample.\n  I say thank you to Senator Carper. It is appropriate to thank Federal \nemployees for their work. Not counting the Army Reserve time, I have \nquite a few years myself in Federal service and love the people I have \nhad the honor to work with.\n  I ask that I be allowed to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/07/senate-section/article/S2736-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2736-S2739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we will be dealing soon--I guess next \nweek--with trade promotion authority and the Trans-Pacific Partnership \ntrade agreement, the TPP. Conventional wisdom is that trade agreements \nare good. We should just move them forward. Let's have an expedited \nfast-track process--a fast-track agreement with the TPA--and we will \nget this done and it is going to work out well for the American people.\n  But in truth, I have to say, since I voted for every trade agreement, \none virtually every year since I have been here--except one--the data \ndoesn't give us much confidence that a loosely drawn or improperly \ndrawn agreement is going to help us. In fact, evidence indicates it is \nnot helping us. It is not helping the economy of the United States. It \nis not helping growth. Some of these agreements have clearly \nexacerbated our trade deficit.\n  So it is a remarkable thing, and we want to believe in trade, and I \ndo, but the United States has interests, our trading partners have \ninterests, and our trading partners are far more mercantile, far more \nfocused on increasing exports to foreign countries--to the biggest \nmarket in the world, the United States--and far more focused on \nblocking imports that would compete against locally manufactured \nproducts than the United States has been producing.\n  Some say: Well, that is not a problem. The United States is smarter \nin the long run. But I would say I am looking at this more carefully \nnow.\n  I voted for the Korea agreement. Our Korean allies are good people. \nIt is a great country. They achieved so much after the Korean war, and \nwe are proud of them. We have many positive relationships and a \nfabulous Hyundai plant in my State. It hires thousands, and they have \nsuppliers that add thousands of jobs also.\n  What about that agreement? I supported it. I thought it was a good \nagreement. It passed here by a substantial vote. But when you look at \nit, it didn't work out as well as people said.\n  The U.S. Federal Trade Commission--our own trade commission--\nestimated that the reduction of Korean tariffs against our exports to \nKorea and tariff rate quotas on goods alone would have added at least \n$10 billion to annual exports to Korea. That is $10 billion. Well, last \nyear, three years after the agreement was passed, we didn't export $10 \nbillion; we exported less than $1 billion to Korea--$0.8 billion. So \nthat is a very huge difference, while at the same time Korea's imports \nto the United States have surged and the trade deficit the United \nStates had with Korea, which was already large, has almost doubled in \nthat time.\n  So I appreciate the complexity of the issue and want to talk about \nit.\n  As we wrestle with how we continue with this situation with the TPP, \ntrade promotion authority, I ask my colleagues about some of the \nquestions we ought to consider. I know there is a goal to move this \nthing forward fast rather than slow. The faster we get it done, the \nfewer questions that get asked, and we have fewer problems. But that is \nnot our problem. That is not our duty.\n  I wrote President Obama a letter yesterday. I made some comments and \nasked some questions that I believe are reasonable and fair questions \nto ask before we vote on this agreement that he has been negotiating \nbut that, of course, hasn't completed the negotiations on. And, to the \nextent to which it has been reduced to writing, which is only partial, \nit is locked up in secret, and we are able to view it only privately. \nWe are not allowed to quote it or copy it to let the public know what \nis in it.\n  I asked him:\n\n       You have asked Congress to approve fast-track legislation \n     (Trade Promotion Authority) that would allow international \n     trade and regulatory agreements to be expedited through \n     Congress for the next six years without amendment. Fast-\n     track, which proponents hope to adopt within days, would also \n     ensure that these agreements--none of which of have yet been \n     made public--could pass with a simple majority vote, rather \n     than the 67 votes applied to treaties or the 60 votes applied \n     to important legislative matters.\n       This is one of the largest international compacts in the \n     history of the United States. [It amounts to 40 percent of \n     global GDP.] Yet, this agreement will be kept a closely-\n     guarded secret until after Congress agrees to yield its \n     institutional powers and provide the administration with a \n     guaranteed ``fast-track'' to adoption.\n\n  In other words, we are going to agree in advance, before we see the \ncompleted deal, before it is made public, to allow this agreement to \npass into effect without the ability to have any amendment to it or to \nfully understand it.\n  I think that is a big ask of Congress. It has always been problematic \nto use this fast-track procedure. I have voted for trade agreements \nwhich were fast-tracked, I acknowledge, in the past, and maybe they \nhave helped us some.\n  But I do believe it is time for us to be a lot more careful today \nwith the trade agreements that we sign and ask a lot more rigorously \nwhat impact it will have on working Americans, not just some capital \ngroup in the canyons of Wall Street.\n  So I continued to write:\n\n       The U.S. ran a record $51.4 billion trade deficit in March.\n\n  That is a record first quarter, I believe. It was a six-year record \nthis year for the trade deficit. That means the amount we export is \nvastly exceeded by the amount we import--$51.4 billion.\n  Economists tell us--and I don't think there is any dispute--that when \nyou are evaluating trade growth you have to subtract trade deficits \nsince they are a negative to growth. So our trade deficits are pulling \ndown growth in America. They are pulling down job creation. They are \npulling down wage growth. They are pulling down our economy.\n  I continue to quote:\n\n       This is especially concerning since, in 2011, assurances \n     were made from the Administration that the recent South Korea \n     free trade deal would ``increase exports of American goods by \n     $10 billion to $11 billion.'' But, in fact, American domestic \n     exports to Korea increased by only $0.8 billion, an increase \n     of 1.8 percent, while imports from Korea increased $12.6 \n     billion, an increase of 22.5 percent.\n\n  So, in other words, imports from Korea to the United States increased \n$12.6 billion. Our exports to them increased less than $1 billion.\n  Continuing:\n\n       Our trade deficit with Korea increased $11.8 billion \n     between 2011 and 2014, an increase of 80.4 percent, nearly \n     doubling in the three years since the deal was ratified.\n\n  And we were promised the other. We were promised it would enhance, \ndramatically, exports. I continue:\n\n       Overall, we have already lost more than 2.1 million \n     manufacturing jobs to the Asian Pacific region since 2001.\n\n  Look, we know there are wage advantages in Asia, but wages are going \nup\n\n[[Page S2737]]\n\nin a lot of Asian countries too. It is getting closer, and we have an \nadvantage on better management. We have advantages on better \ninfrastructure, and we have advantages on better energy prices. So this \nis a huge loss to us. At some point we have to defend our American \nworking people's interest.\n  I write:\n\n       Former Nucor Steel Chairman Daniel DiMicco argues that we \n     have not been engaged in free trade but in ``unilateral trade \n     disarmament and enablement of foreign mercantilism.''\n\n  In other words, our agreements with trade have not overcome our \ntrading competitors, our trading partners' desire to maximize their \nexports and minimize their imports from us. We have to be honest about \nthat; it is not theory. Simply eliminating tariffs does not solve the \nproblem. History tells us that.\n  So I continue to President Obama:\n\n       Due to the enormity of what is at stake, I believe it is \n     essential Congress have answers to the following questions \n     before any vote is scheduled on ``fast-track'' authority.\n       1. Regarding the ``Living Agreement\": There is a ``living \n     agreement'' provision in TPP that allows the agreement to be \n     changed after adoption--in effect, vesting TPP countries with \n     a sweeping new form of global governance authority. TPP calls \n     this new global authority the ``Trans-Pacific Partnership \n     Commission.'' These measures are unprecedented.\n\n  We have not had anything like a living agreement in a trade agreement \nbefore.\n  Continuing:\n\n       While I and other lawmakers have been able to view this \n     provision in secret [the chamber downstairs], I believe it \n     must be made public before any vote is scheduled on TPA, due \n     to the extraordinary implications.\n\n  I think it ought to be reviewed by independent scholars, lawyers, \ntrade experts, to help us decide just what we are doing when we allow, \napparently, the members who signed this agreement to meet at any point \nin time to adjust the meaning of the agreement and the provisions of \nthe deal in order to adjust to changing circumstances. It is kind of \nlike what the Supreme Court has been doing to our Constitution.\n\n       2. Regarding trade deficits--\n\n  I asked this question, colleagues. Isn't it a fair question to ask, \nwhen we are asked to vote for this fast track--\n\n       Will TPP increase or reduce our cumulative trade deficit \n     with TPP countries overall, and with Japan and Vietnam \n     specifically?\n\n  I want to know that. Don't you want to know whether or not we are \ngoing to increase our deficit in trade with these member countries, in \nparticular Japan and Vietnam, where we can expect real problems in the \nfuture, it seems to me?\n  By the way, by far the biggest trade partner in our economy is the \nJapanese economy, in this agreement. Vietnam, with 100 million people, \nhas the potential to become a small China, as one expert said, and \nreally be, very much, a competitor to the textile industry, hurting--\nmost of all, one expert has said--Central American countries, such as \nHonduras, El Salvador. Those countries that have been developing a \ntextile industry may find themselves undercut by Vietnam under this \nagreement.\n\n       3. Regarding jobs and wages: Will TPP increase or reduce \n     the total number of manufacturing jobs in the United States \n     generally, and American auto-manufacturing jobs specifically, \n     accounting for jobs lost to increased imports? Will average \n     hourly wages for U.S. workers, including in the automobile \n     industry, go up or down and by how much?\n\n  Let's have a report on that. Shouldn't we know that?\n\n       4. Regarding China: Can TPP member countries add new \n     countries, including China, to the agreement without future \n     Congressional approval?\n\n  Some say it can't be done. Let's have a clear answer to that. At \nfirst glance, it would appear that is possible.\n\n       5. Regarding foreign workers, TPA is a 6-year authority to \n     the President of the United States to negotiate trade deals. \n     He can submit them to the Congress, and these agreements can \n     be passed without amendment in a simple majority vote. So \n     this is a 6-year authority which concludes into the future. \n     We have had President Clinton, President Bush, President \n     whoever--Rubio, Cruz or whoever could be our President. So it \n     would have that authority.\n\n  Finally, I asked whether the administration can state unconditionally \nthat no agreement or Executive action, throughout the lifetime of TPA, \nwill alter the number, duration, availability, expiration enforcement, \nrules or processing time of guest worker, business, visitor, \nnonimmigrant or immigrant visas to the United States.\n  I think those are fair questions. I think we need to have answers to \nthose before we vote on TPA, but I can tell you what the American \npeople think. There have been some studies that say large numbers of \npeople tend to be right when they express an opinion on things.\n  This is Mr. Frank Luntz--I believe it is his poll. He asked this \nquestion on international trade. ``Do free trade agreements the United \nStates has signed with other countries over the past 2 decades benefit \nother countries or the United States?''\n  That is a simple question. He asked the American people: What do you \nthink? Do these agreements we have passed over the last 20 years--and I \nvoted for a lot of them in the last 18 years I have been here--are they \nbenefiting other countries or the United States? This is what the \nAmerican people say: Seventy percent say it benefits other countries. \nOnly 30 percent say it benefits the United States.\n  I think people are deeply skeptical about what we have been doing \nregarding trade, and it is easy to dismiss their concerns and their \nskepticism, to say they are just not knowledgeable and we know more and \nthat this movement of capital from New York, to Beijing, to Seoul, to \nJapan, to Chile is just fine and wonderful and it is going to make your \nlife better. But the American people are not seeing that.\n  Another poll asked the question: What about the effect of the free-\ntrade agreements on wages the American people make.\n  This is the question:\n\n       Free trade agreements are treaties between countries \n     reducing trade barriers, such as reducing tariffs for \n     imported goods, agreeing to common standards and allowing \n     market access to foreign companies. Do you think the United \n     States making free trade agreements with other countries \n     increases or decreases the level of wages paid in the United \n     States or makes no difference?\n\n  They asked this of the American people. This is a YouGov poll.\n  Answer: Increases the level of wages paid in the United States--11 \npercent.\n  Now, we are told repeatedly: Oh, we need to sign these trade \nagreements. It is going to make your wages go up. It is going to be \ngood for everybody. Don't we hear that? And I have hoped that would be \ntrue, but only 11 percent of the American people think trade agreements \nhave moved their wages up.\n  What about the answer to the other part of that question. Decreases \nthe wages paid in the United States--34 percent.\n  So by more than a 3-to-1 majority the American people believe that \ntrade agreements over the last 20 years are decreasing the level of \nwages in the United States rather than increasing them. Nineteen \npercent say it makes no difference and one-third say they do not know.\n  We have to consider, colleagues, what is it that is happening. How is \nit this might be happening? Because, in theory, comparative advantage \ndoctrine means that multiple countries can benefit from trade \nagreements. I acknowledge that theory and believe it is fundamentally \nvalid, but let's take a tremendous trading partner such as Japan. We \nhave a tremendous trading relationship, where billions of dollars are \nexchanging hands between our countries every year, and that will be \ncovered by this trade agreement--Japan. So what do we find? We find \nthat we have a 2.5-percent tariff on imported Japanese automobiles to \nthe United States and a 25-percent tariff on the import of light trucks \ninto the United States from Japan.\n  I didn't know the numbers were that high, but it is as a result of \nvarious events that occurred over time where retaliation took place.\n  What about Japanese tariffs on automobiles going to Japan. There are \nnone. Japan does not have tariffs on automobiles going into Japan. Yet \nwe have a huge trade deficit with Japan. Why is this happening? It is \nbecause of nontariff trade barriers, institutional matters, and the \nlike.\n  One of the biggest is that it is very difficult in Japan to get an \nautomobile dealership up and operating effectively. Hyundai has tried \nto do it and failed. You can't get a distribution network for vehicles. \nMaybe there is a cultural loyalty in Japan that makes people far\n\n[[Page S2738]]\n\nmore likely to buy a Japanese automobile than a foreign automobile. \nThere are other factors.\n  So the TPP, as written, will do nothing that advances the export of \nU.S. automobiles to Japan because those exports into Japan have been \nreduced substantially through nontariff barriers. Got it? Those \nnontariff barriers are not fixed in this agreement, but we are going to \nbe reducing ours.\n  One expert who negotiated with Japan for President Ronald Reagan, \nClyde Prestowitz, who opposes this agreement and who has written a book \non trade, says there is no doubt we are going to have an increase in \nour trade deficit with Japan.\n  Now, look, I don't have a hard feeling about Japan. In fact, they are \nfabulous allies. They are putting up money to help in mutual defense. \nWe have Honda and Toyota automobile companies in my home State of \nAlabama, and I am proud of what they do. But we are not going to see an \nincrease in exports to Japan unless some things are changed other than \nthe tariff, and, in fact, they are not changing the tariff because it \nis already at zero.\n  Well, maybe that is why the theories don't always work as well as \nthey are projected to work.\n  Mr. Dan Dimicco, whom I mentioned earlier, an outspoken commentator \non the issues relating to trade--lived with it and is the chairman \nemeritus of Nucor Steel today--wrote a very valuable piece in Forbes \nmagazine back in December in which he discussed the trade deals and \nproblems that occurred. He goes through virtually every issue that is \nraised in these discussions and presents a contrary view to \nconventional wisdom.\n\n  I really think we have to listen to some of this. We can't just \nblithely go by and pretend that the American people, by more than a 2-\nto-1 margin, are all wrong about salaries and wages when, in fact, I \nthink the record will show that wages have dropped as these trading \nagreements have increased. From 2009 until today, we have had a net \ndecline of family income of $3,000 in the United States. Wages are down \nsince the 1970s. The percentage of Americans actually with a job who \nare in the working years is the lowest we have had since the 1970s. \nWages have declined basically since the year 2000. We have had \nvirtually no increase in wages since that time.\n  So what is it that is happening that is allowing the stock market to \ngo up and business profits to go up but wages are not? We have had a \ndecline in manufacturing. The numbers are unmistakable, and a large \npart of this is foreign competition.\n  Colleagues, the time has come when we should enter into no trade \nagreement--not one--in which we lose a single job in this country as a \nresult of unfair competition.\n  Mr. DiMicco goes on at length. I ask unanimous consent to have his \narticle printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      [From Forbes, Dec. 16, 2014]\n\n  `Fast Track' To Nowhere: Congress Shouldn't Give Obama Power To Ram \n                              Through TPP\n\n                          (By Daniel DiMicco)\n\n       If the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade and global \n     governance agreement has any chance at passage, it will \n     require the usual alliance of Wall Street Democrats and Wall \n     Street Republicans. Disgruntled citizens voted to ``throw the \n     bums out'' because they were not delivering jobs and \n     prosperity. Yet there is a danger that President Obama and \n     the Republican leadership did not get the message.\n       The Obama administration may soon be enabled by some in the \n     GOP to pass the globalists' biggest wish: ``fast-track'' \n     trade authority on the road to the massively misguided Trans-\n     Pacific Partnership.\n       It has made for titillating journalism to speculate on how \n     these strange bedfellows will overcome opposition from blue \n     collar Republicans and Democrats, and the fractiousness of \n     the current Congress, to collaborate on further gutting \n     America's productive supply chains through unilateral trade \n     disarmament and enablement of foreign mercantilism. The \n     kumbaya trade agreement cheerleader crowd has convinced \n     itself that 40 years of trade deficits don't matter, even as \n     the shrinkage of GDP growth has rendered the U.S. a dwindling \n     superpower teetering on the brink of second class economy \n     status.\n\n\n                         Misunderstanding Trade\n\n       The left-right Wall Street alliance of TPP cheerleaders \n     relies upon a fundamental misunderstanding of trade, its role \n     in the world and its role in economic growth. National income \n     accounting makes it clear that gross domestic product is the \n     sum of four factors: consumption, investment, government \n     procurement and net trade (exports minus imports).\n       That's net trade--not gross trade. In other words, net \n     exports increase our economic size while net imports shrink \n     it. This is not a liberal plot, or a Tea Party plot, or a \n     protectionist plot. It is basic and uncontroversial economic \n     math that the TPP cheerleaders either don't understand or \n     don't want to.\n       In 2013, the U.S. economy amounted to $16.8 trillion. \n     Consumption was about 68% of GDP. Investment was about 16%. \n     Government procurement was about 19%. But net trade \n     subtracted about 3% from our economy (because imports \n     exceeded exports). This shrinkage is cumulative, compounding \n     year after year.\n       America is the picture of an unbalanced economy, \n     disproportionately relying upon unsustainable consumption. \n     Investment is too small, and should be 4% to 6% higher. Net \n     trade should add to our economy, or at least not subtract \n     from it. Consumption should increase in absolute terms, but \n     should be a smaller percentage of our economy.\n       Stated another way, we need to produce more of what we \n     consume. Right now we underproduce and engage in debt-driven \n     consumption. We live beyond our means. Investment is down \n     below sustainable levels. We are slouching towards Gomorrah. \n     We must produce more to employ people and grow wealth so that \n     we can export more (on a net basis), save more and engage in \n     income-driven consumption.\n       Thus, the battle is not between free traders and \n     protectionists, as the beltway think tanks and pundits often \n     assert. It is between misguided Gross Traders and factually \n     accurate Net Traders. It is not about opening or closing the \n     borders to trade, but balancing trade flows over time. The \n     seminal economist David Ricardo envisioned balanced trade \n     over time, as did the drafters of the General Agreement on \n     Tariffs and Trade (GATT).\n       Free trade was crafted as an antidote to mercantilism, not \n     an enabler of it.\n\n\n                      Markets versus Mercantilism\n\n       There is a twisted ideological school that promotes \n     unilateral American trade disarmament. The trade disarmament \n     advocates naively convince themselves that foreign \n     mercantilism is irrelevant and the basic trade principle of \n     reciprocity can be ignored. Big Government market \n     intervention by other countries is just fine even as Big \n     Government here is bad.\n       President Reagan gave a speech that established the \n     principle of ``free and fair trade with free and fair \n     traders.'' More specifically, he established the 3 R's: \n     Rules, Reciprocity and Results.\n       ``Rules'' mean that the trade must be rules based and every \n     nation should follow them. ``Reciprocity'' meant that there \n     will be a reciprocal reduction in tariffs, quotas and other \n     barriers rather than one-sized reduction. ``Results,'' the \n     point forgotten most, meant that America must gain a net \n     benefit from trade arrangements rather than being taken \n     advantage of.\n       The Wall Street Republican and Democrat ``free traders'' \n     are not pursuing free trade at all. They are practicing \n     ``mercantilism enabling'' trade. They want a deal that says \n     ``free trade'' on the front cover even as the actual text \n     incentivizes and enables scores of creative mercantilist \n     tactics.\n       Modern mercantilism is not tariffs or quotas. It is not \n     Smoot-Hawley. Foreign currency manipulation, via domestic \n     currency controls or government intervention in foreign \n     exchange markets, is a massive problem undertaken by many \n     countries, some of those countries are part of the TPP \n     negotiations. While the communist government in China is the \n     poster child for using competitive currency devaluation to \n     gain a trade advantage, South Korea, Japan and Singapore do \n     it as well. The WTO includes a provision prohibiting \n     countries from ``frustrating'' the intent of the agreement \n     with exchange rate actions. But that provision has been \n     ignored to the detriment of the global trading system, the \n     global monetary system and the US standard of living.\n       Tariff reductions are often replaced by increased \n     consumption taxes, which are charged at the border, in other \n     countries. After NAFTA, Mexico enacted a 15% value added tax \n     which is applied to all U.S. exports there. The border tax \n     replaced the Mexican tariff reductions. The Central American \n     Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) countries generally enacted a \n     new 12% consumption tax to replace their tariff reductions. \n     So American companies still pay similar tariff/tax amounts at \n     their border.\n       State-owned enterprises are modern forms of epic industrial \n     subsidization. Over 50% of Chinese industry is state owned. \n     Telecommunications, steel, shipbuilding, etc. are state-owned \n     enterprises. They receive free or low cost land, credit, \n     energy and other inputs. Production decisions are not driven \n     by market forces so much as by government bureaucrats. \n     Pricing decisions are made to undercut U.S. or global \n     competitors and gain market share rather than by supply and \n     demand.\n       A basic principle of trade agreements is that countries \n     should not engage in actions that ``nullify or impair'' the \n     benefits the contracting parties bargained for. But the U.S. \n     has not enforced those provisions, they are hard to enforce \n     in existing agreements,\n\n[[Page S2739]]\n\n     and the TPP cheerleaders keep pushing new deals without \n     addressing the modern forms of mercantilism.\n\n\n      Name Calling as a Substitute for Constitutional Consistency\n\n       Deprived of past economic success to base their argument \n     upon, a recent Cato Institute article engages in grade school \n     name calling against those on the right and the left who \n     oppose fast-track trade authority and recycled trade deals \n     like the TPP. The attempt at character assassination by \n     association is an unfortunate substitute for real data.\n       Even as the economy suffers from over-financialization, \n     deindustrialization, debt-driven consumption and asset \n     bubbles, the Wall Street TPP cheerleaders advocate a solution \n     in more flawed trade and global governance deals. Never mind \n     that we now have the WTO and bilateral agreements with more \n     countries than ever. Never mind that they predicted an \n     economic nirvana that never materialized when promoting those \n     prior agreements.\n       The medicine didn't work. So the solution is to take more \n     medicine.\n       The Tea Party groups that oppose fast-track trade authority \n     do so for core constitutional reasons as well. Article I, \n     Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the \n     authority to conduct trade policy. Congress, in the past, \n     typically passed bills designating the countries to negotiate \n     with and mandated the goals. Congress chose the countries to \n     negotiate with, set goals, oversaw the negotiations, and did \n     not pre-approve the final product before it was negotiated or \n     concluded. The checks and balances system set up by our \n     Founding Fathers was very intentional in dividing authority \n     among the legislative, executive and judicial branches so the \n     mistakes or abuse of power in one branch could be checked by \n     another.\n       Today's fast-track trade authority not only suspends the \n     ``regular order'' of Congress to approve an agreement, it \n     pre-approves a trade deal before it is even negotiated. The \n     so-called negotiating objectives in the fast-track bill are \n     merely for show. They are mere friendly congressional \n     suggestions that do not bind the executive branch and are \n     often ignored. Congress never verifies that the president \n     achieved the objectives.\n       A read of past fast-track legislation reveals many \n     ``negotiating objectives'' that were neither attempted nor \n     achieved by the executive branch negotiators. Yet, the \n     president can and does sign the agreement before Congress \n     views or votes on it.\n       Then, the president writes implementing legislation, which \n     is Congress' job. Congress cannot, under fast track, amend \n     the implementing legislation or the agreement but instead has \n     only 45 days for committees to consider and vote, then 15 \n     days for a floor vote. Only 20 hours of debate are allowed on \n     a complex international document that runs to thousands of \n     pages.\n       Modern fast track goes far deeper into Congress' \n     constitutional authority than mere tariffs and quotas. The \n     president becomes a super-Congress legislating through \n     diplomacy in domestic policy areas. He can and does negotiate \n     with other countries regarding immigration, financial \n     services, tax, food and product safety rules, domestic \n     procurement, labor standards and many other domestic issues. \n     The final agreement may overturn past acts of Congress or \n     include new standards previously considered but rejected by \n     Congress.\n       If and when the deal is approved by Congress, the new rules \n     are adjudicated by international tribunals that issue \n     decisions which penalize the U.S. if we do not comply. Future \n     Congresses are forever restricted from considering a wide \n     range of policy changes to benefit our citizens, barred by \n     global rules or the decisions of international tribunals.\n       The recent WTO ruling against American's country of origin \n     labeling for food laws is only the most recent example. \n     Americans did not think they agreed to a treaty that \n     prohibited them from identifying where their food comes from.\n       Contrary to conventional wisdom, it's an open question as \n     to whether a majority of economists or politicians would \n     support modern trade and global governance deals if they \n     actually read them. The debate becomes twisted into the low-\n     brow rhetoric of free trade versus protectionism. Or by \n     ideological name calling. Or by the identity politics of \n     ``this group could be working with that group, which is a \n     very bad thing.''\n       America became great by becoming an economic superpower. We \n     innovated, we built supply chains based upon that innovation, \n     we employed and paid people well, we created wealth, we built \n     the first durable middle class in the world. That gave us \n     cash to not only improve our standard of living, but also to \n     build the world's dominant military. We thus became the sole \n     global superpower.\n       Modern fast-track legislation began with the Trade Act of \n     1974. We have had 40 years of trade deficits shrinking our \n     economy ever since. It has been a net detriment rather than a \n     net benefit. It is time to focus upon true free trade with \n     rules, reciprocity and results, while fighting the increasing \n     scourge of global mercantilism. We must seek balanced trade \n     flows over time rather than be condemned to serve as the \n     global importer of last resort.\n       It is also time to preserve our constitutional system of \n     checks and balances and refrain from giving more power to \n     global institutions that displace our legislative and \n     judicial branches.\n       Only then can America return to a more broadly shared \n     prosperity.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. He says:\n\n       It is time to focus upon true free trade with rules, \n     reciprocity and results, while fighting the increasing \n     scourge of global mercantilism. We must seek balanced trade \n     flows over time rather than be condemned to serve as the \n     global importer of last resort.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       It is also time to preserve our constitutional system of \n     checks and balances and refrain from giving more power to \n     global institutions that displace our legislative and \n     judicial branches.\n\n  I think that is good advice, too.\n  Again, what Mr. DiMicco says is that while we remove trade barriers \nand open our markets to importing competition, our allies, even when \nthey reduce their tariff barriers, don't reduce other institutional \nbarriers.\n  They also utilize currency manipulation. This currency manipulation \ncan provide a far more substantial advantage in trade than even a \ntariff does. Mr. Volcker--the former Federal Reserve Chairman under \nPresident Reagan and widely regarded as having done a magnificent job--\nsaid tariffs can be overcome in a matter of minutes by currency \nmanipulation. Europe has seen its currency drop over 20 percent. Korea \nhas moved its currency down. Japan has moved its down. China has \nensured its yuan remains at a level below where it should be on \neconomic terms. As a result, they have gained a trade advantage, and as \na result, they have decimated American industries, closed factories all \nover this country when they wouldn't have closed if they had a fair \ndollar-to-yuan currency relationship. They have been found to be \nmanipulating their currency year after year. The Treasury makes it \nclear, but the Treasury has taken no action to do anything about it. As \na result, good American people have lost jobs, had their factories \nclosed and their towns and communities damaged economically by unfair \ntrade. We have enough trouble competing in the world market. We don't \nneed to have the unfair trade.\n  I thank the Chair for allowing me to share these remarks. I don't \npretend to know all the answers. I try to be supportive of trade. I \nremain supportive of trade. But I think we need to listen to the \nAmerican people a little bit. I don't think their concerns are \nunfounded. By a more than 2-to-1 margin, they say these trade \nagreements have advantaged our competitors rather than us.\n  It is time for us to make sure that if we do a trade agreement or \ntrade promotion authority, the product that is going to be passed into \nlaw and become a worldwide trade agreement serves the American people's \ninterests--somebody's interests other than some theoretician in a \nuniversity, somebody's interests other than some foreign capital, \nsomebody's interests other than the canyons of New York where capital \nis moved all over the world. Somebody needs to be looking out for the \ninterests of the American people. We need to ask that question first.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/07/senate-section/article/S2739-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, MAY 11, 2015, at 3 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
