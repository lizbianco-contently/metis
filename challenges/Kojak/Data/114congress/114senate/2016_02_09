Mr. President, on one final matter, the regime in \nNorth Korea presents serious threats to regional stability, to the \nsecurity of Americans, to the safety of our allies, and to the well-\nbeing of North Koreans themselves.\n  Pyongyang regularly threatens neighbors, such as South Korea and \nJapan. It routinely engages in cyber warfare. It repeatedly commits \ngross human rights violations against its own people and continues to \ndevelop a nuclear program that threatens peace in the region and \nthroughout the world. The regime's most recent display of belligerent \nbehavior only underlines that the administration's approach has \ncertainly not worked. Let's\n\n[[Page S710]]\n\nwork together to change that. Let's vote to move America's policy in a \nbetter and more successful direction.\n  Last month the House of Representatives voted to pass comprehensive \nsanctions legislation on a bipartisan basis. Tomorrow the Senate will \nturn to comprehensive sanctions legislation that builds on what the \nHouse passed, and we should pass that measure on a bipartisan basis as \nwell.\n  The North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act was written by a \nRepublican from Colorado, Senator Cory Gardner, and a Democrat from New \nJersey, Senator Bob Menendez, and reported from the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. It would strengthen congressional oversight. It would give \nthe President more tools to take action against North Korea's growing \naggression and require him to do so. It would also reassure our \nregional allies that we have not despaired in taking any action against \nNorth Korea--with or without help from China.\n  The kind of belligerence we have seen from Pyongyang must not be \nignored. Let's work together to make our country and our world safer by \npassing this bipartisan bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/senate-section/article/S710-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the people in Flint, MI, continue to suffer \nthrough a catastrophic series of problems. Basically, it is their \nwater. It is heavily contaminated. Their nightmare, which began almost \n2 years ago, is an emergency that requires a Federal response, and that \nis what we have been trying to do. In the case of emergencies like \nthis, we must act to help Americans dealing with a public health \ncrisis.\n  For weeks now, we have called on Republicans to work with us to \nprovide assistance for the people of Flint--100,000 people. Nine \nthousand children under the age of 6 have been poisoned in that little \ncity in Michigan. It is very large by Nevada standards, but by Michigan \nstandards, that city is not one of the bigger ones, but they need help. \nWe need help from the Republicans. Nothing is happening because we \nhaven't had enough Republican support. In the meantime, the people of \nFlint, MI, are using bottled water to bathe, to drink, to brush their \nteeth, and to cook with. That is really too bad.\n  This should not be a partisan issue. This is drinking water we are \ntalking about. Everyone is entitled to pure, clean drinking water, and \naccess to safe water is a right every American deserves. Whether you \nlive in Michigan, Texas, Florida, Arizona, Nevada, Illinois--it doesn't \nmatter where you live, you shouldn't be afraid to drink the water that \ncomes out of your faucet. No one should have to suffer, but the people \nof Flint, MI have suffered.\n  Yesterday the American Academy of Pediatrics wrote a long letter to \nme and to Senator McConnell. In this letter they said that this \norganization representing 65,000 pediatricians and other pediatric \nspecialists believes something needs to be done with the water in \nFlint.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter from the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               American Academy of Pediatrics,\n\n                          Elk Grove Village, IL, February 8, 2016.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leaders McConnell and Reid: On behalf of the American \n     Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), a non-profit professional \n     organization of 64,000 primary care pediatricians, pediatric \n     medical sub-specialists, and pediatric surgical specialists \n     dedicated to the health, safety and well-being of infants, \n     children, adolescents, and young adults, I write regarding \n     Congressional efforts to respond to the tragedy in Flint, \n     Michigan and the exposure of its citizens to lead, a potent \n     neurotoxin, through their drinking water.\n       The AAP supports federal efforts to provide immediate \n     funding and other assistance to the people of Flint, \n     including the amendment offered by Senators Stabenow and \n     Peters. While their proposal is a vitally important first \n     step, we would urge the Senate to provide additional funding \n     for long-term educational, early literacy, nutrition, \n     medical, behavioral, and other assistance to this community. \n     This includes, but should not be limited to: support for Head \n     Start and Early Head Start; quality child care; literacy \n     programs; Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program \n     enrollment; the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for \n     Women, Infants, and Children; school meals and afterschool \n     feeding programs; and mental health screening and treatment.\n       There is no safe level of lead exposure for children. Lead \n     damage can be permanent and irreversible. Lasting decreases \n     in cognition have been documented in children with blood \n     levels as low as 5 micrograms per deciliter of lead in \n     blood.' It is therefore clear that the children and families \n     of Flint will need comprehensive assistance in both the \n     short- and long-term.\n       The AAP is eager to assist this community, and federal \n     policymakers, in both immediate and longer-term solutions to \n     this public health tragedy. Thank you for your consideration. \n     If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact \n     Ami Gadhia in our Washington, D.C. office.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       Benard P.

I will only read a short phrase or two out of the letter, \nwhich says it all:\n\n       The AAP supports federal efforts to provide immediate \n     funding and other assistance to the people of Flint, \n     including the amendment offered by Senators Stabenow and \n     Peters.\n\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       There is no safe level of lead exposure for children. Lead \n     damage can be permanent and irreversible. Lasting decreases \n     in cognition have been documented in children with blood \n     levels as low as 5 micrograms per deciliter of lead in blood. \n     It is therefore clear that the children and families of Flint \n     will need comprehensive assistance in both the short- and \n     long-term.\n\n  This is a letter from the American Academy of Pediatrics. These are \npeople who deal with children. They are not politicians. They are \nwilling to tell us that these children have been poisoned.\n  In order to do something for the children of Flint and other \nfamilies, we need help from my Republican colleagues. Despite harsh \nwords from several Members of the Republican caucus who have no \ninterest in resolving the crisis in Flint, some Republicans are willing \nto help. For example, the senior Senator from Oklahoma has been working \nwith Senator Stabenow all weekend to put together an aid package that \nincludes immediate funding for the people of Flint. Now we are once \nagain waiting on Republicans to step forward and to support the chair \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee. It is incumbent upon the \nRepublican majority to get to ``yes'' to\n\n[[Page S711]]\n\nhelp the people of Flint end this manmade emergency that is simply \nbeyond their control.\n  All Americans deserve safe, clean drinking water, not just some of \nthem. I hope my Republican colleagues will choose to help us to pass \nlegislation to resolve this crisis, sending emergency funds to the \npeople of Flint now.\n  Mr. President, would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/senate-section/article/S711-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to address an issue of vital \nimportance to America's national security. It is the issue of reliable \nrocket launches--launches which the Department of Defense and the \nnational intelligence agencies count on on a regular basis to launch \nsatellites to keep America safe.\n  There is a separate area of launches with NASA involving the civilian \nside, but this morning I want to focus primarily on the Department of \nDefense rocket launches.\n  We made a decision about 10 years ago that was wrong. Two companies \nthat were competing at that time, Boeing and Lockheed, came forward to \nthe Federal Government and said: We have a plan. Instead of our \ncompanies competing, we will join together. We will become one \ncompany--Boeing and Lockheed--for this purpose, under the term United \nLaunch Alliance. They argued, convincingly at the time, that this was \nthe best way to come up with affordable, reliable launches. Well, that \nwas true for half of the projection. They were reliable.\n  In the last 10 years, the United Launch Alliance has been a reliable \npartner with the Department of Defense in launching satellites and \nother things into space which are critical for our national security. \nBut, unfortunately, because they became a monopoly, with no \ncompetition, they became increasingly more expensive and we had no \nplace to turn.\n  Recently, there have been new entries in this market in terms of \nlaunching satellites. One of the most promising is SpaceX. SpaceX, from \nits infancy, has matured into a company that could play an important \nrole in the future of satellite launches in the United States. I noted \nthis fact, and as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nDefense, I did something that doesn't happen around here very often. I \nhad a hearing scheduled and brought together the CEOs of United Launch \nAlliance, the traditional partner of the Department of Defense in \nlaunching satellites, and this new company, SpaceX. I invited the CEOs \nfrom both companies to sit at the same table and to answer questions \nfrom the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense. Then, at the end of \nthe hearing, I did something that I thought might be positive and \nconstructive. I said to each CEO: I would like each of you to write 10 \nquestions that should be in the record answered by your partner at the \ntable there. If we haven't covered everything to give a fair exposition \nof where this issue stands today, now is your chance.\n  That was in January 2014. It was the first time anybody had brought \ntogether two potentially competing companies and let them plead their \ncase before the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense. But I felt this \nwas the best way to give SpaceX a chance to tell its story as a new \nentrant into this competition and for ULA to defend its position.\n  We then decided there was another element that was important. United \nLaunch Alliance has several engines that can take a satellite into \nspace. The most economical one is built by the Russians, the RD-180. I \nhappen to believe that it is not in our best security interest to be \ndependent on the Russians to supply us with a rocket engine for vital \nsatellites to be launched into space. So I started pushing in the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Defense to put money into a competition \nfor an American-made, American-built rocket engine to replace the \nRussian RD-180. For 2 successive years we have appropriated more money \nfor this competition than the defense authorizing committee.\n  It turns out that we are on the right track, but the timing is \nchallenging. What we have been told is that replacing the Russian \nengine with an American-made engine will take up to 5 years. Who is the \nsource of that statement? The Secretary of the Air Force. So the \nobvious question is, If we can't cut off the Russian engine today \nwithout jeopardizing our national security, what should we do? We \ndecided in the current appropriations bill to extend the authority to \nthe Department of Defense to take bids on rockets launched by the \nRussian engine from ULA through this fiscal year. I thought this was a \nprudent thing to do--to wean ourselves from dependence on Russian-made \nengines--but to do it in a thoughtful, sensible way that gave the \nDepartment of Defense some options. This request, incidentally, for \noptions and flexibility came not just from the Secretary of the Air \nForce, but it came from the Director of National Intelligence as well \nas the Secretary of Defense. They said they needed these options to \nkeep America safe.\n  That was the state of play until the senior Senator from Arizona \ndecided he was going to come to the floor repeatedly and challenge this \nconclusion by the Appropriations subcommittee, then leading to an op-ed \nwhich he published yesterday in the Wall Street Journal. I come to the \nfloor this morning to address that op-ed by the senior Senator from \nArizona. It is titled: ``Congress's Cynical Crony-Capital Gift to \nPutin.''\n  The senior Senator from Arizona referenced me by name in this \narticle, as he has repeatedly on the floor of the Senate, though many \nwould argue that violates the Senate rules. Notwithstanding that \npersonal aspect of this, I want to address the issue that is before us.\n  Why does the senior Senator from Arizona continue to single me \nout personally? It is because I happen to agree with the Secretary of \nDefense, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Secretary of \nthe Air Force about a vital, important national security issue. The \nsenior Senator from Arizona disagrees with them.\n\n  The issue is deadly serious, despite the name-calling by my \ncolleague. It is about competition for launching defense satellites \ninto space. Here are the facts. One company, United Launch Alliance, or \nULA, held a monopoly for nearly 10 years. The cost of launches rose out \nof control. Today, there is finally an opportunity for competition. A \nnew company I mentioned earlier, SpaceX, has entered space launch. They \nare challenging ULA. As I said earlier, in January 2014, I recognized \nthis option--this possibility, this opportunity--and held a hearing \nwith the CEOs of both companies testifying under oath. The result of \nthis competition is that costs are dropping, exactly what we wanted to \nachieve, and the taxpayer is beginning to see savings. However, as I \nmentioned earlier, the ULA rocket most often uses a Russian-built \nrocket engine, the RD-180. After the Russian invasion of Crimea and \neastern Ukraine, the Department of Defense and Congress agreed it was \ntime for us to phase out any dependence on this Russian-made engine and \nto make an American product as soon as possible. I couldn't agree with \nthat more.\n  Developing and testing a new, American-made rocket takes time--more \ntime than I imagined. The Secretary of the Air Force, testifying before \nthe committee of the senior Senator from Arizona, estimated that it \nwould take to at least 2021 or 2022 until there was an American-made \nrocket engine that can replace the Russian engine that is being used \ntoday. However, the senior Senator from Arizona doesn't want to wait \nthat long to replace the Russian engine. In his Wall Street Journal \ndiatribe, he writes that ``we don't need to buy any more.'' And he is \napparently considering a total ban on the Department of Defense using \nthese Russian engines, despite the fact that we have received, in \nwriting, from the Secretary of Defense and the Director of\n\n[[Page S712]]\n\nNational Intelligence a warning that doing this would in fact create a \ngap which could endanger our national security.\n  In May 2015, the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National \nIntelligence wrote to the chairman of the defense authorization \ncommittee, and they shared his goal of replacing this Russian engine. \nBut they warned the senior Senator from Arizona that if he followed his \nown plan, it could harm U.S. national security. They were alarmed, in \nthis letter, of the proposed cutoff of access to Russian engines before \nan American replacement was ready. Secretary Carter and Director \nClapper do not want to trade one launch monopoly, ULA, for another \nlaunch monopoly, SpaceX. They are encouraging and standing for \ncompetition. They want to keep them competing so they can have lower \ncosts and options if one of the companies, for whatever reason, is \nunable to meet its obligations.\n  Also, our defense and intelligence satellites must not be dependent \non one type of rocket. A SpaceX launch failed last summer, and it took \n6 months before they could return to launches. With only one supplier \nof rockets, a crash could stop vital satellite launches for months, \nendangering America's national security.\n  The senior Senator from Arizona ignored the arguments being made by \nthe Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence. \nAfter all, it is hard for a Senator to argue with the senior national \nsecurity leader, Secretary Carter, whose doctorate is in theoretical \nphysics, and it would be unconscionable to call our Nation's highest \nintelligence official--a former Air Force pilot and career civil \nservant--a ``Putin crony.''\n  But I take warnings from our top national security experts seriously. \nMy Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense has been working to address \nthese issues the right way, the safe way. Rather than attack fellow \nSenators in the press, the senior Senator from Arizona should face the \nfacts.\n  When the Defense appropriations bill was marked up in June of 2015, \nthe bill included a bipartisan provision to allow the Department of \nDefense to conduct full and open competitions for rocket launches for 1 \nyear. An amendment was offered by the Republican senior Senator from \nthe State of South Carolina to strike that provision. But after a full \ndebate, he withdrew his amendment when it was clear there was \nbipartisan support for the bill. The provision was modified in \nconference, but the effect of the provision remains the same--to make \nsure that the Department of Defense and the Director of National \nIntelligence have some answer to their concerns about a launch \nmonopoly.\n  The senior Senator from Arizona has proposed another solution--that \nULA offer another rocket called the Delta IV, which, of course, is not \na Russian engine. According to the Pentagon's top weapons buyer and \nULA, each of those rockets endorsed by the senior Senator from Arizona \ncosts about 30 percent more than the Atlas rockets with Russian \nengines. So if that figure is correct, the plan of the senior Senator \nfrom Arizona requires American taxpayers to pay approximately $1 \nbillion more in launch costs over the next 6 years. This Senator, who \ncomes to the floor frequently telling us that he is such a budget hawk, \nis proposing a plan that will cost us at least $1 billion more over the \nnext 6 years. That figure could be higher. His plan could triple the \ncost of launches for some satellites that are too heavy to be launched \non a single rocket.\n  Under the plan of the senior Senator from Arizona, the taxpayers \nwould foot the bill for a new government-created monopoly. It is in \nfact a $1 billion windfall and gift to one defense contractor in \nCalifornia if we follow the plan of the senior Senator from Arizona, \nand it would also put our national security at risk if there is a \ntechnical failure.\n  If spending $1 billion of taxpayers' money to increase the risk that \nthe United States won't be able to launch a satellite to keep track of \nRussia sounds like a counterproductive and questionable idea, you would \nbe right. Last year, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee said \nmany times that the Defense authorization bill isn't a budget bill. \nNow, as vice chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense--\nthe subcommittee that has to make the math work--I can say that \nspending an extra $1 billion at this moment in the history of the \nDepartment of Defense doesn't make sense.\n  There is another aspect to this. I don't know if the senior Senator \nfrom Arizona is going to look into it or attack it as well. When it \ncomes to supplying the space station, we are reliant on Russian-made \nengines. If the senior Senator from Arizona wants to cut off access of \nNASA to these Russian-made engines, it will be a dangerous proposal. \nThere are a variety of NASA missions ahead that rely on this Atlas \nrocket. These include multiple resupply missions to the International \nSpace Station, a mission to take samples from a nearby asteroid, a new \nMars lander, a probe to study the sun, and several weather satellites.\n  If there is the will to ignore the national security concerns of the \nSecretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence about \naccess to space for national security, we had best take care. The \nsenior Senator from Arizona will now say that supplying the space \nstation is somehow a sellout to Vladimir Putin.\n  We have appropriated $448 million to develop all-American engines, \nwhich is more than the Armed Services Committee has authorized. In a \nfew years, we will have real competition for space launches that will \nhelp lower costs for a long time to come--but only if we listen to our \ntop defense and intelligence leaders, who favor a responsible \ntransition to the next rocket in the interest of national security and \noppose the plans put forward by the senior Senator from Arizona.\n  One aspect of this article in the Wall Street Journal that troubles \nme the most is the suggestion that I take lightly the adventurism of \nVladimir Putin and his bloody invasion of Ukraine. I am proud to be the \ncochair of the Ukrainian Caucus with Senator Portman of Ohio. We have a \nlarge Ukrainian population in my State. I have spoken to them many \ntimes, and I have visited Ukraine many times to make it clear that I \ndetest what Putin has done in invading their country and threatening \ntheir sovereignty. The irony is the senior Senator from Arizona \npersonally invited me to accompany him to Ukraine, where we both \nprotested Putin's actions. To suggest my position on these rocket \nengines is somehow a give-in to Putin is shameless and wrong. I think \nmy statements--public and otherwise--have made it clear.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this morning at 11 a.m., the President \nreleased the budget, his final budget for his Presidency. \nUnfortunately, rather than something that sends a signal that he wants \nto work with Congress, it is basically more of the same--a $4 trillion \nbudget that is unserious, partisan, and contains reckless spending. In \nit, he does include several new proposals, proposals he knows will be \ndead on arrival here in the U.S. Congress.\n  From my perspective, coming from an energy State, one pretty \nastounding measure he suggested was putting a $10 tax on each barrel of \noil. What that would do is translate into 25 cents a gallon more for \nconsumers at the pump. How in the world would that help American \nfamilies who are suffering as a result of stagnant wages due to slow \neconomic growth in this country as well as additional costs, such as \nObamaCare, that have been imposed upon them by the administration? The \nsimple fact is that it doesn't help the average American family get by. \nIt is the opposite.\n  At a time when our country is producing more energy domestically than \nit ever has and just beginning to export that energy to our friends and \nallies around the world, the President's budget reveals that he has \nlittle interest in growing our energy independence and little interest \nin jump-starting our economy.\n  All he has to do is look at Texas, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, and \nother places to see how our domestic energy production has helped \ncreate thousands of jobs and helped grow the economy. Instead, the \nPresident makes these job-\n\n[[Page S713]]\n\nkilling proposals, which will further burden hard-working American \nfamilies, along with the tepid growth that we have seen here in our own \neconomy--0.7 percent just this last quarter. The President's budget \nadds further insult to injury by adding to our national debt, which is \nalready $19 trillion.\n  Somebody is going to have to pay that back. In the meantime, what we \nwill have to do is pay interest on that debt, which will continue to \ncrowd out spending in other areas like national security where there is \na national consensus. This is the number one priority for the American \npeople.\n  Strangely, but unfortunately predictably, rather than deciding to \nwork with Congress and to listen to the concerns that are raised by \nthose hard-working American families, President Obama went ahead and \nsubmitted a budget with no apparent interest in finding any kind of \ncommon ground. It is a sad testament to his go-it-alone legacy, which \nhas been more ideological than actually solution oriented.\n  We are here to try to solve problems, and the only way we do that is \nby working together to find consensus where we can. Understanding that \nthere are people who serve in the Senate and the House from different \npoints of view all across the ideological spectrum, it is only by \nworking together--and that includes not just Congress but the \nPresident, too--that we can actually begin to help grow the economy to \nhelp create jobs, to help make America more secure.\n  Given the fact that the President has decided to take the tack he \nhas, I hope that Congress will lead the charge against this request for \nirresponsible spending and try to help get our economy back on track, \nto begin the process of reducing our debt and strengthening the hand of \nthe American family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/senate-section/article/S713-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S713-S714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MENTAL HEALTH REFORM\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, on another note, I wish to spend a few \nminutes talking about a very important hearing that we will be having \ntomorrow in the Senate Judiciary Committee, something that I feel very \npassionately about, and that is finding a way forward on mental health \nreform. As shocking as it is, our jails and our streets have become \nplaces where people suffering from mental illness basically are left \nwithout treatment and without recourse.\n  Tomorrow I will have the honor of chairing that hearing where we will \ndiscuss the intersection of our mental health system such as it is and \nour criminal justice system, and hopefully we will be able to find a \nway forward to push toward real reform. The goal of the hearing is to \nbetter understand how to bring help and support for those who struggle \nwith mental illness.\n  This is an area where we can and we must do better. Too often, after \nthe fact, we find out that families faced with the choice of allowing \ntheir loved ones' mental health to continue deteriorating, letting \ntheir illness spiral out of control until they become a danger to \nthemselves or others--there are very few choices available to families \nwhose loved ones are becoming more and more ill. True, they could go to \ncourt and seek a court order, seeking a temporary commitment to a \nmental institution, but that frequently exacerbates frayed relations \namong family members, and it stigmatizes the individual who is \nsuffering from mental illness issues.\n  We need to give those families more and better choices on how to deal \nwith their loved ones, hopefully to keep them from becoming a danger to \nthemselves and to the community. Thanks to the marvels of modern \nmedicine, for many people suffering from mental illness, if they will \njust follow doctors' orders and take the medication that has been \nprescribed for them--frequently under some doctor's supervision--many \nof them can get much better and become more productive in society.\n  One of our witnesses tomorrow will be Pete Earley who wrote a book \ncalled ``Crazy.'' He is not talking about a person. He is talking about \nour so-called system of mental health treatment. Pete Earley wrote this \nbook because, as an accomplished journalist and writer, he knew of no \nother way than to write about the issue to help his very own son who \nhad encounter after encounter with the criminal justice system because \nhe had untreated mental illness.\n  Sadly, the failure to adequately address mental health in the United \nStates has led to a drastic increase in the number of mentally ill \nindividuals being locked up in prisons and jails, still without \nadequate treatment. I don't think anyone would support the idea of \nturning our prisons and our jails into warehouses for the mentally ill, \nbut that is what has happened by default.\n  We need to provide better choices to law enforcement officials, to \nfamilies, and to the individuals who suffer from mental illness. So \noften many of them will self-medicate with drugs and alcohol, \ncompounding their problems, creating more and more of this turnstile \neffect within the criminal justice system where no one ever gets better \nand the illness never gets treated.\n  As criminologists and mental health experts will tell you, locking up \npeople with mental illness without treatment will make them only more \ndangerous and increase the risk of crisis, but unfortunately this is an \nall-too-common practice across our country.\n  This is a shocking number to me when I read it, but one estimate \nsuggests there are as many as 400,000 current inmates in our prisons \nacross America who suffer from some form of mental illness. That is \nbecause, at least in part, the United States has witnessed a rapid \ndecline in psychiatric and mental health hospitals over the past \ndecades. The idea was that you couldn't institutionalize people so you \nhad to let them out. Unfortunately, just letting them out without \nfinding a way forward to help them deal with their mental illness \nresulted in many of them becoming homeless, living on our streets or in \nour jails and our prisons when they commit petty crimes such as \ntrespassing and the like.\n  Since 1960, more than 90 percent of State psychiatric beds have been \neliminated--90 percent. But prison is a poor and often very harmful \nreplacement for a treatment facility. Our goal in the hearing tomorrow \nis to work toward another solution, one that would give families \ngreater flexibility, including actual treatment options for the people \nthey love.\n  A bill I introduced, the Mental Health and Safe Communities Act, \noffers one proven approach to treating mental illness. It borrows from \na successful model of reform, put into place in my hometown in Bexar \nCounty, TX, more than a decade ago.\n  Let me say a word about borrowing from these successful local and \nState models as opposed to imposing a one-size-fits-all approach at the \nnational level, not knowing whether it would actually work in this big \nand diverse country we live in. I believe that taking successful \nexamples of best practices at the local and State level--those are the \nbest subject matter for us to look at in terms of scaling these up on a \nnational level where appropriate.\n  The Bexar County sheriff, Susan Pamerleau, a champion of mental \nhealth reform in San Antonio, will testify tomorrow about the San \nAntonio story. Bexar County's mental health program focuses on \ntreatment of the mentally ill instead of just putting them behind bars \nand leaving them untreated. The results have been very impressive.\n  These reforms have reduced the size of our overcrowded jails, which \nhas been a perennial problem. It has saved tax dollars, and it has \nimproved the lives of people who otherwise would be put behind bars and \nleft to their own devices.\n  I look forward to hearing from Sheriff Pamerleau tomorrow. I bet \nother members of the Senate Judiciary Committee and anyone else who \ncares to listen will learn a lot about how we can bring these reforms \nto the rest of the country.\n  Another part of this is to help equip law enforcement, teachers, \njudges, and people who work in the courts with the knowledge and skill \nset they need to spot mental illness early on. Wouldn't it be more \nhelpful if teachers, parents, and counselors were empowered to help \nidentify people who need help early on in school? Doesn't it make sense \nto train our law enforcement officials how to deal with a person \nsuffering from a mental health crisis? Do you slap the cuffs on them? \nDo you get engaged in a violent confrontation? Or do you try to \ndeescalate the incident in a way that is\n\n[[Page S714]]\n\nsafer for the law enforcement official as well as the person being \nconfronted?\n  There are better ways for us to respond effectively at the early \nsigns and help to train the people who are in the best position to \nidentify people who need help early on. This legislation includes \nspecialized training for those on the frontlines, such as law \nenforcement and judicial officials, so they are ready to respond and \ncan react swiftly and safely should a mental health crisis erupt.\n  The truth is that this is a difficult issue and one that raises hard \nquestions. But I am grateful to Chairman Grassley of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee for not shying away from this topic but embracing \nit and having witnesses such as those we will have tomorrow who I think \nwill open the eyes of many people to something they perhaps don't \nencounter in their daily lives because they don't go to our jails or \nour prisons or they don't have a loved one who suffers from mental \nillness. I think this will open a lot of eyes, and it will help us \ncontinue the conversation so we can find some common ground and work \ntoward real solutions.\n  Reform is long overdue. All you need to do is visit our jails, as I \nhave done in Harris County, Bexar County, and Dallas County, to see \nthat too often our jails are occupied by people who--yes, they may have \ncommitted petty crimes, nonviolent crimes, but they really need some \nhelp. If we give them the help, they can turn their lives around and \nbecome more productive.\n  It will save taxpayers money, and I think it will be a much more \nhumane and efficient system of dealing with people suffering with a \nmental health crisis. I am hopeful we can advance substantive \nlegislation to help those struggling with mental illness and their \nfamilies and, as a result, make our communities safer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss the bill that will be \ncoming before the Senate this week, the North Korea Sanctions \nEnforcement Act, which seeks to curb North Korea's unacceptable \nbehavior through the implementation of targeted sanctions.\n  On January 6 of this year, North Korea tested a nuclear weapon in \nopen violation of numerous U.N. resolutions. This is the fourth time \nNorth Korea has conducted a nuclear weapons test, and it is estimated \nthe country may have as many as 20 nuclear warheads in its arsenal.\n  Just this past weekend, while many Americans were getting ready to \nwatch the Super Bowl, North Korea conducted a missile test, putting a \nsatellite into orbit. This missile test, which has already been \ncondemned by the U.N. Security Council, served as a demonstration of \nthe threat posed by North Korea's long-range missile program. In fact, \njust a few hours later, the satellite launched by the North Korean \nmissile passed over the site of the Super Bowl in Santa Clara, CA.\n  If equipped with a nuclear warhead, a missile similar to the one \nlaunched this weekend could potentially threaten the United States and \nour allies, and North Korea is actively seeking to market this same \nmissile technology, as well as its nuclear weapons technology, to other \nrogue regimes.\n  North Korea's history of aggressive behavior is already well known \nand well documented. In March of 2010, a North Korean torpedo sank the \nSouth Korean naval vessel Cheonan, killing 46 sailors. In November of \n2010, North Korea fired artillery on the island of Yeonpyeong, killing \ntwo soldiers and injuring an additional 15 soldiers and 2 civilians.\n  North Korea's dictator Kim Jong Un continues to spout threats against \nthe United States and our allies. This past year, when South Korean \ncitizens sent leaflets with unfiltered information into North Korea, \nthe regime responded with threats to turn the whole of South Korea into \na ``sea of fire.'' After the January nuclear test, a North Korean \nspokesman said: ``North Korean scientists are in high spirits.'' The \nstatement went on to claim that North Korea detonated an H-bomb, which \nwe now know to be untrue, and added that the bomb was ``capable of \nwiping out the whole territory of the U.S. all at once.'' These threats \nare so common now that they barely make the news.\n  North Korea is not only a threat to the United States, it is also a \nthreat to its own people. It is estimated that 150,000 to 200,000 North \nKoreans are imprisoned in concentration camps. We can confirm the \nexistence of these camps from satellite photographs and firsthand \naccounts. These are not camps for what we would consider criminals but \nfor individuals deemed disloyal to the regime. The ``crime'' of a \nsingle family member--which can be something as simple as accidentally \ntarnishing the photo of a member of North Korea's hereditary \ndictatorship--can lead to an entire North Korean family being sent away \nto a labor camp.\n\n  The brutality of these camps has been confirmed by those who have \nmade it out. To date, more than 28,000 North Korean defectors have \nescaped and made it to South Korea. Tens of thousands more are still in \nChina, often working as cheap laborers who become victims of human \ntrafficking.\n  The stories of those who have escaped Kim Jong Un's regime carry a \ncommon theme: starvation, imprisonment, torture, and the execution of \nfamily members. And this is everyday life for the people of North \nKorea.\n  The bill we are considering this week seeks to curb North Korea's \naggressive behavior through the use of targeted sanctions. The bill \nrestricts access to financial resources and raw materials that North \nKorea uses to support its nuclear weapons program and operate its \npolitical prison and forced labor camps. It levels mandatory sanctions \nagainst individuals who contribute to North Korea's ballistic missile \ndevelopment and targets luxury goods the regime uses to maintain the \nloyalty of party elites. It also puts in place sanctions against any \nentity determined to be enabling North Korea's ability to censor \ninformation, as well as those engaged in money laundering, narcotics \ntrafficking, and counterfeiting. The bill also includes discretionary \nsanctions that the U.S. President could use to target entities \nassisting North Korea in misappropriating funds for the benefit of \nNorth Korean officials. The President would have to justify any waivers \nof these sanctions on a case-by-case basis. The bill also codifies into \nlaw the Presidential Executive orders issued in 2015 following the \ncyber attack on Sony Pictures.\n  This is a multifaceted bill designed to target North Korea's weapons \nprograms, human rights abuses, and the finances of government elites. \nAnd it will do so with minimal impact on the lives of everyday North \nKoreans who continue to suffer at the hands of their own government.\n  Last week I introduced legislation addressing another threat posed by \nNorth Korea. As I stated before, North Korea is actively seeking to \nmarket its nuclear weapons technology to other rogue regimes. In fact, \nthe Syrian nuclear reactor destroyed in 2007 is based on a North Korean \ndesign. My bill would ensure that North Korea can't sell its technology \nto another rogue regime--Iran.\n  Although President Obama's nuclear deal seeks to prevent Iran from \nacquiring a nuclear weapon, many of us remain skeptical. And with the \nNorth Korean regime strapped for cash, its nuclear weapons and missile \ntechnology are some of the few commodities it can offer, and it \nactively tries to market them to other rogue regimes.\n  My bill seeks to prevent Iran from becoming a potential customer for \nNorth Korea's nuclear weapons technology. Under my legislation, if Iran \nattempts to acquire nuclear weapons technology from North Korea, all \nsanctions waived or suspended as a result of the President's nuclear \ndeal would be reinstated immediately. A nuclear armed Iran is \nunacceptable.\n  Regardless of what the President claims his Iran nuclear deal has \nachieved, we must remain vigilant and ensure that Iran keeps its end of \nthe agreement and does not go after a nuclear weapon.\n\n[[Page S715]]\n\n  I am glad the Senate is addressing the threat posed by North Korea. A \nsimilar version of the North Korea sanctions bill that we are \naddressing this week recently passed the House of Representatives by a \nvote of 418 to 2. I hope we will see similar bipartisan support for the \nbill here in the Senate. We should not compromise the national security \nof the United States with disputes between our political parties. I \nhope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle feel the same and will \njoin me in moving this bill forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today the President of the United States \nunveiled the last budget of his Presidency: $4.1 trillion. Of that, \n$1.1 trillion is discretionary spending, which is the amount Congress \nwill discuss over the next few months.\n  It is no big secret that Presidential budgets typically are dead on \narrival--this one especially so, obviously, as it is the last one of \nthe President's term. It is a requirement of the 1974 Budget Act. The \nPresident turns in his budget by the first Monday of February. It is \nactually now into the second week. It is a week late, but it is closer \nto on time than the budgets of other Presidents have been in the last \nfew years.\n  There are a lot of wish list items in the President's budget. It also \nincludes about $3.4 trillion in new taxes over the next 10 years. It \nincreases spending by $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years, including \nnext year. The challenge in the President's spending plan is that he \nincreases spending so much that we also continue to increase the \ndeficit, the debt, and our interest payments.\n  This body should realize that on the current track, the Congressional \nBudget Office and the President's budget that he released today \nforecast that within the next 10 years, the United States of America \nwill spend more on interest on our debt than we spend on national \ndefense. I want everyone to soak that in. Within 10 years, the Federal \ntaxpayer will spend more on interest on our debt--our debt payments--\nthan we spend on national defense.\n  When the President came into office, there was $10.6 trillion in \ntotal debt. The President's budget lays out a plan that by the end of \nhis budget, there will be $27.4 trillion in total debt. This is an \nissue for us, and it continues to accelerate. And until this body and \nuntil the House and until the White House agree this is a problem, it \nwill not be solved.\n  I don't want to say this flippantly; the President and I have had \nthis conversation. He does not believe that increasing deficits--that \nis, overspending what we bring in--is a problem. He believes, as he has \nshared with me and with the American people publicly, that if the \ngovernment overspends a little bit, that stimulates the economy. Well, \nthat might be true in some economic formula, but when our interest \npayments are larger than total what we spend for defense, we are in a \nspiral that we cannot sustain.\n  We cannot keep saying we will add more debt every year and there is \nno reckoning for that. Our total debt right now exceeds our gross \ndomestic product. Literally, if we took from every single American in \nthe entire country all of their income for the entire year we could not \npay off our debt.\n  We are very much at a tipping point. The problem Congress faces is \nCongress never seems to act until we have to, and, in this time, in an \neconomic crisis, when we have to, it is too late. How do we get on top \nof that? How do we stop bragging about how much the deficit has been \ncut and actually start reducing our debt? Many Americans don't hear the \ndifference between the debt and the deficit because they don't live in \nthis world of all of these different terms. Deficit is how much we \noverspend in any one year; debt is the accumulation of all of those \ndeficits.\n  Washington continues to talk about how in the last 6 years we have \ncut the deficit by $1 trillion. And that is a good thing, but the \nproblem is that in the last 10 years, the debt has also doubled as \ndeficits are still so large every single year, and that is a problem.\n  So what do we do with this? I would say there are multiple things. \nNo. 1, we are not going to get out of this in any one time period. This \nbody needs to understand that this is not a car payment we are paying \noff. This is a really big jumbo mortgage. We are not going to pay this \noff in 1 year, and we are not going to fix it in one stroke. This is \ngoing to take multiple years of picking away at this.\n  I have reminded several of my colleagues of one sobering fact: If we \nwere to balance our budget and set this 10-year time period to actually \nbalance the budget, if the next year after the balanced budget we had a \n$50 billion surplus as a nation, it would take 460 years in a row of \n$50 billion surpluses to pay off our debt. For twice as long as we have \nbeen a country, if we had a $50 billion surplus every year, we could \npay off our debt. At some point we have to admit this is a really big \nissue.\n  CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, as all of us know in this room, \ncontinues to rattle us and remind us that this debt is continuing to \ngrow and we do not have the resources to do it. For the first time \nsince 2009, our deficit will rise again next year to $544 billion. That \nis up 24 percent from just this last fiscal year. As we continue to \nhave more individuals who retire and use Medicare and Social Security, \nwhich they have set aside their entire life to go into, and as that \nnumber continues to rise and as discretionary spending continues to \nstay fairly capped, we are not getting on top of the big issues that we \nface.\n  Where do we go from here? In 1974 this Congress created the \nCongressional Budget Act, which set up the process of how we would \nactually do our budget every year. It is a very interesting process \nwith the House and Senate passing budgets, putting them together, going \nthrough the process and getting everything to the President. All the \ntiming and everything was set up with appropriations bills and how they \nwould be done with all the deadlines. Interestingly, since 1979, the \nCongressional Budget Act, in the way that it was set up, has only \nworked two times--twice since 1979. Would anyone else admit that there \nis a problem with that setup? Coming out of Watergate in 1974, they \nwanted more transparency and an open process doing the budget. So they \ncreated this process that is so cumbersome that since 1979 it has only \nworked twice.\n  To give more up-to-date details, in the last 10 years we should have \npassed 118 appropriations bills. Of the 118 appropriations bills, only \n7 of those individual bills were passed on time. We have a problem just \nin basic process.\n  So allow this Senator to just throw out a few ideas to recommend to \nthis body that we consider. If we are going to fix our debt and \ndeficit, we have to look at the process of executing our budget to fix \nit.\n  Here are a few thoughts. A biennial budget--if we don't do a budget \nevery year, we should do a budget every 2 years. We are dealing with \ntrillions of dollars. We should do a little bit of advanced planning. \nWe should be able to do that at least 2 years in advance to be able to \nlay out how we are actually going to do the spending. We could do \nappropriations every single year to be able to provide the \naccountability, but at least the major budget process we should do \nevery 2 years.\n  We should get rid of the budget gimmicks that dominate this body in \nhow we ``balance our budget.'' Budget gimmicks such as pension \nsmoothing, corporate timing shifts, and all of our favorites--CHIMPS, \nor changes in mandatory programs, which everyone outside of this city \nthinks is a monkey, and everyone inside this city knows it is a great \nbudgeting technique.\n  Here is how some of these work. Here is an example from October's \nbudget agreement. A pension payment acceleration in section 502 changed \nthe due date for pension premiums from October 15, 2025, to September \n15, 2025, in order to get $2.3 billion into the ten-year window. Now \nwhat just changed there? They moved the payment time 30 days forward \nand so that is when it is due. Since they moved it 30 days forward 10 \nyears from now, suddenly that is another $2 billion into the Federal\n\n[[Page S716]]\n\nbudget. If our Federal budget was not 10 years, but 10 years and 2 \nweeks, it would have been $2 billion short. Because they moved the \npayment over a month and made it earlier, suddenly the budget picked up \n$2 billion. It is not real. It is a gimmick.\n  There are the changes in mandatory programs that go out, such as the \nCrime Victims Fund. That is a fund of money that is expected to be \nspent, but should we actually not spend part of it, they will say: \nGreat, we can take that part we were ``expected to spend'' and actually \nspend it this year. Then guess what; next year you spend it again, and \nnext year you spend it again. It is a gimmick. That should be struck. \nWe shouldn't have gimmicks like that. Those things make Congress look \ngood but don't actually deal with our deficit and debt. There are rules \nthat are internal that need to be fixed. We need to get real numbers \nand be able to have agreeable real numbers.\n  Right now there is a big argument all the time saying: How does the \nbudget balance against the President's budget--this particular baseline \nand that particular baseline? How about this: We have a lot of programs \nthat have not been authorized--some of them for more than a decade--\nthough we continue to allocate money for them every single year. \nAuthorizing programs as we do for national defense every single year is \nimportant, and we should actually do the work with that to be able to \nbring bills to the floor and to be able to get it done.\n  We have reports from the GAO and from the IG that come out every year \nshowing waste, yet many of those no one ever acts on. Three folks I see \non the floor right now--Senator Flake and Senator McCain from Arizona \nand my office--have all put out waste reports in the past 5 months \ndetailing billions of dollars in waste. We can identify these areas, \nand the inspector general's office and the GAO can identify these \nareas. We need to set a process in place to actually solve those \nissues. Then we can do more than talk about it. We can move it from \njust a messaging moment to solutions on our debt and our deficit.\n  I recommend a measure such as the Government Shutdown Prevention Act \nthat says we don't have a government shutdown. I understand some are \nvery romantic about government shutdowns and what they would \naccomplish. Government shutdowns always cost more money for the \ntaxpayer than they save. They cost a tremendous amount of turmoil in \nthe Federal workforce and multiple places.\n  There is an easier way for us to handle this. Congress only acts when \nwe have to. When we have a government shutdown, we suddenly have to \nact. How about if we do something simple and straightforward, and we \nput in place something that at the end of the budget year, if we do not \nhave a budget in place and do not have proper appropriations done, we \nhave a short-term continuing resolution for 30 days that automatically \nputs into place in all legislative offices and the Executive Office of \nthe White House a funding haircut to create the incentive that we need \nto act? If 30 days later we still don't have the appropriations done, \nthe Executive Office of the White House, the House, and the Senate get \nanother haircut, and we continue to press. There are ways that we can \nadd pressure to ourselves that won't actually damage what is happening \nin the rest of the Nation.\n  Why don't we pass a balanced budget amendment, which we have talked \nabout forever and which we voted on in 2011 and has not come up again? \nWe will never get to some of these measures until Congress is compelled \nto do the right thing. Let's put some processes in place beginning with \nour budget process, with real reform in how we do the budget and real \nstructural changes to actually push this body to do what everyone \noutside of this body says needs to be done.\n  In the days ahead when we are spending more on interest than we are \non national defense, this body should hang its head in shame. But \nbefore that occurs, we should fix it so that never happens and we get \non top of our debt and deficit with a straightforward process that \nactually gets us back to work.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate in morning business and be allowed to complete my remarks, which \nwon't be too long.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/senate-section/article/S716-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S716-S717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WATERBOARDING\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today is the 100th New Hampshire \nPresidential primary. Regardless of who wins, this is a celebration of \nour vibrant democracy of engaged citizens putting candidates to the \ntest and demanding answers on the tough issues the next President will \nconfront.\n  It is also another important step in choosing our next Commander in \nChief, and the stakes couldn't be higher. As we heard from the Director \nof National Intelligence this morning, the threats to our Nation are \ngrowing more diverse, more complex, and more dangerous. More than ever \nwe need a Commander in Chief with a clear vision, a steady hand, sound \njudgment and confidence--not only in our Nation's power but in the \nvalues and ideals that generations of American heroes have fought for \nand died defending.\n  That is why it has been so disappointing to see some Presidential \ncandidates engaged in loose talk on the campaign trail about reviving \nwaterboarding and other inhumane interrogation techniques. It might be \neasy to dismiss this bluster as cheap campaign rhetoric, but these \nstatements must not go unanswered because they mislead the American \npeople about the realities of interrogation, how to gather \nintelligence, what it takes to defend our security, and at the most \nfundamental level, what we are fighting for as a nation and what kind \nof a nation we are.\n  It is important to remember the fact that these forms of torture not \nonly failed their purpose to secure actionable intelligence to prevent \nfurther attacks on the United States and our allies, but they \ncompromised our values, stained our national honor, and did little \npractical good. While some have shamefully sought to minimize the \npractice of waterboarding, it is clear to me that this practice, which \nis a simulated execution by drowning, amounts to torture as any \nreasonable person would define it and how the Geneva Conventions on the \ntreatment of prisoners of war, of which we are signatories, define it.\n  The use of these methods by the United States was shameful and \nunnecessary because the United States has tried, convicted, and \nexecuted foreign combatants who employed methods of torture, including \nwaterboarding, against American prisoners of war. Following World War \nII, Japanese generals were tried, convicted, and hung. One of the \ncharges against them was that they practiced waterboarding. Contrary to \nassertions made by some of the defenders, it provided little useful \nintelligence to help us track down the perpetrators of the September 11 \nattacks or to prevent new attacks and atrocities.\n  This Senator knows from personal experience that the abuse of \nprisoners will produce more bad than good intelligence. I know that \nvictims of torture will offer intentionally misleading information if \nthey think their captors will believe it. I know they will say whatever \nthey think their torturers will want them to say if they believe it \nwill stop their suffering. Most of all, I know that the use of torture \ncompromises that which most distinguishes us from our enemies--our \nbelief that all people, even captured enemies, possess basic human \nrights that are protected by international conventions the United \nStates not only joined but for the most part authored.\n  I understand that in the aftermath of the worst terrorist attacks on \nour homeland, those who approved harsh interrogation methods and those \nwho used them were sincerely dedicated to securing justice for the \nvictims of terrorist attacks and protecting Americans from further \nharm. I know that in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in Paris \nand San Bernardino, many Americans feel again the grave urgency that we \nfelt 15 years ago. But I dispute wholeheartedly that it was right for \nour Nation to use these interrogation methods then or that it is right \nfor our Nation to use them now.\n  Waterboarding, as well as any other form of torture, is not in the \nbest interest of justice, security or the ideals\n\n[[Page S717]]\n\nwe have sacrificed so much blood and treasure to defend.\n  It is the knowledge of torture's dubious efficacy and the strong \nmoral objections to the abuse of prisoners that have forged broad \nbipartisan agreement on this issue. Last year, the Senate passed in an \noverwhelming vote of 91 to 3 the National Defense Authorization Act for \nfiscal year 2016, legislation that took a historic step forward to ban \ntorture once and for all by limiting U.S. Government interrogation \ntechniques to those in the Army Field Manual. That vote was 91 to 3. \nThere was debate and discussion about it in the Armed Services \nCommittee and on the floor of this Senate. The vote was 91 to 3.\n\n  Now candidates are saying they will disregard the law. I thought that \nwas our complaint--Republicans' complaint--with the present President \nof the United States.\n  The U.S. military has successfully interrogated more foreign \nterrorist detainees than any other agency of our government. The Army \nField Manual, in its current form, has worked for the U.S. military--\nincluding on high-value terrorist detainees in Iraq, Afghanistan, and \nelsewhere--and it reflects current best thinking and practices on \ninterrogation.\n  Moreover, the Army Field Manual embodies the values Americans have \nembraced for generations, preserving the ability of our interrogators \nto extract critical intelligence from our adversaries while recognizing \nthat torture and cruel treatment are ineffective interrogation methods.\n  Some of the Nation's most respected leaders from the U.S. military, \nCIA, and FBI supported this legislation, as well as numerous human \nrights organizations and faith groups, including the National \nAssociation of Evangelicals and the U.S. Conference of Catholic \nBishops.\n  GEN David Petraeus, a military leader whom I admire more than \nliterally any living military leader, said he supported the use of the \nArmy Field Manual because ``our Nation has paid a high price in recent \ndecades for the information gained by the use of techniques beyond \nthose in the field manual--and, in my view, that price far outweighed \nthe value of the information gained through the use of techniques \nbeyond those in the manual.'' Obviously, that includes waterboarding.\n  Why don't we listen to people like GEN David Petraeus, who has had \nvast experience in Iraq and Afghanistan with detainees, the information \nwe have gotten from them, and our practices. If General Petraeus were \nhere, he would tell you the most effective method of gaining \ninformation is establishing a friendly relationship with the detainee.\n  Obviously, we need intelligence to defeat our enemies, but we need \nreliable intelligence. Torture produces more misleading information \nthan actionable intelligence. What the advocates of harsh and cruel \ninterrogation methods have never established is that we couldn't have \ngathered as good or more reliable intelligence from using humane \nmethods. The most important lead we got in the search for bin Laden \ncame from using conventional interrogation methods. I think it is an \ninsult to many of the intelligence officers who have acquired good \nintelligence without hurting or degrading prisoners to assert that we \ncannot win this war on terrorism without such methods. Yes, we can and \nwe will.\n  In the end, torture's failure to serve its intended purpose isn't the \nmain reason to oppose its use. I have often said and will always \nmaintain that this question isn't about our enemies, it is about us. It \nis about who we were, who we are, and whom we aspire to be. It is about \nhow we represent ourselves to the world.\n  We have made our way in this often dangerous and cruel world, not by \njust strictly pursuing our geopolitical interests but by exemplifying \nour political values and influencing other nations to embrace them. \nWhen we fight to defend our security, we fight also for an idea that \nall men are endowed by their Creator with inalienable rights; that is, \nall men and women. How much safer the world would be if all nations \nbelieved the same. How much more dangerous it can become when we forget \nit ourselves, even momentarily, as we learned from Abu Ghraib. Our \nenemies act without conscience. We must not. It isn't necessary, and it \nisn't even helpful in winning this strange and long war we are \nfighting.\n  Our Nation needs a Commander in Chief who understands and affirms \nthis basic truth. Our Nation needs a Commander in Chief who will make \nclear to those who fight on our behalf that they are defending this \nsacred ideal and that sacrificing our national honor and our respect \nfor human dignity will make it harder, not easier, to prevail in this \nwar. Our Nation needs a Commander in Chief who reminds us that in the \nworst of times, through the chaos and terror of war, when facing \ncruelty, suffering, and loss, that we are always Americans--different, \nstronger, and better than those who would destroy us.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/senate-section/article/S717-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Maryland\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 \nminutes also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. COTTON. I do modify my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I rise today in support not only of the \nnomination of Scot Marciel to be our Ambassador to Burma but to \ncelebrate the remarkable change Burma is undergoing.\n  I recently traveled to Burma, leading a congressional delegation \nhosted by our Embassy there, Ambassador Derek Mitchell, and Deputy \nChief of Mission Kristen Bauer.\n  Burma has undergone a remarkable transition. After 50 years of a \nbrutal military dictatorship, Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and her \nparty won a landslide election in November. The military is still \nentrenched in power, but gradual change is occurring, in part thanks to \nU.S. policies. It is change we should continue to support.\n  Sitting at the intersection of China and India, Burma is a \ngeostrategically critical country. Sitting, as it does, between the \ncrossroads of Southeast Asia and the Middle East, it is critical to the \nWar on Terror. Burma can be a potent trading partner because of its \nlargely untapped natural resources and is a shining example of the \nstrategic impact of U.S. moral leadership in the world.\n  Those elections were not the end of the work, though; they are only \nthe beginning of the work. The military still has a deep role in the \nConstitution. The National League for Democracy needs to transition \nfrom an opposition party to a governing party. Burma must address its \ninternal ethnic conflicts, and, like most countries, it needs to \naddress corruption and economic reforms as well. Our mission team in \nRangoon is working on all these matters and more. I know that\n\n[[Page S718]]\n\nAmbassador Marciel looks forward to leading that team and continuing to \nstrengthen the U.S.-Burma relationship.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Cotton in urging \nour colleagues to vote for the confirmation of Scot Marciel to be \nAmbassador to Burma for the reasons Senator Cotton pointed out.\n  There are exciting things happening in Burma. It is a country in \ntransition. We have seen some promise. There are still major challenges \nin that country. We clearly need a confirmed ambassador. It is \nimportant that the Senate act, and I am glad to see we will be acting \nin a few moments.\n  We couldn't have a more qualified person to take on the \nambassadorship of Burma than Scot Marciel. He currently serves as the \nPrincipal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific \nAffairs. I got to know him very well in that capacity in the last \nCongress when I chaired the subcommittee of the Senate Foreign \nRelations on East Asia and the Pacific. He is a career diplomat who has \ntaken on some of the most challenging positions in Foreign Service, \nincluding being the Chief of Mission in Indonesia. He has devoted his \nlife to these challenges. I know he will do an excellent job \nrepresenting U.S. interests in Burma.\n  I urge our colleagues to support the nomination.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the Marciel nomination?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to simply say to Chairman \nGrassley and the Judiciary Committee: Thank you for being willing this \nweek to have a markup and to legislate and report out a bill with \nregard to the prescription drug and heroin epidemic we now face around \nour country. The legislation is called the Comprehensive Addiction and \nRecovery Act, or CARA. It focuses on several areas. One is prevention \nand education to try to keep people from making the wrong decision and \ngoing down the road to addiction, but another is to encourage States \nand provide incentives to local governments and nonprofits to use \nevidence-based treatment and recovery that has been proven to work to \ntry to deal with this epidemic.\n  Today we have unfortunately higher levels of death from drug \noverdoses than we do any other accidental cause of death--more than car \naccidents, for instance. In my own home State of Ohio, this has been \ntrue for the last couple of years. We lost over 2,400 Ohioans last year \nto drug overdoses. Part of the legislation also addresses this issue \ndirectly by providing our law enforcement and other first responders--\nfirefighters, EMS--with Narcan, also known as naloxone, which is a \nmiracle drug to bring people back if they overdose.\n  Finally, the legislation helps to get prescription drugs out of the \nhands of the wrong people. There has been overprescribing over the \nyears, and so our legislation encourages getting these drugs off the \nbathroom shelves so they can't be used and having a drug-monitoring \nprogram to tell if someone has been prescribing these drugs. It would \nbe national in scope, so if someone can't get prescription drugs in one \nlocation, they don't go across the State line to get them somewhere \nelse. Sadly, these narcotic painkillers have caused a lot of the \nconcern out there because sometimes they are given appropriately--maybe \nfor pain--but they are overprescribed, and then someone uses them to \nthe point that they become addicted and later turn to heroin because \nheroin is so much less expensive.\n  This is an issue that affects the whole country. In my own State, it\n\n[[Page S719]]\n\nlooks as if the per capita use in the rural areas is higher than it is \nanywhere else, including the inner city or our suburban areas. But no \nZIP Code is immune from this; we are all affected by it. In Ohio, over \nthe last week, there have been two incidents where people have \noverdosed while behind the wheel. In one just a couple of days ago, \nsomeone overdosed on heroin while his kids were in the backseat, and he \nhad a bad crash. Luckily, the children were not injured badly. This \ncontinues to happen again and again. And of course much crime is being \ncommitted to pay for the habit.\n  This is an effort at the Federal Government level to work with State \nand local governments and with nonprofits to address this growing \nproblem, the epidemic of prescription drugs and heroin abuse.\n  I encourage the Judiciary Committee to move swiftly with this \nlegislation. There is a markup scheduled on Thursday so we can move \nthis legislation to the floor of the Senate, get it to the House, and \nget it to the President for his signature.\n  There seems to be not only bipartisan but nonpartisan support for \nthis legislation. In other words, this is not a political issue but \nsomething that affects us as fathers, mothers, brothers, and sons. I \nhope the Senate will take on this issue.\n  I was in Ohio yesterday meeting with some women who are recovering \naddicts, and they told me their stories. Many of them started on \nprescription drugs sometimes because of an accident. They talked to me \nabout how the grip of addiction is so great that it requires real \ncourage and real resilience to be able to come through it. We want \nthose women and others to be able to live out their God-given abilities \nand not to be afflicted by this addiction, which is really a disease. \nThis legislation we have before us is a step in the right direction.\n  I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it \nand to move it to the President so we can begin to help local \ncommunities, neighborhoods, and our States be able to address this \ngrowing problem.\n  I yield back my time, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/senate-section/article/S719-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S719-S721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PRESCRIPTION DRUG ADDICTION\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, first, I say to my colleague from Ohio--\nSenator Portman, who is a dear friend--that we all have it; you are \nright, it is nonpartisan. This has no home. This has affected every \nAmerican family one way or another. There is not a person I know in my \nState or in the good State of Ohio that doesn't have a family member--\nimmediate family, extended family--or close friend who hasn't been \naffected by legal prescription drug abuse. We are looking at a whole \ncultural change that needs to go on, and I am on the floor to share \nletters with you.\n  Senator Portman, I am sure you are getting the same letters. I would \nencourage all our colleagues to read just one letter a week from a \nfamily whose lives have been changed. They have lost a husband, they \nhave lost their childhood, or they have lost a dear family member. It \nhas destroyed their family life as they knew it. They can't get a job--\na first-time felony offense, and they are out of the workforce now.\n  If you talk to law enforcement, there is not a law enforcement agency \nin America today that will not tell you that 80 percent of their crimes \nare drug related. Theft, arson, robbery--whatever it may be, it is \naround drug abuse.\n  So I come to the floor to continue to share the story of millions of \nAmericans--most importantly, of some of my very dear West Virginia \nfamily members--who have had this.\n  I applaud the good Senator from Ohio. All of us are working. This \nwill go through a normal process, I hope. It will be an open amendment \nprocess, and we are all going to make a piece of legislation and maybe \nfor the first time start changing the culture in America, starting \nright here in Washington, DC, with the Food and Drug Administration. I \nwill talk about that too.\n  West Virginia has been hit the hardest per capita. Just this past \nyear, 600 West Virginians have died--in a State with less than 2 \nmillion people. The American people are drowning under the weight of \nprescription opioid abuse. Nationally, more than 51 people die every \nday--in my State, Oklahoma, Ohio, all across this great Nation.\n  The FDA must get serious about the dangers--we have been speaking \nabout this--of prescription drugs, and this will not be accomplished \nwithout a significant change in the culture. It starts with them.\n  Although the FDA announced that the agency will be taking steps in \nthe right direction to address these problems, it is not enough and \nmore needs to be done. Let me explain why. The FDA's No. 1 priority \nmust be public health and well-being--nothing else. Yet time and again \nthe FDA has stood in the way of efforts to address the opioid abuse \nepidemic and improve public health.\n  The FDA plays a critical role in the epidemic as the agency \noverseeing the approval. Let me make sure we understand. This starts \nwith a prescription. A legally licensed company makes medicine for pain \nreduction, if you will, pain suppressant, an opiate, and then they \nbring that to the FDA, and the FDA goes through a process of evaluating \nit to see if it should go on the market. They go through an \nevaluation--or their committee, basically an oversight committee--and \nthen they say this is a product that should be on the market or should \nnot. Many times the FDA has gone against the advice of their own \nadvisory committee.\n  These are things we have to protect the American public from. Why?\n  So last week they decided to slightly improve the agency's response \nto the opioid epidemic. I am pleased at this small step, but let me \ntell you about this small step. They said that now they are going to be \nserious about the dangers of prescription drugs, and they said they are \ngoing to finally start listening--mind you, listening--to the advice of \ntheir advisory committee. Oh, that is wonderful; they are going to \nlisten to them now. That means they haven't really been listening to \nthem up until now, but they are going to start now.\n  What they don't tell you is they are not going to be required to take \nthe recommendation of their experts. A perfect example is Zohydro. It \ntook us 3 years to get all opiates--Vicodin and Lortab, which are the \nmost prescribed pain relievers and pain pills in the country--3 years \nto get the FDA to change that from a schedule III to a schedule II, \neven after I went personally, when I was first in the Senate 5 years \nago, to the advisory committee and they voted overwhelmingly that, yes, \nthis should be a schedule II. Within the bureaucracy, the FDA took 3 \nyears. The day they did that and made that piece of legislation or that \nrule saying that now it will be schedule II, we saw the immediate \neffect. It took 1.1 billion--billion with a ``b''--pills off the \nmarket. Twenty-two percent of the amount of opioids on the market were \nreduced immediately within the first year. Within a week of their \nfinally agreeing to go from a schedule III to a schedule II, which \ncontrolled the prescriptions, they came out and approved Zohydro \nagainst the wishes of their advisory committee, 11 to 2. Now you tell \nme why that product came to market.\n  So I have legislation that says: Listen, when you are not going to \ntake their advice and you don't recommend or you don't basically agree \nwith your advisory committee, you have to come to the people's \nrepresentatives--that is us--and tell us why you think this addictive \ndrug needs to be on the market.\n  I believe we have to do things and take important steps. What we have \nbasically turned a blind eye to is unbelievable.\n  Let me explain what I think goes on and what goes on. This is of such \nan epidemic proportion that we are afraid to talk about it. If you have \na child in your family who is addicted, if your mother or father or \nmaybe you or your wife is addicted, you are afraid to talk about it. It \nis kind of a shame, so we kind of try to take care of it. Guess what. \nWe can't even find treatment centers to help people. And then you can't \nafford it if you can find it--most people in America--and most of the \ntimes you can't.\n  So there are two things that have to be done. First, and I am as \nguilty as anybody here--the last 20 years I thought: Boy, if you are \ngoing to use these drugs and abuse them, that is a crime. I am going to \nput you in jail. You are going to pay the fine for that, a penalty.\n\n[[Page S720]]\n\n  Well, guess what. It hasn't worked. They go in addicted and come out \naddicted. All we did by convicting them and putting them in jail is \ngive them a felony. Now they can't get a job. Now they are out of the \nworkforce. Next, they come out more addicted than when they went in.\n  As Americans, we must say: Listen, this is an illness, and an illness \nmust be treated. You can't just throw them in the jail and say out of \nsight, out of mind; it will take care of itself. So once we change \nthat--and we have enough courage here politically to do that--then we \nwill start moving in a cultural change that will basically be able to \ntake on this epidemic.\n  We are fighting on that. I continue to go into all of this, but I \nhave always come here and I have said: Listen, all of you in the State \nof West Virginia, please get on my Web site, manchin.senate.gov. It is \nvery simple. And all of us have our Senate Web sites. Share with me \nyour life-altering letter. Tell me what happened.\n  We have been getting them by the hundreds. They are coming from all \nover my State, and they are in every State. I am sure Oklahomans will \nsend the Presiding Officer theirs too.\n  I am going to read two stories. This brings to light everything we \nare talking about and why we must be successful in fighting this \nhorrific epidemic.\n  This is Kylie's story:\n\n       In 1994 my dad broke his shoulder.\n\n  We all have accidents in our families.\n\n       He had to have surgery. He was on prescription narcotics \n     from 1994-1996--\n\n  Now you tell me why he was allowed to be on them and why the doctor \nkept prescribing them for 2 years. That is the biggest problem--\n\n     he became addicted in those 2 years. After the doctor would \n     no longer prescribe--\n\n  Finally, maybe the doctor came to his senses--\n\n     him pain medication, he'd illegally purchase them off of the \n     street. His life literally revolved around his pain \n     medication. His pain medication money came before our bills.\n       There were a few times we could not have Christmas or \n     Easter because he used all of our money to purchase these \n     drugs. I have 2 sisters. Eventually, he started buying more \n     potent drugs when he couldn't find anyone to buy prescription \n     pain pills off of. Heroin, Cocaine, you name it, he'd buy it. \n     My mother eventually filed for a divorce and that made him so \n     much worse. He started using more and more.\n\n  He used more because of depression on top of that addiction.\n\n       On February 23, 2007, I stayed home from school, I was a \n     junior in High school in Clarksburg. I woke up at 10am, went \n     to check on my dad who had been having drug withdrawals, I \n     found him dead. He'd found drugs and overdosed while I was \n     asleep, leaving me there to find him. It's something I carry \n     with me everyday. I don't have many memories of my father \n     interacting with us kids as a father should. I only have the \n     bad memories of him going above and beyond for drugs. Even \n     back then, if the prescription drug problem wouldn't have \n     been so bad, I feel like he'd still be here today.\n       I remember exactly how he was laying when I found him. I \n     remember everything. It's my first thought in the mornings \n     and my last thought at night. It changed my life, taught me \n     alot of life lessons but it also left me with alot of \n     heartache.\n\n  And unanswered questions--as I told you, the rescheduling took 2 \nyears. Basically, you could get Vicodin and Lortab that were schedule \nIII at this time, and all you had to do was keep calling in. You never \nhad to see the doctor after the first visit. They can give them to you \n90 days at a time or even longer. They were like M's. So when we went \nfrom schedule III to schedule II, that knocked it down. It took at \nleast a billion that we know of off the market, and we are hoping maybe \neven more. So that is what happened.\n  This is Helen's story:\n\n       My husband and I were married for over 21 years. We had two \n     daughters together and I expected to grow old with him and \n     enjoy our grandchildren. He worked in a factory for over 18 \n     years. Part of his job was moving 55 gallon drums of \n     different types of fluids. He worked full time. Sometimes 6 \n     days a week.\n       He sprained his back and was prescribed pain medicine. The \n     doctor he was going to gave him the maximum amount--\n\n  At that time it would have been more than 90 days probably, and he \ndidn't have to go back because it felt so good--\n\n     allowed by law for about six years.\n       As time went on, he needed a higher dose for it to be \n     effective. Taking more caused him to run out before the next \n     refill. He started going through withdrawals. Instead of \n     going to the emergency room to get help, he took his life. \n     Now I have no husband, my children have no father and my \n     grandchildren do not have a grandpap.\n       The stigma surrounding all of this is what kept him from \n     getting the help he needed to get off those pills.\n\n  We have said it is a silent killer. They were afraid to talk about \nit. They couldn't go to anybody, didn't know where to turn, and didn't \nhave any types of treatment centers that would bring him off of that.\n\n       The Friday before he ended his life, I spoke with a doctor \n     and told him he needed to get off those pills and get dried \n     out. He didn't want to be admitted and they let him go.\n\n  They knew he was desperately hooked.\n\n       Why do pharmaceutical companies market drugs that cause \n     normal people to give up on their families and life? Why do \n     doctors allow their patients to take something so long and \n     build up such a tolerance for it? I will never find the \n     answers to these questions and it is too late for him now.\n       It sickens me to read of others going through this and \n     there just doesn't seem to be an end to it.\n\n  This is why I am standing here. I face it every day. I go home. There \nis not a person who doesn't come up to me knowing that basically their \nlives have been changed and knowing now that they can speak to \nsomebody. I am making it a point to give them the comfort of speaking \nto me. I protect their identity. I try to get them help.\n  There has to be a way. As my good friend from Ohio and the Presiding \nOfficer, my good friend from Oklahoma--this is not partisan. This \nshould not be bogged down because of who gets credit, who doesn't get \ncredit, or whose fault it is. We are all to blame, and we all can share \nin changing the culture of drugs in America--legal drugs.\n  Most drug addicts today--people who are addicted--will tell you if \nthey are on heroin or illicit, harder drugs, they started with legal \ndrugs that were in their prescription cabinet, in the medicine cabinet \nthat their mom had or that they had. This is what has to change. This \nis why--Dr. Robert Califf is being recommended by the President; he is \na good man with a stellar resume, a stellar performance, very \nhonorable. But the culture that he comes from is basically from a \nresearch institution and a research university that has been funded by \nthe pharmaceutical industry. That is just the way they say it is done. \nSo they are funding the clinical research, and then we are expecting \nMr. Califf to come into this industry, into the FDA, and make the \nwholesale changes.\n  I need--and I think we all need--for America to find somebody who has \ngone through a life-changing event and who has all of the experience \nand all of the education to be able to go into that agency and say: \nListen, we are not going to give you a prescription just as a frontline \nin the first line of defense because I know the chances of it changing \nyour life are greater than my helping you and giving you relief.\n  Until we have that and until that permeates clear down through, it \nwill not change. Tell me how the CDC--the Centers for Disease Control \nwithin the agency of DHHS--is able to start responsibly recommending \nguideline changes for how we are going to prescribe and how doctors \nshould be trained before they prescribe these life-altering \ndrugs. Then, within the FDA they are fighting against it, and they are \nwithin the same agency of the HHS. So it is deep-rooted, and it has to \nbe culturally changed from the top. It doesn't change from the bottom \nwithin.\n\n  So if this good man would withdraw his name and let us move on, I \nwould be tickled to death, because he is a good person and he can be \nvery helpful in his knowledge. But I don't think he can drive the \nchange that needs to be done for us to save the families and children \nand moms and dads across America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I would like to report some good \nnews about the work of the Senate that should be of interest to every \nsingle American family; that is, that we are moving ahead in the Senate \non a package of 50 bipartisan proposals that will help move medical \ndevices, medical cures, and medical drugs through the long, expensive, \nregulatory process and into medicine cabinets and doctors' offices, \nwhere they can help patients. We call this our Innovation Project. It \nis a companion to work that has been done in the House of \nRepresentatives already that they call their 21st Century Cures Act. It \nis also work that President Obama has talked about in important ways. \nThe reason that the House has already done its work, that the President \nhas talked about this in his State of the Union Address, and that we in \nour HELP Committee in the Senate have been working for a year to \ndevelop 50 bipartisan proposals that we hope to bring to the floor of \nthe Senate is because we have never had a more exciting time in \nbiomedical research in America than today. We are talking about \nactually curing some cancers, not just treating cancers. We are talking \nabout using 3-D printing to actually help replace knees.\n  I was in a medical device office in Memphis a few weeks ago, and that \ncompany told me that in one-third of the cases where it sells knee \nreplacement equipment, it also sells a tool to the doctor made with 3-D \nprinting so that if he or she--the doctor--is replacing the knee of the \nSenator from Oklahoma, the doctor uses this tool that is just made \nespecially for the knee of the Senator from Oklahoma and virtually \neliminates the possibility of a mistake by the doctor in that \nsurgery. The company told me it not only uses 3-D printing in one-third \nof the cases but that it could easily do it in all of the cases and \nexpects it will soon.\n\n  At our hearing about 3 weeks ago, I asked Janet Woodcock, the head of \nthe Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug \nAdministration, if there had ever been a case of a 3-D of printing of a \ndrug, and she said, yes, there had been one. They have used 3-D \nprinting to manufacture a medicine for epilepsy.\n  That is not all. Last year when the President announced his Precision \nMedicine Initiative, he introduced a young man whose cystic fibrosis \nhad been cured by a new medicine, which he takes every day. While that \nonly benefits some cystic fibrosis patients, the drugs that are used to \ncure that number of patients are the same kind of drugs they believe \neventually will cure every patient with cystic fibrosis.\n  On that day, the President announced what he calls his Precision \nMedicine Initiative and that he wanted to assemble 1 million human \ngenomes so that if my doctor is prescribing for me a medicine by \nknowing what my genome is and what that medicine has done in other \ngenomes, he can make a very specific sort of prescription, one that is \nmore likely to help me and less likely ever to hurt me.\n  I attended the President's ceremony. I told him afterward that we \nwould do our best to incorporate his Precision Medicine Initiative into \nour work in the Senate on our Biomedical Innovation Project.\n  The House was making good progress on its 21st Century Cures project. \nSo I told the President: Mr. President, I can't imagine why we can't \nget a result in this Congress.\n  Since that time, the President has announced a cancer task force that \nVice President Biden is leading to work to speed up treatments and \ncures for cancer. The House has passed its 21st Century Cures Act. In \nour committee in the Senate during the past year we have held 10 \nbipartisan hearings, including 6 on how to improve the electronic \nmedical records systems that hospitals and doctors are using. We have \nhad five bipartisan staff working groups that have met or held \nbriefings more than 100 times in the last year, and the result of their \nwork has been 50 bipartisan legislative proposals. As I said, every \nsingle one of those has support from Democrats as well as Republicans \non the committee.\n  Today in our committee we debated and approved the first 7 of these \nbills, which included 12 of the 50 bipartisan proposals I just \nmentioned. We had an open process. Any Senator who wished to could have \noffered an amendment. The bills have had so much work on them that \nthere weren't any amendments, but they were important pieces of work.\n  Our committee probably is the most diverse in the Senate. I know that \nis saying a lot, but if you look up and down the Democratic and \nRepublican aisle, we span the whole spectrum. Last year we worked \ntogether, despite our differences of opinion, and produced a bill to \nfix No Child Left Behind. A lot of people thought we couldn't do that. \nI expect the same sort of bipartisan effort led by Senator Murray, the \nsenior Democrat on her side, and me as chairman, to work well for us \nagain.\n  We have a second markup of legislation scheduled for March 9 and a \nthird for April 6. My expectation is that after we meet these 3 times \nand consider 50 legislative proposals, when we are finished it will all \nadd up to bipartisan companion legislation to the House's 21st Century \nCures legislation, and our legislation will include important elements \nof the President's Precision Medicine Initiative in his Cancer \nMoonshot.\n  The 21st Century Cures Act, the House bill, includes $9.3 billion in \nso-called mandatory funding over 5 years, mostly for the National \nInstitutes of Health. Several of President Obama's other proposals in \nhis new budget involve mandatory funding, and several Members of our \ncommittee have talked to me about mandatory funding for some of the \nwork we need to do.\n  Here is my view about mandatory funding: I don't want to get the cart \nbefore the horse. When I was Governor of Tennessee and we needed a new \nroad system, people would say to me: Are you going to raise the gas \ntax? I said we are not going to talk about the gas tax. There are lots \nof different ways to pay for the road. You can borrow the money. You \ncan use discretionary money. You can raise the fuel tax. You can build \na toll road. We are not going to talk about any of that. First, we are \ngoing to decide on what we want to do. What we decided to do was to \nhave three big road programs to attract the auto industry suppliers to \nTennessee, and it worked.\n  The decision we made after we decided what we wanted to do was in \nthat case to raise the fuel tax three times because we didn't want any \nroad debt. We have among the best roads in the country and zero road \ndebt, and we have the auto industry. That worked out pretty well for us \n30 years ago. I would like to apply the same sort of thinking here.\n  I don't want to talk about how we pay for something before I decide \nwhat the something is. Here is the something I am thinking about. I am \nthinking about something called the NIH--National Institutes of \nHealth--Innovation Projects Fund; five areas, in addition to the things \nwe normally fund and do that require extraordinary support, one-time \nsupport for ideas that have a start and a finish. In other words, they \nare not built into the budget for a long period of time.\n  The National Institutes of Health Director would have the authority \nto direct allocations of this fund to specific areas of importance. The \nfive areas of importance I have in mind are helping the President \nlaunch his Precision Medicine Initiative and an American Young \nInvestigators Corps.\n  We have heard from Dr. Collins, the head of NIH, and many others how \nimportant it is to have young investigators have enough money to give \nthem the money to do their research. The BRAIN Initiative, all of us \nare staggered by the prospect of the personal anguish that Alzheimer's \nand other brain diseases will cause individuals and their families, and \nwe are excited about the prospect of relieving that anguish. We know \nhow much this is going to cost us--in the tens and tens of billions of \ndollars. If we can find a way to develop new understandings of \nneurological disorders, which help discourage Alzheimer's disease or \nprevent it or deal with it, it saves money as well as saving anguish. A \nBig Biothink Award--Dr. Collins had suggested this in some of his \ntestimony. During this exciting time, let's let each of the 24 \nInstitutes that fund grant awards at\n\n[[Page S722]]\n\nthe National Institutes of Health issue a challenge and let them \nidentify the most promising big ideas in the country in their areas and \nfund it; for example, cancer, mental health. Let's see what comes out \nof this remarkable country of ours when we challenge them in that way. \nThen the Cancer Moonshot--now that the President and the Vice President \nare involved in this way, we want to make sure we do all we can to take \nadvantage of curing some cancers as well as treating some cancers. \nThere may be some aspects of that effort that have a start and a finish \nthat could be part of what I call NIH Innovation Projects Fund.\n  I go into some detail about my Innovation Projects Fund proposal \nbecause we may be able to fund these needs in the regular \nappropriations process, but I am willing to consider using mandatory \nfunding for these five areas because, No. 1, they have a start and a \nfinish. They help jump-start. They are limited. In that sense, they are \nnot subject to being appropriated forever, as appropriations often are. \nNo. 2, I believe we should reduce other mandatory funding in order to \nuse this mandatory funding. We should be about setting priorities in \nthe Senate. I cannot think of a more important priority than biomedical \nresearch.\n  I mentioned we have 50 legislative proposals for which we have \nbipartisan support, but we do not have bipartisan agreement in the \nSenate committee on how to deal with any of these items that are paid \nfor by mandatory funding, and neither do we have enough money within \nthe jurisdiction of our committee to deal with it. So we will deal with \nboth the Innovation Projects Fund and the mandatory funding--if that is \nwhat it turns out to be to pay for it--once the bill comes to the \nfloor.\n  We have to decide first what programs we want and then how to pay for \nthem. We should do that on the floor. We know we will have to have 60 \nvotes to do it in that way that includes mandatory funding. We had some \nexperience with that.\n  Last year we had some very difficult issues with the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. I had one of them that had to do with \nvouchers. That drives some people on the other side of the aisle up the \nwall. If I insisted on putting the scholarships for kids proposal that \nI had on the bill in the committee, the bill may never have gotten to \nthe floor. Senator Franken, on the other hand, had an important piece \nof legislation to him on discrimination, but if he had gotten that on \nthe bill in the committee, it would never have gotten to the floor. We \nagreed, since we needed 60 votes to get a result--and a result is what \nwe want and the American people expect us to get--that we would \nwithhold our controversial amendments until the floor and see if we \ncould develop bipartisan support on the floor to have at least 60 votes \nand get a result.\n  We followed, in our Education bill, the rule that the late Senator \nKennedy and Senator Enzi followed when they were the ranking members of \nthis committee, and that was let's find the 80 percent we agree on and \nwork on that first, and let's take the things we disagree on and do \nthose later, but most important, just as Senator Kennedy did with \nSenator Enzi, just as the full Senate did last year on fixing No Child \nLeft Behind, we kept in our mind getting a result.\n  I said on the floor many times last year that if all you want to do \nis make a speech or assert your point of view, you can stay home. You \ncan get your own radio program. You don't have to travel as much. There \nis no need for you to come to the U.S. Senate. You can have your say \nhere, but if you really want to do your job here, you can work with \nother people and see if we can get a result, especially when we are \ntalking about issues that affect every American family in such an \nimportant way.\n  I am determined to get a result. I am delighted I have the \nopportunity on this committee to work with the Senator from Washington, \nMrs. Patty Murray. She is a strong Democrat. She is the leader of the \nDemocratic caucus, but because of her leadership and her interest in \ngetting a result, we were able to succeed last year. I believe, working \nwith her and the other Members of our committee, we will be able to \nsucceed this year.\n  The House of Representatives has done its work. It has passed the \n21st Century Cures legislation. The President has made his proposals \nfor precision medicine and for a cancer moonshot. He talked to all of \nus during his State of the Union Address in the last two sessions. We \nhave worked for a year in our committee to produce 50 bipartisan \nlegislative proposals that should go through the committee and be ready \nin early April to come to the floor.\n  The majority leader, Senator McConnell, has said to me, and he has \nsaid to all of us, that even though this is a Presidential year and we \nhave less time here, he is still looking for important ideas that \nbenefit a large number of Americans that have bipartisan support and \nthat the President will sign into law. I can't think of a single piece \nof legislation that the Senate could consider this year that fits that \ndefinition better than our companion legislation to the House of \nRepresentatives' 21st-Century Cures legislation.\n\n  I wish to say a word about the legislation we passed today. As I \nmentioned, these were all bipartisan pieces of legislation. The first \none was introduced by Senator Bennet, Senator Warren, Senator Burr, and \nSenator Hatch. It had to do with rare diseases such as cystic fibrosis.\n  This is what Senator Susan Collins of Maine said about that piece of \nlegislation during the debate in our committee:\n\n       If you ask the parents of sons or daughters--primarily \n     sons--with muscular dystrophy who suffer from Duchenne's, a \n     very rare kind of muscular dystrophy, whether the bill we \n     just approved is important, believe me they will tell you \n     that it is.\n\n  We approved it unanimously, and it is ready for the Senate to \nconsider.\n  Senator Burr, a Republican, and Senator Franken, a Democrat, offered \nthe FDA Device Accountability Act of 2015. This legislation would help \nmove innovative medical devices ahead--such as artificial knees, \ninsulin pumps for people with diabetes, stents for people who have \nsuffered a heart attack--and new surgical tools that can get bogged \ndown in the FDA. In other words, we want to keep the safe and effective \ngold standard, but we want to get these devices through the system as \nrapidly as we can, at the lowest cost we can, so people can afford and \nuse them.\n  Senator Baldwin and Senator Collins--Democrat and Republican--offered \na bill called the Next Generation Researchers Act. We know that \nbiomedical research is our best weapon against diseases, illness, and \ndeath, and we can't afford to lose young scientists to other countries, \nso this bill helped to attract young scientists by promoting \nopportunities at the National Institutes of Health.\n  This is what Senator Collins had to say about that:\n\n       If you asked Dr. Francis Collins--the head of NIH--whether \n     the bill that Senator Baldwin and I have sponsored is \n     important to attracting and keeping young researchers, \n     believe me he would say yes.\n\n  Senator Kirk, a Republican, Senator Bennet, a Democrat, along with \nSenator Hatch, Senator Murkowski, Senator Isakson, and Senator Collins, \nintroduced another piece of legislation, S. 800. This bill will help \nmillions of Americans with disabilities, illnesses, and chronic \nconditions that require them to go to medical rehabilitation. Senator \nKirk, a stroke victim, spoke movingly about the importance of that \nbill.\n  This morning, Senator Collins said:\n\n       If you ask stroke victims whether the rehabilitation bill \n     that we passed is important, they would say yes.\n\n  There were four other bills we enacted. The one by Senator Isakson--\nwe didn't enact it--we approved it by committee. Senator Isakson and \nSenator Murphy had legislation on advancing research for neurological \ndiseases.\n  This is what Senator Collins said about that one:\n\n       If you asked families that are struggling with neurological \n     diseases such as Parkinson's, MS, or Alzheimer's, whether the \n     bill that is on the agenda today is important, they would say \n     yes.\n\n  Senator Murray offered the Preventing Superbugs and Protecting \nPatients Act, which is based on incidents that happened in her home \nState of Washington.\n  Finally, Senator Murray and I offered legislation to improve \nelectronic medical records. Our committee did not set out to deal with \nelectronic\n\n[[Page S723]]\n\nmedical records, but the more we got into our discussion----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 20 minutes of his time.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. We have used 20 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, sir. The Senator asked to be notified \nwhen he reached 20 minutes, and he has reached 20 minutes. The Senator \nstill has the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Presiding Officer very much. I will \ncomplete my remarks. I see the Senator from Florida is here.\n  Before I yield the floor, I wish to make a brief statement about the \nlegislation Senator Murray and I introduced. The electronic medical \nrecord system in this country is in a ditch. Doctors and hospitals that \nuse it have come to dread it.\n  The administration recognizes that there are problems. They haven't \ntaken all of my advice about what to do about it, but I do give them \ncredit. I thank Secretary Burwell, Dr. Karen DeSalvo, the National \nCoordinator for Health Information and Technology, and the head of CMS, \nAndy Slavitt, for working with our committee, Senator Murray and me, to \ntry to find ways to make the electronic medical record system something \nthat genuinely helps patients and that doctors look forward to instead \nof dreading. We have to do this because almost every advance we need to \nmake in biomedical innovation depends upon this. Certainly the \nPresident's Precision Medicine Initiative absolutely depends upon our \ngetting electronic medical records right. Perhaps the most important \npiece of legislation we approved today, among those seven pieces of \nlegislation, was doing what we could do in legislation to get the \nelectronic medical record system out of the ditch and onto a better \ntrack so that doctors use it rather than dread it. We are counting on \nthe administration to continue to work with us to finish that job.\n  I believe this is good news for the American people. It means we are \non a path, step by step, to do our part of the job.\n  There was some debate in our committee about whether the bills we \nwere passing were important.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks, Senator Collins' \ncomments, which remind us why each of the seven pieces of legislation \nis important, be printed in the Record.\n  There was some talk about the fact that we disagreed about the level \nof mandatory funding or whether to do it at all. We disagreed about \nthat. We don't have bipartisan consensus on it, but we do have \nbipartisan consensus on 50 legislative proposals that we need to move \nahead, and we will move ahead with them. Twelve of the 50 were done \ntoday, and the rest will be done in early March and early April.\n  My hope is that by early April, the Senate will be able to join the \nHouse of Representatives and President Obama and say: Here is our \ncontribution to the most important step we can take to make the quality \nof health better for virtually every American family by passing our \ncompanion legislation to 21st-century cures.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord, following my remarks, the summary of each of the seven bills \nour committee approved today.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Senator Collins Remarks at Innovation Mark-up\n\n       Before I turn to the bill that I am honored to cosponsor \n     with Senator Baldwin, which addresses a real problem of \n     keeping our young researchers at NIH, I do want to respond to \n     some of the earlier comments that have been made about the \n     approach we are taking today.\n       First--I want to commend the Chairman and the Ranking \n     Member for scheduling these important bills for markup by \n     this committee.\n       If you ask the parents of sons and daughters--primarily \n     sons--with muscular dystrophy who suffer from Duchenne's, a \n     very rare kind of muscular dystrophy, whether the bill that \n     we just approved is important, believe me they will tell you \n     that it is.\n       If you ask stroke victims whether the rehabilitation bill \n     that we passed is important, they would say yes. If you asked \n     families that are struggling with neurological diseases such \n     as Parkinson's, MS, or Alzheimer's, whether the bill that is \n     on the agenda today is important, they would say yes.\n       If you asked Dr. Francis Collins--the head of NIH--whether \n     the bill that Senator Baldwin and I have sponsored is \n     important to attracting and keeping young researchers, \n     believe me he would say yes.\n       And the fact is that this congress has come together and \n     approved a much needed $2 billion dollar funding increase for \n     NIH--that is the largest increase for NIH's budget since 2003 \n     we also approved, and I know this well because I was Chairman \n     of it as part of the bipartisan Alzheimer's task force--\n     nearly a 60% increase in Alzheimer's funding bringing us to \n     $936 million. Is it enough? Given that we spend billions \n     caring for people with Alzheimer's--no.\n       The National Advisory Council on Alzheimer's says we need \n     to spend $2 billion per year. But to imply that a 60% \n     increase in funding for Alzheimer's research is nothing; is \n     just not accurate. There is widespread bipartisan support for \n     biomedical research because there simply is no investment \n     that promises greater returns for Americans than that \n     investment.\n       It not only leads to discoveries and the developments of \n     effective new treatments for families who are coping with \n     these diseases but it also can have a dramatic impact on the \n     budgets of families, states and the federal government. I am \n     pleased with the progress we are making, I support the \n     approach that the chairman has taken and I believe that the \n     bills that we are considering at this markup and at the \n     upcoming March 9 markup are important bills that will make a \n     real difference to American families.\n\n     Innovation Bills Approved Today by the Senate Health Committee\n\n\n Sens. Bennet (D-Colo.), Warren (D-Mass.), Burr (R-N.C.), and Hatch (R-\n Utah)--The Advancing Targeted Therapies for Rare Diseases Act of 2015 \n                               (S. 2030)\n\n       Many rare diseases, like Cystic Fibrosis, have multiple \n     genetic mutations, making it difficult for researchers to \n     find enough patients with the same mutation for a clinical \n     trial. This bill will help expand the successful treatment of \n     people suffering from rare diseases like this.\n\n\n       Sens. Burr (R-N.C.) and Franken (D-Minn.)--The FDA Device \n                  Accountability Act of 2015 (S. 1622)\n\n       These innovative medical devices, items like artificial \n     knees, insulin pumps for people with diabetes, or stents for \n     people who have suffered a heart attack, or new surgical \n     tools to minimize scarring and reduce post-surgery \n     complications, can get bogged down at the FDA. This bill \n     reduces unnecessary regulations while maintaining the gold \n     standard of safety and efficacy to keep us safe.\n\n\n  Sens. Baldwin (D-Wisc.) and Collins (R-Maine)--The Next Generation \n                       Researchers Act (S. 2014)\n\n       Biomedical research is our best weapon against disease, \n     illness and death and we can't afford to lose young \n     scientists to other countries or professions because they're \n     frustrated by the lack of opportunity or funding--so this \n     bill helps attract talented young scientists by promoting \n     opportunities at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\n\n  Sens. Kirk (R-Ill.), Bennet (D-Colo.), Hatch (R-Utah), Murkowski (R-\n  Alaska), Isakson (R-Ga.), and Collins (R-Maine)--The Enhancing the \n Stature and Visibility of Medical Rehabilitation Research at NIH Act \n                                (S. 800)\n\n       This bill will help millions of Americans with \n     disabilities, illnesses and chronic conditions that require \n     them to go to medical rehabilitation and prevension. For \n     example, this is important to people who have suffered from \n     strokes, 800,000 happen every year in the U.S. according to \n     the Centers for Disease Control. This bill ensures that the \n     NIH is focusing on research into helping these people, and \n     others who suffer from debilitating illnesses each year.\n\n\nSens. Isakson (R-Ga.) and Murphy (D-Conn.)--The Advancing Research for \n               Neurological Diseases Act of 2015 (S. 849)\n\n       This bill will help people with neurological diseases like \n     Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis, and Alzheimer's by helping \n     to advance our understanding of these diseases and helping \n     researchers access data on these diseases in order to \n     discover new therapies and cures.\n\n\nSen. Murray (D-Wash.)--The Preventing Superbugs and Protecting Patients \n                             Act (S. 2503)\n\n       If you would ask patients and families or anyone who has \n     undergone a procedure in a hospital or outpatient facility \n     that involve reusable medical devices--and if you asked the \n     people of the states of Washington and Illinois--whether they \n     thought this legislation was important, they would say yes.\n       There was a tragic outbreak of antibiotic-resistant \n     infections linked to contaminated scope devices in Sen. \n     Murray's home state of Washington, where the devices were not \n     being properly disinfected between operations, and this bill \n     helps FDA in its work to ensure that reusable devices like \n     these are safe for patients.\n\n[[Page S724]]\n\n  \n\n\n\n Sens.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/senate-section/article/S724-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S724-S725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE PRESIDENT'S SPACE PROGRAM BUDGET\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about the \nPresident's proposal with regard to our space budget, the civilian \nspace program, and NASA. Of course we have many other space programs, \nprimarily national security, but now there is a commercial space \nprogram. We are seeing the burgeoning commercial space industry in the \nNASA budget. We are amazed by the rockets which can take the first \nstage--instead of throwing it away when it lands in the Atlantic Ocean \nafter a launch from Cape Canaveral--under powered flight, even without \nparachutes, can come back and land on a specific spot, just as SpaceX \ndid in its first stage in a launch about 2 months ago. We are seeing \ncommercial space.\n  The fact that these things we carry around in our pockets that we \nloosely refer to as phones that know exactly where we are at any time \nis as a result of a constellation of satellites up there called GPS \nthat triangulate and calculate exactly where we are. It is absolutely \namazing to me that my latest gadgetry acquisition--a Fitbit--can so \nsensitively understand what my heart rate is at any moment, can measure \ndistance, and gives me all kinds of information about the functioning \nof the human body.\n  Well, this didn't just accidentally appear. Where in the world did a \nlot of this come from? It came from the space program. I wish to talk \nabout that, but first I want to underscore something. Other than its \npioneering, for example, of increased investments in aeronautics, which \nis the first ``A'' in ``NASA''--the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration--there are other parts of the President's proposal that \nhave been left behind in the visionary appropriations bill we passed \nback in the middle of December which has sent us on a course that we \nare going to Mars. We are preparing to go to Mars, and that is a long \nway. In order to sustain human life and go all the way there--land, \nsurvive, reignite off the surface of Mars--and, by the way, I commend \nthe Matt Damon movie ``The Martian.'' The author of the book which the \nmovie came from actually consulted with a number of folks, including \none of my crewmates, on the propulsion, how to get to Mars a lot \nquicker. That propulsion uses magnets and plasma as its fuel and thrust \nto get us to Mars, and instead of the conventional 8 to 10 months, we \ncould get there in as little as 39 days. But those are to-be-developed \ntechnologies.\n  Let me mention a couple of things we are developing. Folks often \nargue about the NASA budget, which back in the lunar days the Apollo \nProgram was as much as 4 percent of the entire Federal budget. Now it \nis about one-half of 1 percent. In the process of divvying up the \ndollars out here, we pull and tug because people will ask: Why do we \nneed to go to Mars? Why do we need to go to an asteroid in preparation \nto go to Mars? Why do we need a space program when we have so many \nneeds here on Earth? That is a legitimate question. What is the \nlegitimate answer? Do you appreciate the fact that we have MRIs and CT \nscans? MRIs--magnetic resonance imaging--and CT scans--computer-aided \ntomography--technologies that are used routinely today to help us so \nmuch in a diagnosis of what is wrong or what is right in our own human \nbodies and is part of this medical miracle that we know as modern \nmedicine--they came straight out of the space program.\n  In the 1960s, NASA had to find a safe landing spot for the Apollo \nlunar lander amid all of that Moon surface and all of that dust. So \nwhat happened was the engineers at JPL out in California developed a \ndigital scanning process using high-frequency sound waves, magnets, and \ncomputers. In addition to making six successful Moon landings, this \ntechnology was tweaked, adapted, improved, and it led to CT scans and \nMRIs.\n  How about robots in the use of modern medicine? How about robots in \nthe use of the manufacturing process? Well, my colleagues will remember \nthe one thing on the space shuttle that had the name of another \ncountry; it was the Canadarm. It was the robotic arm that was birthed \nin the cargo bay of the space shuttle. It was used to deploy, maneuver, \nand capture payloads. It has now been the forerunner of the neuroArm, a \nsurgical device that has successfully performed dozens of tumor \nremovals by robotic surgery.\n  Now, any of the males around here over the age of 50 ought to be \nconcerned about prostate cancer. They have a robot named DA Vinci that \nis built in California, even though it is named after Leonardo da \nVinci, and this robotic device, with a small incision--six times--can \ngo in and, with some of this precise photography that was developed for \nthese cameras, robotically remove, in this case, the prostate cancer by \nremoving the prostate without damaging the nerves and without cutting \nthe human body open, which takes so much more time to heal, instead of \njust sticking six holes in. That came directly out of the space \nprogram. It is being used to develop an image-guided autonomous robot \nfor use in the early detection of breast cancer.\n  Let me give my colleagues another idea. When we get on a modern \nairliner today and we look out the window and we look at that swept-\nback wing, what do we see out there on the tip of the wing? The wing \ndoesn't just stop as it normally does; it curves up. This is called a \nwinglet. The winglets have these upturned features. They save billions \nof dollars in fuel costs.\n  Now, with NASA technology at the Langley Research Center and now the \ntests conducted at the Dryden Flight Center--now named, after the first \nastronaut on the moon, the Armstrong Flight Center--this winglet \ntechnology was released to Boeing, and it has saved the airline \nindustry more than 2 billion gallons of jet fuel, and it has saved more \nthan $4 billion in jet fuel costs and a reduction of almost 21.5 \nmillion tons of carbon dioxide emissions, just by the design of the \nwing. That technology came directly out of NASA.\n  Here is another example. All of this is coming back to this: Why go \nto space? Well, we go to space because our nature is that we are \nexplorers and adventurers. We go there because we haven't been there. \nWe go there to explore. Our nature is one of pioneers. The frontier is \nnow not westward, as it was in the beginning of this country, but \nupward. So that is certainly a reason to have the space program, but \nlet me tell my colleagues more of how it applies to our daily lives.\n  How about fortified baby formula? Early 1980s research on \nregenerative ecosystems led to a method of algae-based food supplements \nthat provide the long-chain polysaturated fatty acids that support \nbrain and eye development and function. So this led to a spinoff \nproduct called Formulaid, which was patented in 1996. It can now be \nfound in over 90 percent of infant formula sold in the United States as \nwell as those sold around the world.\n  I will give another example: image sensors--image sensors to enhance \ncell phone cameras. In the 1990s, a NASA team had been improving \ndigital image sensors in order to miniaturize cameras on spacecraft \nwhile maintaining the scientific image quality. So this was spun off \ninto commerce, and the company that commercialized the technology has \nshipped over 1 billion sensors for use in applications such as--now, \ndoes this sound familiar--digital cameras, camera phones, web cameras, \nautomotive cameras. They are even developing something where you will \nswallow a pill; only it is not a pill. It is an ingestible camera for \nimaging the patient's gastrointestinal tract.\n\n[[Page S725]]\n\n  Let me tell my colleagues about another one. I had a visit from \nTallahassee Community College today. They showed me what they could do \nwith a 3-D printer. I ask unanimous consent to show this in front of \nthe Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. We are doing this on the space station right now. We are \nputting together tools so that if we don't have a tool in space or if \nwe were on the long journey to Mars and we did not have a tool that we \nneeded to repair something, we could send the messages up to the \nspacecraft and 3-D print the tools that we need. So long-term space \nmissions like the one to Mars are going to benefit from this onboard \nmanufacturing capability.\n  Spare parts--what happens if we get up there and we don't have \nenough? Well, we can print it. Engineers are even experimenting with \ncreating a completely 3-D printed high-performance rocket engine. Can \nmy colleagues believe that? So that would advance manufacturing \ntechnologies that could benefit a number of us right here on the face \nof the Earth.\n  So the excitement of this--even though some would look at the \nPresident's request for NASA and see that it is $600 million over what \nhe requested last year, but it is actually almost flat-line to what we \nactually appropriated. Don't be discouraged by that because in this \nsense the excitement is gathering as we are about to launch humans--\nAmericans on American rockets. That is going to occur next year, as we \nsend crews to and from the International Space Station. As a result, we \ntherefore do not have to rely on the proven Russian Soyuz that gets our \ncrews to and from today. Now we will have the capability of not only \ntransporting cargo to and from but our American astronauts.\n  Even though the President's request falls short in some areas, I \nthink the President's request has been overcome with what we have done \nhere in the Congress, with a substantial increase in this current \nfiscal year over and above last year and with the excitement of human \nspace flight again within our grasp on American rockets, as well as \nthis excitement of defining, creating, and manufacturing new \ntechnologies for space flight that will benefit us here on the face of \nthe Earth.\n  If it sounds like I am a cheerleader, indeed I am a cheerleader. When \nI see the miracles of modern medicine, when I see the increased \ncapabilities of exploring the heavens and now almost back to the \noriginal light emitted from the big bang, and when we start to uncover \nthe new discoveries that expand our horizons, indeed, I am a \ncheerleader. For that, I am grateful.\n  I commend the Senate to keep this space program going at a fast pace \nas we increasingly get back into the total business, both manned and \nunmanned, of space exploration.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, over the course of the last year and a \nhalf, I have come down to the floor fairly regularly to tell some \nsimple stories about victims of gun violence all across the country. \nThe idea is that if the overwhelming data of those killed through gun \nviolence--31,000 a year; 2,600 a month; 86 a day--if these mind-numbing \nnumbers don't move this body to action, then maybe the voices of the \nvictims, the stories of the victims of gun violence may eventually thaw \nthe ice of this Congress and cause us to act in some way, shape or form \nto reduce this scourge of gun violence--whether it be tightening the \nNation's gun laws, which are the loosest in the world, whether it be to \npass mental health legislation that will address those who are \nwrestling with demons manifested eventually in gun homicides or whether \nit be giving more resources to gun enforcement to simply enforce the \nlaws on the books. We have done nothing. We have done nothing since the \nmurders of Sandy Hook, CT, to address this epidemic of gun violence. It \nis about time that we do.\n  On New Year's Eve, I spent most of that day tweeting out the 370-plus \ninstances of mass shootings over the course of 2015. Think about that \nfor a second. There were more mass shootings in 2015 then there were \ndays in the year. Just to be honest, I will tell you what I believe to \nbe a mass shooting. I am talking about a shooting in which there were \nmore than four people shot. If there were more than four people shot in \nyour neighborhood, that would probably be something you would be \ntalking about, that would probably rise to the level of being something \nserious enough to change behavior or to call for a change in policy. \nThere were 370 instances in 2015 where more than 4 people were shot at \none given time--more than one per day. So I tweeted out to every single \none of them on the day before the year turned to 2016 just to give \npeople a sense all in one place of how big this problem of mass \nshootings is. Of course, that is only the tip of the iceberg.\n  If on the average day there are 4, 5, 6 or 7 people being shot in \nepisodes of mass violence, there are another 80 that are killed through \nother episodes of gun violence. Many of those are suicides, but many of \nthose are just the day-to-day gun violence incidents that happen across \nthis country, most of which happen in our cities.\n  So I want to share a few of those stories here with you today.\n  A lot of attention gets paid to those who die in episodes of mass \nviolence. This is a binder that is basically full of the stories of the \nindividuals who were killed in mass shootings over the past couple of \nyears. This doesn't even begin to account for the individuals who are \nkilled every day on the streets of Chicago and New Haven and Los \nAngeles and New Orleans, people such as Jonathan Aranda, who was 19 \nyears old when he was killed just before Christmas of 2015. He was \nkilled in the morning hours of December 8. He had just graduated from \nEli Whitney Technical High School, which is located in Hamden, CT.\n  His cousin said:\n\n       He was getting out of work, stopped at a friend's house to \n     talk about cars and this senseless act of violence happened. \n     He was quick to lend a hand when you needed help without \n     asking for anything in return. He worked a third shift job to \n     come home, rest and help at home.\n\n  His younger sister, Genisis, said that her brother was ``a humble and \nloving person, he was a person who never picked fights. He was quick to \nlend a hand when you needed help without asking for anything in \nreturn.''\n  Jonathan's cousin Edgar said he was a ``very, very likeable kid. . . \n. He didn't have a problem with anybody.''\n  The community has been devastated by this loss. He was liked by \neverybody. He cared deeply for his family. Jonathan was 19 years old \nwhen he was killed after stopping at a friend's house--after getting \noff of work--to talk about cars.\n  Treesa Wiley was killed just a few days ago in Rockford, IL. She was \nfatally shot while she was visiting a friend in her home. An unknown \nperson forced entry into the home and shot Wiley and her friend. She \nlived paycheck to paycheck, but she was still immensely generous with \nher friends and family, showering them with love, attention, and gifts.\n  Her uncle said of Treesa:\n\n       She didn't have children herself, but every child that she \n     met was her child. That's why she enjoyed that work so much. \n     She enjoyed giving back to the community because it had given \n     her so much.''\n\n  Her friends described her as ``bubbly,'' ``angelic,'' and \n``lovable.'' Her favorite color was purple. Her favorite team was the \nGreen Bay Packers. She loved red lipstick. She had overcome a learning \ndisability to get a 2-year degree. She was killed while she was \nstudying to get her bachelor's degree.\n  A friend said:\n\n       She was the most loving and honest friend you could hope \n     for. . . . I can't think of one person who didn't like \n     Treesa.\n\n  Raven White was 16 years old when about a month ago she was killed in \nBirmingham, AL. She was fatally shot in her car in the early morning \nhours of January 8. It looks as if it was a robbery. She was a junior \nin high school, and she was 6 months pregnant.\n  Her mother said Raven was very outgoing.\n\n\n[[Page S726]]\n\n\n  \n\n       I know she loved school. Even after getting pregnant, she \n     made good grades and didn't miss a day of school.\n\n  She was planning to go back to the volleyball team that she played on \nafter giving birth. She had just gotten off work at Walmart hours \nbefore the shooting. ``All I want is to hold my grandbaby once, but I \ncan't,'' said Raven's mother, Tangee Dixon.\n  Miguel Arguelles was 22 when he was killed in Bridgeport, CT. He was \nshot in the neck and the shoulder during a shooting at the Charles F. \nGreene Homes housing complex. Police say he wasn't a target, but he was \nhit by stray bullets. He was 22 years old. At the hospital, Miguel's \nmother pounded his chest, urging him to come back to life, saying: \n``Mommy's here. C'mon, baby, c'mon, baby. Mommy's here.''\n  A veteran officer said the nurses were crying, the priest was crying, \nand even the police were crying while watching this.\n\n       It was one of the saddest things I've seen. You feel so \n     helpless.\n\n  His mother said he lit up the room when he walked in.\n\n       You saw his teeth every time he smiled--he brought a smile \n     to your face. . . . I just want to hug him. I just want to \n     tell him I love him.\n\n  ``He was my protector,'' said his sister. ``He loved to make people \nlaugh.''\n  Jabari Saunders was 30 when he was killed in December of 2015 in \nWilmington. He was shot on the very same street on which he used to \nwalk his children to school every morning. He was a devoted father of \nfour. His life revolved around his kids. The neighbors said the only \ntime they would see him is with his kids. He was always smiling. It is \nsad. You can't even let your kids walk to school--walk to afterschool \nstuff now.\n  When a neighbor's son was shot, irony of all ironies, the victim's \nmother recalls that Jabari visited her home every single day the week \nafter the shooting.\n\n       He just came to pay respect. . . . I know the love he \n     showed me when my son was killed.\n\n  Another neighbor said:\n\n       I can't say anything bad about him. He was just a nice guy.\n\n  That is 5 stories out of 2,600 a month. There is no antidote to this \nepidemic. There is no one law that we can pass that makes it all \nbetter, that makes this all go away. But that can't be the excuse. The \nexcuse cannot be that because there is no panacea legislatively, we \nshouldn't even try. The excuse can't be that because it is impossible \nto erase gun violence, we shouldn't take some commonsense steps to make \nit all better. The excuse also can't be that laws don't make a \ndifference, because they do.\n  I will leave you with this because my point really is to tell the \nstories of these victims, not to expound on the data, but the data is \npretty irrefutable. Here are all the States where background checks are \nrequired in order to buy a gun through a private gun sale. That is a \npurchase at a gun store or a purchase at a gun show. Here are all the \nStates with no additional background check laws besides the Federal \nfloor. The data is pretty irrefutable. On average, there is 1 \nadditional death per 100,000 in the States with no additional \nbackground check laws than there are in the States that have additional \nbackground check laws. It is a 30-some-odd percent increase for the \nStates that don't take extra steps to make sure criminals don't get \nguns.\n  So when people say that we shouldn't pass a background check law that \n90 percent of the American public support because it won't make a \ndifference, the data doesn't tell us that. The data actually tells us \nthat if we take steps to make sure criminals don't get guns, fewer \ncriminals will get guns and fewer people will be killed, because I will \nassure you that one of these five people whom I just listed was killed \nwith a gun that was purchased legally. It might have been purchased in \na gun show, put in the back of a van, and sold on the streets of \nWilmington, Bridgeport, or New Haven.\n  Laws won't save all 31,000 of these lives, but they certainly will \nsave a handful. And for the individuals, the nurses, the clergy, and \nthe police officers who witnessed Miguel Arguelles's mother pressing on \nhis heart trying to get him to come back to life--simply one less death \nwould make a debate on the Senate floor worth it.\n  I hope that we take some steps this year, perhaps, to pass a mental \nhealth reform bill. I hope we get to where 9 out of 10 of our \nconstituents are and pass legislation that keeps guns out of the hands \nof criminals. If we don't do it because of the statistics, maybe we \nwill do it because we will start to hear the real voices of these \nvictims.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, investigative author Jane Mayer has \nwritten an important piece of journalism--her new book, ``Dark \nMoney''--about the secret but massive influence-buying rightwing \nbillionaires led by the infamous Koch brothers. Jane Mayer's book \ncatalogs the rise and the expansion into a vast array of front groups \nof this operation and the role in it of two of America's more shameless \nvillains: Charles and David Koch. Some have called this beast they have \ncreated the Kochtopus because it has so many tentacles.\n  The Presiding Officer may be wondering why I am talking about secret \ninfluence-buying in my climate speech. The reason is that the story of \ndark money and the story of climate change denial are the same story--\ntwo sides of the same coin, as it were.\n  Two strategies of that Koch-led, influence-buying operation \nparticularly bear on climate change. Indeed, they are probably the \nmajor reason we don't have a comprehensive climate bill in Congress and \ninstead have this present little mouse of a bipartisan energy \nefficiency bill. ``Oh, there goes Whitehouse,'' I am sure some \nlisteners are saying, ``off his rocker, trying to connect the Koch \nbrothers to this climate change.'' Well, it is not just something I am \nsaying; it is what the Koch brothers' own operatives say when they are \ncrowing about their influence-buying success.\n  I will get to that later, but first the two strategies. One strategy \nis to mimic real science with phony science. Real science wants to find \nthe truth. This phony science has no interest whatsoever in the truth. \nIt wants to look like science, sure, but it is perfectly content to be \nwrong. There is an apparatus, a whole array of front groups through \nwhich this phony science is perpetrated. This machinery of phony \nscience has been wrong over and over. It was wrong about tobacco, wrong \nabout lead paint, wrong about ozone, wrong about mercury, and now it is \nwrong about climate change. They are the same organizations, the same \nstrategies, the same funding sources, even in some cases the same \npeople--always wrong. You would think that if they cared a hoot about \nright from wrong, they would change their methodology after such an \nunblemished record of being wrong every time. But they don't care. \nTruth is not their object; truth is actually their adversary.\n  This isn't science; it is public relations dressed up in a lab coat. \nIt masquerades as science. But, as a visiting university president from \nRhode Island recently said to me, ``it uses the language of science, \nbut its purpose is to undermine actual science.'' To pull off this \nmasquerade, you have to trick people. You have to do what Ms. Mayer \ndescribes a Koch brothers associate saying as this whole scheme was \nbeing developed. It is perhaps the most telling quote in her book. Here \nis what the man said. ``It would be necessary,'' he said, to ``use \nambiguous and misleading names, obscure the true agenda, and conceal \nthe means of control.''\n  The next quote in her book is this: ``This is the method that Charles \nKoch would soon practice in his charitable giving, and later in his \npolitical actions.''\n  Did he ever. Misleading names. How about the John Locke Foundation, \nthe Ethan Allen Institute. The pages listening will know these names \nfrom history: the James Madison Institute for Public Policy; the Thomas \nJefferson Institute; the Franklin Center for Government & Public \nIntegrity, with a little profile of old Ben Franklin on its letterhead; \nthe George C. Marshall Institute, named after the hero of World\n\n[[Page S727]]\n\nWar II and the European recovery that followed. None of them have a \nthing to do with their illustrious namesakes; they just took the famous \nnames to put on a veneer of legitimacy.\n  The George C. Marshall Institute--it sounds impressive. You might \nfool the occasional editorial page editor. Who does that? Maybe someone \ntrying to hide something, ``obscure the true agenda.''\n  Take the Mercatus Center, which the Washington Post described as a \n``staunchly anti-regulatory center funded largely by Koch Industries \nInc.'' In ``Dark Money,'' journalist Jane Mayer wrote that Clayton \nCoppin, a professor at George Mason who reviewed Bill Koch's political \nactivities, concluded Mercatus to be ``a lobbying group disguised as a \ndisinterested academic program.'' And conceal the means of control--a \nlarge portion of the funding behind this special interest apparatus is \nsimply not traceable. Why? Because money is funneled through \norganizations that exist to conceal donor identity. That is their \npurpose. The biggest identity-laundering shops are Donors Trust and \nDonors Capital Fund. Indeed, they are by far the biggest sources of \nfunding in the web of climate-change front groups that have been stood \nup.\n\n  Dr. Robert Brulle of Drexel University, who studies the network of \nfossil fuel-backed climate denial, reports the Donors Trust and Donors \nCapital Fund operations are the ``central component'' and ``predominant \nfunder'' of the denier apparatus; and at the same time he continues it \nis the ``black box that conceals the identity of contributors.''\n  Jane Mayer reports in her book: ``Between 1999 and 2015, Donors Trust \nredistributed some $750 million from the pooled contributions to myriad \nconservative causes under its own name.'' There were $750 million \nlaundered into anonymity with no telltale fossil fuel fingerprints.\n  This is no small operation. There are over 100 groups involved, all \nbeholden to the same master: the fossil fuel industry. Setting up or \nsupporting over 100 front groups may seem unduly complicated, but \nremember, an internal combustion engine has more than 500 parts, and we \nare totally comfortable with that mechanism.\n  According to the International Monetary Fund, this apparatus is \ndefending a $700 billion--billion with a ``b''--effective subsidy, just \nin the United States of America, every year. How much work would you \ndo--how much complication would you be willing to create--to defend \n$700 billion per year? To use Jane Mayer's telling phrase, this is a \nnew device. Put it all together and what do you have? ``The think tank \nas disguised political weapon.'' Who is behind this elaborate scheme? I \nwill quote from ``Dark Money.''\n\n       [T]he director of research at Greenpeace . . . spent months \n     trying to trace the funds flowing into a web of nonprofit \n     organizations and talking heads, all denying the reality of \n     global warming as if working from the same script. What he \n     discovered was that from 2005 to 2008, a single source, the \n     Koch [brother]s, poured almost $25 million into dozens of \n     different organizations fighting climate reform. The sum was \n     staggering. His research showed that Charles and David [Koch] \n     had outspent what was then the world's largest public oil \n     company, ExxonMobil, by a factor of three. In a 2010 report, \n     Greenpeace crowned Koch Industries, a company few had ever \n     heard of at the time, the ``kingpin of climate science \n     denial.''\n\n  By the way, I should say that ExxonMobil has been actively involved \nin this as well, as a lot of very good recent reporting has showed. But \nthey were outshone and outdone by the Koch brothers.\n  I will quote again from ``Dark Money.''\n\n       The first peer-reviewed academic study on the topic added \n     further detail. Robert Brulle, a Drexel University professor \n     of sociology and environmental science, discovered that \n     between 2003 and 2010 over half a billion dollars was spent \n     on what he described as a massive ``campaign to manipulate \n     and mislead the public about the threat posed by climate \n     change.'' The study examined the tax records of more than a \n     hundred nonprofit organizations engaged in challenging the \n     prevailing science on global warming. What it found was, in \n     essence, a corporate lobbying campaign disguised as a tax-\n     exempt, philanthropic endeavor. Some 140 conservative \n     foundations funded the campaign, Brulle found. During the \n     seven-year period he studied, these foundations distributed \n     $558 million in the form of 5,299 grants to ninety-one \n     different nonprofit organizations.\n\n  It is quite a ``Kochtopus.''\n\n       The money went to think tanks, advocacy groups, trade \n     associations, other foundations, and academic and legal \n     programs. Cumulatively, this private network waged a \n     permanent campaign to undermine Americans' faith in climate \n     science to defeat any effort to regulate carbon emissions.\n\n  The bottom line is if your faith in climate science is undermined, \nyou have been had by a well-funded, complex, sophisticated scheme of \ndisinformation.\n  Back to ``Dark Money'' again.\n\n       The cast of conservative organizations identified by Brulle \n     was familiar to anyone who had followed the funding of the \n     conservative movement. Among those he pinpointed as the \n     largest bankrollers of climate change denial were foundations \n     affiliated with the Koch and Scaife families, both of whose \n     fortunes derived partly from oil. Also heavily involved were \n     the Bradley Foundation and several others associated with \n     hugely wealthy families participating in the Koch donor \n     summits, such as the foundations run by the DeVos Family, Art \n     Pope, the retail magnate from North Carolina, and John \n     Templeton, Jr., a doctor and heir to the fortune of his \n     father John Templeton, Sr., an American mutual fund pioneer \n     who eventually renounced his U.S. citizenship in favor of \n     living in the Bahamas, reportedly saving $100 million on \n     taxes. Brulle found that as the money was dispersed, three-\n     quarters of the funds from these and other sources financing \n     what he called the ``climate change counter-movement'' were \n     untraceable.\n\n  Brulle's conclusion, as reported by Ms. Mayer, is this:\n\n       Powerful funders are supporting the campaign to deny \n     scientific findings about global warming and raise public \n     doubts about the roots and remedies of this massive global \n     threat. At the very least, American voters deserve to know \n     who is behind these efforts.\n\n  But it wasn't enough for the Koch brothers to have the paid-for, \nphony science masquerade. You also had to drive politicians to accept \nthe phony science. You had to make politicians willing to participate \nin the masquerade and put on the phony science costume. To do that, \nthey turned to the mother's milk of politics: money.\n  The money was set loose by five Republican justices on the Supreme \nCourt when they decided Citizens United. Citizens United is described \nin ``Dark Money'' as ``the polluters['] triumph.'' Mayer quotes a \ndefeated candidate the Kochs went after:\n\n       There was a huge change after Citizens United, when anyone \n     could spend any amount of money, without revealing who they \n     were, by hiding behind amorphous-named organizations, the \n     floodgates opened. The Supreme Court made a huge mistake. \n     There is no accountability. Zero.\n\n  The money got loaded into political organizations like Americans for \nProsperity, the leading Koch brothers-backed political front group. \nThey waved that money around like a club, touting how they were going \nto spend $750 million just in this 2016 election. They told Republicans \nthey would be so ``severely disadvantaged'' if they crossed them on \nclimate change that they would be in political peril. Do the math. How \nmuch more obvious could you get?\n  Here is how Jane Mayer quotes their own official crowing about their \nvictory. Remember what I said earlier? This is not me making wild \nallegations. This is them taking credit for what they did.\n\n       Tim Phillips gladly took credit for the dramatic spike in \n     expressed skepticism. ``If you look at where the situation \n     was three years ago and where it is today, there's been a \n     dramatic turnaround,'' he told the National Journal. . . .\n       We've made great headway. What it means for candidates on \n     the Republican side is ``if you . . . buy into green energy \n     or you play footsie on this issue, you do so at your \n     political peril. And that's our influence. Groups like \n     Americans for Prosperity have done it.''\n\n  That is what they say about what they are doing. And don't think we \ndon't see that effect in this Chamber. The Koch brothers have had their \nday, doing their dirty work in the dark. I will give them that. It has \nbeen quite a racket, but the truth will come out. It always does.\n  Jane Mayer is not alone. Academic researchers like Robert Brulle at \nDrexell, Riley Dunlap at Oklahoma State University, Justin Farrell at \nYale University, and Michael Mann at Penn State University are exposing \nthe precise dimensions and functions of this denial machine. \nInvestigative writers like Naomi Oreskes, Erik Conway, Naomi Klein, and \nSteve Coll are on the hunt. ``Merchants of Doubt'' is already a movie. \nJeff Nesbit's forthcoming book, ``Poison Tea,'' about how these big \nmoney boys suckered the tea\n\n[[Page S728]]\n\nparty down this road, should be illuminating. On the official side, two \nattorneys general appear to be looking into Exxon's role in this \nclimate denial scheme. In short, what could well be the biggest scam to \nhit politics since Teapot Dome and Watergate is being unraveled and \nexposed.\n  The dirty fossil fuel money has deliberately polluted our American \npolitics, just as their carbon emissions have polluted the atmosphere \nand oceans. Justice cannot come too soon for these people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I was in the cloakroom listening to my \ncolleague from Rhode Island talk about the issue he is clearly very \npassionate about relating to our climate and recognizing that in that \nspace, as we think about energy and our energy needs as a nation, our \neconomic security, our energy security, our national security, how that \nis all tangled and intertwined, I can't help but think we have \ncolleagues from very different perspectives who have stood on this \nfloor over the course of the past couple of weeks, and it seems that \none thing we have found some level of consensus on is that it is time \nto update our energy policies. It has been over 8 years now since we \nhave seen any energy policies that do anything to move us forward as a \nnation, that work to help us be more energy efficient, be more energy \nindependent, move toward a cleaner energy future, embrace the \ntechnologies we have available to us. There is a recognition we need to \nact together to update our energy policies.\n  I have come to the floor this evening to speak to where we are in \nthis process of successfully moving an energy modernization bill across \nthe floor of the Senate. We took this up some 2 weeks ago now. I wanted \nto comment on some of the comments that were actually made on the floor \nthis morning. There was a comment that was made that as Republicans we \nneed to ``get to yes'' on assistance for Flint.\n  I have stood on the floor and have made clear there is no doubt in my \nmind that Flint is the site of a tragedy that should have been, could \nhave been avoided. There is no doubt in my mind that Federal assistance \ncould be provided to help with the city's ongoing crisis, but there is \nalso no doubt in my mind but that this is something where we need to \nget to yes on a number to help Flint out. We need to get to yes, and we \nneed to figure out what that right amount is.\n  It sounds easy, and those of us who are committed to not only \naddressing the situation, the urgent situation we see in Flint, there \nis a recognition that there is a broader problem at play when we think \nabout our Nation's infrastructure and our water infrastructures. I \nwanted to take a few minutes this evening to speak to that and where we \nare in this process and why this ``getting to yes'' has perhaps been \nmore problematic than most had hoped.\n  I remind my colleagues that what we have been debating on the floor \nis an energy bill. It is a bill that was written by myself as the \nchairman of the Energy Committee, along with Senator Cantwell from \nWashington as my ranking member. It included the Presiding Officer as a \nmember of the committee, along with dozens of other members who serve \non the Energy Committee. It has been the result of more than a year of \nregular process, regular order, within the committee, where we worked \nto consider ideas from all over the board.\n  We undertook an effort that some would say you just don't see around \nhere anymore. We started with an agreement, an agreement between the \nchairman, myself, and the ranking member, and asked: Do we want to send \na message this year about what we need to do with energy and our energy \npolicies or do we want to bring about some change? Is it time to update \nour energy policies after 8 years?\n  The two of us agreed we wanted to make that change. We recognized \nthat in order to do that, in order to get it through the committee with \na good bipartisan vote, in order to get it to the floor, we were going \nto have to work together. We made that commitment, our staffs made that \ncommitment, and we not only said we were going to do it, we did it.\n  We started off with a series of oversight hearings that we had in \nWashington, DC, and around the country, bringing people in, soliciting \ntheir ideas. After the oversight hearings, we had six legislative \nhearings before the committee, going through a host of different \ninitiatives. There were 114 bills, separate bills--some from members of \nthe committee, some from Members who were not serving on the Energy \nCommittee but who had good ideas, and we reviewed them all, considered \nthem as part of the bill we were building, and then we had our markup. \nWe went into 3 days of markup before the Energy Committee. We \nconsidered over 50 different measures, 50 different measures from folks \nwithin the committee and outside the committee, Republicans and \nDemocrats, urban and rural.\n  In the committee process, it was full-on. It was an open exchange. It \nwas any good idea, any amendment that you have, if you think you have \nthe votes, let's run it. If you think you don't and you still want to \nrun it anyway, let's work it. We worked that committee process. We \nconsidered 59 amendments within the committee. It was a good process, \nand because it was good process and it was so inclusive, we got a bill \nthat moved out of the committee 18 to 4. The four dissenting votes were \ninteresting. We had two Republicans who dissented and two Democrats. \nEven the opposition was bipartisan.\n  I say this by laying the groundwork for what we have built because I \nwant colleagues to appreciate the substance of the measure we have \nbefore us with the Energy Policy Modernization Act. We then came to the \nfloor the first of the year, the first big bill to come to the floor \nand take up valuable floor time, and I am pleased we were able to come \nto the floor early. In the time that we have been to the floor, we have \ndispensed with 38 amendments. Most of those have gone by voice, not \nbecause it has been a take-this-or-leave-it approach. A voice vote \nmeans it comes by unanimous consent. You have to get consent to get \nthese before the body. We worked through a host of different issues, \nall over the board--whether it related to advanced nuclear or whether \nit related to coal research or whether it related to issues as they \nrelate to our public lands. We have been working this throughout this \nprocess.\n  In fact, I think it is important to recognize that even during this \ntime period where it has been quiet on the floor, we haven't heard \npeople talking much about where we are with the Energy bill. Our staffs \non the majority side and the minority side have been working together \nto clear even more amendments that have that support that we could move \nby voice, almost 30 additional amendments on top of what we have \nalready done.\n  We are not letting the moss collect and gather as we are trying to \ndeal with the situation that has detracted and distracted this Energy \nbill, and that is the nature of the Flint issue. I don't want people to \nthink the basis of the bill which brought us here, a bill that would \nmodernize our energy policies, a bill that would help America produce \nmore energy, a bill that would help Americans save money, a bill that \nwould help our Nation with our national security, our energy security, \nand our economic security, a bill that would help to cement our status \nas a global energy superpower--it is important we remember why we are \nhere.\n  Others are remembering that when we left the floor on Thursday with \nan indeterminate path forward into how we were going to advance the \nEnergy bill, those groups that have been interested in following this \ndebate come to us with concern saying: Wait. Don't stop that forward \nmovement. The Bipartisan Policy Center has sent out a letter urging us \nto move forward with this Energy Policy Modernization Act. ClearPath \nhas urged us: Please, this is important to us from a clean energy \nperspective. Bill Gates has put out a\n\n[[Page S729]]\n\nletter on his blog post urging us: Please don't forget that as we are \ntalking about how to resolve this situation for Flint, MI, that we \ndon't forget the importance of the underlying bill we are debating, \nwhich is the Energy Policy Modernization Act.\n  The progress we have made on this bill is critically important. \nAgain, we are working with the ranking member to keep plugging along on \nall of those issues we have outstanding. We believe we have a path \nforward for a bipartisan bill, a bill that so many Members of this body \nhave come to the floor and said that this is good, this is important, \nthis is something we need to do.\n  We are not going to forget that, but in the meantime, what we are \ndealing with is this plea for assistance, Federal assistance by the \npeople of Flint, MI. As I said last week, I don't fault that request. \nComing from a State like Alaska, which has considerable needs of its \nown when it comes to water infrastructure, in far too many of my \ncommunities it is not a situation of aging infrastructure. It is a \nsituation of no infrastructure, no clean water, no safe drinking water.\n  I understand, but I am increasingly frustrated by where we are now \nand how the decisions that have been made to date are effectively \nstopping all activity on an energy bill, even as it becomes perhaps \nincreasingly obvious or clear that the issue related to Flint, the \nurgency of Flint's situation--the bigger issue we see looming when it \ncomes to our Nation's water infrastructure, that is a problem that \ndemands a level of scrutiny and attention that we as a Congress should \ngive--but is the Energy Policy Modernization Act the right vehicle for \nwhat is being sought right now?\n  I want to make sure that not only colleagues know but people who have \nbeen following this issue know that we have been working in good faith \ntoward a solution that will help address the situation in Flint. Many \nof my Republican colleagues are working with the Senators from Michigan \nto try to find a good-faith solution. I have been engaged in this from \nthe very get-go. I have been working on this issue, as have many \nRepublican members.\n  We found some programs out there that make sense for providing \nassistance. The State revolving fund is one we have looked to and have, \nalong with our staffs, spent considerable hours debating the merits of \ndifferent approaches and drafting language for them in the hope of \nbeing able to resolve scoring issues and generally trying to seek a \npath forward.\n  While others were enjoying the Super Bowl on Sunday, my staff was \nnot. Actually, the Senator from Washington and I happened to be on the \nsame airplane when we were coming back from the west coast so we could \nbe here to work on this bill, and we missed the game as well. Our \nstaffs were going back and forth with CBO to determine if the solutions \nthat we had laid down were going to work. Were they going to meet the \nscoring issues? Were they going to avoid the blue slip issues? Was it \ngoing to be a viable path forward? We have been doing this since day \none.\n  I think it is important to outline these issues to people so that \nwhen someone suggests that somehow or other we just need to ``get to \nyes'' quickly, they know that there is a range of factors that have \ncomplicated our efforts. It doesn't help that the Energy bill that has \ndrawn widespread acclaim for having a very open process has to now try \nand deal with the situation in Flint, so there hasn't been an open \nprocess. In fact, there hasn't been a process. I think that is part of \nwhat is complicating this situation.\n  This is a big issue. There is an urgency to address Flint's \nsituation, which is maybe more specific, but again, this is bigger than \nFlint. We heard from colleagues on both sides of the aisle about the \nissues around their respective States and around our country which we \nare going to have to be dealing with.\n  We have an amazing, complete process with the Energy bill that we \nhave methodically and consistently--almost over the top--gone through a \nprocess, and now we have something that is kind of been airdropped in, \nto use an expression around here, that is not as easy as people would \nsuggest. It is not something where you can say: Just throw some money \nat it. We are not helped by attempts to federalize the process, \nregardless of the Federal Government's share of the responsibility in \nit. I believe there is a proportionate share where we have to be there \nto help.\n  We are not helped by the President's decision not to issue a disaster \ndeclaration but instead to grant a much more limited emergency \ndeclaration, and then we are not necessarily helped by the President's \nbudget that he laid down today. He didn't request funding for Flint in \nthis massive budget proposal. In fact, the level of funds that we have \nbeen looking at that could help Flint--the State revolving funds--have \nnot increased. What we have actually seen is a decrease in the Clean \nWater Fund. That is not going to help us because we recognize that we \nhave to address those issues as well. Also, we are not helped when they \nask for far more Federal dollars than the city of Flint may be capable \nof spending over the next year. We have been trying to identify and \ndiscern what would help.\n  I had a conversation with the Governor of Michigan to try to discern \nit. I have talked to the Senators from Michigan, and I have talked to \nthe House Members from Michigan. We have at least four Flint-related \namendments that are pending to the Energy bill from the Michigan \ndelegation alone, but again, in terms of the extent of the repairs that \nneed to be made, does it include all of the pipes in Flint? Are they \ntrying to get a corrosion control system in place? Is that it? Do we \nhave a final estimate for what those repairs will cost and the plan of \naction that will be required?\n  I appreciate the response of the Senator from Michigan when there was \na little bit of back and forth with the Senator from Texas, saying that \nin her bill there is a requirement to detail how the money will be \nspent. I truly appreciate that part of it. We are being put in a \nsituation where we are trying to define the right amount here, and it \nis important that we get that right. As important as it is for us to \nget to yes and figure out what we can do to help Flint in a way that is \nfair to Flint and fair overall, we have to get it right as well.\n  Again, I was reading some newsclips last night. The New York Times \nhad an article about how all around the country we are seeing other \nStates that are setting up an alarm in terms of situations within their \ncommunities--from Pennsylvania to Ohio to California--where there is a \nneed to not only improve the current infrastructure, but there are \nissues in these communities that have raised a level of concern that we \nshould all be concerned and care about. So how we approach this issue \nand how we make sure that--in an effort to kind of rush money out the \ndoor to Flint alone--we don't put ourselves in a place where we commit \nto a course of action where the Federal Government pays for all of the \ncosts for local water systems. We can't legislate crisis by crisis, \ncommunity by community, or pretend that the Federal Government is not \nalready $19 trillion in debt. We have to do right by this. We want to \naddress the urgency--I want to address the urgency--for the people in \nFlint, but I also want to make sure we do it right.\n  I think most Members recognize that our solution is going to have to \nbe national in scope because there are other communities in other \nStates that may also need help. Most Members know that our answers must \nbe responsible in light of our already difficult fiscal situation, and \nmost Members are at least willing to consider the legislation that \nprovides assistance so long as it doesn't violate our Senate rules, the \nConstitution, or add to the Federal deficit. Again, that is why we are \nkind of sitting here today, Tuesday evening.\n  There are a couple of plans that have been viewed as viable because \nthey meet that criteria. They meet the criteria in terms of not adding \nto the Federal deficit, not violating the rules of the Senate, and not \nviolating our Constitution, and it is interesting that both of those \nmeasures are actually measures that come from this side of the aisle.\n  I note that the majority leader is on the floor, and I will defer to \nhim at his convenience; otherwise, I will continue with my comments.\n  I laid down an offer last week. The offer would make $550 million \navailable, $50 million would be made available through State-revolving \ngrants.\n\n[[Page S730]]\n\nThis money could help the people of Flint and other communities that \nhave contaminated drinking water. It gives access to $500 million in \nloans. It is fully paid for. It is one of the few viable offsets that \nwe have found within the jurisdiction of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee where I am the chairman, and I think that is part \nof the issue that we need to be discussing here. It is so important to \nmake sure--as we look to these pay-fors--we can make an agreement on \nthe pay-fors, and I believe this one is viable because I believe it is \none we can agree on.\n  Last week I asked unanimous consent to have this amendment pending \nfor a vote, but that was rejected. The second proposal was one made by \nChairman Inhofe, who is the chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, which is the committee of jurisdiction, and last week \nhe also introduced an amendment that was fully paid for. He used funds \nthat are available from an all-but-dormant loan program at the \nDepartment of Energy which is used to subsidize the auto industry. We \ncan go back and forth about the merits of that fund, but the fact \nremains that it would have been a viable pay-for for the measure that \nSenator Inhofe laid down. It, too, was rejected even though it was \neffectively an offer to prioritize assistance for the families and the \nchildren in Flint over some of the major corporations, and we were told \nno. That is kind of where we are right now. If you want to know why the \nnegotiations aren't proceeding as quickly and as smoothly as they had \nhoped, I think that is one of the reasons we are where we are.\n  The fact is, many of us are willing and trying valiantly, and in many \ncases desperately, to get to yes, but we can't get to yes on just \nanything. We cannot accept something that is not paid for. Quite \nhonestly, we can't do something that would jeopardize and doom the \nunderlying Energy bill, and I think we can't get to yes on something \nthat provides more funding than could reasonably be used in the short \nterm or ignores the problems that we are facing in other parts of the \ncountry.\n  We have looked at how we can separate this and how we can work it out \nas a stand-alone measure. I think it needs to be made a priority. I \nthink Chairman Inhofe, who is on the EPW, has made it one, but I think \nit needs to be separate and apart from what we are doing on this \nbipartisan Energy bill which already includes priorities from over 62 \nMembers of the Senate.\n  I don't think it is too much to ask that our Energy bill be allowed \nto move forward in the meantime. If we had been able to move forward as \nwe had planned, we would have tucked this legislation away last \nThursday, and we would have had a full week to buckle down and figure \nout a path forward for Flint and for the Nation. Instead, here we are \non a Tuesday, we have a recess coming up at the end of the week, and we \nhaven't had an opportunity to approve these almost 30 amendments that \ncould go by voice. We are kind of at a stall spot.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a comment?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I will.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I just want to assure the chairman of \nthe Energy Committee that we are not giving up on this bill. It has too \nmuch support on a bipartisan basis for us to walk away from it, and I \nknow all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle appreciate the \nongoing efforts the Senator has made to deal with the other issue that \nhas arisen here, regrettably right when she was on the verge of \nachieving an agreement here. I know the Senator from Alaska will stick \nwith it, and I am behind this effort all the way.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I appreciate those comments, and I \nappreciate the support of the majority leader. I had an opportunity to \nspeak with the minority leader earlier today, and he reiterated the \npriority of this Energy bill. To my colleagues and those who have been \nurging us to carry on and continue, know that we are doing exactly that \nand that I remain committed to not only the Energy Policy Modernization \nAct, but I am committed to finding a path forward as we deal with the \nimportant issue that relates to Flint and also relates to the rest of \nthe Nation when it comes to the security and safety of our water \nsupply.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Politicians should certainly not \ntry to tax it.\n  Congress passed a temporary ban on Internet taxes back in 1998. It \nwas an important bipartisan win for the American people, but Congress \nhas never made that ban permanent. In fact, there have been eight \ndifferent short-term extensions of the Internet tax ban. It is time we \nmade it permanent. It is time we made it permanent.\n\n  The bipartisan Internet Tax Freedom Forever Act has 51 cosponsors. It \nwas introduced by the top Republican on the Commerce Committee and the \ntop Democrat on the Finance Committee. In my office we have received \nmany, many messages from Kentuckians who support this measure.\n  Here is what the bipartisan Internet Tax Freedom Forever Act would \ndo. It would ensure any existing Internet taxes are phased out \npermanently. It would ensure any new attempts to tax the Internet are \nprohibited permanently. It would ensure Americans' access to \ninformation and online communications remain open and free permanently.\n  The House already passed this kind of commonsense bipartisan \nlegislation to make the ban on Internet taxes permanent. It is time we \ndid it here in the Senate.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of \na great Wyoming citizen: Col. Raymond ``Ray'' Corbett Bishop, retired. \nCol. Bishop was an experienced leader who devoted his life to serving \nthe country and State he loved.\n  Ray grew up as part of a military family originally from Douglas, WY. \nHis formative years were spent in a number of States, including Hawaii \nand Utah. Though he traveled extensively with his parents, Loren and \nEleanor, and his two siblings, John and Helen, Ray's roots were firmly \nplanted on Wyoming soil. He returned to the State to attend college at \nthe University of Wyoming. In 1970, he graduated with his bachelor of \nscience degree in ecology and received his commission from the U.S. Air \nForce ROTC program. This distinct honor became the first in a long line \nof achievements earned while serving his country.\n  Ray had a successful career in the U.S. Air Force. He was driven and \nfocused and honorably served his country for over 25 years. He had a \ndistinct talent for flying. Throughout his service, Ray completed two \ncombat tours in Vietnam and logged over 4,100 hours of flight time \npiloting B-52 and C-7A aircraft. Ray continued his record of leadership \nwith a number of other assignments. He was commander at a number of \nbases, including 325th Bomb Squadron Commander at Fairchild Air Force \nBase, Operations Commander at Anderson Air Force Base, and Wing \nCommander at Castle Air Force Base. He was also a skilled educator, \nproviding training for T38 pilots and serving as the Strategic Air \nCommand Chair at the Air War College in Alabama.\n  Ray met each new assignment with enthusiasm and fortitude. He earned \nmany accolades during his years of service. In addition to the Air \nForce Commendation Medal, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross \nand numerous other Meritorious Service Medals. These accomplishments \nand his Active-Duty service highlight his extraordinary patriotism.\n  Following his military career, Ray continued his service in the \naviation industry as the director of airports for Kern County, \nCalifornia. He served in this position until 2006, when Wyoming \nwelcomed his return. Settling in Jackson, he became the director of the \nJackson Hole Airport. He successfully rose to the challenge of \ndirecting the only commercial airport located in a national park. In \nthe years he served as director, Ray brought the airport to new heights \nof success. Under his guidance, the airport experienced over \n$80,000,000 in capital improvements, including a complete renovation \nand expansion of the main terminal.\n  Safety was Ray's first priority, and the runway was improved with \nseveral safety features that many larger airports have yet to \nimplement. During his tenure, the airport received both airline and FAA \naccolades and national recognition for the terminal updates. Ray loved \nGrand Teton National Park, and he was proud of the strong working \nrelationship between the park and the airport's board members that made \nthe airport renovations possible.\n  Ray retired in late 2014 and decided to remain in the area so that he \ncould continue to enjoy the scenic beauty of the Jackson Hole area. \nAccording to friends, Ray was most at peace when he was in his boat on \nJackson Lake. In addition, he was a seasoned triathlete and had been \ntraining to run in an international marathon.\n  Ray is survived by his wife, Debbie, and his children, Brian and \nKristina Bishop, Abbey and Mike Donley, and Clark and Christine Bishop. \nHe loved his grandchildren, Megan Bishop, Elise Bishop, and William \nDonley; his sister, Helen Thompson, and her husband, Fred.\n  Wyoming flies a little higher because of Ray Bishop's service. We \nthank Ray for his service to our Nation and Wyoming. We will miss him, \nbut we are confident that his legacy lives on and can be seen by all \nwho visit the Jackson Hole Airport.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/senate-section/article/S731-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S731-S732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING CLAYTON JAMES\n\n Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, today I wish to remember the life \nof a great Wyoming citizen, Clayton James. A longtime Jackson Hole \nresident, Clay was well-loved by all in the community. I am honored to \nrecognize Clay's lifetime of accomplishments.\n  Born in St. Louis, Clay first felt the call of the West in college. \nHe attended Arizona State University, eventually graduating with a \nbachelor of science degree in business. He held several jobs during the \nacademic year, but his summers were reserved for the great beauty of \nGrand Teton National Park. It was here that he first began working for \nthe Grand Teton Lodge Company. During this time, he learned to \nappreciate the natural beauty of the park, while also gaining firsthand \nexperience in the hospitality industry.\n  This experience proved useful upon his graduation. He returned to the \nGrand Teton Lodge Company as a full-time employee. The company was part \nof the Rockefeller RockResort Company, owned by Laurance Rockefeller. \nClay's career in the resort management and development sector was \nlargely the result of his relationship with Rockefeller. Shortly after \nbeing hired, he was selected to open a new Rockefeller resort in the \nBritish Virgin Islands; thus began a nearly 20-year career of opening, \noperating, and managing resorts and hotels.\n  Clay was an outstanding representative for Wyoming's tourism \nindustry. In working with the RockResort Company, Clay travelled \nextensively, opening resorts across the United States. During one such \nassignment in Hawaii, he met his future wife, Shay. They were married \nin 1966. And although they traveled frequently, often with family in \ntow, Clay never lost his love for the Teton Mountain Range. In 1984, \nthey settled in Jackson Hole permanently, and he again returned to the \nGrand Teton Lodge Company as the general manager. His love for the \nresort and his staff was truly remarkable. When he retired in 2006, \nClay was\n\n[[Page S732]]\n\nthe well-admired president of the company.\n  Clay was deeply passionate about conservation. He believed that it \nwas possible to preserve the diverse ecosystem in Grand Teton National \nPark while also welcoming the millions of visitors who came to enjoy \nits splendors each year. This guiding principle led to his involvement \nin the transfer of the historic JY Ranch to the National Park Service. \nOwned by the Rockefeller Estate, the JY Ranch was a parcel of about \n33,000 acres that was originally purchased by John Rockefeller, Jr., in \nthe early 20th century. In 2007, Laurance Rockefeller asked Clay to \nmanage this important transition. The project was completed in 2008, \nand the Laurance S. Rockefeller Preserve was opened in Grand Teton \nNational Park for the public to enjoy. Clay was especially proud of \nthis achievement because it brought so many of his passions together.\n  Clay's extensive background in hotel management, as well as his \nexperience as a concessionaire in Grand Teton National Park, was \nespecially useful during his service on the Jackson Hole Airport's \nboard of directors. This experience, coupled with his unique \nperspective, made Clay an effective liaison between the National Park \nService and the Jackson Hole Airport. He was instrumental in the design \nand construction of the airport's terminal renovation and expansion \nproject. With Clay's advocacy, the airport was able to complete all \nrenovations while working with the Park Service to maintain the \nenvironmental integrity of Grand Teton National Park.\n  Clay's penchant for giving back to the community was incredible. He \ndevoted his free time to serving on several local and State boards and \ncommittees, each as different as his wide range of interests. He was a \nproud member of the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve and also served in the \nArmy National Guard. He always strove to improve the quality of life \nfor his family, friends, and the community of Jackson, and his impact \nwill be felt for years to come.\n  Clay is survived by his wife of 49 years, Shay Orlin James, and his \nchildren and their spouses, Scott and Jennifer James and McKenzie and \nRobert Hammond. He loved his grandchildren Emma and Cole James and \nRigdon and Riley Hammond. He also is survived by his brothers and their \nspouses, several nieces and nephews, and many close family friends.\n  It is an honor to celebrate Clay James and his extraordinary legacy \nof community service. He was kind, personable, and a natural leader. I \nknow that the community of Jackson shines brighter because of his \nspecial contributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/senate-section/article/S732-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING A. DAVID HAMILL\n\n Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the life \nof Ranson Mayor A. David Hamill, who recently passed away at the age of \n71. I first met Dave following my election to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives in 2000, and I came to know him as a passionate \nadvocate for the city of Ranson. We began working together very early \nin my House tenure, revitalizing Ranson through Federal Brownfields \ninitiatives.\n  With his height, his booming voice, and his mischievous sense of \nhumor, he certainly cut an impressive figure. And while he was in many \nways a larger-than-life persona, his greatest strength was his \nwillingness to listen. He tried to genuinely understand the needs of \nhis constituents and the people with whom he worked. Indeed, his \nhumility was evident in an excerpt from the open letter he wrote to the \ncity last month, sharing his worsening prognosis. He wrote, ``I have \ntried to do what is best for the City of Ranson--sometimes my result \nmay not have been successful as I planned, but it was not for my lack \nof passion or desire to do the right thing.''\n  Born in Kitchener, Ontario, Dave met his wife, Helen, while working \nin Macon, GA. Although they married in Canada, Dave would always submit \njob applications to local employers when he and Helen would return to \nher hometown of Ranson, WV. They would return to Ranson for good in \n1979 when Dave was hired at Abex, in nearby Winchester, VA. Dave rose \nto become a certified purchasing manager and negotiated purchasing \ncontracts for the company's eight factories in its North American \ndivision. When Dave became a U.S. citizen, he almost immediately began \nhis public service career. Beginning with the planning commission, Dave \nsoon became a member of Ranson's city council. In 1987, he was \nappointed mayor and was subsequently reelected seven consecutive times, \nmost recently in 2013.\n  Dave will be celebrated for his many accomplishments as mayor, \nincluding his work with the Brownfields initiative, the redevelopment \nsurrounding the American Public University System campus, Ranson's \nannexations for future growth, the city's streetscape projects, \nRanson's youth football field, and the Fairfax Boulevard extension \nproject. The list could certainly go on, but to highlight only the \naccomplishments of the man would be to overshadow Dave's spirit and his \ndedication to the city he served.\n  In addition to his wife, Helen, Dave is survived by his three \nchildren: Cindy, Melissa, and James; and nine grandchildren. In \naddition to his public service, Dave was also very active in the United \nMethodist Church, where he was a lay speaker and lay member to the \nMethodist Annual Conference.\n  I will miss Mayor Dave Hamill, as will all who knew him. I am honored \nto have worked with this talented individual and am proud to have \ncalled Dave my friend for more than 15 years. Today I ask my colleagues \nto join me in honoring the memory of ``Ranson's Champion.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/senate-section/article/S732-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/senate-section/article/S732-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S732-S734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   BUDGET OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017--PM 41\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with accompanying \nreports and papers; which was referred jointly, pursuant to the order \nof January 30, 1975 as modified by the order of April 11, 1986; to the \nCommittees on the Budget; and Appropriations:\n\n                  The Budget Message of the President\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As I look back on the past seven years, I am inspired by America's \nprogress--and I am more determined than ever to keep our country moving \nforward. When I took office, our Nation was in the midst of the worst \nrecession since the Great Depression. The economy was shedding 800,000 \njobs a month. The auto industry was on the brink of collapse and our \nmanufacturing sector was in decline. Many families were struggling to \npay their bills and make ends meet. Millions more saw their savings \nevaporate, even as retirement neared.\n  But thanks to the grit and determination of the American people, we \nrescued our economy from the depths of the recession, revitalized our \nauto industry, and laid down new rules to safeguard our economy from \nrecklessness on Wall Street. We made the largest investment in clean \nenergy in our history, and made health care reform a reality. And \ntoday, our economy is the strongest, most durable on Earth.\n  Our businesses have created more than 14 million jobs over 70 months, \nthe longest streak of job growth on record. We have cut our \nunemployment rate in half. Our manufacturing sector has added nearly \n900,000 jobs in the last six years--and our auto industry just had its \nbest year of sales ever. We are less reliant on foreign oil than at any \npoint in the previous four decades. Nearly 18 million people have \ngained health coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), cutting the \nuninsured rate to a record low. Our children are graduating from high \nschool at the highest rate ever. And we managed to accomplish all of \nthis while dramatically cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters \nand setting our Nation on a more sustainable fiscal path. Together, we \nhave brought America back.\n  Yet while it is important to take stock of our progress, this Budget \nis\n\n[[Page S733]]\n\nnot about looking back at the road we have traveled. It is about \nlooking forward. It is about making sure our economy works for \neverybody, not just those at the top. It is about choosing investments \nthat not only make us stronger today, but also reflect the kind of \ncountry we aspire to be--the kind of country we want to pass on to our \nchildren and grandchildren. It is about answering the big questions \nthat will define America and the world in the 21st Century.\n  My Budget makes critical investments while adhering to the bipartisan \nbudget agreement I signed into law last fall, and it lifts \nsequestration in future years so that we continue to invest in our \neconomic future and our national security. It also drives down deficits \nand maintains our fiscal progress through smart savings from health \ncare, immigration, and tax reforms. And, it focuses on meeting our \ngreatest challenges not only for the year ahead, but for decades to \ncome.\n  First, by accelerating the pace of American innovation, we can create \njobs and build the economy of the future while tackling our greatest \nchallenges, including addressing climate change and finding new \ntreatments--and cures--for devastating diseases.\n  The challenge of climate change will define the contours of this \ncentury more dramatically than any other. Last year was the hottest on \nrecord, surpassing the record set just a year before. Climate change is \nalready causing damage, including longer, more severe droughts and \ndangerous floods, disruptions to our food and water supply, and threats \nto our health, our economy, and our security.\n  We have made great strides to foster a robust clean energy industry \nand move our economy away from energy sources that fuel climate change. \nIn communities across the Nation, wind power is now cheaper than \ndirtier, conventional power, and solar power is saving Americans tens \nof millions of dollars a year on their energy bills. The solar industry \nemploys more workers than the coal industry--in jobs that pay better \nthan average.\n  Despite these advances, we can and must do more. Rather than \nshrinking from the challenge, America must foster the spirit of \ninnovation to create jobs, build a climate-smart economy of the future, \nand protect the only planet we have. To speed our transition to an \naffordable, reliable, clean energy system, my Budget funds Mission \nInnovation, our landmark commitment to double clean energy research and \ndevelopment funding. It also calls for a 21st century Clean \nTransportation initiative that would help to put hundreds of thousands \nof Americans to work modernizing our infrastructure to ease congestion \nand make it easier for businesses to bring goods to market through new \ntechnologies such as autonomous vehicles and high-speed rail, funded \nthrough a fee paid by oil companies. It proposes to modernize our \nbusiness tax system to promote innovation and job creation. It invests \nin strategies to make our communities more resilient to floods, \nwildfires, and other effects of climate change. And, it protects and \nmodernizes our water supply and preserves our natural landscapes. These \ninvestments, coupled with those in other cutting-edge technology \nsectors ranging from manufacturing to space exploration, will drive new \njobs, new industries, and a new understanding of the world around us.\n  Just as a commitment to innovation can accelerate our efforts to \nprotect our planet and create a sustainable economy, it can also drive \ncritical medical breakthroughs. The Budget supports a new ``moonshot'' \nto finally cure cancer, an effort that will be led by the Vice \nPresident and will channel resources, technology, and our collective \nknowledge to save lives and end this deadly disease. It also supports \nthe Precision Medicine Initiative to accelerate the development of \ncustomized treatments that take into account a patient's genes, \nenvironment, and lifestyle, as well as the BRAIN Initiative, which will \ndramatically increase our understanding of how the brain works.\n  Second, we must work to deliver a fair shot at opportunity for all, \nboth because this reflects American values and because, in the 21st \nCentury global economy, our competitiveness depends on tapping the full \npotential of every American. Even as we have rebounded from the worst \neconomic crisis of our lifetimes, too many families struggle to reach \nthe middle class and stay there, and too many kids face obstacles on \nthe path to success.\n  Real opportunity begins with education. My Budget supports the \nambitious goal that all children should have access to high-quality \npreschool, including kids from low-income families who too often enter \nkindergarten already behind. It also supports States and cities as they \nimplement a new education law that will place all students on a path to \ngraduate prepared for college and successful careers. The bipartisan \nEvery Student Succeeds Act sets high standards for our schools and \nstudents, ensures that States are held accountable for the success of \nall students, including those in the lowest performing schools, spurs \ninnovation in education, helps schools recruit and support great \nteachers, and encourages States to reduce unnecessary testing. And \nbecause jobs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics are \nprojected to grow faster than other jobs in the years ahead, the Budget \nmakes critical investments in math and science. Through a new Computer \nScience for All initiative, the Budget will expand the teaching and \nlearning of these important concepts across America's schools, better \npreparing our Nation's students for today's innovation economy.\n\n  Higher education is the clearest path to the middle class. By 2020, \ntwo-thirds of jobs will require some education beyond high school. For \nour students and for our economy, we must make a quality college \neducation affordable for every American. To support that goal, the \nBudget strengthens Pell Grants to help families pay for college by \nincreasing the scholarships available to students who take enough \ncourses to stay on track for on-time graduation, allowing students \nmaking progress toward their degrees to get support for summer classes, \nand providing scholarships to help incarcerated Americans turn their \nlives around, get jobs, and support their families. It also offers two \nyears of free community college to every responsible student and \nstrengthens the American Opportunity Tax Credit.\n  In addition to preparing students for careers, we must help workers \ngain the skills they need to fill jobs in growing industries. My Budget \nbuilds on the progress we have made to improve the Nation's job \ntraining programs through implementation of the bipartisan Workforce \nInnovation and Opportunity Act. It funds innovative strategies to train \nmore workers and young people for 21st Century jobs. And it doubles \ndown on apprenticeships--a proven pathway to the middle class--and \nsupports a robust set of protections for the health, safety, wages, \nworking conditions, and retirement security of working Americans.\n  Even as we invest in better skills and education for our workforce, \nwe must respond to dramatic changes in our economy and our workforce: \nmore automation; increased global competition; corporations less rooted \nin their communities; frequent job changes throughout a worker's \ncareer; and a growing gap between the wealthiest and everyone else. \nThese trends squeeze workers, even when they have jobs, even when the \neconomy is growing. They make it harder to start a career, a family, a \nbusiness, or retirement.\n  To address these changes and give Americans more economic security, \nwe need to update several key benefit structures to make sure that \nworkers can balance work and family, save for retirement, and get back \non their feet if they lose a job. The Budget supports these priorities \nby funding high-quality child care, encouraging State paid leave \npolicies, extending employer-based retirement plans to part-time \nworkers, putting us on a path to more portable benefit models, and \nproviding a new tax credit for two-earner families. It also modernizes \nthe unemployment insurance system, so that more unemployed workers \nreceive the unemployment benefits they need and an opportunity to \nretrain for their next job. And, if that new job does not pay as much \ninitially, it offers a system of wage insurance to encourage workers to \nrejoin the workforce and help them pay their bills. The Budget includes \ntax cuts for middle-class and working families that will make paychecks \ngo further in meeting the costs of child care,\n\n[[Page S734]]\n\neducation, and saving for retirement. It builds upon the demonstrated \nsuccess of the Earned Income Tax Credit by expanding it for workers \nwithout children and non-custodial parents.\n  Providing opportunity to all Americans means tackling poverty. Too \nmany Americans live in communities with under-performing schools and \nfew jobs. We know from groundbreaking new research that growing up in \nthese communities can put lifelong limits on a child's opportunities. \nOver the past few years, we have made progress in supporting families \nthat were falling behind. For example, working family tax credits keep \nmore than 9 million people--including 5 million children--out of \npoverty each year, and the ACA provides access to quality, affordable \nhealth care to millions. Nevertheless, we need to do more to ensure \nthat a child's zip code does not determine his or her destiny. \nImproving the opportunity and economic security of poor children and \nfamilies is both a moral and an economic imperative.\n  The Budget funds innovative strategies to support this goal, \nincluding helping families move to safer neighborhoods with better \nschools and more jobs, revitalizing distressed communities to create \nmore neighborhoods of opportunity, preventing families experiencing a \nfinancial crisis from becoming homeless, and ensuring that children \nhave enough to eat when school is out for the summer. It also supports \nefforts to break the cycle of poverty and incarceration through \ncriminal justice reform.\n  Finally, as we work to build a brighter future at home, we must also \nstrengthen our national security and global leadership. The United \nStates of America is the most powerful nation on Earth, blessed with \nthe finest fighting force in the history of the world.\n  Still, this is a dangerous time. We face many threats, including the \nthreat of terrorist attacks and violent extremism in many forms. My \nhighest priority is keeping the American people safe and going after \nterrorist networks. That is why my Budget increases support for our \ncomprehensive strategy to destroy the Islamic State of Iraq and the \nLevant (ISIL), in partnership with more than 60 other countries, by \neliminating its leadership, cutting off its financing, disrupting its \nplots, stopping the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamping out its \nvicious ideology. If the Congress is serious about winning this war and \nwants to send a message to the troops and the world, it should \nspecifically authorize the use of military force against ISIL.\n  The Budget also sustains and builds the strength of our unmatched \nmilitary forces, making the investments and reforms that will maintain \nour Nation's superiority and ensure our advantage over any potential \nadversary. It also makes investments to ensure that our men and women \nin uniform, who sacrifice so much to defend our Nation and keep us \nsafe, get the support they have earned to succeed and thrive when they \nreturn home.\n  Cybersecurity is one of our most important national security \nchallenges. As our economy becomes increasingly digital, more sensitive \ninformation is vulnerable to malicious cyber activity. This challenge \nrequires bold, aggressive action. My Budget significantly increases our \ninvestment in cybersecurity through a Cybersecurity National Action \nPlan This Plan includes retiring outdated Federal information \ntechnology (IT) systems that were designed in a different age and \nincreasingly are vulnerable to attack, reforming the way that the \nFederal Government manages and responds to cyber threats, and \nrecruiting the best cyber talent. It will also help strengthen \ncybersecurity in the private sector and the digital ecosystem as a \nwhole, enhancing cyber education and making sure companies and \nconsumers have the tools they need to protect themselves. But many of \nour challenges in cybersecurity require bold, long-term commitments to \nchange the way we operate in an increasingly digital world. That is \nwhy, to complement these steps, I am also creating a commission of \nexperts to make recommendations for enhancing cybersecurity awareness \nand protections inside and outside of Government, protecting privacy \nand empowering Americans to take better control of their digital \nsecurity.\n  To ensure security at home, we must also demonstrate leadership \naround the world. Strong leadership means not only a wise application \nof military power, but also rallying other nations behind causes that \nare right. It means viewing our diplomacy and development efforts \naround the world as an essential instrument of our national security \nstrategy, and mobilizing the private sector and other donors alongside \nour foreign assistance to help achieve our global development and \nclimate priorities. The Budget supports this vision with funding for \neffective global health programs to fight HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other \nillnesses; assistance for displaced persons and refugees, including \nfrom Syria; and expanding educational opportunities for girls, among \nmany other critical development initiatives.\n  As we make these investments to meet our greatest challenges, we are \nalso working to build a 21st Century Government that delivers for the \nAmerican people. The Budget supports efforts to make the Federal \nGovernment more efficient and effective, through smarter IT delivery \nand procurement, improving digital services, eliminating outdated \nregulations, and recruiting and retaining the best talent. It also \ninvests in a new approach to working in local communities, one that \ndisrupts an outdated, top-down approach, and makes our efforts more \nresponsive to the ideas and concerns of local citizens. The Budget \nsupports the use of data and evidence to drive policymaking, so the \nFederal Government can do more of what works and stop doing what does \nnot.\n  The Budget is a roadmap to a future that embodies America's values \nand aspirations: a future of opportunity and security for all of our \nfamilies; a rising standard of living; and a sustainable, peaceful \nplanet for our kids. This future is within our reach. But just as it \ntook the collective efforts of the American people to rise from the \nrecession and rebuild an even stronger economy, so will it take all of \nus working together to meet the challenges that lie ahead.\n  It will not be easy. But I have never been more optimistic about \nAmerica's future than I am today. Over the past seven years, I have \nseen the strength, resilience, and commitment of the American people. I \nknow that when we are united in the face of challenges, our Nation \nemerges stronger and better than before. I know that when we work \ntogether, there are no limits to what we can achieve.

A bill to require the Bureau of Justice Statistics to report \non recidivism rates of Federal prisoners who are released early, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, today I wish to discuss the Sentencing \nReform and Corrections Act that has been voted out of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  There is much debate about the wisdom of this bill. That is, like \nmost bills we discuss in this Chamber, a judgment call. But there \ncannot be debate over the facts of this bill. We have to be very clear \non what this bill, by its own text, is designed to do.\n  Proponents of the bill often invoke four phrases to describe the \nfelons to be released under the terms of the bill: ``first-time,'' \n``nonviolent,'' ``low-level,'' ``drug possession'' offenders. Yet none \nof these four terms is accurate.\n  By its text, the bill will apply sentence reductions not to first-\ntime offenders but to repeat offenders--some many times over. These are \nfelons who have made the conscious choice to commit crimes over and \nover.\n  By its text, the bill will not just apply to so-called ``nonviolent \noffenders'' but to thousands of violent felons and armed career \ncriminals who have used firearms in the course of their drug felonies \nor crimes of violence.\n  By its text, the bill will reduce sentences not for those convicted \nof simple possession but for major drug traffickers--ones who deal in \nhundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of heroin and thousands of \npounds of marijuana. And let's be clear. Drug trafficking is not \nnonviolent, as the bill's proponents often claim. It is built on an \nentire edifice of violence, stretching from the narcoterrorists of \nSouth America to the drug-deal enforcers on our city streets. If you \nthink dealing drugs on a street corner while armed with a gun is a \nnonviolent offense, you probably live in a rich suburb or a gated \ncommunity.\n  By its text, this bill will apply to felons convicted as juveniles of \nmurder, rape, assault, and other crimes for which they were justly \ntried as adults.\n  By its text, this bill will apply to repeat felons whose past crimes \ninclude kidnapping, carjacking, armed robbery, and other violent \ncrimes.\n  By its text, this bill will make eligible for early release into \nAmerica's communities thousands of drug traffickers and other violent \nfelons. And when we catch such criminals going forward, we will not be \nable to keep them locked up for the same sentences.\n  It has been reported that the bill's sponsors are preparing to \nrelease a revised bill, one that would address some of the many \nshortcomings. Regarding this news, I thank the sponsors for \nacknowledging that the bill as passed by committee does, in fact, apply \nto serious drug traffickers and other violent felons. I look forward to \nevaluating the new legislative text, and I hope it addresses these \nproblems. Until then, though, we can only examine more closely the bill \nas passed by the committee and its consequences.\n  Make no mistake, the consequences of this bill are all too \npredictable. Sadly, more than half of released prisoners are rearrested \nwithin 1 year, and 77 percent are rearrested within 5 years. We can be \nsure, then, that we will see more crimes committed by those who might \nbe released early--thanks to this bill. That is indisputable. Those new \ncrimes will wreak havoc on the citizens, families, and communities in \neach of our States.\n  This risk is not hypothetical. Sterile statistics do not adequately \nconvey the severity of the threat of mass recidivism. Last month in \nColumbus, OH, a man named Wendell Callahan brutally killed his ex-\ngirlfriend and her two young daughters. In what was described as a \n``stabbing rampage,'' Callahan murdered Erveena Hammonds, her 10-year-\nold daughter Anaesia, and Anaesia's little sister, 7-year-old Breya.\n  These murders were an atrocity, and they were completely avoidable. \nWendell Callahan walked out of Federal prison in August 2014, but his \noriginal sentence should have kept him in jail until 2018. If he had \nbeen in jail instead of on the streets, a young family would still be \nalive today.\n  Callahan walked out of jail early because the U.S. Sentencing \nCommission reduced sentences retroactively for hardened violent \ncriminals like him. The Commission first reduced sentencing guidelines \nin 2007. It did so again in 2010 and again in 2014. That is three major \nsystemic sentencing reductions in the span of a mere 7 years. The \nresult is that 46,000 Federal convicts will walk from jail early. \nWendell Callahan was one among that 46,000. There will be many more \nlike him. While we pray against all odds that none of them go on to \ncommit a triple-murder like Wendell Callahan did--or any other heinous \ncrime--I am afraid our prayers will go unanswered, at least in part.\n  The U.S. Sentencing Commission is an independent judicial agency that \nprovides uniform sentencing guidelines to judges. Congress didn't have \na hand in those sentencing reductions, but with the Sentencing Reform \nand Corrections Act, the Senate would impose a fourth major sentencing \nreduction within 8 years--one that is deeper and broader than the \nreductions imposed by the U.S. Sentencing Commission.\n  This is badly misguided. The Senate would be launching a massive \nsocial experiment in criminal leniency without knowing the full \nconsequences of the first three reductions imposed by the Sentencing \nCommissions. This experiment threatens to undo the historic drops in \ncrime that we have seen over the last 25 years.\n  That drop in crime rate was no accident. It was the result of higher \nmandatory minimums put in place in the 1980s, coupled with vigilant \npolicing strategies pioneered by scholars like Jim Wilson and practiced \nby elected leaders like Rudy Giuliani and other American mayors and law \nenforcement officials. The combination of mandatory minimums and \ninnovative policing is not a haphazard anticrime strategy. It is one \nthat was reached through tough trial-and-error performed at local, \nState, and, eventually, the Federal levels. It is one that arose from \nadvocacy that originated in the communities and cities that were \nhardest hit by the drug trade. It is one that has a proven record of \nsuccess, not in terms of crime rates but in terms of lives saved, \nfamilies protected, and communities healed.\n  The connection between higher mandatory minimums and lower crime is \noften lost on those unfamiliar with this history or blinded by \nideology. For example, in 1997 the New York Times reported: ``Crime \nKeeps On Falling, but Prisons Keep On Filling.'' One year later, in \n1998, the Times added: ``Prison Population Growing Although Crime Rate \nDrops.'' In 2004 the Times reiterated yet again, just for good measure: \n``Despite Drop In Crime, An Increase In Inmates.'' You can't make this \nstuff up, yet it is real and appears to be all too soon forgotten.\n  Like most conservative achievements, the reduction in crime over the \npast generation is built on the hard lessons of experience. We should \nnot lightly abandon the criminal justice wisdom accumulated over \ndecades to the passing fashions of current thinking. We\n\n[[Page S740]]\n\nshould not blithely move from a proven strategy of accountability and \nvigilance to an experimental theory of leniency. We should not trade \naway concrete, hard-won gains when the results may be devastating to \nAmerican communities.\n  The Senate and the American people need to consider any change to our \nsentencing laws with full information. We need to know if this \nsentencing leniency bill will return us closer to the days of the 1970s \nand 1980s, when our cities were besieged by the drug trade and whole \ncommunities were being rotted out as a result. We need to debate \nsentencing changes with all the data available to us, and we need to do \nthis with eyes wide open.\n  That is why today, together with Senators Hatch, Sessions, and \nPerdue, I am introducing the Criminal Consequences of Early Release \nAct. This is a simple but very needed bill. It will require the Federal \nGovernment to report on the recidivism rates of the 46,000 Federal \ninmates to be released early under the Sentencing Commission's \nreductions, and it will require the same reporting for any prisoners \nreleased early under any future reductions mandated by Congress.\n  The report required by this bill will make clear how many crimes are \nbeing committed by released felons who would otherwise still be in \nprison. It will make clear what types of crimes--from drug trafficking \nto assault to robbery to murder--are being committed by these felons. \nIt will make clear in which States these crimes are occurring.\n  Currently this type of data is extremely hard to compile. It is not \nreported by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, and any information we do \nhave comes mostly through anecdotes and sporadic media reports. Full \ninformation on the criminal consequences of early release must be \npublished in detail. Before voting on any bill to reduce sentences, \nSenators need to understand fully the criminal consequences of prior \nsentence reductions.\n  To hold Senators accountable for their votes, the American people \nneed to understand how their communities are being affected. When the \nFederal Government decides to release thousands of violent criminals \nonto the streets, no legislator or official should be able to plead \nignorance. If people are being killed, drugs trafficked, property \nstolen, and children kidnapped by felons who should have been in prison \nbut instead are out on the streets, then the people in our States and \ncommunities deserve to know that.\n  I want to be clear. To those who support the Sentencing Reform \nCorrections Act, we are not in full disagreement. Like you, I oppose \njail for first-time drug users with no prior record. It is vanishingly \nrare for such offenders to be prosecuted and jailed in the Federal \nsystem, of course, but it remains true that the better option for \nthem--particularly if they are addicts--would be drug treatment. Like \nyou, I believe that our prisons should not be an anarchic jungle that \nis a danger to both prisoners and corrections officers. Like you, I \nbelieve that those prisoners who will someday complete their sentences \nand reenter society should be given a chance to rehabilitate and redeem \nthemselves while in prison so they do not commit additional new crimes \nonce they are out of prison. Like you, I do believe there exists a \npossibility of a manifestly unjust sentence.\n  So I suggest: Let's work on that bill. Let's work on a bill that \nidentifies and addresses all first-time drug possession inmates in the \nFederal system but keeps drug traffickers and other violent offenders \nin prison to finish their sentences. Let's improve prison conditions \nand give prisoners a shot at redemption and a better life while \nprotecting our communities. If you wish, let's work on a bill to speed \nthe consideration of commutation and pardon applications because, if \nyou want to undo manifestly unjust sentences, we can help the President \nuse his constitutional power of pardon and commutation as a precise \nscalpel to identify and remedy those very rare cases of manifestly \nunjust sentences. What we should not do is use the blunt instrument of \nreleasing thousands of violent felons and major drug traffickers back \nonto our streets early.\n  The President has a constitutional power to remedy unjust sentences, \nbut you know what power he doesn't have? The power to bring back to \nlife the victims who are murdered by prisoners released early or \nsentenced inadequately.\n  In the discussion about the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, \nthere is much talk about legacy, and, in particular, a legacy of \nPresident Obama after he leaves office. If considerations of legacy \nshould factor into the debate, I would close with this observation. \nLegacies are not necessarily positive. They can be negative and deeply \ntragic. If supporters of this bill and President Obama are wrong, if \nthis grand experiment in criminal leniency goes awry, how many lives \nwill be ruined and how many dead? How much of the anticrime progress of \nthe last generation will be wiped away for the next?\n  Those are the questions we must ask as we consider this bill. If we \nask them honestly, soberly, and with full information, we will \ninvariably be led to one conclusion: We should not grant early release \nto thousands of drug traffickers and other violent criminals nor should \nwe shorten their sentences in the future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Perdue):\n  S. 2519. A bill to provide for incentives to encourage health \ninsurance coverage, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it has been more than 5 years since \nObamaCare was signed into law. Since then, the American people have \nonly seen higher health care costs, less access, decreased quality of \ncare, and fewer choices.\n  Every day I hear from Arizonans who have been forced to give up the \nhealth insurance plans they liked and now face skyrocketing monthly \npremiums and never-ending wait times for appointments. Moreover, I have \nspoken with small business owners across my State who have been forced \nto choose between complying with costly government mandates, laying off \nemployees or, worse, closing their doors.\n  For 5 long years, the American people have been unfairly burdened by \nthis failed law, and the negative effects are only expected to grow. \nAccording to the Department of Health and Human Service's own data, 24 \ninsurance plans in the ObamaCare exchanges were expected to see double-\ndigit rate hikes in 2016, while residents of Phoenix, AZ, were expected \nto see their premiums increase by roughly 19 percent. The highest \naverage premium increase in Arizona was projected to reach a whopping \n78 percent.\n\n  ObamaCare's numerous failures are well established. Take, for \nexample, the President's broken promise that Americans who liked their \nhealth care plans and doctors could keep them; skyrocketing premiums \nand deductibles; 21 tax increases that both the CBO and the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation predict would be passed on to the consumer; over \n$1 billion wasted on failed ObamaCare-established health care co-ops; \nand an estimated 2 million full-time equivalent workers expected to \nlose their jobs by 2024, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n  For these reasons, a majority of Americans today oppose the \nPresident's failed health care law. They are counting on us, their \nelected representatives in Congress, to fight to fully repeal and \nreplace it. That is why I was proud to partner with my Republican \ncolleagues in sending the first ObamaCare repeal to the President's \ndesk. That is also why I am proud to stand before the Congress today to \nreintroduce the Empowering Patients First Act along with my friend, the \nSenator from Georgia, Mr. Perdue, to replace the President's failed law \nwith health care reform that puts patients and physicians back in \ncharge of their health care decisions. The Empowering Patients First \nAct is companion legislation to a bill introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Congressman Tom Price that would fully repeal the \nAffordable Care Act and replace it with solutions that put patients, \nfamilies, and doctors back in charge of their medical decisions--not \nWashington bureaucrats.\n  It is past time for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to \nwake up to the reality that ObamaCare is the wrong solution to health \ncare reform. Just consider a recent report by the Galen Institute which \nnotes that since the President's health care law was\n\n[[Page S741]]\n\npassed in 2010, it has undergone 70 significant changes through either \nacts of Congress, administrative actions, or the U.S. Supreme Court. \nLet me repeat that. ObamaCare has been changed a total of 70 times--in \nmany cases through unilateral action--in order to protect the American \npeople from its damaging effects.\n  I am as convinced today as I was 7 years ago when I stood on this \nfloor to propose the first Republican amendment to ObamaCare that this \nlaw is the wrong approach to health care reform.\n  The bill I am reintroducing today would create policies that empower \npatients and doctors to take charge of their health care decisions, \nincluding by ensuring no one is priced out of the market, including \nindividuals with preexisting conditions; building on and expanding \nhealth savings accounts and other models to drive down costs; \nestablishing age-adjusted tax credits for health insurance; equalizing \ntax treatment of employer-sponsored plans and plans purchased by \nindividuals by letting individuals buy health insurance with pretax \ndollars; enhancing coverage options by letting small business owners \nband together across State lines through association health plans to \ncreate more affordable and comprehensive health care; letting consumers \nbuy insurance across State lines; curbing defensive medicine and \nlawsuit abuse through tort reform; and making coverage more affordable \nby enabling individuals to own their insurance, like a 401(k) plan, so \nthey can take it with them across State lines and if they change jobs. \nThat only makes sense.\n  Americans deserve an alternative to the mandates, high costs, and \nbureaucratic mess that have been created by ObamaCare. The Empowering \nPatients First Act would repeal ObamaCare once and for all and replace \nit with health care reform that gives patients, families, and doctors \nthe power to make medical decisions--not bureaucrats in Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/senate-section/article/S741-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 367--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF CAREER AND \n                       TECHNICAL EDUCATION MONTH\n\n  Mr. KAINE (for himself, Mr. Portman, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Isakson, Mr. \nWarner, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Franken, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. \nEnzi, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Wyden, Ms. Cantwell, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Coons, Mr. \nThune, Mr. Boozman, Mrs. Capito, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Casey, and Mr. \nDurbin) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 367\n\n       Whereas a competitive global economy requires workers who \n     are trained in skilled professions;\n       Whereas, according to the National Association of \n     Manufacturers, 80 percent of respondents indicated a moderate \n     to severe shortage of qualified skilled production employees, \n     including front-line workers such as machinists, operators, \n     craft workers, distributors, and technicians;\n       Whereas career and technical education (referred to in this \n     preamble as ``CTE'') ensures that competitive and skilled \n     workers are ready, willing, and capable of holding jobs in \n     high-wage, high-skill, and in-demand career fields such as \n     science, technology, engineering, mathematics, nursing, \n     allied health, construction, information technology, energy \n     sustainability, and many other career fields that are vital \n     in keeping the United States competitive in the global \n     economy;\n       Whereas CTE helps the United States meet the very real and \n     immediate challenges of economic development, student \n     achievement, and global competitiveness;\n       Whereas approximately 14,000,000 students are enrolled in \n     CTE across the country with CTE programs in nearly 1,300 \n     public high schools and 1,700 2-year colleges;\n       Whereas of the 20 fastest growing occupations--\n       (1) 10 require an associate's degree or a degree with fewer \n     requirements;\n       (2) 13 with the largest numbers of new jobs projected \n     require on-the-job training, an associate's degree, or a \n     certificate; and\n       (3) nearly all require real-world skills that can be \n     mastered through CTE;\n       Whereas CTE matches employability skills with workforce \n     demand and provides relevant academic and technical \n     coursework leading to industry-recognized credentials for \n     secondary, postsecondary, and adult learners;\n       Whereas CTE affords students the opportunity to gain the \n     knowledge, skills, and credentials needed to secure careers \n     in growing, high-demand fields;\n       Whereas CTE students were significantly more likely than \n     non-CTE student to report having developed problem-solving, \n     project completion, research, math, college application, \n     work-related, communication, time management, and critical \n     thinking skills during high school; and\n       Whereas students at schools with highly integrated rigorous \n     academic and CTE programs have significantly higher \n     achievement in reading, mathematics, and science than \n     students at schools with less integrated programs: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates February 2016 as ``Career and Technical \n     Education Month'' to celebrate career and technical education \n     across the United States;\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of Career and Technical \n     Education month;\n       (3) recognizes the importance of career and technical \n     education in preparing a well-educated and skilled workforce \n     in the United States; and\n       (4) encourages educators, counselors, and administrators to \n     promote career and technical education as an option to \n     students.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/09/senate-section/article/S741-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S741-S742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 368--SUPPORTING EFFORTS BY THE GOVERNMENT OF COLOMBIA \n TO PURSUE PEACE AND THE END OF THE COUNTRY'S ENDURING INTERNAL ARMED \nCONFLICT AND RECOGNIZING UNITED STATES SUPPORT FOR COLOMBIA AT THE 15TH \n                      ANNIVERSARY OF PLAN COLOMBIA\n\n  Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. Corker, and Mr. Kaine) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S.
