Mr. President, I move to proceed to H.R. 240.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 5, H.R. 240, a bill \n     making appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security \n     for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n\n                           Carter Nomination\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, later today the Senate will consider \nthe nomination of Ash Carter to be the next Secretary of Defense.\n  If I could place one demand on him, it would be to leave our Armed \nForces in a better position to deal with global threats than they are \ntoday. As I have noted in the past, the overall consequence of many of \nthe President's policies have been to weaken our ability to confront Al \nQaeda and its affiliates, the Taliban, and associated groups.\n  The President's inflexible commitment to campaign promises made in \n2008 has led to artificial deadlines for withdrawal from Afghanistan, a \nrushed withdrawal from Iraq, and Executive orders to close Guantanamo \nand send detainees back home to places such as Yemen and Afghanistan. \nIt has also led essentially to end America's ability to capture, \ndetain, and interrogate terrorists--whether or not we are still at war \nwith Al Qaeda.\n  The truth is Al Qaeda was at war with us before we went to war with \nthem, and today we face a diffuse and versatile threat from terrorists, \nwith ISIL intent on striking America and its allies.\n  The next Secretary of Defense needs to explain to the President that \ndrawing down in Afghanistan--based on an artificial deadline--risks the \ngains we have made there. He needs to explain that the Haqqani network \nand the Taliban continue to threaten our allies.\n  The next Secretary of Defense must do all he can to make a \ndeclaratory policy of pivoting to Asia a real one. Past drawdowns of \nconventional power and failure to modernize the American force have \nencouraged foes and unsettled friends. So it is time to invest in the \nplatforms and the capabilities needed to address effectively China's \nmilitary buildup, and the next Secretary must also support the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff when he provides his best military advice \nto the President, especially when that advice is ignored in the White \nHouse.\n  In the Senate I will do all I can to support the next Secretary. That \nstarts today. I intend to support Ash Carter's nomination, but my \nsupport is conditioned on this request: The incoming Secretary needs to \nhave the courage to speak truth to power--to Congress, yes, but also to \nhis Commander in Chief.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n               Recognition of the Acting Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have been trying to understand what has \nbeen holding up the funding for the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The Department of Homeland Security is the agency we created after 9/\n11 that merged 22 different agencies of our government to make sure \nthat 9/11 never happened again. We created this new Department, and we \nsaid to them: Keep America safe. Use our tax resources and your best \nefforts to keep America safe. Thank goodness that we have not had a \nrepeat of that terrible tragedy of 9/11 since--under either Republican \nor Democratic Presidents.\n  When we started debating about funding the agencies of government in \nDecember with an omnibus budget bill, the House Republicans said: We \nwill fund the entire Government of the United States, but we will not \ngive regular budget appropriations to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. They singled out the one department responsible for our \nsafety and security and\n\n[[Page S948]]\n\nsaid: We will give them temporary funding.\n  In fact, the funding for this round ends February 27, in 15 days. So \nwe are in an almost impossible-to-explain situation where the agency \nwith the premier responsibility of keeping America safe is not being \nadequately funded to do its job. Now, we know we live in a dangerous \ntime in the world's history. Evidence continues to be shown of the \nruthless, barbaric tactics of extremist groups such as ISIS.\n  Kayla Mueller, this magnificent young woman--I believe 26 years old--\ntaken captive by ISIS, was killed by them. They murdered a Jordanian \npilot by burning him alive. They beheaded the Japanese journalist. So \nwe know they are ruthless and barbaric, and we know that they are \nextending their reach.\n  Well, we are doing what we must do with the Department of Defense \nwhen it comes to stopping them, but we are not doing enough when it \ncomes to the Department of Homeland Security because we are not funding \nthis agency as it should be funded. It has been singled out by the \nHouse Republicans as the only agency that doesn't receive regular \nappropriations.\n  We sat down with Secretary Johnson and asked him: Well, what impact \ndoes it have on you, on managing your Department when it comes to \ntemporary funding, as opposed to a regular budget?\n  He said: I can't make grants to fire departments in Illinois, Nevada \nor Arizona. The fire departments come to me and say: Our firefighters \nneed better training; can you give us a Federal grant for that purpose?\n  Or if they need equipment to keep themselves safe, he said: I can't \ngive the grants because I am under a continuing resolution.\n  If we look at the budget for this Department of Homeland Security, \nhonestly, there is no real disagreement on how much they should \nreceive. When we look at this budget of $47.8 billion, it raises some \nobvious questions.\n  I wish to mention for the record some of the items the money is used \nfor. There is $8.5 billion, roughly, for the Coast Guard. We know the \nCoast Guard's responsibilities--focusing on preventing terrorist \nattacks; addressing evolving threats to our maritime and transportation \nsystems as well as the global supply chain; preventing the unauthorized \nacquisition, importation, and use of chemical, biological, \nradiological, and explosive materials. That is what the Coast Guard is \nsupposed to do. I said $8.5 billion, but it looks like it is $10 \nbillion in total that is supposed to go to the Coast Guard. But it is \nbeing held up by this continuing resolution.\n  We have to ask ourselves: What is stopping us from funding the Coast \nGuard properly so they can protect us?\n  How about Customs and Border Protection: There are $12.5 billion for \nCustoms and Border Protection to secure U.S. air, land, and sea \nborders; safeguard and streamline lawful trade and travel; and disrupt \nand dismantle transnational, criminal, and terrorist organizations.\n  The list goes on and on. What is it that is holding up this \nappropriation? It took some research, but I found what is holding it \nup.\n  It is this young woman on the poster. Her name is Herta Llusho. Herta \nLlusho was brought to the United States from Albania at the age of 11.\n  She grew up in Grosse Pointe, MI, a suburb of Detroit. She quickly \nlearned English and became an academic star. She graduated from Grosse \nPointe South High School with a 4.05 grade point average. In high \nschool, Herta was a member of the varsity track team, won an Advanced \nPlacement Scholar Award, and was a member of the National Honor \nSociety.\n  Herta went on to the University of Detroit Mercy, and she graduated \nwith honors with a major in electrical engineering. While Herta was in \ncollege, she completed internships at engineering companies, was very \ninvolved in her community, and volunteered at homeless shelters, \ntutoring programs, and in her church.\n  Listen to what her friends say about Herta Llusho:\n\n       I am humbled by Herta's willingness and desire to serve. I \n     have had the privilege of going to the same church at which \n     she faithfully serves. She spends hours tutoring kids and \n     volunteering with the junior high Sunday school class. It's a \n     joy to watch so many kids run up to her at church because of \n     the love they receive when they are with her.\n\n  Herta, after she graduated, learned that she could be protected from \ndeportation--because she is undocumented--with a Presidential order \ncalled DACA. It is Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, and it was \nan Executive order by President Obama which says that Herta Llusho \ncould be a DREAMer, allowed to stay in the United States, and will not \nbe deported.\n  It turns out that Herta Llusho is the reason why we can't fund the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, in the minds of Republican leaders. \nThey believe she needs to be deported first before we fund the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  I hate to put that burden on Herta's shoulders, but she and many like \nher are at the center of this debate--600,000 young people, many of \nthem people such as Herta Llusho, who came to this country as children, \nmade a great record in high school, have no criminal issues whatsoever, \nand who want to be part of America's future. And what we are hearing \nfrom Republican leadership is that we will not fund the Department of \nHomeland Security to protect America until they deport Herta Llusho. \nThat is what the House bill says. It makes no sense whatsoever.\n  We were off to a flying start in the Senate. We had 3 straight weeks \nof debate and 30 to 40 amendments from both sides of the aisle. I \nthought there was--but for one bump in the road on a Thursday night--a \ngreat spirit of cooperation. Amendments were being offered on the \nDemocratic side and on the Republican side. Some were controversial, \nand people didn't want to vote on them. But I happened to welcome what \nhappened on the floor. I think that active debate, deliberation, and \nall these amendments were the right thing to do, even though I \ndisagreed with the basic bill, the Keystone Canadian pipeline bill that \ncame before us. We took it through to its conclusion.\n  There were countless times when any Democrat could have stood up, \nobjected and stopped the Senate for 30 hours or 60 hours, as we saw \nover the past several years. We did not do that.\n  We tried in a spirit of bipartisanship to engage in an active debate, \neven on an issue where we knew the Republicans would prevail. I think \nthat was the right thing to do.\n  Sadly, in the past 2 weeks, we have fallen back into bad habits. \nThere has been this insistence by Speaker Boehner that the Homeland \nSecurity bill not go forward to fund this critical agency unless they \ncan challenge President Obama on immigration issues.\n  Why are they doing this? Why are they endangering the safety of the \nUnited States of America?\n  Is it because of Herta Llusho and their determination to make sure \nthis spectacular young woman leaves America, is deported back to \nAlbania, a country she barely remembers? Is that why we are doing this? \nIf it is, it is sad. In fact, it borders on being disgraceful.\n  We need to pass a clean Homeland Security bill. We need to do it now. \nWe can take up the debate on immigration any time the Speaker and the \nmajority leader want to bring it up. It is within their power to call \nthe next issue we are going to debate.\n\n  I sincerely hope that before we leave for the President's week break \nthat we call up this bill; that we debate it and pass it, so we can \nmake sure America is safe in this age of terrorism, and then let's save \nfor another day the debate on Herta and the thousands just like her and \nwhat their fate and future will be in the United States of America.\n  Some Republicans have stepped up recently and joined us in our \neffort. I thank the Presiding Officer for the time he joined us on the \nrollcall. Yesterday, my colleague Senator Kirk, from the State of \nIllinois, made a statement on this issue. He said: My hope is that we \npass the Homeland Security appropriations bill clean now. I would think \nwe should just pass a regular appropriations bill under regular order. \nRepublican Senator Jeff Flake said: To attempt to use a spending bill \nto try to poke a finger in the President's eye is not a good move, in \nmy mind.\n  More and more Republican Senators are speaking up. I hope the \nleadership is listening and I hope the Speaker is\n\n[[Page S949]]\n\nlistening. If we want a debate on immigration, let's have it. I am \nanxious to tell the story of Herta and many others and to appeal to my \ncolleagues on a bipartisan basis to come up with sensible immigration \nreform. But let us not withhold funding from this critical agency while \nwe are embroiled in this political squabble.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation Of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nPresident's nominee, Dr. Ashton Carter, to serve as our Nation's 25th \nSecretary of Defense.\n\n\n                    Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel\n\n  Let me first say a few words of thanks to Chuck Hagel, our former \ncolleague in the Senate, who has served as Secretary of Defense. He is \na friend, he has had a long career in public service, and he is a \nveteran of Vietnam. The people of Nebraska rewarded him by asking him \nto represent them in the United States Senate.\n  As our Nation's first person of enlisted rank to serve as Secretary \nof Defense, he had a unique, ground-level view on matters of war and \npeace, and a strong commitment to our troops. I thank Chuck Hagel for \nhis service and his family for their sacrifices over the last 2 years.\n  Dr. Carter has an impressive and distinguished record of service as \nwell in government, as an adviser and as a scholar. He has what it \ntakes to be a great Secretary of Defense.\n  His credentials as one of our Nation's top security policy experts \nare well established. He earned a bachelor's degree in physics and \nmedieval history from Yale and his doctorate in theoretical physics \nfrom Oxford. He has served as faculty chair at Harvard and is the \nauthor of 11 books.\n  As singularly impressive as this is, Dr. Carter is also very much a \ndoer. He has served no fewer than 11 Secretaries of Defense, including \nLeon Panetta and Chuck Hagel. He has four times been awarded the \nDepartment's Distinguished Service Medal, as well as the Defense \nIntelligence Medal.\n  As an assistant secretary during the Clinton administration, he was \ninstrumental in removing nuclear stockpiles from the former Soviet \nstates of Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus.\n  As Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and \nLogistics, he was renowned for breaking through bureaucratic logjams to \nget our troops what they needed, when they needed it. We talked about \nthis at some length when we met in my office a few weeks ago. How can \nwe continue, I asked him, to reform DOD so that it will be able to rise \nto the occasion of today's challenges?\n  As part of the discussion, I was pleased to hear his appreciation for \nthe organic industrial base of the Department of Defense, especially \none near and dear to my heart, the Rock Island Arsenal in Illinois.\n  He recalled his experience in Afghanistan as he tried to bring our \ntroops the body armor and armored humvees they needed. He also recalled \nworking alongside the great dedicated employees at the Rock Island \nArsenal as they delivered the necessary lifesaving equipment to our \ntroops and rolled it off their assembly lines in record time.\n  I am confident Dr. Carter can steer the Department of Defense through \ndifficult times and provide the President with the best policy advice \nto deal with our Nation's challenges. He has my full support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/12/senate-section/article/S949-3", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LYNCH NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, while I am pleased the Senate is moving, \nand moving quickly, on Ashton Carter, I am troubled that my colleagues \nacross the aisle are delaying consideration of Loretta Lynch, the \nPresident's nominee for Attorney General of the United States. It has \nbeen 96 days since the President announced the nomination. This is \nlonger than any other Attorney General nominee has had to wait in \nrecent memory. By way of comparison, the Democratic-controlled Senate \nconfirmed Michael Mukasey as Attorney General in 53 days, Eric Holder \nin 64 days.\n  I sat through the hearings with Loretta Lynch, and I listened to the \nquestions, particularly from the Republican side, because most all \nDemocrats I know of are supporting her. I listened to the questions on \nthe Republican side and I came to the inescapable conclusion that \nRepublican Senators were going to refuse any effort to renominate Eric \nHolder for Attorney General. That is all they had to say. Their \ngrievance was with the sitting Attorney General, who has announced he \nis leaving as soon as his successor is chosen. I listened carefully for \nany criticism of Loretta Lynch and I didn't hear it.\n  Then they had the panel of public witnesses. That is a panel that has \na majority of Republican-chosen witnesses and Democratic witnesses. \nEarly on, I believe Senator Leahy asked the question of all the \nwitnesses there: How many of you who are on this public panel oppose \nthe nomination of Loretta Lynch for Attorney General? Not one--not one \nRepublican, not one Democrat. There is no opposition to Loretta Lynch.\n  Why are they holding up this important appointment by President \nObama? Why don't we consider that this afternoon? It can be done, and \nit should be done very quickly.\n  Nobody has questioned her record as a Federal prosecutor. She has \ntwice before been unanimously confirmed to serve as U.S. Attorney for \nthe Eastern District of New York. She has been vetted and examined and \nquestioned to a fare-thee-well. She testified before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee for nearly 8 hours, answering every question, \nincluding 600 written questions that were sent to her.\n  It is time to move forward and confirm this obviously well-qualified \nand historic nominee.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee will have the opportunity to report \nMs. Lynch out this week. We have the opportunity to confirm her \nimmediately. There is no reason for further delay. What are the Senate \nRepublicans trying to prove by holding up an obviously qualified \nnominee for a critically important agency such as the Department of \nJustice?\n  I hope the spirit of bipartisanship shown in that committee can be \nshown on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/12/senate-section/article/S949-4", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S949-S951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  AUMF\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, to her high school classmates it was \npretty clear what kind of person Kayla Mueller was going to turn out to \nbe. As a teenager she took up the causes of the disenfranchised and the \ndispossessed, such as when she joined a campaign to stop the city of \nFlagstaff from using recycled wastewater to make snow on a set of peaks \nthe Hopi people considered to be sacred. She later went to the most \ndangerous place on Earth because people there needed help. She saw \nsuffering on an unimaginable scale, brought on by a vicious civil war \ninside Syria and Iraq, and she wanted to make it better.\n  No one is responsible for her death except for ISIL. They killed her, \nas they did James Foley, Steven Sotloff, Abdul-Rahman, Peter Kassig, \nand thousands of individual innocent Iraqis and Syrians over the course \nof the last year.\n  It has been a long time since the world has seen such evil. This is a \nbrutal inhuman terrorist organization\n\n[[Page S950]]\n\nthat today is a threat to the region in which they prowl, but without \nquestion could pose a threat to the United States if their march is \nallowed to go unchecked.\n  Like the Presiding Officer, every time I hear of a new attack or a \nnew execution carried out by ISIL, my blood boils, I get furious, and I \ncommit myself to doing everything within our power to stamp them out. \nBut I also remember that as justified a response as it is, fury is not \na strategy; revenge is not security.\n  If we are going to defeat ISIL, we need to act with our heads, not \njust with our hearts. And that means Congress needs to pass a war \nauthorization that includes a strategy for victory--a strategy that \nlearns from a small little creature called the planarian flatworm. I \nwant to tell you about flatworms for a second. This is going to sound a \nlittle strange, but I will bring it back here.\n  These flatworms are extraordinary little things that live in ponds, \nunder logs, and in moist soil. What is amazing about these flatworms is \nthat if you split one of them in two, if you cut it in half, both \nhalves regenerate into new flatworms. In fact, if you cut it into four \npieces, all four pieces can regrow into new flatworms. It means if for \nwhatever reason you are trying to get rid of flatworms, cutting them \ninto pieces does more harm than good. If you take a knife to it, you \nactually create more flatworms than you destroy.\n  So why am I talking about this? Because they are a perfect object \nlesson of the simple truth that if you attack a problem the wrong way, \nyou might not just leave the problem unsolved, you might actually make \nit worse. If you use the wrong tool to try to eradicate flatworms, you \njust end up with a lot more of them.\n  In the wake of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, we were told we were going \nto be treated as liberators. We were told we would be out of Iraq in a \nfew years. When that failed, our invasion turned the one-headed monster \nof Saddam Hussein into a two-headed monster of competing Sunni and \nShiite insurgencies.\n  Then we were told more troops would do the trick. And it worked, for \nonly as long as tens of thousands of Americans were patrolling the \nsands of Iraq. But ultimately our occupation was quietly breeding a new \nbrand of an even more lethal insurgency, one that turned into the \nterrorist group we are fighting today.\n  Put simply, ISIL in its current form would not exist if we had not \nput massive ground troops into the region in the first place. Our \npresence in Iraq, our mishandling of the occupation, became bulletin \nboard material for terrorist recruiters. Iraq became, in the CIA's \nwords, the ``cause celebre'' of the international extremist network. We \nkilled a terrorist, and the next day two more showed up.\n  Let me be clear, because I don't want people to twist my words here. \nAmerica is not responsible for this evil ideology, and our troops are \nnot to blame for ISIL. No one forgets that Al Qaeda attacked us and \nkilled 3,000 of our people before we invaded Iraq. But do we believe \nhaving hundreds of thousands of U.S. soldiers occupying territory in \nthe Middle East since then has succeeded in making us safer?\n  We have killed a lot of terrorists over the last 13 years, and yet \nthere are more of them, in more places, with an even more radical \nagenda today than ever before.\n  Former Defense Secretary Bob Gates understood the lesson of the \nflatworm when he said, upon his departure from the Department of \nDefense, any future Secretary who proposed putting ground troops back \ninto the Middle East should ``have their head examined.''\n  So for me, as we debate this new war authorization against ISIL, I \nhave a bottom line: We cannot authorize a strategy that could result in \nAmerican combat troops going back to the Middle East.\n  If this President or the next President puts our soldiers into the \nMiddle East to fight ISIL, they would serve with bravery and honor. But \nan intervention of this scale would ultimately create more terrorists \nthan it destroyed. And to the extent we drove back ISIL, it would only \nbe temporary, lasting only as long as our troops were there.\n  Why? These extremist groups such as ISIL exist not because of a \nmilitary vacuum but because of a political and an economic vacuum. They \nprey upon disenfranchised young men who see no future for themselves in \nsocieties with massive, crippling hunger, poverty, and destitution.\n  These groups work best when autocratic or sectarian governments \nmarginalize and dispossess specific ethnic or religious groups, pushing \nthem into the arms of extremists who pledge to fight the corrupt and \ndehumanizing status quo.\n  Foreign ground troops do nothing to address these underlying issues. \nBut worse, more often than not, foreign ground troops exacerbate these \nmotivating forces. Bloody ground wars make more economic dislocation, \nnot less. Foreign occupations often empower divisive local leadership, \nsuch as the former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Malaki, who pushed \npeople toward--not away from--extremist groups. Then groups such as Al \nQaeda and ISIL use this misery to brainwash young men into believing \nAmerica is to blame, that we are the enemy they are yearning to fight.\n  That doesn't mean there isn't a role for military force in the Middle \nEast. I have voted for an authorization in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee that allows for the United States--our military--to go in and \nkill terrorists, but we simply need to understand that ultimately what \nmilitary force is in the Middle East is a shaping mechanism to give us \nspace in order to achieve the political and economic reform on the \nground with our local partners such that those root causes of \nterrorists disappear.\n  American military force is useful in this fight, but it has limits. \nThere is a decreasing marginal return and then a point where it \nactually flips on its head and begins to actually create more of the \npeople we are seeking to destroy.\n  I have heard two arguments over the past few days as to why this AUMF \nshouldn't have a limitation on ground troops. First, some of my \nRepublican friends say this kind of prohibition on ground troops would \nbe unwise because it would telegraph to our enemies a critical tactical \nlimitation. My response: Good.\n  Why do we think ISIL puts up these execution videos? Because they \nknow the best long-term play for their desired caliphate is predicated \non the United States making a mistake and rejoining a ground war in the \nMiddle East. Recent history has taught ISIL that the best tool by far \nto recruit terrorists--and estimates are there are as many as 20,000 \nforeign fighters who have joined ISIL--is the U.S. Army in the Middle \nEast. Thus, I have no problem being transparent with our enemy by \nsignaling this to them; that we are going to learn from our mistakes \nand we are going to fight this war with tools that result in victory, \nnot defeat.\n  The second argument I hear is that Congress would be overstepping our \nconstitutional bounds by limiting the power of the President to \nprosecute a war. But first let's note that over and over again, \nstarting with Congress's very first authorizations of military force \npassed in early American times, we have put restrictions consistently \non war declarations and AUMFs. Most recently, Republicans and Democrats \nin the Foreign Relations Committee voted to put some pretty serious \nlimitations on our authorization for the use of military force in Syria \nin the wake of chemical weapons usage. Frankly, regardless of the \nprecedent, I would argue Congress has a constitutional responsibility \nto help set the strategy for war, to help guide the Nation's foreign \npolicy.\n  Let's be honest. This AUMF is going to go on for 3 years, according \nto the limitations the President proposed, well into the next \nPresident's term. As someone who believes combat troops in the Middle \nEast would be a mistake, I simply can't rely on President Obama's \npromise that he will not use ground troops against ISIL because he only \nhas 2 more years left, and many leading Republicans have made it \nperfectly clear they would push a President from their party, if that \nis who comes next, to put troops back into the fight against ISIL. As \nan elected representative of the people I serve, I should get a say as \nto whether we have learned from our mistakes of the past 10 years.\n  I remember my first visit to Iraq. I was there in the bloody spring \nof 2007. I remember being absolutely blown\n\n[[Page S951]]\n\naway by the capability and the bravery and the capacity of the young \nU.S. soldiers whom I met in places such as Baghdad, Tikrit, and Baiji. \nSo I can understand why it is easy for some people to believe there is \nno enemy our soldiers can't beat, that there is no challenge they can't \nmeet, that there is no threat they can't eliminate. I believe in \nAmerican exceptionalism in my heart, but I don't think it allows us to \nignore history, to avoid facts, to deny reality, and the reality is \nextremists in some parts of the world are like flatworms. If we come at \nthem with the wrong weapon, we may kill one, but we will create two \nmore.\n  I am pleased the Senate is finally able to debate a new war against \nISIL. This debate is past due. ISIL needs to be defeated, and we \ndeserve to honor the U.S. Constitution and step up to the plate and \ndebate an authorization.\n  Make no mistake, we should pass an AUMF. ISIL is evil personified, \nbut for us to beat them, we need an AUMF that makes it totally clear we \nwill not simply repeat the mistakes of the past that got us into this \nmess in the first place.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds).

Mr. President, I have come to the floor, with just 16 \ndays left until the Department of Homeland Security shuts down, to \nagain call for Congress to pass a clean full-year bill to fund the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. With our Nation facing very real and \nvery dangerous threats--Senator Murphy was just on the floor talking \nabout the ISIL threat and pointed out what the risks are--it is time \nfor us to put politics aside and do what is right for the security of \nour Nation.\n  If we don't pass a full-year bill to fund the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, we will not be able to make critical investments in border \nsecurity, maritime security, and in nuclear detection activities.\n  If we don't pass a full-year bill, grants to protect our cities and \nour ports from terror attacks would be halted, and new grants to police \nand firefighters will not be awarded. If we don't pass a full-year \nbill, we are shortchanging counterterrorism efforts, and we will put \nour Nation's cyber networks at risk.\n  Senator Mikulski and I have filed a clean, full-year funding bill \nthat is on the Senate calendar and ready for action. Our bill fully \nfunds these key security priorities, but if our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle don't want to support a bill that Senator Mikulski \nand I have filed, certainly we can support a clean Republican bill that \nincludes the funding for the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Our bill--our clean bill--is based on the bicameral, bipartisan \nagreement that was reached in December by Senator Mikulski and \nCongressman Hal Rogers. The legislation was agreed to by Democrats and \nRepublicans, and it was the result of bipartisan, compromised \nnegotiations. Not everyone got what they wanted in the bill, but it is \na good budget that strengthens our Nation and protects against the many \nthreats we face.\n  Appropriations bills are only possible because of the art of \ncompromise. Senators from both parties identify priorities important to \nthem or their States. They work with Members of the Appropriations \nCommittee on bill language, funding priorities. Everyone works together \nto influence the final product. All Senators have the opportunity to \nparticipate in crafting appropriations bills.\n  In fact, there doesn't seem to be any disagreement about the funding \nand how it is allocated in the appropriations bill before us, in the \nfunding bill for Homeland Security. Senator Cochran, who chairs the \nAppropriations Committee, came to the floor and touted all of the \nbenefits in the funding bill for Homeland Security. Senator Hoeven, who \nchairs the Subcommittee on Homeland Security that I am the ranking \nmember of, came to the floor and, similar to Senator Cochran, touted \nwhat is on the bill. I have been on the floor, Senator Mikulski has \nbeen to the floor many times to talk about what is in the funding bill \nfor the Department of Homeland Security and why we need to pass it.\n  This morning I wish to highlight a few more of the priorities in a \nclean, full-year bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security, \npriorities that will be at risk if we can't pass a clean bill.\n  There is bipartisan support that the Homeland Security appropriations \nbill includes strong funding for fire and SAFER grants. I know the \nPresiding Officer understands these programs because he has been the \nGovernor of his home State. So he knows how important those fire and \nSAFER grants are to local fire departments, to first responders because \nthey help purchase new equipment, they help with training exercises, \nand they can help fire departments cut down response times and save \nlives.\n  There is also bipartisan support that the Homeland Security funding \nbill include grants to help our Nation's largest cities protect against \nterror attacks. There is funding for port security grants, State and \nlocal law enforcement grants, emergency preparedness grants. There is \nbipartisan support for funding to upgrade the FEMA Center for Domestic \nPreparedness in Anniston, AL.\n  There is a compromise most of the people on the Democratic side of \nthe aisle didn't agree with, to deny President Obama's request to \nincrease air passenger fees and reinstitute the air carrier security \nfee.\n  The Coast Guard needs to continue the acquisition of its eighth \nnational security cutter, which is so important for our maritime \nsecurity. Republicans and Democrats secured $627 million in the bill \nfor the cutter.\n  We have all seen how devastating the attacks were against Sony when \nit was hacked. Cyber attacks are an area of security that former \nNational Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft called ``as dangerous as \nnuclear weapons.'' That is why Republicans and Democrats pushed for \nfull funding for DHS cyber security activities.\n\n  The increase to the southwestern border of unaccompanied children and \nfamilies last year is a major concern for States along our southern \nborder--States such as Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico. It has been a \nkey priority for a number of my Republican colleagues, and for all of \nus who are concerned about border security, to meet the statutory \nmandate of 34,000 detention beds for undocumented immigrants that is \nrequired for the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The clean funding bill includes support for those 34,000 detention \nbeds, and it also includes funding to meet Republican requests to build \n3,000 new family detention beds in Texas.\n  The National Bio and Agro-Defense facility construction in Manhattan, \nKS, which is an effort to help us deal with threats against our food \nsupply and other bioterrorism threats--in a clean funding bill will \nreceive the final amount needed to begin construction.\n  Senator Roberts and I talked about this today. One of the things he \npointed out is he has been working on this project for 16 years. There \nis $300 million in this clean, full-year bill. If we don't pass this \nbill, if the Department of Homeland Security shuts down, if we are in a \ncontinuing resolution, then this funding is at risk and they may have \nto rebid the project, which will drive up costs. That makes no sense.\n  There was bipartisan agreement to include $12 million for the \nNational Computer Forensics Institute in Hoover, AL, to support the \nexpansion of basic and advanced training for State and local law \nenforcement personnel, judges, and prosecutors to combat cyber crime.\n  These important investments in counterterrorism and cyber and border \nsecurity are not controversial. That is not what we are arguing about \nhere. We are arguing about whether we are\n\n[[Page S952]]\n\ngoing to debate what the President did with respect to immigration, and \nwe should not be having this debate on the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's funding bill. We can have that debate. I am all for it. I \nwas happy to have that debate when this body passed comprehensive \nimmigration reform 2 years ago, but we should not be having this debate \non this bill. The House should understand, just as the Senate \nunderstands that. We should not be having that debate on this funding \nbill for Department of Homeland Security.\n  We need to come together to pass a clean bill--a bill that was the \nresult of bipartisan negotiation and bipartisan compromise. We have a \nbill on the Senate calendar to do just that.\n  I am hearing from communities all across New Hampshire--we are \nhearing from communities across the country--about the need to pass a \nfull-year funding bill.\n  Last week the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Association of \nCounties, the International Association of Emergency Managers, and the \nInternational Association of Firefighters joined our call for a clean, \nfull-year funding bill because they understand, as I know we all do, \nhow disastrous failing to fund this agency would be. Three previous DHS \nSecretaries, two Republicans and one Democrat, have done the same.\n  Earlier this week, the National Fraternal Order of Police joined that \ncall for action.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the letter from the \nNational Fraternal Order of Police printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          National Fraternal Order\n\n\n                                                    of Police,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 10, 2015.\n     Hon.

Boehner,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy P. Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell, Mr. Speaker, Senator Reid and \n     Representative Pelosi: I am writing on behalf of the members \n     of the Fraternal Order of Police, and probably most \n     Americans, to express our frustration and outrage that what \n     used to be two greatest legislative bodies on the planet will \n     allow a policy dispute to compromise the safety and security \n     of our country.\n       The previous Congress made a conscious, political decision \n     to defer action of funding for the U.S. Department of \n     Homeland Security (DHS) until the end of this month. I would \n     also point out that is five months since the start of the \n     current fiscal year and that some of our nation's largest and \n     most vital law enforcement agencies and functions are \n     operating without FY15 funding in place. The House passed \n     legislation in spite of a veto threat and the Senate is now \n     paralyzed and cannot even pass a motion to begin debating the \n     bill. The entire process has become farcical and no amount of \n     political spin or blaming the other side is reason enough to \n     jeopardize the integrity of our nation's borders or the \n     safety of the public.\n       What kind of message does this send to the men and women in \n     DHS who put their lives on the line in defense of our \n     homeland--three of whom fell in the line of duty over the \n     past two years?\n       What kind of message does this send to our enemies? Our \n     current threat level is ``Elevated'' as threats from \n     terrorists and other hostile organizations plan attacks on \n     the United States and our allies. Our Border Patrol and \n     Customs and Border Patrol officers, not yet recovered from \n     last year's surge of minors unlawfully entering our country \n     by the thousands, now must redouble their vigilance against \n     more sinister penetrations. Yet our great democratic \n     institutions are unable to complete their most basic \n     function--providing funding for the protection of our \n     national security. Just more than a decade has passed since \n     the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and today \n     political partisanship holds hostage its operational \n     integrity. This is a political obscenity.\n       I urge you all, as the leaders of this Congress, to work \n     together and to fund fully the Department of Homeland \n     Security. This is what the American people elected you to do \n     and this is your obligation as Members of Congress. If you \n     cannot, you may as well put out a welcome mat for our enemies \n     and others who would do us harm.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Chuck Canterbury,\n                                               National President.\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Their letter expresses frustration with the fact that a \npolicy dispute over the President's immigration actions ``could \ncompromise the safety and security of our country.''\n  The letter continues:\n\n       What kind of message does this send to the men and women in \n     DHS who put their lives on the line in defense of our \n     homeland--three of whom fell in the line of duty over the \n     past two years?\n       What kind of message does this send to our enemies?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for another 60 \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Congress's most basic function is to provide for the \nNation's security. It is time to stop playing politics, to get to work, \ndo our jobs, and pass a clean full-year bill to fund the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/12/senate-section/article/S952-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S952-S954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PRESIDENT'S NATIONAL SECURITY PLAN\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, on the same week that the President \nreleased his national strategy, a pilot in the Royal Jordanian Air \nForce was burned alive by radical Islamists.\n  While the administration was putting the finishing touches on this \ndocument, the propaganda wing of ISIS was busy too. The jihadist group \nwas pumping out a video of this latest act of horrific brutality.\n  ISIS represents one of the biggest threats to peace of an already \nunstable region. These terrorists are committed to establishing a new \ncaliphate ruled by shari'a law where all would be forced to convert or \ndie. They are committed to destroying all who stand in their way. If \nanyone embodies radical Islam, it is ISIS.\n  Given the severity of the threat posed by ISIS, not to mention \ncontinuing efforts of Al Qaeda to strike again, you would think a plan \nto take on radical Islam would be a focal part of the President's \nnational security plan. It is not. In fact, there is no mention of \nradical Islam in the document at all.\n  What is mentioned instead is global warming. Yes, global warming is \ndiscussed in the President's national security strategy, but not \nradical Islamic extremism. Apparently that is not a threat to the \nUnited States. The President and his advisers have stood by this \nsenseless narrative.\n  In a lengthy interview with Vox, the President essentially blamed the \nmedia for overhyping the threat of terrorism. He went on to say that \nterrorism sells because it is ``all about the ratings,'' and climate \nchange is ``a hard story for the media to tell on a day-to-day basis.''\n  Yesterday the White House spokesman was pressed on this very issue \nand refused to accept the premise that terrorist groups such as ISIS \npose a ``greater clear and present danger'' than global warming. So you \ncan see the disconnect that exists within the administration. But it \ndoesn't end with just this document.\n  The President's budget proposal for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity would allocate tens of millions of dollars to protect against \nclimate change. It does so by failing to dedicate funds for communities \nto identify and disrupt homegrown terror, despite the fact that ISIS is \nrecruiting foreign fighters at a clip never seen before. While the \nmajority of them are from the Middle East, the Wall Street Journal \nreports that upwards of 20,000 foreign fighters have joined ISIS in the \npast 2 years.\n  The group's savvy use of social media and its highly orchestrated \npropaganda campaign has appealed to Westerners as well, bringing \nthousands of jihadists with passports that allow them to travel with \nease to ISIS-controlled territory. Where they will ultimately take the \ndeadly skills they learned in Iraq and Syria remains to be seen. These \nforeign fighters could return home or even come to the United States, \ngiving ISIS the ability to strike on American soil. The recent attacks \nin Paris serve as a vivid reminder that the reach of radical Islam \nextends far beyond the jihadi fighters on the ground in Iraq and in \nSyria.\n\n[[Page S953]]\n\n  Meanwhile, the Democrats in this Chamber, at the behest of the \nPresident, are holding up the House-passed DHS appropriations bill. \nSenate Democrats voted three times to filibuster the House-passed \nDepartment of Homeland Security funding bill last week. Their objection \nis that it withholds funding from the President's unconstitutional \nExecutive actions on immigration. They are holding up the entire bill \nand threatening to shut down DHS to protect the President's priority--\nnot because the funding is too low or because the programs need \nreforms. Their complaint is that the President is not getting what he \nwants.\n  I encourage them to relent on their filibuster so we can debate the \nbill, make changes if the Chamber sees fit, and send it to the \nPresident. If the President truly wants immigration reform, then do it \nthe right way and work with Congress to get it done. Don't go about it \non your own unconstitutionally and then threaten to shut down a \ndepartment charged with protecting Americans. It is out of touch, but \nit is not the first time this administration's priorities have been at \nodds with those of the American people.\n  The President once characterized ISIS as the JV team. This is no JV \nteam. As the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee noted, \nISIS is the ``largest convergence of Islamist terrorists in history'' \nthat has created a ``pseudo-state dead set on attacking America.''\n  Preventing ISIS from achieving its goals takes a clear, forceful \nsecurity strategy both abroad and at home. What the President has put \nforward is neither.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I wish to follow on the comments of my good \nfriend and neighbor from Arkansas, Senator Boozman. He was talking \nabout what the President is now asking the Congress to do. I think \nthere are many questions that need to be asked about this authorization \nfor activity against ISIS and what that might mean before the Congress \ncan move forward.\n  The principal question, however, will continue to be: Do we have a \nstrategy? And if we have a strategy, which has not yet been explained, \nis there a commitment to that strategy to move forward? Is this just \nanother redline that means nothing or is this a document that is \ndesigned to meet some objectives that really are not the objectives of \nfighting people who clearly perceive freedom and America and the values \nwe stand for as anathema to what they would hope to see?\n  There are so many questions. Is the 3-year timeframe enough? Why \nwould you have a 3-year timeframe? That puts this authorization of \nforce 1 year into the next Presidency. What kind of legacy is that to \nleave the next President? The minute that person becomes President, \nsuddenly you have a clock that is ticking. If we take that approach, \nnot only are we telling our adversaries when we plan to quit, we are \ntelling the next President, no matter what the situation is, when we \nwill quit. We have not been presented with a 3-year plan on how to \ndegrade and destroy ISIS. We understand that is what the goal is, but \nnobody suggested a 3-year plan.\n  In fact, if you look back over the last 6 months, you will find the \nPresident's ability to project his foreign policy seems to defy all \nprojections. A few months ago, he talked about Yemen as an example of \nhow well our policy is working. This week we abandoned the Embassy and \nabandoned our efforts in that country.\n  The specific focus on ISIS and/or associated persons or forces--what \ndoes that mean? Does that mean another terrorist group that is \nstruggling against ISIS is not covered by this? Does that mean Al Qaeda \nor al-Nusra or some other group that is equally focused on the United \nStates and our friends is not covered by this?\n  The President has the authority to go after terrorist organizations. \nAs far as 2001, 2002--he says he wants at least one of those \nauthorities left on the books. By the way, it is sufficient to do \nanything we want to do now, so why add this to it?\n  This debate may take a while, but during the debate, I think we need \nto listen closely to our military leaders and question them again about \nhow we can accomplish what we need to accomplish here, what we can do \nto help our friends as they work to accomplish what needs to be \naccomplished here, what we do to encourage people from the neighborhood \nto put their boots on the ground, and what do we need to do to be \nhelpful.\n  Last weekend I traveled with a few other members of the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence to Jordan and Turkey to discuss the ISIS \nthreat and what was happening in Iraq and Syria. It was especially \ninteresting to be in Jordan just after the brutal murder of the \nJordanian pilot. I don't know that we know for sure exactly when that \nhappened, but I think there are many reasons to believe this group was \nnegotiating to save the life of the pilot long after the pilot's life \nhad been taken in one of the most barbarous of possible ways. It got \nthe attention of the neighborhood, and certainly Jordan and the UAE and \nothers are beginning to line up with a new determination to go after \nISIS, hitting targets on the ground, we are told, that we have known \nwere targets for a long time but we didn't seem to be able to have the \nwillingness to hit them. Certainly we had the capacity to hit them. \nCertainly we had the information to hit them. But why weren't we doing \nthat? What is the commitment to do this?\n\n  The President asked the Congress of the United States to make this \ncommitment of use of force, but there is absolutely no reason for us to \nmake that commitment unless he intends to use the force and unless we \nunderstand how he intends to use the force. Not only can we not define \nour policy here; those people around the world who would like to know \nwhat our policy is don't hear it defined either.\n  Then we have events happen such as the botched interview of last \nweekend the Senator from Arkansas was speaking about where the \nPresident was asked if ``the media sometimes overstates the level of \nalarm people should have about terrorism and this kind of chaos, as \nopposed to a longer-term problem of climate change and epidemic \ndisease.'' The President's response was ``Absolutely.'' Absolutely, a \nlong-term problem of climate change and epidemic disease somehow \ncalculates into the discussion of whether we are in imminent danger of \nthese terrorist groups and whether that is real?\n  He went on to say in that interview: ``If it bleeds, it leads, \nright?'' This is the President talking. He went on to say, ``You show \ncrime stories and you show fires, because that's what folks watch, and \nit's all about ratings.'' I don't know what that means. I wouldn't want \nto suppose the President is saying that coverage of terrorism is about \nratings. I, frankly, don't know what it means, but I do know that if I \ndon't know what it means, a lot of people all over the world don't know \nwhat it means.\n  This is not climate change. It is not what we need to be doing at the \nCDC. The President is not asking for authorized use of force to do \nsomething about the CDC. When that was happening, the Congress stepped \nup and said: OK, here is money that will help meet that immediate need. \nThat is not the same kind of discussion at all.\n  The President also raised eyebrows by suggesting that the shooting at \na kosher deli, kosher market in Paris was ``random.'' I think his exact \nquote was, ``It is entirely legitimate for the American people to be \ndeeply concerned when you've got a bunch of violent, vicious zealots \nwho behead people or randomly shoot a bunch of folks in a deli in \nParis.'' I could speak quite a bit about the President's unwillingness \nto call this bunch of violent, vicious zealots what they are. They are \nIslamic extremists. The Prime Minister of Great Britain can say that. \nOther leaders all over the world can say that. We can't say that.\n  The other comment I thought was particularly interesting was \n``randomly'' shoot people in a deli in Paris. It was a kosher deli in \nParis. There was no ``random'' about that. Most of the customers would \nbe and the victims were Jews. There was no ``random'' about that. Let's \naccept this for what it is.\n  Let's not go back, as the President did at the National Prayer \nBreakfast a few days ago, and decide to equate something--crusades, \nalmost 800 years\n\n[[Page S954]]\n\nago, 600 years ago, various crusades--equate the crusades with what is \nhappening now and somehow suggest that these people are just \ntemporarily misguided. These people are not temporarily misguided; \nthese people are about an evil purpose. They killed fellow members of \ntheir religion because they believed those people didn't perfectly \nreflect their own religion.\n  This is an issue we need to be concerned about. We have to have a \nstrategy. We need clarity. We need commitment. If we are going to \ndestroy this threat, we really have to be committed to destroy this \nterrorist threat.\n  I plan to press the administration, as many others will, on that \nquestion of, What is your plan? The President's nominee for Secretary \nof Defense couldn't explain the plan. That is a vote we are going to \nhave later today. I don't intend to vote for that nominee today. We \nhave already had three Secretaries of Defense in this Presidency who \nhave been incredibly frustrated, obviously and visibly frustrated and \nwilling to talk about their frustrations--at least the two Secretaries \nwho have already left--of not knowing how to deal with a White House \nthat wants to run the military in the most specific ways rather than \nsaying: Here is our goal. What is the best way to meet that goal?\n  We have had that already. We don't need another Secretary of Defense \nwho doesn't understand what the plan is and can't communicate that plan \nto either the Congress or the country or our friends around the world.\n  The Congress doesn't understand what the President is trying to do. \nThe administration can't explain what the President is trying to do. \nOur enemies are emboldened by the fact that we can't explain what we \nare trying to do, and our friends wonder what we are trying to do.\n  In so many cases--I remember the great speech by the President of \nUkraine at a joint session of Congress last year where basically he \nsaid: Thank you for the food. Thank you for the blankets. But we can't \nfight the Russians with blankets. We can't fight the terrorists without \na strategy. We can't fight the terrorists without a commitment to the \ngoal.\n  The document the President sent to us this week was carefully worded \nto meet all kinds of political constituencies. It is not carefully \nworded in a way that meets the threat of radical Islamic terrorism. The \nJordanians understand this. People in the neighborhood understand this. \nPeople in Europe seem to have a better understanding of it than we do. \nThey all want to see some level of commitment by the United States of \nAmerica, and I would like to hear what that commitment is.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/12/senate-section/article/S954-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I heard the remarks earlier today about how \nwe need to move forward with the Department of Homeland Security \nfunding bill without any reaction to the President's Executive actions \nof last year. One way to see if that would really meet the test of the \nSenate is to move forward, to have the debate.\n  Our friends on the other side are unwilling to debate this. Why would \nthat be? Many of them disagree with the actions of the President of \nlast November. Enough of them certainly disagreed to have 60 votes on \nthe Senate floor that would pass a bill to reverse those actions. Maybe \nnot everybody agrees with everything, but we had more amendment votes \non the Senate floor 2 weeks ago on 2 different days--each of 2 \ndifferent days--than we had all of last year. The majority leader has \nshown a commitment to let Senators be heard. If they want to improve \nwhat the House sent over, let's debate it. If they want to improve what \nthe House sent over, let's hear what those improvements are.\n  Later today I am joining my colleagues from the Senate Steering \nCommittee and the Republican Study Committee to discuss why Senate \nDemocrats continue their efforts to filibuster this funding bill, to \nnot have a debate on this funding bill. In the last Congress we were \noften accused of not being willing to end debate; seldom were we \naccused of not being willing to have the debate. Our argument was, how \ncan we end debate when we have had no amendments? We have not been able \nto be heard on how we would like to change this bill. Why would we end \nthat debate?\n  Seldom were we accused of not wanting to go to debate. Several times \nthat was the case when it was clear that nothing was going to happen \nand the debate was all about politics.\n  This is a debate about funding part of the government that is so \nessential that if funding is not there, almost all of the employees \nshow up anyway. They are considered essential. They need a paycheck, \njust as families all over America do. We are going to see to it that \nthat happens. These are essential employees.\n  This is not a situation where we can just decide we don't need to \nhave the debate. Our friends on the other side can't continue to think \nthat the debate only happens and amendments only happen in the Senate \nif there are provisions with which they agree. Maybe they just don't \nwant to explain why the President said 22 times he couldn't take the \naction he took in November. That is a lot of times, even by political \nstandards. Twenty-two times saying he can't do something and then \nfiguring out a way he can do it is a pretty extraordinary event.\n  So we need to have this debate. Frankly, unless we engage in the \ndebate, we won't really ever know what is going to happen with the \ndebate.\n  I think it is time to move forward. I hope Senate Democrats will work \nwith us. If they want to offer amendments, I am more than happy to vote \non their amendments. I think the bill the House sent over is work \nproduct we should be pursuing. We should be moving forward with it. \nSeldom is there legislation that can't possibly be improved, but it \ncan't be improved if we won't talk about it. This is not an option. \nThis is an issue we eventually have to deal with.\n  Let's have the debate on why it now doesn't matter that the President \nsaid 22 times he wasn't going to take an action and then took it. If \nthere are provisions in the House bill our friends on the other side \ndon't like, let's hear what they are and vote on those issues and see \nwhat happens then.\n  We need to continue our efforts to move to this funding bill. I hope \nwe will still engage in this debate before the end of the month and \ngive this the attention it deserves.\n  We should not assume that any legislation that comes to the floor is \nso perfect, it can't be improved. In fact, the tradition for \nappropriations bills of the Senate and the House has always been that \nany Member could challenge anything--until about 7 years ago when \nsuddenly no Member could challenge anything. Let's get back to the way \nthis work is supposed to be done.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to exceed--I \nknow morning business expires in 3 or 4 minutes. I doubt I will be \nspeaking for more than 10 minutes, but for extra time in morning \nbusiness, I ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to address what I call an \nissue of public responsibility. More specifically, I rise to address \nthe responsibility of both the legislative and the executive branches \nto deal with our Nation's out of control deficit spending. \nUnfortunately, the President has shown little interest in the dire \nfiscal situation facing our Nation, which makes it all the more \nimportant for Congress to do so. Without Presidential leadership, it is\n\n[[Page S955]]\n\nnow Congress's duty to step up and take the lead.\n  We have an obligation to be straightforward and honest with the \nAmerican people about the financial challenges America faces. There was \na furor over our continuing plunge into debt and deficit starting in \n2009 and 2010 as we saw the spending explode with stimulus plans that \ndidn't work and other policies that continued to drive us into debt. \nUnfortunately, that level of intensity and displeasure over all that \nwas happening has subsided, but the problem hasn't gone away. It needs \nto be addressed, and it needs to be addressed now.\n  As I said, we have an obligation as Members of this body and of the \nCongress to be honest and straightforward with the American people \nabout where we stand and what we will do about it.\n  I received a letter from one of my constituents, Steven of \nMartinsville, Indiana. Steven wrote to me to describe his concerns \nabout our national debt and spending. Let me quote from his letter:\n\n       As of today, the outstanding national debt is over $18 \n     trillion. That is an overly exorbitant amount of money.\n\n  It certainly is, Steven. You are right. It is an exorbitant amount of \nmoney--one we can hardly even get our minds around in terms of what $18 \ntrillion means.\n  Steven continued:\n\n       Therefore, I would like to know our options in America.\n\n  I think we as elected officials have an obligation to list those \noptions and describe what we would do about it if we had the \nopportunity and the support from the President, which is not \nforthcoming, but perhaps it will be. Surely even the executive branch \nand the President have to understand the situation we are in and the \nconsequences of not doing something about it.\n  I am sure my colleagues received many letters and information from \nconstituents who are concerned about the health of our Nation, from our \nmounting Federal debt, to our management--or I suppose I could say \nmismanagement of the Federal budget. Our constituents want to know what \nwe, as their elected officials, are going to do about it.\n  What is plain as day to Steven, unfortunately, is not so clear here \nin Washington because the President says we don't have a spending \nproblem, we have a revenue problem. I can't go home to people in \nIndiana and tell them that we need to tax more because government is \ngrowing and needs their money, and do so without derision coming back \nmy way because people are being taxed to death. This President has an \nobsession with solving every conceivable problem by asking for more \nrevenue and more taxes. The revenue is increasing; yet we have not \nplaced the necessary spending restraints to control this ever-growing \ndilemma of deficit spending.\n  I think there is only one real solution to our problem--a solution \nthat is absolutely necessary because we literally have tried everything \nelse and come up short--and that solution is for this body to pass a \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment. That is why I am cosponsoring \nan amendment to the United States Constitution that forces the Federal \nGovernment to balance its budget, limits the growth of government \nspending, and that requires a supermajority to pass any tax increase. \nWithout these measures, we will not successfully deal with this \nproblem.\n  This is not a new idea. I served here in 1995 and again in 1997. I \nvoted for a balanced budget amendment to limit spending and require the \nFederal Government to balance its checkbook. Both times, the Senate \ncame one vote short of the necessary two-thirds to pass the \nconstitutional amendment and send it to the States for ratification. \nOne vote--one Member out of 100--could have voted with us, and we would \nhave put ourselves on the path towards a balanced budget. We would not \nhave begun to have the problems of ever-increasing debt, ever-\nincreasing new taxes to cover that debt, and constriction in terms of \nspending for national priorities, such as defense and health research. \nUnfortunately, it didn't. When the amendment failed in 1997, our \nnation's debt stood at $5.36 trillion. Our debt is about three and a \nhalf times larger today. If we had had the political will to act then, \nwe would not be faced with the financial challenges that exist today.\n  By passing a balanced budget amendment, we can send to the States not \njust a message that we are serious about addressing our fiscal woes, \nbut that we are giving them a voice, we are giving people a voice, and \nwe are giving them the power to hold Federal spending accountable. It \nwould be a unique opportunity to right a wrong and begin restoring our \nfiscal house by making the Federal Government accountable for its \nspending.\n  In March of 1997 I stood on this very floor and warned about the \ndangers of operating outside our means. I said it then, and I would \nlike to say it again today. I am quoting from what I said in 1997:\n\n       There is no reliable check on this process of \n     intergenerational theft. It is politically prudent, even \n     popular, and this political calculation will not change, will \n     never permanently change without some kind of systematic \n     institutional counterweight, without some measure to give \n     posterity a voice in our affairs. Nothing, in my view, will \n     permanently change until the accumulation of popular debt is \n     a violation of our oath to the Constitution. Perverse \n     incentives of the current system will not be altered until \n     the system itself is altered, until our political interests \n     are balanced by the weighty words of a constitutional \n     amendment. It would be a much needed balance.\n\n  We need to come to this body at the beginning of each session and put \nour left hand on the Bible and our right hand forward and swear to \nuphold the Constitution, which would involve responsible spending to \nkeep us from plunging into disastrous consequences.\n  I mentioned earlier that Steven from Martinsville, IN, sent me this \nletter. What I did not mention is that Steven is a Boy Scout working \ntoward his Citizenship in the Nation merit badge, which teaches Scouts \nhow to become active citizens who are aware of and grateful for their \nliberties and their rights.\n  We all know that Boy Scouts take this oath--the oath to be \ntrustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, \ncheerful, brave, clean, reverent, and thrifty. If we just take one of \nthose principles, thrifty, and apply it to our governing, then America \nwould be in a better place.\n  We cannot fail Steven, and we cannot fail his generation. His share \nof the debt will amount to more than $62,000 in 10 years. Let's not \nkeep shifting the hard choices to our children and grandchildren. Let's \nnot deny them the opportunity at the American dream that all of us in \nmy generation have enjoyed. The opportunity that comes with responsible \nspending and a responsible government. Opportunity that comes to few \npeople in the world. We are so privileged as Americans to have that, \nand we are denying that to the future. By passing this balanced budget \namendment, we can honor the moral tradition of sacrificing for \nposterity instead of asking posterity to sacrifice for us.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/12/senate-section/article/S955-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Department of Homeland Security Funding\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I always try to be accurate in what I \nsay on the floor. Having been trained before Federal judges for almost \n15 years, practicing law, if you said something out of line, you got \nhammered for it.\n  My friend, very good friend and colleague, the Democratic whip, \nSenator Durbin, earlier today came to the floor and said: Mr. \nPresident, I have been trying to understand what is holding up the \nfunding for the Department of Homeland Security.\n  I would ask my colleague Senator Durbin: Have you ever heard of a \nfilibuster? What about the filibuster you are leading to block the bill \nthat funds Homeland Security? I mean how much more obvious can the \nanswer be to what is holding up funding for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, the House-passed legislation?\n  It is good legislation, to my knowledge. There is very little dispute \nabout the agencies and the departments in Homeland Security in terms of \nwhat they would get in terms of funding. They simply said that the \nextra-lawful actions of President Obama would not be funded.\n  The Los Angeles Times now says that this executive amnesty could cost \nup to $484 million. I think it will be much more. The Los Angeles Times \nisn't counting the cost to State and local governments, welfare costs, \ntax costs. This is just their idea of what it will cost to give lawful \nstatus to 5 million people. It is going to cost more than that. But \n$484 million is still a lot of money.\n  Congress, the House of Representatives, said: Mr. President, we don't \nagree with this policy and your policy is unlawful. You said 20 times \nyourself you don't have the power to do this. Constitutional scholars \nsay that. It is an erosion of our power and, based on the fact that we \ndon't like the policy and we think it is unlawful policy, we are going \nto fund Homeland Security, we are just not going to allow you to take \nmoney from enforcement of homeland security laws to reward people who \nviolated the laws.\n  Isn't that a responsible thing for Congress to do? Isn't it an \nabsolute fact that Congress has the power to fund what it desires to \nfund and not fund what it does not desire to fund? That is the power of \nthe purse, vested in the coequal branch of Congress. It is Congress's \nfundamental power.\n  Senator Durbin is now leading the filibuster. We have had a series of \nvotes. He has been able to get every single Democrat to vote with him \nto block even going to the bill, even allowing a bill to come up on the \nfloor of the Senate for debate and amendment.\n  If he wants to offer language that says we want to ratify what the \nPresident did and allow all this to happen, he is free to offer that \namendment on the floor of the Senate. But he is not even attempting to \ndo that. He is basically saying we are not going to allow the bill to \ncome up for a vote, and we are going to blame the Republicans for \nblocking the bill.\n  What kind of world are we living in? I have suggested that is \n``through the looking glass.'' We have the people leading the \nfilibuster accusing the House and Republicans in the Senate for \nblocking the bill when they, indeed, are the ones doing it.\n  He also quoted our fine colleague Senator Flake to say: To attempt to \nuse the spending bill to try to poke a finger in the President's eye is \nnot a good move, in my mind.\n  I agree with that, we shouldn't be using a spending bill to poke the \nPresident in the eye. But I suggest to my colleagues that the President \nis the one who has poked the American people in the eye, he has poked \nthe rights and powers of Congress in the eye by taking money that was \nassigned and given to Homeland Security to enforce the laws of the \nUnited States. He is taking out money and spending it at this very \nmoment to undermine and to violate the laws of the United States.\n  Colleagues, the law of the United States--we have a lot of laws--says \nthat an employer, for example, cannot hire somebody unlawfully in the \ncountry.\n  So the President's proposal: Well, I am going to make 5 million \npeople who are unlawful today lawful. I am going to give them a photo \nID, I am going to give them a right to work, a Social Security number, \nand the right to participate in Social Security and Medicare, because I \nam angry that Congress wouldn't pass it.\n  Senator Durbin says this--and our colleagues who have been leading \nthe filibuster have been saying this--repeatedly.\n  It is impossible to explain the situation, quoting Senator Durbin, \nwhere the agency ``with the premier responsibility to keep America safe \nis not being adequately funded.''\n  He goes on to say that again about placing America at risk.\n  I would ask a couple of questions. How does taking funding from the \nlawful, authorized policies of Homeland Security that are supposed to \nidentify people unlawfully here, to identify terrorists, and do other \nthings to make America safe--how does taking the money from them, to \ngive legal status to 5 million illegal aliens make us safer?\n  Does that make us safer? How absurd is that?\n  Ken Palinkas, who is head of the union of CIS workers, the National \nCitizenship and Immigration Services Council, said:\n\n       Unfortunately--and perilously overlooked in Washington--our \n     caseworkers are denied the urgent professional resources, \n     enforcement tools, and mission support we need to keep out \n     those who are bent on doing us harm.\n\n  This is processing the 1 million or so per year who are given lawful \nstatus in America. He is not referring to the future when they are \ngoing to be expected to process--immediately, apparently--5 million \nmore. They don't have money to process the people today. These are his \nwords, not mine, in a letter dated September of last year. He said:\n\n       The 9/11 hijackers got into the U.S. on visas and now, 13 \n     years later, we have around 5 million immigrants in the \n     United States who overstayed their visas--many from high-risk \n     regions in the Middle East. Making matters more dangerous, \n     the Obama Administration's executive amnesty, like S. 744 \n     that he unsuccessfully lobbied for, would legalize visa \n     overstays and cause millions additionally to overstay--\n     raising the threat level to America even higher.\n\n  That is what the people who enforce the law every day are saying.\n  In January of this year, a few weeks ago, January 22, Mr. Palinkas \nsaid:\n\n       The President's executive amnesty--\n\n  And that is what they are objecting to. That is what the people who \nare filibustering this bill today are doing. They are protecting, \nadvancing, supporting, and attempting to fund the President's unlawful \namnesty.\n  Mr. Palinkas, whose duty it is to enforce these laws, said:\n\n       The President's executive amnesty order for 5 million \n     illegal immigrants places the mission of USCIS [that is the \n     immigration service] in grave peril. Instead of meeting our \n     lawful function to protect the Homeland and keep out those \n     who pose a threat to U.S. security, health, or finances, our \n     officers will be assigned to process amnesty for individuals \n     residing illegally inside our nation's borders. This \n     compromises national security and public safety, while \n     undermining officer morale.\n\n  That is exactly right. You don't have to be a real expert to \nunderstand he is exactly right about this.\n  He continues:\n\n       The Administration's skewed priorities means that the \n     Crystal City amnesty processing center will likely have \n     superior worksite conditions for personnel relative to our \n     normal processing centers. Additionally, the security \n     protocols at place in this facility will be insufficient to \n     engage in any basic screening precautions, ensuring and \n     rewarding massive amounts of fraud. For the administration to \n     continue down this course after the Paris attacks is beyond \n     belief.\n\n  This is what we are dealing with. In October of last year, Mr. \nPalinkas, when the President was proposing this amnesty before it \nhappened, issued a statement on behalf of his workers and his \ncolleagues in the immigration service. He concludes in his statement:\n\n       That is why this statement is intended for the public. If \n     you care about your immigration security and your \n     neighborhood security, you must act now to ensure that \n     Congress stops this unilateral amnesty. Let your voice be \n     heard and spread the word to your neighbors. We who serve in \n     our nation's immigration agencies are pleading for your \n     help--don't let it happen. Express your concern to your \n     Senators and Congressmen before it is too late.\n\n\n[[Page S957]]\n\n\n  Well, that is what it is all about. The President 20 times said he \ndid not have the power to do such a thing, but he--under political \npressure, I suppose, or just an overreach on his part--decided to do it \nanyway. He said he didn't have the power to do this. Now he has acted \non it, even though the officers pleaded for him to not do it, even \nthough an overwhelming majority of the American people said don't do \nit, even though at least nine Democratic colleagues who were supporting \nthis filibuster said the President didn't have the power or shouldn't \ndo it this way, that these kinds of decisions are part of Congress's \npower.\n  Mr. President, don't do it, is what they said. Yet all nine of them \nare now standing in lockstep to block the funding of homeland security \nthat funds every part of homeland security--it just doesn't fund this \nbuilding they have leased across the river in Crystal City that is \nsupposed to process up to 5 million people.\n  Colleagues, I want you to know it is absolutely true they will not \neven have face-to-face interviews with these applicants. This is going \nto be coming in by mail and computer. They will eventually be sent \nsomeplace to get a photo ID, they will be given a work permit to take \nany job in America, and the right to participate in Social Security and \nMedicare, weakening both of those programs over the long term, without \nany doubt.\n  That is what is occurring without congressional approval. This is \ngoing to cost hundreds of millions of dollars just in the process.\n  But what I want Senator Durbin to know is this is going to weaken \nnational security. Because if someone is here to do harm to America--\nperhaps they are a drug dealer or they are a terrorist and they want to \ndo criminal acts in America, and they have a record--they are not going \nto ask for the amnesty. They are going to stay and continue to work \ntheir wicked will. That is what they are going to do. Nobody is going \nto go look for them. Nobody is looking for them now, and nobody will be \nlooking for them then. It will be business as usual.\n  But if you came here with a bad purpose--terrorism, drug dealing, \nother criminal activity--and you don't have a criminal record, you will \njust call in, send an email in, get your identity, and be allowed to \npermanently operate in the United States.\n  And colleagues, the American people, I think, understand this. Nobody \nis going to investigate anything, other than maybe to run a computer \nbackground check--a computer check to see if there is a criminal record \nout there. There is no way anybody is going to go back and try to \nverify whether someone has actually been in the country a number of \nyears, verify family relations. They are not going to go back to some \nschool to see if they actually graduated. There are no people to do \nthat. This is just a blanket approval for people who apply, basically. \nYou send in a few documents, and you are in. There is no capability of \ndoing anything other than that.\n  So the President has just made a big mistake--a big mistake--and \nCongress needs to push back. Congress has the power to consider what \nkind of policies we want to set with regard to immigration. Those have \nbeen set. It is unlawful for people unlawfully in America to work in \nAmerica and to participate in Social Security and all of those \nprograms. It is just unlawful to do that. The President is violating \nthat law in issuing directives through these departments and agencies \nto Federal employees, and those employees are protesting dramatically, \nbut nobody seems to care.\n  Congress is the one body that is supposed to stand up to that, and \nthe House of Representatives has done so. They passed a bill that would \nstop this activity, that says: we will not authorize the expenditure of \nany money to carry out this plan that Congress has not approved, that \nundermines the laws we have in place, and that--as Palinkas and other \nofficers have told us--will encourage more people to come to America \nunlawfully, further decimating any integrity the system has.\n  We issued a 49-page document of 200 different actions taken since \nPresident Obama has been in office that undermine the moral integrity \nof the immigration system, making it more and more difficult to \nmaintain even a modicum of legality in the system. His actions are \ncontinuing to erode that--the most dramatic, of course, being this \nExecutive Amnesty. So we are just supposed to accept this.\n  This isn't a personal issue to attack President Obama or any of our \ncolleagues. It is a big American policy issue. It is a huge issue for \nthis country, and we need to understand it. It is a constitutional \nquestion as well as a policy question.\n  The constitutional question, which the House of Representatives \nunderstands, is that Congress appropriates money. Congress has no duty \nto placate the President of the United States when he wants to carry on \nan activity that Congress chooses not to fund. Congress has a duty to \nhistory and to generations yet unborn to defend and protect its power \nof the purse. Congress has to do that.\n  I plead with and say to my colleagues that those who know the \nPresident overreached on this, this is the time, this is the bill when \nwe should fix this. Passage of this bill without the language of the \nHouse would basically fund all of the Executive Amnesty. It would not \nblock funding of this activity. To take out the House language and to \npass what our colleagues want to pass--a bill that makes no reference \nto the Executive Amnesty--takes no action to stop that activity; that \nis, it ratifies it. It is in effect a financial ratification of an \nunconstitutional overreach by the executive branch that will have \nramifications in the future that we can't even imagine today.\n  Somebody asked the question--and I think it is a valid analogy--what \nif the President wanted to reduce the tax rate from 39 percent to 25 \npercent and Congress wouldn't pass it. So he tells all of his IRS \nagents--they work for him--don't collect any money over 25 percent. He \nsays to the people: Don't send in money more than 25 percent. I told \nthe agents not to collect more than 25 percent.\n  Is that so far-fetched, if this were to pass?\n  What the President is saying is, I know the law says you can't work \nhere. I know the law says you are supposed to be removed if you are \nhere illegally. I know all of these things, but we are just not going \nto do it. Not only am I not going to enforce the law with regard to \nimmigration, but what I am going to do is I am going declare you as \nlawful. I am going to give you Social Security numbers and work \npermits.\n  A recent report from a liberal group, the Economic Policy Institute, \nannounced on February 10 that the unemployed exceed job openings in \nalmost every industry in America.\n  We know unemployment is exceedingly high, and we know that we have \nhigh job unemployment in the country. Remember, the unemployment rate \nwe see today does not include people who drop out of the workforce, it \nonly reflects those people who are underemployed and looking for more \nwork or people who are actually seeking employment aggressively and \nhave signed up on the unemployment rolls in efforts to get a job.\n  This indicates that in the big industry we used to hear a lot from--\nthe construction industry--there are six times as many construction \nworkers as there are job openings. Even for professional and business \nservices they are higher. In retail trade there are far more applicants \nthan jobs. It goes on and on, sector after sector.\n  So remember, at a time of this high unemployment, we are also going \nto be legalizing 5 million people to take jobs. We know we have to get \nover 200,000 jobs created in a month--that it takes 180,000 or \n200,000--just to stay level with the growth in the population of \nAmerica. We have been slightly above that recently, and there has been \na lot of positive spin about that. But we still have the lowest \npercentage of Americans in their working years actually working that we \nhave had in this country in 40 years.\n  Income is down $4,000 since 2007 for middle-class working families. \nThe median income is down $4,000 since 2007. So how is this good for \nlawful immigrants, permanent residents, American citizens? How is it \ngood to bring in even more workers at a time when we have the smallest \npercentage of Americans in the workforce in 40 years? I point to 40 \nyears ago because we began to see a lot more women working in\n\n[[Page S958]]\n\nthose years, so this is a reversal of that trend.\n  What do the American people think about it? Here is some Paragon Poll \ndata that says by a more than 2-to-1 margin Americans strongly oppose \nrather than strongly support the President's Executive actions. Blue \ncollar and middle class workers strongly oppose the President's action \nby more than a 3-to-1 majority. By a 50-point margin, voters want \nCongress to pass legislation making it harder for companies to hire \nworkers now illegally in the country--71 to 21.\n  The American people want to make it harder. Their children, their \nhusbands, their wives are looking for work and not finding any. They \nwant to have a decent wage, a rising wage, and a chance to get a job. \nSo this is a 50-point margin. Remember, the President's action--far \nfrom making it harder for people to get a job--is going to provide a \nphoto ID, work authorizations, and Social Security numbers to 5 million \npeople unlawfully here. Almost all of those are adults, frankly.\n  Just to show how people feel about this and how strongly they feel \nabout it, Kellyanne Conway's polling data shows that by a 75-to-8 \nmargin Americans say companies should raise wages instead of allowing \nmore immigrant workers to fill jobs.\n  People would like to see a pay raise around here for a change. \nSalaries dropped 5 cents in December. We are not doing nearly as well \nas some would like to say. That is a Department of Labor statistic--a \ngovernment statistic--that says that.\n  How about this? What about people who have the hardest time finding \nwork right now. African Americans, according to the Conway poll, by an \n86-to-3 margin say companies should raise wages instead of allowing \nmore immigrant workers to take jobs. For Hispanics that is true by a \nmargin of 71 to 11. So by a 71-to-11 margin, Hispanics in America say \ncompanies should raise wages instead of bringing in more workers to \ntake jobs, pulling wages down. That is what the market says.\n  So let's go back to the morality of all of this, which is \nfundamental. We as members of Congress represent the people of the \nUnited States. That includes immigrants, recent immigrants--naturalized \ncitizens--living here today. It includes native-born citizens. That is \nwho our obligation is to. So we need to ask ourselves, how are we \nhelping them at a time of difficult wage conditions, difficult job \nconditions, while allowing a surge of workers to come to compete for \nthe few jobs there are? Is that fulfilling our duty to the voters, to \nthe electors who sent us here? I think not.\n  I think it is time for somebody to focus on the needs of people who \ngo to work every day, who have had their hours reduced, who have had \ntheir wages decline, who have had their spouses and children having a \nhard time finding work. That is what is happening.\n  To repeat for my good friend Senator Durbin, who says he has been \ntrying to understand what is holding up the funding for the Department \nof Homeland Security, let me answer that question. The House has passed \na bill. They have sent it to the Senate. More than a majority of the \nSenators have voted to pass a bill and fund the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. And you, as the Democratic whip, are leading the filibuster \nto block it from even coming up on the floor so amendments can be \noffered.\n  That is the answer to your question. So I don't think you should \ncontinue blaming Republicans for not attempting to fund Homeland \nSecurity. The whole world knows who is blocking the bill that funds \nHomeland Security: You and your team of filibusterers.\n\n  That is what it is. There is no doubt about that, and we need to get \nthis straight. I don't believe the American people are going to be \nmisled by that argument. I believe they are going to know what is \nhappening in this Senate and why we have this difficulty.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate will vote later today on the \nconfirmation of Dr. Ashton Carter to fill a critically important \nCabinet position, that of Secretary of Defense. I think we all know Dr. \nCarter is a dedicated and distinguished public servant. He has actually \nbeen confirmed twice, unanimously, to two senior positions at the \nPentagon. He has been recognized as a four-time recipient of the \nDepartment of Defense Distinguished Service Medal, and he has been \nawarded the Defense Intelligence Medal. I have no doubt the vote today \nin support of Dr. Carter will be overwhelmingly favorable.\n  The Defense Department faces important, timely, and difficult \ndecisions in the coming months and years. They have to learn how best \nto balance what we know are our fiscal constraints with not only \nexisting but emerging international challenges. Dr. Carter served as \nthe day-to-day financial officer of the Pentagon, so he is one of the \nfew people who understand the complexities of the Pentagon's budget. I \nbelieve that Dr. Carter will build upon the fine work of Secretary \nHagel to chart a path toward fiscal accountability while maintaining \nthe kind of military capabilities we need to face current global \nthreats.\n  Dr. Carter is receiving his confirmation vote just over a week after \nhe testified before the Armed Services Committee and two days after his \nnomination was reported to the full Senate, and that swift action is \ncommendable. But I want to contrast how his nomination was handled as \ncompared to Loretta Lynch's for Attorney General.\n\n\n                            Lynch Nomination\n\n  It is a disappointment that contrary to what was done for Dr. Carter, \nRepublicans on the Judiciary Committee chose to hold over for another \ntwo weeks another critical nomination, that of Loretta Lynch to be the \nAttorney General of the United States, the Nation's chief law \nenforcement officer.\n  Loretta Lynch is a renowned prosecutor, twice unanimously confirmed \nby the Senate. She has worked to put criminals behind bars for such \ncrimes as terrorism and fraud. Some Members of this body said these \nterrorists should be held in Guantanamo because we, the most powerful \nnation on earth, should be afraid to try them in our Federal courts--\nthe best court system in the world. She showed a lot more courage. She \nsaid, we will try these terrorists in our Federal courts, and we will \nshow the rest of the world America is not afraid--and it worked. She \ngot convictions. Now, the President announced the nomination of Ms. \nLynch nearly one hundred days ago. It has been more than two weeks \nsince she testified before the Judiciary Committee. In addition to \nnearly eight hours of live testimony, she has responded to more than \n600 written questions. Her nomination has been pending for longer than \nany modern Attorney General nominee.\n  I contrast this to another nominee. In 2007, Democrats, who had been \nin the minority, took back over control of the Senate. President Bush \nhad had an Attorney General, a man who, by just about any objective \nstandard, had been a disaster. He was removed, and President Bush \nnominated Michael Mukasey to serve as Attorney General. It took only 53 \ndays from the time his nomination was announced to his confirmation. \nThat included doing all of the background checks and having the \nhearings. And then, after Mr. Mukasey's hearing, of course under our \nrules we could have held his nomination over in Committee, but I asked \nthe Committee not to and we did not. While I ultimately voted against \nMr. Mukasey because of his responses relating to questions on torture, \nas Chairman I made sure to have the Committee act quickly on him. In \nfact, I held a special markup session in order for the Committee to be \nable to report his nomination as soon as possible, because the \nPresident should have an Attorney General--and he was confirmed by the \nSenate two days later. Now, Republicans should extend the same courtesy \nwith respect to Ms. Lynch's nomination to serve as the Nation's top law \nenforcement officer.\n  I look forward to working with Dr. Carter. I am not suggesting we \nshould hold him up because they are holding her up. Of course not. He \nshould be confirmed, as she should be confirmed, and\n\n[[Page S959]]\n\nI look forward to working with Dr. Carter on issues of great importance \nto Vermonters and to the Nation, particularly concerning our continued \ndiplomatic efforts to end Iran's nuclear program, in halting and \nreversing the proliferation of landmines around the world, in \nresponsibly managing the Pentagon, and in supporting our servicemembers \nat home and abroad.\n  And I look forward to working with Loretta Lynch when the Senate \nultimately confirms her nomination, as it will. I urge the Republican \nLeader to serve the national interest by scheduling a confirmation vote \non her nomination as soon as she is reported by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee on February 26. She has already waited far longer for a \nconfirmation vote than any Attorney General in modern history, and she \nshould be confirmed just as Dr. Carter is going to be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to join my friend and colleague \nfrom Rhode Island, Senator Reed, in supporting the nomination of Dr. \nAsh Carter to be Secretary of Defense. I am confident Senator Reed and \nI feel we have had a very good nomination hearing and that Dr. Carter \nis qualified to be the Secretary of Defense.\n  I have known Dr. Carter for many years during his lengthy service in \nWashington. He is one of America's most experienced defense \nprofessionals, respected by Republicans and Democrats alike.\n  He has served as Assistant Secretary of Defense for Global Strategic \nAffairs, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and \nLogistics, and most recently as Deputy Secretary of Defense. In these \npositions, I have known him to be an honest, hard-working, and \ncommitted public servant. I have had the opportunity to work together \nwith Dr. Carter on several issues of shared concern, especially trying \nto reform the Defense Acquisition System, improving financial \nmanagement of the Department, and repealing and rolling back \nsequestration.\n  I was also pleased to hear Dr. Carter explain his views on a number \nof critical national security issues at his confirmation hearing \nearlier this month.\n  On Afghanistan Dr. Carter told the committee he would consider \nrevisions to the size and pace of the President's drawdown plan if \nsecurity conditions warranted. To achieve the success that is possible \nthere, he urged the United States to ``continue its campaign and finish \nthe job.''\n  Dr. Carter indicated he is very much inclined in the direction of \nproviding defensive lethal arms to help Ukraine resist Russian \naggression.\n  He pledged to do more to streamline and improve the Defense \nAcquisition System that takes too long and costs too much, and Dr. \nCarter agreed it is time to roll back sequestration because, in his \nwords, ``it introduces turbulence and uncertainty that are wasteful, \nand it conveys a misleadingly diminished picture of our power in the \neyes of friends and foes alike.''\n  America is confronted with a diverse and complex range of national \nsecurity challenges. A revisionist Russia, a rising China, and radical \nIslamist groups each seeking in their own way to fundamentally \nchallenge the international order as we have known it since the end of \nWorld War II, a system that cherishes the rule of law, maintains free \nmarkets and free trade, and relegates wars of aggression to their \nrightful place in the bloody past.\n  We need a coherent national security strategy incorporating all \nelements of America's national power to sustain and defend the \ninternational order that has produced and extended security, \nprosperity, and liberty across the globe.\n  We need to stop holding our military hostage to domestic political \ndisputes and send an unmistakable message to friend and foe alike that \nAmerica intends to lead in the 21st century by repealing sequestration \nimmediately.\n  We need to reform our Defense Acquisition System to restore \nconfidence that every defense dollar is spent well and to ensure that \nthe men and women in uniform are getting the training and equipment \nthey need on time and at a cost acceptable to the taxpayer.\n  That is why America needs a strong Secretary of Defense now more than \never. I think Dr. Carter will be a good Secretary of Defense, who will \nalways keep faith with our men and women in uniform and work tirelessly \non their behalf and that of our national security. I am hopeful about \nthe prospects of working together with Dr. Carter, along with my \ncolleagues in the Senate Committee on Armed Services on both sides of \nthe aisle, to achieve our shared priorities, especially the reform of \nour Defense Acquisition System, the modernization of our military \ncompensation system, and the repeal of sequestration.\n  But when it comes to much of our national security policy, I must \ncandidly express concern about the task that awaits Dr. Carter and the \nlimited influence he may have.\n  Two of his predecessors, Secretary Gates and Secretary Panetta, have \nseverely criticized White House micromanagement of the Defense \nDepartment and overcentralization of foreign and defense \npolicies. According to numerous news reports, Secretary Hagel \nexperienced similar frustrations with the insular and indecisive White \nHouse national security team over issues ranging from ISIL to Ukraine, \ndetention policy to sequestration.\n\n  Dr. Carter is a worthy choice for Secretary of Defense. He has the \nexperience, knowledge, and skill to succeed. The Armed Services \nCommittee voted unanimously to approve his nomination last week, and I \nwill gladly vote to confirm him today. I do so with sincere hope, and \nsadly, little confidence that the President who nominated Dr. Carter \nwill empower him to lead and contribute to the fullest extent of his \nabilities. At a time of global upheaval and multiplying threats to our \nsecurity, the American people need and deserve nothing less.\n  I thank my colleague from Rhode Island for his cooperation and \ncoordination with the hearing and for his input and influence which led \nto a unanimous vote from the committee.\n  I yield the floor for my friend and colleague from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I commend the chairman for his very clear \nand thoughtful conduct of these hearings with respect to Dr. Carter. \nThe reason we are here today on the verge of a very strong vote for Dr. \nCarter to be the next Secretary of Defense is due to the contribution \nthat Chairman McCain has made to this process, which was extremely \nthoughtful and bipartisan. I thank him again for that.\n  Mr. President, I join Senator McCain, and I not only commend him for \nhis leadership but I also wish to express my strong support for the \nnomination of Dr. Ashton Carter to be the 25th Secretary of Defense. \nDr. Carter is uniquely qualified to lead the Department of Defense at a \ntime when--as Henry Kissinger recently said in a hearing before the \nArmed Services Committee--``the United States has not faced a more \ndiverse and complex array of crises since the end of the Second World \nWar.''\n  Dr. Carter was born and raised in Philadelphia. He received a \nbachelor's degree in physics and medieval history from Yale and a \ndoctorate in theoretical physics from Oxford, where he was a Rhodes \nScholar.\n  During his career, Dr. Carter has already held three critical \npositions in the Department of Defense: Assistant Secretary of Defense \nfor Global and Strategic Affairs in the Clinton administration; Under \nSecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics from \n2009 to 2011; and most recently, Deputy Secretary of Defense from 2011 \nto 2013. He is well aware of, and has already been deeply immersed in, \nmany of the significant challenges facing this Nation and the Defense \nDepartment.\n  As Deputy Secretary of Defense, Dr. Carter was a critical player in \nthe discussions and decision making on a myriad of international \nissues--issues that will continue to need the close attention in his \ntenure as Secretary of Defense.\n  I wish to name just a few. While the Secretary of Defense is not a \nparty to the negotiations relating to Iran's nuclear program, the \nSecretary will undoubtedly be responsible for any number of potential \ncontingencies. In the event of a breakdown in the negotiations, the \nconsequences could alter the face of the region for generations and \ngenerations to come, and the Secretary\n\n[[Page S960]]\n\nof Defense will be intimately involved in shaping the reaction.\n  Another area of deep concern is ISIL. Their violent campaign in Iraq \nand Syria to establish an extremist caliphate threatens to erase \nborders, destabilize the region, and create a breeding ground for \nforeign fighters willing to return to the West to carry out attacks \nagainst the United States and our allies. The Department must provide \ncritical leadership in a coalition effort that includes Arab and Muslim \nStates to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL while being careful to \nensure that the United States does not end up, as Brent Scowcroft and \nDr. Brzezinski indicated to us in a hearing before the committee, \n``owning'' some of these conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.\n  In Afghanistan the hard-won gains of the past decade are significant \nbut remain fragile. As the Afghan National Security Forces continue \ntaking over responsibilities to secure Afghanistan, the United States \nand coalition forces have transitioned to a more limited mission of \ntraining and assisting the Afghan forces and conducting \ncounterterrorism operations. Yet it remains to be seen whether \nconditions on the ground in Afghanistan will improve sufficiently by \nthe end of 2016 to warrant the pace of further reductions under the \ncurrent plan. Dr. Carter's participation in evaluating that plan will \nbe absolutely critical.\n  Russia's aggression against Ukraine has raised tensions in Europe to \na level not seen in decades. Recently separatists in eastern Ukraine, \nwith substantial Russian equipment, training, and leadership, have \nabandoned any pretext of a cease-fire, although there were discussions \nthat were held overnight that perhaps might indicate a cease-fire. But \nin any case, the United States must determine the best way to support \nthe Ukrainian people and their forces in defending their country.\n  Political instability in Yemen has caused the United States to \nevacuate its Embassy and created a vacuum, allowing the free reign of \nAl Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which is intent on striking the \nUnited States and its interests. Again, the Defense Department plays a \nkey role in supporting our partners in Yemen and navigating the complex \npolitical situation and continuing to have a presence there--which they \ndo--which can effectively help to preempt any attempt to use that as a \nlaunching pad for operations in the region or across the globe.\n  The same brand of violent extremism in the Middle East can also be \nfound in parts of Africa--al-Shabaab in Somalia, Al Qaeda in the Lands \nof the Islamic Maghreb, and Boko Haram in Nigeria. Countering the \nthreat posed by these groups will require building partner capacity and \nenabling support to foreign security forces at a time when resources \nare scarce and those capabilities are in high demand.\n  In North Korea, Kim Jong Un's regime has increased tensions on the \npeninsula with his provocative and belligerent behavior. The recent \ncyber attack on Sony is just the latest in a string of destabilizing \nactions. The regime is playing a dangerous game that could have \ndisastrous consequences--especially for its own civilian population \nwhich has already suffered untold hardships and deprivation under his \nleadership. The North Korean regime is painting itself into a corner \nwhere it will be left with few friends and few options, and again, the \nUnited States, and particularly the Department of Defense, must be ever \nvigilant.\n  While the United States and China have many areas of coordination and \ncooperation, our future relationship remains uncertain. We welcome the \nrise of a peaceful and prosperous China. Especially in this new century \nof global commerce and economies, a prosperous China is not only in the \nregion's best interests but also in the world's best interest. China's \nincreasingly controversial claims of sovereignty in the South China Sea \nand dangerous altercations with its neighbors raise serious concerns. \nWhile legal and peaceful avenues for dispute resolution are available, \nChina has instead chosen to pursue, in too many cases, adversarial and \nunilateral actions that raise questions about its intentions.\n  On the cyber front, China is engaged in massive theft of U.S. \nintellectual property from American industry and government, which \nthreatens our technological edge and sows distrust and profound \nmisgivings. China will remain one of the Department's most persistent \nand complicated challenges. With the focus on so many crises overseas, \nit is easy to overlook the challenges on our own continent. We have a \nviolent threat of transnational organized crime in our own hemisphere. \nWhen the United States faced a threat stemming from violence and the \ndrug trade in Colombia in the 1990s, it dedicated significant resources \nand entered into a decade-long commitment to provide training and other \nenabling assistance.\n  Colombia is a success story, but the problem has simply moved, in \nmany cases, to other nations in the region. General Kelly, Commander of \nU.S. Southern Command, leads the Department's efforts in the \nhemisphere, but he operates with scarce resources, a situation that may \nhave serious consequences.\n  In addition to these traditional challenges that nation-states have \nfaced for many, many years, the United States now faces new 21st \ncentury threats. For years we have devoted significant attention to the \ncomplex challenge of cyber warfare. The attack on the Sony Corporation \nwas a watershed event in many respects, and it should and must \nstimulate fresh critical thinking. This attack demonstrated that a \nrelatively small and weak rogue nation can reach across the oceans to \ncause extensive destruction to a U.S.-based economic target and very \nnearly succeed in suppressing freedom of expression through cyber \nspace.\n  The real and manifest advantages of the offense over the defense in \ncyber warfare that enable militarily inferior nations to strike \nsuccessfully against the homeland are a new and worrisome factor for \nour national security and that requires not only the attention of the \nDepartment of Defense but the attention of the Congress.\n  All of the issues I have talked about are external, but there are \nlocal issues that the Secretary of Defense has to deal with. Senator \nMcCain pointed out probably the most significant one, and that is the \nbudgetary and programmatic challenges that have been forced upon us by \nsequestration.\n  The most immediate threat facing the Defense Department is, indeed, \nsequestration because without resources, the programs, the policies, \nand the initiatives which must be undertaken to confront these national \nthreats cannot be done.\n  General Mattis, former Commander of Central Command, recently \ntestified before our committee. He said: ``No foe in the field can \nwreak such havoc on our security that mindless sequestration is \nachieving today.''\n  Only one-third of Army brigades are ready to fight. Less than 50 \npercent of our combat squadrons are fully combat ready. Sequestration \nthreatens not only our national security, but it risks damaging our \npublic safety, our health, our transportation, our education, and our \nenvironment. In the world we face, there is not a neat distinction \nbetween what the Department of Defense does, what the Department of \nHomeland Security does, and what other civil agencies such as FEMA must \ndo. It is something that we have to consider, not just in the context \nof the Department of Defense but in so many other agencies of the \nFederal Government--in fact, in every agency of the Federal Government.\n  When the Budget Control Act was passed, Dr. Carter organized the \nStrategic Choices and Management Review to find options for \nimplementing the required defense cuts. The results of this review have \nhelped the Defense Department navigate through difficult fiscal \nconstraints, but Congress must find a balanced and bipartisan solution \nand a repeal of sequestration across the entire government.\n  Even without sequestration, the Defense Department has to tackle the \nrising personnel costs which could crowd out other items in the budget. \nCurrently, military personnel benefits, including health care and \nretirement, consume approximately one-third of the Defense Department's \nbudget.\n  If we are to adequately train and equip the force we have, to ensure \nthey are capable of performing the arduous task we ask of them, and to \nmodernize weapon systems, we must slow the growth of these costs within \nthe Department in line with the slowdown of the overall top line. The \ncongressionally mandated Military Compensation\n\n[[Page S961]]\n\nand Retirement Modernization Commission recently released their \nrecommendations. They are far-reaching and would fundamentally change \nmilitary personnel benefits. They did so with the idea of improving the \nbenefits available to many of our forces. They did it with the idea of \ninsisting that our recruitment and retention efforts continue to be \nsuccessful because we are a volunteer force. Their focus was really on \nthe troops, but one of the effects of the recommendations was to make \nthese costs sustainable over time.\n  As Secretary of Defense, Dr. Carter will have to work with Congress \nto carefully consider these recommendations to ensure that the \nDepartment has the resources to properly train and equip its fighting \nmen and women.\n  The other major cost driver in the Defense Department is acquisition. \nTo put it succinctly, defense acquisition takes too long and costs too \nmuch, but the Defense Department has undertaken significant reforms in \nrecent years and many of these were personally led by Dr. Carter.\n  As Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and \nLogistics, Dr. Carter oversaw implementation of the Weapons System \nAcquisition Reform Act of 2009, and again, I must commend Senator \nMcCain and Senator Levin for their leadership in this effort. The \nlargest restructuring of DOD acquisition policies in more than two \ndecades resulted from this initiative.\n  He also oversaw and contributed to improvements in a number of major \nacquisition programs, including the major restructuring on the Joint \nStrike Fighter program, the largest DOD acquisition program; efforts to \nreduce the cost of the Virginia-class submarine program and to improve \ncontract performance, which has allowed the Navy to begin a two-per-\nyear procurement program for these submarines, which are under budget \nand ahead of schedule--a remarkable achievement; improvements to the \nlittoral combat ship program, which was experiencing major costs \nincreases and delays, with Dr. Carter's participation DOD shifted to \ncompetitive fixed-price contracts in 2011; restructured procurement for \nthe Air Force's KC-46A strategic tanker program, which led to a \ncompetitive procurement, incorporating a firm fixed-price development \nproduction contract for buying up to 120 tanker aircraft; and \ncancelling of the VH-71 program, an out-of-control program to replace \nthe current Presidential helicopter fleet.\n\n  Clearly not all acquisition problems have been fixed and the Defense \nDepartment can and should do more to streamline and improve the system. \nI believe, from what I have just indicated, that Dr. Carter as \nSecretary of Defense will do just that. He has already demonstrated he \ncan do it and he will do it.\n  Finally, and most importantly, as Senator McCain indicated, if \nconfirmed as Secretary of Defense, Dr. Carter will be leading 1.3 \nmillion Active-Duty military, 820,000 Reserve and Guard, and 773,000 \ncivilians. They are under strain after over a decade of war and years \nof fiscal uncertainty. They are wrestling with many of the same issues \nas civilian society--issues such as sexual assault and suicide. Yet \nthey are committed to protecting this Nation and remain the finest \nforce in the world.\n  Every decision Dr. Carter makes, I know he will make it thinking \nultimately about what is in the best interests of the men and women in \nuniform and the DOD civilian workforce who give so much to this country \nevery day, and that, I think, is one of the factors that compels all of \nus to support this nomination.\n  Dr. Carter has proven time and time again his commitment to the men \nand women who serve this Nation. I believe he is the right leader at \nthe right time for the Department of Defense, and I urge my colleagues \nto support his confirmation.\n\n\n                    Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel\n\n  Mr. President, I would urge them also at this time to commend and \nthank Secretary Chuck Hagel for his service. It began decades ago as a \nyoung sergeant in Vietnam where he was wounded twice, where he fought \nin close combat against the enemies of the United States. He took this \nethic from his own experience of understanding that ultimately the \ndecisions made here in Washington are carried out by young men and \nwomen across this globe. In his tenure, he brought principled \nleadership, he brought a dedication to the men and women of the Armed \nForces, and he also looked ahead in many different ways. One notable \napproach was his complete review of the nuclear establishment, the \ntriad, not only in terms of its effectiveness but its security and its \nability to respond to the threats not just of the Cold War but of the \nnew world we face.\n  So for many reasons, he has done a remarkable job, and at this \njuncture, it is an opportunity to salute his efforts.\n\n\n                Department of Homeland Security Funding\n\n  Mr. President, I have concluded my remarks with respect to the \nnomination of Dr. Carter, but I wish to speak for a moment on a \ndifferent topic.\n  We are in the midst of trying to provide appropriations for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. It is an action we must take and we \nshould take and we should do it without extraneous policy provisions.\n  Over the past few weeks, the State of Rhode Island has been beset by \na series of snowstorms. In fact, the State could face another foot of \nsnow this weekend. In coordinating a response to a disaster such as \nthis, my State depends upon the Rhode Island Emergency Management \nAgency as well as local emergency managers. Those agencies, in turn, \ndepend on Federal funding through the Department of Homeland Security, \nparticularly the Emergency Management Performance grant and Homeland \nSecurity grant programs, to build the capacity they need to respond to \nsnowstorms, to hurricanes, and to natural disasters of all forms.\n  However, uncertainty about Federal funding makes it harder on my \nState to plan and prepare. It is harder for every State to plan and \nprepare. It is one of the many reasons we ought to pass the bipartisan \nbill that was negotiated by Democrats and Republicans on the Committee \non Appropriations without the provisions added by the House regarding \nimmigration.\n  A clean Department of Homeland Security bill would probably pass in \nthis Chamber by an overwhelming majority in a matter of minutes. We all \nunderstand the security of the United States--not just with respect to \nnatural disasters but with respect to many of the issues that are \nhanded off, if you will, from the Department of Defense to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. When we are worried, as we all are, \nabout the lone wolves who may be in combat zones but coming to the \nUnited States, that is quickly a Department of Homeland Security \nresponsibility. I don't think we want to confuse the issue of defending \nthe homeland and protecting communities from natural disasters with \nother issues.\n  This is commonsense legislation. We have done it before. We have to \nmove I think with alacrity to get this done. It is about protecting the \nAmerican people from natural disasters as well as, unfortunately, in \nthis world we live in, the potential for terrorist activities that \nemanate elsewhere but are directed against the United States.\n  Issues that are unrelated to funding the Department of Homeland \nSecurity I think should be put aside. We can deal with them. We can \ndeal with them through the authorization process, but let's get this \nDepartment fully appropriated so it can continue.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I support Dr. Ashton B. Carter to be \nour next Secretary of Defense.\n  I have known Dr. Carter for many years, both inside government and \nout, and especially as members of the Aspen Strategy Group. I have \nfound Dr. Carter to be deeply thoughtful and extraordinarily competent. \nI am confident he will serve with distinction as our next Secretary of \nDefense, and I urge my colleagues to support his nomination.\n  It is vital to swiftly confirm Dr. Carter because we face countless \nthreats around the world, many of which know no simple resolution. On \nall these national security issues, I strongly believe we need someone \nin charge who brings leadership, experience, intellect and a strategic \nlens. Dr. Carter possesses all of these things, and I fully expect he \nwill put his expertise and counsel to good use in tackling our Nation's \npressing challenges.\n\n[[Page S962]]\n\n  First and foremost, Dr. Carter will need to lead the Pentagon in \nconfronting and ultimately defeating the Islamic State of Iraq and the \nLevant, ISIL.\n  ISIL is an unconscionably evil terrorist organization. Its barbarity \nknows no bounds. ISIL has burned alive Jordanian Capt. Moath al-\nKasasbeh, beheaded American journalists and aid workers, and inflicts \ndaily savagery on the people of Syria and Iraq, including the murder of \ncivilians, women, children, and minorities. To marshal international \nsupport to sustain the global coalition and ensure ISIL is ultimately \neliminated, I trust Dr. Carter to serve his country well.\n  At the same time, Dr. Carter will need to focus on our drawdown in \nAfghanistan. The Taliban is resurgent, ISIL is attempting to establish \nitself in the country, and the Afghan National Security Forces need our \ncontinued support. In 2011, the United States fully withdrew from Iraq \nonly to see that country fall apart due to sectarian violence and undue \nforeign influence. We cannot afford the same in Afghanistan.\n  I have discussed with Dr. Carter my view that our drawdown in \nAfghanistan should not be linked to an arbitrary timeline, but rather \nto the needs on the ground and the necessity of an orderly transition.\n  Dr. Carter's deep history with nuclear nonproliferation issues will \nalso be important in the coming years. Unfortunately, many of our \nnonproliferation programs with Russia have gone dormant due to our \nworsening bilateral relationship. We cannot let this continue to \nhappen.\n  For decades the United States and Russia have worked together to \nsecure nuclear materials and reduce our nuclear arsenals because doing \nso is important not only for U.S. security, but for global security. \nFinding a way to work constructively with Russia on securing and \neliminating nuclear material, despite its invasion of Ukraine and \ncontinued support for the Assad regime in Syria, is clearly a most \ndifficult assignment. I think Dr. Carter is up to the task.\n  Finally, Dr. Carter will need to deal with the extremely difficult \nspending limitations created by the 2011 Budget Control Act. If \nCongress cannot come together to find a bipartisan solution to raise \nthe spending caps, like we did for fiscal years 2014 and 2015, overall \nsecurity spending will only be allowed to increase by $1.8 billion this \nyear, that is a less than one-half of 1 percent increase.\n  At a time when threats to our Nation are increasing, not decreasing, \nI am deeply concerned that, under current law, our defense budget will \nnot be allowed to rise to meet current threats. Dr. Carter understands \nthis. In his confirmation hearing, he said, ``I very much hope that we \ncan find a way together out of the wilderness of sequester.'' I fully \nagree, and I urge my colleagues to work together to increase the \nspending caps for both defense and non-defense programs.\n  Dr. Carter is a rare combination of a strategic foreign policy \nthinker and an expert on the roles and procedures of the Department of \nDefense. In his time as Assistant Secretary of Defense under President \nClinton, he focused on key national security issues like proliferation \nof weapons of mass destruction and relationships with other major world \npowers.\n  In his two recent positions at the Pentagon--as Undersecretary of \nDefense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics and as the Deputy \nSecretary--Dr. Carter has managed the Department's business functions \nand ran its day-to-day operations. As Secretary, he will bring his \nunique experience in both sides of the job to the numerous challenges \nthe Department and the Nation face.\n  Dr. Carter returns to the Defense Department at a time of immense \nglobal upheaval. Leading the Defense Department in such a time is no \neasy task, but I believe he will prove to be an excellent pick to help \nour country address these challenges head-on. He has the support of the \nPresident, the military, the civilian leadership of the Department, and \nby virtue of this vote, the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. REED. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n  Realities of Drug Sentencing in the Federal Criminal Justice System\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President and Members of the Senate, as chairman of \nthe Committee on the Judiciary, I have mentioned publicly that I am \nopen to certain Federal sentencing, or prison, reforms, and I have \ntried to make it very clear that I am very opposed to others.\n  Today I wish to address the realities of drug sentencing in the \nFederal criminal justice system. I do so because there are many myths \nthat surround this topic.\n  The myth is that there are thousands of low-level drug offenders, \nsuch as people smoking marijuana, in Federal prison for very long \nterms. This is supposed to mean a waste of Federal tax dollars, \novercrowding, and unfairness to people who should not be in prison. \nThese myths are often used to justify lenient and, frankly, dangerous \nsentencing proposals in the U.S. Senate. One of those proposals is the \nso-called Smarter Sentencing Act.\n  It is time to set the record straight, and that is why I am here. It \nis important to know how many people are in Federal prison for drug \npossession, who they are, and why they are in prison. Then it will be \nclear why it is unwise to make wholesale, one-way lenient changes in \ndrug sentencing. In fiscal year 2013, the most recent year we have \nstatistics, according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission there were \n2,332 drug possession cases in the Federal prison. Almost 94 percent \ninvolved marijuana, more than 86 percent were against noncitizens, and \n88 percent of the cases arose along the southwest border, so it is \nclear why so many noncitizens were charged. Federal drug possessors \nwere rarely prosecuted for small quantities.\n\n  The median amount of drug possession in these southwest border cases, \nwhich are 88 percent of the Federal drug possession cases, was about 48 \npounds. Understand, we are not talking about a few ounces of possession \nof marijuana. The average is 48 pounds. Can you imagine being in \npossession of 48 pounds of illegal drugs? These are not low-level, \ncasual offenders by any stretch of the imagination. Moreover, well over \n90 percent of the drug possession cases are along the southwest border. \nSo more than 80 percent of all Federal drug possession cases were \nbrought in the State of Arizona.\n  In that district, the U.S. attorney will agree to charge a drug \ntrafficker with only drug possession if the offender is a first-time \noffender who acted only as a courier. Again, the median quantity of the \namount of possession is 48 pounds, and many who actually committed \ntrafficking there are charged only with mere drug possession.\n  Since 88 percent of all Federal drug possession cases derive from the \nsouthwest border, only 270 simple drug possession cases arose anywhere \nelse in the United States. Get this, please. The odds of an American \nbeing subject to a Federal prosecution for drug possession in any given \nyear are less than 1 in 1 million. It is also imperative to remember \nthat mandatory minimum sentences are not an issue in these cases. The \naverage Federal sentence for drug possession is 5 months; that is, only \n5 months--I say that for emphasis--not the years of imprisonment some \nof the proponents of lenient sentencing would have us believe.\n  The brevity of Federal drug possession sentences is emphasized by how \nin the vast majority of these cases the median amount of drugs at issue \nwas 48 pounds. In the 270 cases not along the border, the median amount \nof drugs the offender possessed was only 4 grams. The average sentence \nwas 1.3 months. Most of those convicted were sentenced to probation.\n  There is no basis whatsoever to advocate change in Federal mandatory \nminimum sentencing laws based on drug possession cases since they are \nnot subject to such mandatory minimums. Anyone who raises drug \npossession as an argument against Federal mandatory minimum sentences \nis using a stalking horse to lower sentences for much more serious \noffenders.\n\n[[Page S963]]\n\n  There is no separate Federal offense for what is called possession \nwith intent to distribute. Those who possessed with that intent are \ntreated the same as those who distribute. We need to look at drug \ndistribution sentences in the Federal system as well.\n  Drug trafficking cases are sometimes subject to mandatory minimum \nsentences. For instance, just under half of all drug courier offenders \nwere subject to mandatory minimum sentences, but under 10 percent were \nsubject to mandatory minimum sentences at the time of their sentencing.\n  There are two main reasons so few of these offenders are actually \nsentenced to a mandatory minimum. The first is they may fall within the \nsafety valve Congress has enacted to prevent mandatory minimum \nsentences from applying to low-level, first-time drug offenders or, \nsecond, they may have provided substantial assistance to prosecutors in \nfingering high-level offenders in a drug conspiracy.\n  That is an intended goal of current Federal sentencing policy, to put \npressure on defendants to cooperate in exchange for a lower sentence so \nevidence against more responsible criminals can be attained. As a \nresult, even for drug couriers the average sentence is 39 months. That \nseems to be an appropriate level.\n  We are not sending huge numbers of nonviolent drug offenders to \nFederal prison under lengthy mandatory minimum sentences. I want to \nmake it very clear, this is the biggest sentencing myth of them all. \nWhen Federal drug sentencing is discussed, we need then to keep in mind \nthe facts. There are hardly any nonviolent drug-offending Americans in \nFederal prison for mere drug possession. The quantities of drugs \nunderlying the vast majority of Federal possession cases are high and \nsentences are fair. For drug courier distribution cases, only 10 \npercent of offenders are subject to mandatory minimum sentences at the \ntime of sentencing.\n  I hope you will be on notice and be on guard. Don't let anyone tell \nyou Federal mandatory minimum sentences are putting large numbers of \nnonviolent offenders in jail for long periods of time at great taxpayer \nexpense. Don't let anyone tell you such offenders are the reason for \nthe increase in Federal drug prisoners over the years. Don't let anyone \ntell you harsh mandatory sentences for low-level nonviolent offenders \nare decimating various communities.\n  Apart from the clear evidence from the Sentencing Commission \nregarding Federal drug offenders, I want to draw attention to the \nresponses to questions from witnesses before our Judiciary Committee \njust this month. Testifying before the committee, Milwaukee County \nSheriff David A. Clarke, Jr., stated: ``Federal mandatory minimum \nsentences have struck terror into the hearts of career criminals . . . \nand have provided longer periods of respite from the impoverished and \ncrime-riddled communities that can least afford their return.''\n  The sheriff said he feared the effect in his inner-city community of \nchanging Federal drug mandatory minimum sentences. I have told my \ncolleagues I am going to be open to lowering some Federal mandatory \nminimum sentences but only where specific situations may warrant that \nand if we can add or raise new ones for such offenses as arms export \ncontrol violations, financial crimes, and child pornography \npossessions. Those three categories do not have to be extremely long \nsentences under present law, but too many judges are systematically \nsentencing these offenders to probation. Especially when the Supreme \nCourt has taken away any other means of making sure judges do not let \nthese offenders walk, mandatory minimum sentences are the only way \nCongress can require these offenders serve any time at all.\n  I am trying to inform my Senate colleagues through the use of facts. \nIn doing that, by looking at the facts, we will not make unwise and \ndangerous changes to our Federal sentencing laws. I ask my colleagues \nto stick to the facts and avoid repeating myths. I pointed out those \nmyths. It is a myth to say sentences for drug possession and nonviolent \noffenders justify the Smarter Sentencing Act. That bill does not apply \nto possession at all. Many drug offenses necessarily involve violence. \nDrug conspiracies operate with the threat or the use of force.\n  Whatever the offense charged, if the offender has a history of \nviolent crime, he is a violent offender, and the sentence will and \nshould reflect that fact. It is a myth to say the Smarter Sentencing \nAct would save money. All it would do is shift costs from incarceration \nto the victims who bear the cost of the crimes that earlier released \noffenders would commit. That is one of the reasons the bill is \ndangerous.\n  The Congressional Budget Office also says it would add billions of \ndollars in mandatory spending, regardless of what upfront discretionary \nsavings there may be. I would ask my colleagues to get this: It is a \nfact the Smarter Sentencing Act would cut sentences for a range of \nheroin offenses, including importation and dealing, while the entire \nNation is in the midst of a heroin epidemic and a rising number of \ndeaths from heroin overdoses.\n  I would ask my colleagues to get this: It is a fact from the heads of \nthe FBI and the Drug Enforcement Agency and Federal police \norganizations that mandatory minimum sentences spur cooperation from \ndefendants and enable the successful prosecution of high-level drug \ncriminals who cause most of the tremendous harm. That includes \ncooperation from defendants charged with narcoterrorism.\n  I would ask my colleagues to get this: It is a fact the so-called \nSmarter Sentencing Act would cut in half the mandatory minimum \nsentences Congress put in place for distributing drugs to benefit \nterrorists or terrorist organizations. It would cut in half the \nmandatory minimum sentences for members of Taliban, Al Qaeda, ISIS or \nHezbollah who deal drugs that fund terrorism. That would mean less \ncooperation to bring charges of narcoterrorism, get terrorists off the \nstreets, and obtain intelligence to help prevent future attacks.\n  As President Obama's U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New \nYork has remarked, ``[T]here is a growing nexus between drug \ntrafficking and terrorism, a threat that increasingly poses a clear and \npresent danger to our national security.\n  So I ask my colleagues to get this: It is a fact that the so-called \nSmarter Sentencing Act is dangerous not only because of its effect on \nincreased crime and victimization but on national security as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Department of Homeland Security Funding\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to urge our colleagues to \ncome together quickly to pass a clean Homeland Security bill. We are \nnow just 16 days away from a Homeland Security shutdown. The clock is \nticking. A shutdown would be wholly unnecessary and, quite frankly, \ncompletely dangerous. We know we do not lack for security threats. It \nwas less than 2 years ago that terrorists attacked the Boston Marathon. \nIt was just weeks ago that we witnessed a horrific series of terror \nattacks on our friends in Paris. We know the brutal destabilizing force \nknown as the Islamic State, or ISIL, is determined to hurt our Nation \nand our citizens. The world is a dangerous place.\n  At a time like this, we should be working together on a bipartisan \nbasis to fund and strengthen Homeland Security, but instead we are \nfacing insecurity, instability, and uncertainty because some want to \nhold the funding for the Department of Homeland Security hostage--\nhostage to a partisan political debate.\n  Is it really more important to hold a fight over deporting children \nwho came to the United States and know no country other than the United \nStates, came here through no fault of their own? Is it more important \nto hold this fight over deporting those children than it is to protect \nAmerica against terrorist threats?\n  Although protecting against these threats is reason enough to oppose \nthis misguided strategy, the resulting fallout would not just be \nlimited to national security. This bill includes\n\n[[Page S964]]\n\nFEMA grants to disaster-stricken areas. This bill includes funding for \ngrants to local fire departments--grants that would not occur.\n  Thousands of essential public servants--from Homeland Security, to \nFEMA, to our terrific men and women in the Coast Guard--would be asked \nto keep on working even though we are not paying them. This is not the \nway to run a nation. This is certainly not the way to address national \nsecurity threats that face us.\n  I think it is telling when a strategy is being criticized from \nMembers on both sides of the aisle. This is a foolhardy game being \nplayed with our national security.\n  A colleague from Arizona said on this floor just yesterday--a \ncolleague from across the aisle--that ``to attempt to use a spending \nbill in order to poke a finger in the President's eye is not a good \nmove.''\n  Another colleague from across the aisle, from Illinois, said, ``The \nAmerican people are pretty alarmed, as they should be, about security . \n. . the way to go forward is just fund DHS,'' the Department of \nHomeland Security. He continued, ``We ought to strip the bill of \nextraneous issues and make it about homeland security.''\n  That is the path forward, to have a funding bill for Homeland \nSecurity, stripped of political riders designed to take on one issue or \nanother when those issues can be addressed in separate bills. If \nsomeone really wants to prioritize the deportation of children who came \nhere through no fault of their own and know no country other than the \nUnited States, our DREAMers, then they should write that bill, put it \nthrough committee, and then the majority should bring the debate to the \nfloor of this Chamber. I can tell you that I would be voting against \nthat bill, but we would have the debate on that issue separate from the \nconversation about funding Homeland Security.\n  I found it interesting to read the Wall Street Journal the other day. \nIt refers to immigration restrictionists who want a larger brawl and \nhave browbeat GOP leaders into adding needless policy amendments. That \nis coming from the Wall Street Journal. They proceed to say in regard \nto the fight over prioritizing the deportation of folks who are here \nwithout legal credentials and who have criminal backgrounds, that the \nPresident is ``prioritizing'' those deportations of those with criminal \nbackgrounds. The Wall Street Journal says:\n\n       That is legitimate prosecutorial discretion, and in \n     opposing it Republicans are undermining their crime-fighting \n     credentials.\n\n  So if some of my colleagues want to argue that the President should \nnot prioritize deporting individuals with criminal backgrounds, which I \nthink should be prioritized, have that debate, but do not hold the \nHomeland Security bill hostage to that particular fight.\n  In this morning's paper, there was an article about the funding of \nthe Department of Homeland Security. This is in the Washington Post. It \nrefers to the Grand Old Party at impasse as a measure stalls in the \nSenate. It quotes the Speaker of the House, Mr. Boehner. Speaker \nBoehner says, ``It is time for the Senate to do their work,'' and he \nproceeds to give a little lecture to Senators. He says, ``You know, in \nthe gift shop out here, they've got these little booklets on how a bill \nbecomes a law.'' Well, I encourage Speaker Boehner to actually read \nthat book because what that book says is that in order to pass through \nthe Senate, it has to get on the floor and it has to have support to be \napproved by this Chamber.\n  So, Speaker Boehner, I encourage you to actually read the pamphlet \nyou recommended because sending over funding for Homeland Security \nladen with unrelated policy riders is going to make sure that bill dies \nhere in the Senate. Don't take my word for it, take the Senate's \nversion or expression on this. It has come up for three votes in the \nSenate. We have voted three times to kill this House bill, giving clear \ninstruction to the House: Send us the actual Department of Homeland \nSecurity bill free of these political riders, and we will put it on the \nfloor, and we will have that debate, and we will undoubtedly pass that \nbill. But if you want to play political games rather than looking out \nfor the security of the United States of America, don't expect the \nSenate to rubberstamp your political games, Speaker Boehner.\n  So that is where we are now. I do encourage the Speaker to go right \ndown the gift shop--I will be happy to buy him a copy of this, and I \nwill be happy to read the phrases to the Speaker on exactly how a bill \nbecomes law.\n  It is deeply disturbing to the American people to see these types of \npolitical games being played with our Nation's security. We live in a \ndangerous world, and we need to take seriously our responsibility to \nfund this Department.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Brown pertaining to the introduction of S. 522 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, are we on the Carter nomination?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, this is an important nomination, at a \ntime when this country faces very significant national security \nthreats.\n\n\n                                  AUMF\n\n  As I commented yesterday, the President came to us yesterday asking \nus to authorize the use of force, and I think we should do that. I am \nnot necessarily sure we should do it in the way he has asked us to do \nit. I think it should be a pretty straightforward authorization, and \nhere is what it should say. It should say we authorize the President of \nthe United States to destroy ISIS and to defeat their military. It is \nup to the Commander in Chief to decide the right way in which to do \nthat.\n  I have very serious concerns and very serious reservations about our \ncurrent strategy when it comes to ISIS. I am not sure it is sufficient. \nI think it is a strategy that will contain them but will not defeat \nthem. In fact, ISIS is now popping up, for example, in Libya, where \nthey have a very significant hub. They have a very significant presence \nin Benghazi. Just a few days ago they carried out an attack in Tripoli. \nWe are now hearing media reports that ISIS has a presence in \nAfghanistan, perhaps even terrorist training camps.\n  So they continue to grow their affiliates, they continue to grow \ntheir presence, and we need an authorization of the use of force that \nallows us to defeat them anywhere in the world where they are to be \nfound.\n  The President's suggestion has been well received. We thank him for \nsubmitting one. But now it is the responsibility of the Senate to do \nits job and to write one of its own. It may reflect many of the things \nthe President wants, but what I believe it should reflect more than \nanything else is that we authorize him to defeat ISIS no matter what it \ntakes and no matter how long it takes. If we have problems with the \nPresident's strategy, there are different ways to address it. I do have \nproblems with the strategy and I want that to be addressed.\n\n\n                                 Israel\n\n  Mr. Carter's nomination comes at another important moment. In that \nsame region of the world, one of America's strongest allies and its \nvery existence is under attack. Of course I am talking about Israel, \nthe Jewish State--an extraordinary story in the history of the world. \nHere is a country founded after the end of World War II as a homeland \nfor the Jewish people so that never again--never again--would they have \nnowhere to go if they faced the sorts of oppression, the sort of \ngenocide they faced during the Holocaust.\n  Since that time the Jewish State has had an extraordinary story. From \nan economic perspective, it is a vibrant, first-rate country with a \nfirst-rate economy. What is most interesting is this is not a country \nwith oil or a country with vast supplies of natural gas.\n\n[[Page S965]]\n\nThis is not a country that is an agricultural superpower, yet it has a \nworld-class economy providing prosperity and upward mobility to \nmillions of its people, and it has done so on the basis of innovation.\n  There is a very good book recently written called ``Start-up Nation'' \nthat talks about the extraordinary story of Israel.\n  It is also a very vibrant democracy--in fact, observers of Israeli \npolitics often joke perhaps a little too vibrant. They have heated \ndebates. But it is a democracy.\n  So what we have here is a democratic nation with a vibrant free \nenterprise economy in the middle of the Middle East.\n  Israel is everything we want that region of the world to become. We \nwish every nation in that region were a real democracy, a vibrant one. \nWe wish every nation in that part of the world had a first-rate economy \nthat provided upward mobility to everyone. And we wish every nation in \nthe Middle East was as strong an ally of the United States as Israel \nhas been.\n  This is the extraordinary story of this small but important nation, \nand this country must continue to be their strongest ally in the world. \nBut they face extraordinary threats to their safety, to their security, \nand to their existence.\n  It begins with what I believe is a concerted effort around the \nworld--including in American academia, including in the universities of \nthis very country--to delegitimize Israel's right to exist and its \nright to exist as a Jewish state, and it is an outrage.\n  It continues with the growth of anti-Semitism all over the world, \nincreasingly in Europe. Every day we see stories of a mass exodus as \nmore and more Jews are leaving Europe because of the growth of anti-\nSemitism.\n  We saw what happened in Paris--not just the attack that happened but \nhow Jews were deliberately targeted for death by terrorists. It was not \na random attack. It was a deliberate act to target Jews. It was a \ndeliberate act of violence in the furtherance of anti-Semitism.\n  In every international body in the world, Israel is often the target \nof scorn and criticism, without any consideration whatsoever to what \nits enemies intend to do to them. And now perhaps the greatest risk of \nall is to its very existence from the threat of an Iranian nuclear \nprogram.\n  I, like everybody else, wish that I would wake up tomorrow morning to \nthe news that the Ayatollah had come to his senses and realized Iran \ncannot continue down its path; that they have given up their nuclear \nweapons ambition; that they have given up sponsoring terrorism all over \nthe world; that they have given up their anti-Israeli, anti-Semitic \nrhetoric; that they have given up oppressing their own people. But I \nknow that is not going to happen because Iran is not governed by a \nnormal leader the way we would consider a leader of a nation. Iran is \ngoverned by a radical shia cleric--a radical shia cleric who believes \nhe is not only the head of Iran, he believes he is the head of all \nIslam everywhere in the world. Iran is where he lives. Iran is where he \nis based. But Iran is not what he believes is his domain; he believes \nevery Muslim on the planet under the Sun is under his control and \nleadership.\n  But here is the scariest thing he believes: He believes it is his job \nto trigger an apocalyptic showdown between the Muslim and non-Muslim \nworld because that would bring about the emergence of the 13th Imam--\nthe Hidden Imam, the Mahdi, as they call him--who will then come and \ngovern the entire world under the flag of Islam--his version of radical \nIslam. We may say that stuff sounds a little far-fetched. That is what \nhe believes. That is what he passionately and legitimately believes.\n  So when someone wants to trigger an apocalyptic showdown between the \nMuslim and non-Muslim world, when someone says they want to destroy the \nState of Israel, wipe it off the face of the Earth, and that person is \ntrying to acquire nuclear weapons capabilities, we had better be very \nconcerned, and we had better conclude that is an unacceptable risk for \nus to take. It is particularly scary for Israel because they are closer \nto Iran than we are. They are in their crosshairs both verbally and \nmilitarily.\n  The administration would have us believe that we are in the midst of \nthis negotiation and hopefully we will delay the Iranian nuclear \nprogram or extend the amount of time they would need to break out. Let \nme break it to everyone: They are not going to break out. They are \ngoing to sneak out. They will concoct some sort of excuse at some point \nin the future as to why they need a nuclear weapons program.\n  Let me begin by saying that Iran is an oil-rich nation. They have no \nneed for civilian nuclear power. But if they want one, they can have \nit, like most of the other countries in the world do, by importing \nenriched uranium or reprocessed plutonium and using it for their \nreactors for peaceful purposes. But instead they insist on the ability \nto enrich and reprocess, and there is only one reason why they would \ninsist on that--because they want the infrastructure necessary to one \nday build a weapon when they decide they need it.\n  But don't take my word for it. That is not the only thing they are \ndoing. There are two other aspects of their program that aren't even \nbeing discussed.\n  The first is that they continue to develop long-range rockets. Why do \nthey need intercontinental missiles? Why do they need long-range \nrockets? They don't need them for conventional purposes. They don't put \na conventional warhead--they don't spend all the time and energy and \nmoney that it takes to build that capacity to bomb someone with a \nconventional weapon. There is only one reason to build long-range \nrockets such as those, and that is to put a nuclear warhead on them. \nThat is not being discussed in these negotiations, and they continue to \nmake unabated progress toward their long-range rocket capabilities.\n  The other is a weapons design. The three things they need for a \nnuclear weapons program: a weapons design, long-range rockets, and the \nability to enrich and reprocess. They are already building the rockets. \nThe weapons design they can literally buy from dozens of people around \nthe world who will sell it to them. And the reprocessing? Even under \nthe deal the President is asking for, if it went down exactly the way \nthe President is asking for, they would still keep all the \ninfrastructure, all the things that it takes to enrich to weapons-\ngrade. They would have all the equipment, all the scientists, all the \ninfrastructure.\n  Here is one more point. Iran has always had a secret component to \ntheir nuclear program. They have always had some secret component to \ntheir program. And I would venture to guess that right now they have a \nsecret component to their program as well that we do not know about.\n  That is why I have little hope in this deal, and that is why Prime \nMinister Netanyahu is so concerned about the deal. See, he doesn't have \nthe luxury of living an illusion. He doesn't have the luxury of \npretending that somehow we can work this out, as if somehow we are \nnegotiating with Luxembourg or Belgium. He knows the neighborhood he \nlives in, and he knows his enemy. He knows their true nature. He knows \ntheir true intentions. And it is his obligation not just to protect his \npeople but to fight for that nation's very existence. So he has chosen \nto come before the Congress at the invitation of the Speaker. I am glad \nhe has accepted his invitation, and I think we owe him the courtesy to \nhear what he has to say.\n  I want you to go back and look at the United Nations rollcall votes. \nTime and again, when the interests of this country are being challenged \naround the world, I want you to see how many times Israel is one of the \nfew countries--often the only country--that vote with the United States \nof America in that international forum. I want you to see all the times \nthat the Israelis have stood with America on issue after issue around \nthe world.\n  I also want you to think about what it says about us as a nation if \nwe are not prepared to make it very clear that before anything else, we \nare the friends of our allies. What does it say to our other allies \naround the world, to other nations in other parts of the world that are \ncounting on the American security guarantee for their own existence and \ntheir own security, what does it say to Japan and to South Korea and to \nour allies in NATO if the United States is\n\n[[Page S966]]\n\nprepared to create daylight between us and the State of Israel?\n  That is exactly the message people will get--that there is a division \nbetween us and Israel--if, in fact, Members of Congress carry through \non their threat to boycott the Prime Minister's speech before Congress \non the 3rd of March. If a significant number of Members of the Senate \nand the House boycott his speech, that message will be heard not only \nby Israel's enemies but also by our allies. And the message will be \ntwofold--one, that America is no longer firmly on the side of Israel as \nit once was, and two, that America is an unreliable ally; look what \nthey just did to Israel.\n  I think everyone has the right to go or not go to any speech they \nwant, but I hope my colleagues who are thinking about not going will \nreconsider. You may not like the way this went down. You may not like \nthe fact that the Speaker did it the way he did it. That is your \nchoice. But I want you to think about the implications beyond that. I \nwant you to think about the implications this leaves on Israel. I want \nyou to think about the message this sends to Israel's enemies because \nwhat we have seen decade after decade is that anytime Israel's enemies \nget the perception that somehow America is no longer as committed to \nIsrael's security as it once was, it emboldens them to attack Israel, \nand Israel has no shortage of enemies that want to not just attack them \nbut destroy them. We have seen what Hamas has done. We have seen what \nHezbollah has done. We have seen what Iran wants to do and is doing.\n  If you boycott this speech, if a significant number of Members of \nCongress boycott this speech, you will send an incredibly powerful \nmessage to Israel's enemies. So I hope you will reconsider.\n  I don't question anyone's commitment on this issue. I believe there \nare supporters of Israel who won't attend the speech because they think \nit is disrespectful to the President. This is a lot bigger than that. \nWe are talking about the existence of this nation. We are talking about \nwhether people in that nation will survive in 20 years or 15 years. \nThat is how important and monumental this moment is.\n  I am not claiming that by you not attending the speech, somehow that \nis going to lead to Israel's destruction. I am claiming that if you \nboycott this speech, you will send a message to Israel's enemies that \ncould embolden them, and I hope you will reconsider that position.\n  I find it quite frankly outrageous that reports are that the White \nHouse has asked Members of Congress to boycott the speech. I find it \noutrageous that the Vice President of the United States--the Vice \nPresident--has decided to boycott that speech. I find it outrageous, \nfor example, that on the one hand we are more than glad to send \nadministration officials at the highest levels to sit down and meet \nrepeatedly with the highest ranking officials that Iran will send, but \nour strongest ally's Prime Minister is coming to Washington and they \nwon't even meet with him? One of our strongest ally's Prime Minister \nwants to speak before the Congress and they won't even attend the \nspeech? What do you think the headlines will be read as in Iran, by the \nterrorists in Gaza, by the terrorists in Judea and Samaria, by the \nterrorists in all parts of the world, such as in Lebanon, who want to \ndestroy Israel? What do you think they are going to read into it? What \nthey are going to read into it, unfortunately, is that somehow \nCongress's commitment to the future security of Israel is not as strong \nas it once was. And I fear what the implications of that will be. We \nshould not take this lightly.\n  I can think of no nation on Earth that needs our help more right now \nthan Israel, and I can think of no people on Earth who deserve our \nsupport more than they do. As I said earlier, they are a reliable, \nstrong, committed ally of this Nation. We have strong links to them on \npersonal, cultural, political, and economic levels. They have stood by \nus time and again in international forums when America's interests have \nbeen challenged. They are everything we want the Middle East to look \nlike in the future--free, prosperous, democratic, aligned with America, \npeace-loving, desirous of a better future. What more do you want? What \nmore could they do? What else could they be for us to be any stronger \nan ally of theirs than we should be or are right now? Yet there are \npeople who are talking about boycotting the speech to protest because \ntheir feelings are hurt, because they are upset about the way it went \ndown, because they don't like the way it was scheduled, because it was \ndisrespectful to the President.\n  You have the right to voice your concerns, but don't do this to an \nally. Don't do this to a nation that is as threatened today as it has \never been at any time in its existence. Don't do this to a people who \nare in the crosshairs of multiple terrorist groups with the capability \nof attacking them. Don't do this to a nation whose civilians are \nterrorized by thousands of rockets launched against them at a moment's \nnotice. Don't do this to a country that is facing down the threat of a \nnuclear weapon annihilating them off the face of the Earth. Don't do \nthis to a people who are being stigmatized all over the world even as \nwe speak, who are being oppressed. Don't do this to a country that in \nforum after forum has become the subject of delegitimization, as people \nargue that somehow Israel's right to exist is not real. Don't do this \nto them.\n  I hope my colleagues will reconsider their decision to not attend. \nThis is an important speech. It is the Prime Minister's choice, \nobviously. He must always act in the best interests of his nation and \nhis people. But I hope he will speak to us on March 3, and I hope he \nwill speak to us clearly. I hope that through his speech he will open \nthe eyes of this Congress and the American people that this is not \nchild's play, that what Iran intends to have is not just a nuclear \nweapon to destroy Israel but ultimately to terrorize the world. I hope \nhe will speak to us bluntly about the true nature of this threat.\n  I know there is a lot going on in the world, but there is no greater \nthreat to the long-term security of the planet than the Iranian nuclear \nambition. No people and no nation on Earth know that better than the \npeople of Israel, and no leader on Earth understands that better than \nPrime Minister Netanyahu.\n  I think after years of commitment to this alliance, after the bravery \nhe has shown in his time in office and the bravery the Jewish people of \nIsrael have shown in defending their nation's right to exist after \nbeing attacked multiple times throughout their history and even to this \nmodern day, they deserve our unambiguous support. Of course, there are \ndifferences between allies. There always have been and always will be.\n  If we won't stand for Israel, for whom will we stand? If the United \nStates of America will not defend its ally, whom will we defend? What \nmessage do we send to our alliances across the planet and what message \ndo we send to our enemies and Israel's enemies?\n  I hope cooler heads will prevail. I hope Members of the House and \nSenate who have announced they are boycotting will reconsider. I hope \nwe will all be there, if we can, to hear what the Prime Minister has to \nsay the first week in March.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in executive session.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Tributes to Kathie Alvarez\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, regular C-SPAN viewers, this is your DVR \nalert. Get your TiVo ready. After today you will no longer hear the \ndulcet voice of Kathie Alvarez calling the roll in the United States \nSenate. After nearly 30 years as an integral part of the floor staff, \nKathie is leaving the Senate.\n  Her road to the Senate began as a young seventh grade history teacher \nin Louisiana. In 1984 she chaperoned her\n\n[[Page S967]]\n\nstudents during a class trip to Washington, DC. During the trip she met \nan old college friend who told her about a job opening in the Senate \nDocument Room. While her students were touring the Capitol, Kathie \ninterviewed and was hired on the spot. Unfortunately for those \nstudents, they lost a great teacher that day, but it turned out to be a \ngain for the Senate.\n  In 1985 Kathie was hired as the second assistant bill clerk and was \nquickly promoted to assistant bill clerk.\n  In 1991, for the first time, Senators came to this Chamber and heard \na woman's voice taking the rollcall vote. It was Kathie Alvarez, the \nfirst female bill clerk of the United States Senate. What an \nachievement.\n  Before the end of the millennium, Kathie Alvarez was a part of \nanother first when she was 1 of 10 officers--all women--presiding over \nthe Senate at the start of the day. If that were not enough, Kathie \nonce again made history when she was promoted to legislative clerk in \n2009. She was the first woman to serve in this role too. What a career.\n  In 1922, for the history books, Rebecca Latimer Felton was the first \nwoman to sit in the Senate. She served in this body for only 1 day, but \nduring those 24 hours she made a bold prediction for her time about the \nfuture role women would play in the Senate. She said:\n\n       When the women of the country come in and sit with you . . \n     . you will get ability, you will get integrity of purpose, \n     you will get exalted patriotism, and you will get unstinted \n     usefulness.\n\n  Well, I will certainly second that.\n  As the first woman to serve as the bill clerk and legislative clerk \nof the United States Senate, I would say Kathie Alvarez has certainly \nlived up to Senator Felton's prediction. She began her career as a \nseventh grade history teacher and came to the Senate, where she made \nhistory.\n  Thank you for your service to this body. I know you will be joining \nyour husband John and your high school student daughter Georgia in a \nmuch more fulsome way now, but we will miss you in the Senate, and I \nwish you and your family the very best.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I wish to say a word about a \nremarkable woman in the Senate we will soon be losing.\n  Kathie Alvarez, the Senate's legislative clerk, is a bit of a \ncelebrity. Every C-SPAN aficionado knows her voice. All she has to say \nis ``Mr. Alexander, Ms. Ayotte . . .'' and it is instantly \nrecognizable.\n  Kathie has been calling the roll around here for quite a while. In \n1991, she became the first woman to ever call the roll in the Senate. \nIn 1999, with Senator Collins in the chair, Kathie became a member of \nthe first all-female team to preside over this body, and in 2009 she \nbecame the Senate's first female legislative clerk.\n  So Kathie Alvarez has been making a lot of history since she first \narrived here in 1984.\n  And you will notice, Madam President, that every female floor staffer \nis paying tribute to her today. They are each wearing something with \nKathie's favorite design--animal print.\n  Along with the love of Cajun food, sartorial distinction is one thing \nthis Louisianan has become known for, a passion for perfection is \nanother.\n  Kathie has maintained a laser-like focus for three decades. That is \ngood news for the Senate because we rely on her--and the American \npeople rely on her--to ensure that every bill, every amendment, and \nevery message from the House is processed perfectly. That is a lot of \npressure.\n  So we can't blame Kathie for wanting to retire. I know she is looking \nforward to spending more time with her husband John, and I know Kathie \nwants to see more of her daughter Georgia.\n  It will not be as though Kathie is leaving us entirely. We will still \nbe able to hear her voice on the film every tourist watches when they \ncome to visit the Capitol.\n  So the Senate thanks Kathie Alvarez, its history-making celebrity, \nfor her many years of service, and we wish the very best to her deputy, \nJohn Merlino, as he steps into Kathie's role as the Senate's new \nlegislative clerk.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Ashton B. Carter, of Massachusetts, to be \nSecretary of Defense?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Requests\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, for 2 weeks now Democrats have \ncontinued to filibuster funding for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  They are filibustering Homeland Security for one reason, and that is \nto defend actions President Obama himself referred to as ``unwise and \nunfair'' and ``ignoring the law.''\n  For 2 full weeks, Democrats have prevented the Senate from even \nconsidering legislation to fund the Department of Homeland Security. \nDemocrats won't allow the Senate to even debate this funding. Democrats \nwon't allow the Senate to even consider amendments to this funding.\n  Democrats appear willing to do anything and everything they can to \nprevent the Senate from taking any action to fund Homeland Security, \nand all to defend ``unwise and unfair''--the President's words, not \nmine--overreach.\n  This includes Democrats who claim to be against overreach and who \nclaim to be for funding the Department of Homeland Security. Yet these \nDemocrats continue to filibuster things they claim to want.\n  Listen to the things Democrats have been saying too. We have heard a \nclaim\n\n[[Page S968]]\n\nfrom them the Democratic filibuster wasn't actually a filibuster. We \nheard a call from them for the Senate to start with funding legislation \nof its own. Of course, the Democratic leader has been clear in the past \nthat the Senate can do no such thing.\n  Well, here is some good news. There is already a funding bill before \nus. It has already passed the House. It would fund the Department of \nHomeland Security fully, and we can consider it today, right now. All \nDemocrats have to do is stop blocking the Senate from even debating it. \nIf our Democratic colleagues don't like provisions of the bill the \nHouse has passed, the Senate has a process for modifying bills. It is \ncalled amending them. But the Senate can only consider amendments to a \nbill if it is not being filibustered.\n  This strained logic of our Democratic friends is very hard to \nswallow. We understand Democrats might be having a tough time kicking \nthis years-long gridlock habit of theirs, but it is about time they \ndid.\n  I have already offered a fair and open debate to them several times \nnow. It is a debate that would allow amendments from both parties--that \nmeans amendments from our Democratic friends as well. If you want to \nmake changes to the bill, colleagues, that is the way to do it. But to \ndo so you first need to end the weeks-long Democratic filibuster of \nHomeland Security funding.\n  Why don't we get serious instead and let the Senate fund the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to proceed to \nH.R. 240 be agreed to, and that it be made in order for the managers or \ntheir designees to offer amendments in an alternating fashion, with the \nmajority manager or his designee being recognized to offer the first \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The acting minority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I don't understand why the Republicans in \nthe House and the Senate have decided to hold up one appropriations \nbill of our Federal Government, the appropriations for the Department \nof Homeland Security, the one agency that is supposed to protect us \nagainst terrorism.\n  Last December, the House Republicans said: We are just not going to \ngive regular funding to this Department--$48 billion this Department \nspends on the Coast Guard, border security, and a myriad of different \nthings to keep America safe--but the Republicans said this is one \nagency we are not going to fully fund. We will put them on temporary \nfunding, called a continuing resolution, and we will get back to you on \nFebruary 27.\n  Then what they did is to lash the budget of this Department to the \nthorny, difficult issue of immigration and insist that we can't fund \nthe Department of Homeland Security unless we take up what I consider \nto be some rather outrageous riders put on by the House of \nRepresentatives on the issue of immigration.\n  The good news is we have come up with a solution on this side. I am \ngoing to make it in the manner of a unanimous consent request, and it \nis very straightforward.\n  First, because Senator Jeanne Shaheen from New Hampshire has stepped \nforward and offered, with Senator Mikulski, S. 272, we have a clean \nappropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security.\n  If the Senator would like me to yield for a question, I will yield at \nthis point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. If I could ask my colleague a question, isn't it true, \nI say to Senator Durbin, that the bill you are talking about, the clean \nbill Senator Mikulski and I have introduced, is the legislation that \nwas agreed to last December by Senator Mikulski, when she was chair of \nthe Appropriations Committee, and Hal Rogers, chair of the House \nAppropriations Committee? It was a bipartisan agreement, a bicameral \nagreement, and each side gave some.\n  What is at issue here is not that underlying bill. What is at issue \nare the five riders, the amendments the House put on, that have nothing \nto do with funding the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would answer in the affirmative. That is why the \nunanimous consent request I am going to make is the easiest, quickest \nsolution to our problem--a clean, bipartisan appropriations bill for \nthe Department of Homeland Security. But we are not running away from \nthe immigration issue. Because Senator McConnell is now the majority \nleader and controls the business of the Senate and Speaker Boehner \ncontrols the business of the House, they can take up the immigration \nissue immediately after we have funded this Department.\n\n  So what I am going to suggest in my unanimous consent request is that \nthey use their power in the majority to take us to this important \ndebate on immigration after we have given a clean appropriation to the \none Federal agency empowered with keeping America safe from terrorism.\n  Let's not play politics with terrorism. Let's not play politics with \nthe budget of the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that following the enactment of \nthe text of S. 272, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations \nAct for fiscal year 2015, at a time to be determined by the majority \nleader, after consultation with the Democratic leader but no later than \nMonday, March 16, the Senate proceed to the consideration of the Border \nSecurity, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, as \npassed by the Senate by a vote of 68 to 32 on June 27, 2013, the text \nof which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. What is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to proceed to H.R. 240.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to H.R. 240, making appropriations for the Department \n     of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2015.\n         Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, Thad Cochran, Tom Cotton, \n           Roger F.

Mr. President, yesterday the Budget Committee, of which \nI am the ranking member, held a very important hearing on the Social \nSecurity Disability Insurance Program,\n\n[[Page S969]]\n\nwhich is a life-and-death program for nearly 11 million Americans, \nincluding more than 1 million veterans and almost 2 million children \nwho rely on this program to get the nutrition they need, to heat their \nhomes, and to pay for their medicine. This is a program that impacts \nsome of the most vulnerable people in this country.\n  Let me be very clear in describing this program. This is a program \nAmerican workers have paid into. It is an insurance program. This is \nnot charity.\n  When Americans pay 6.2 percent of their income in payroll tax, almost \n1 percent of that amount goes into the disability insurance program. \nThe average disability insurance benefit is less than $1,200 a month, \nand for 30 percent of beneficiaries this is all of the income they \nhave--$1,200 a month, 30 percent of the beneficiaries of SSDI. For them \nthis is all of their income. Nobody is getting rich off of disability \nbenefits.\n  Sadly, on the very first day of the new Congress, House Republicans \npassed a rule that would lay the groundwork for a 19-percent cut in \nSocial Security disability insurance benefits. Specifically, this rule \nwould prohibit the reallocation of payroll taxes from the Social \nSecurity retirement fund to the disability insurance fund, a routine \naccounting practice that has been done 11 times in the past in a very \nnoncontroversial, nonpartisan way. But Republicans in the House said \nthey will not allow this to happen unless it is accompanied by a cut in \nSocial Security benefits or an increase in taxes.\n  In other words, what the House Republicans are saying is that either \nthere will be cuts to the disability program or, if that fund is to be \nreplenished, the money will have to come from cuts to the Social \nSecurity Retirement Program. In my view, that is very wrong.\n  If the Social Security disability program was cut by 19 percent, it \nwould mean the average benefit of approximately $13,980 a year for a \ndisabled person--which is already where the poverty level is--would be \ncut by 19 percent to $11,324. That is what a 19-percent cut to the \naverage Social Security disability insurance benefit would mean.\n  Do any of my colleagues believe a person with a severe disability--\nmaybe that person is facing a terminal illness, maybe that person is \nparalyzed, maybe that person is an amputee. Does anybody believe a \ndisabled person in America in the year 2015 should be forced to live on \n$11,324 a year?\n  Unfortunately, that is what the House Republicans are laying the \ngroundwork for. That is what a 19-percent cut in disability benefits \nwould mean, and we must not allow that to happen.\n  In my view, the debate we are having is nothing more than a \nmanufactured crisis which is part of the long-term agenda of a number \nof Republicans who in fact are trying to cut Social Security. In my \nview, cutting Social Security is a very bad idea.\n  Let us be very clear because there is a lot of misinformation about \nSocial Security that is getting out there. The fact is Social Security \nhas a $2.8 trillion surplus and can pay out every benefit owed to every \neligible American for the next 18 years.\n  Let me repeat that. Social Security has a $2.8 trillion surplus and \ncan pay out every benefit owed to every eligible American for the next \n18 years. That is not the opinion of Senator Bernie Sanders. That comes \nfrom report of the Social Security trustees.\n  There are a lot of folks out there who are talking in one way or \nanother about cutting Social Security. Some of them are saying let's \nraise the retirement age. Let's have struggling workers work another 1 \nor 2 years or more before they can get Social Security benefits. Other \npeople are saying these COLA benefits are just too generous. In recent \nyears, Social Security beneficiaries know we have had several years \nwhere people have gotten a zero cost-of-living increase and other cost-\nof-living increases in recent years has been minuscule. Yet some are \nsaying let's move to a so-called chained CPI and lower the cost-of-\nliving adjustments.\n  Other people are talking in one form or another about a means test, \nwhich would mean significant reduction in benefits for many seniors. \nOthers who are bolder--including some of our Republican colleagues--are \ntalking about the privatization of Social Security. As many will \nremember, under President Bush that proposal in fact was brought \nforward and pushed very hard by Republicans.\n  Because of an aging population, because more women are in the \nworkforce today, and because of an increase in the retirement age, it \nis true there has been an increase in the number of Americans who are \nreceiving disability benefits, but this is not a surprise. This is a \ndemographic reality that the Social Security Administration predicted \nwould happen back in 1994. The fact that the Social Security Disability \nInsurance Program is facing a funding shortfall next year is a surprise \nto absolutely no one. It was predicted 20 years ago.\n  Furthermore, shortfalls in the Social Security Disability Insurance \nProgram or the Social Security Retirement Program is nothing new. It \nhas happened 11 times in the past and has always been resolved in a \nsimple, noncontroversial way. That is the reason for the reallocation \nof payroll taxes between the Social Security retirement fund and the \nSocial Security disability fund.\n  As this chart shows, reallocation was done in 1968 under President \nJohnson; in 1970 under President Nixon; in 1978, 1979, and 1980 under \nPresident Carter; in 1982, 1983, and 1984 under President Reagan; and \nin 1994, 1997, and 2000 under President Clinton. In other words, this \nis a commonplace procedure which has happened under Democratic and \nRepublican Presidents in an absolutely noncontroversial way.\n  Interestingly, of the 11 times funds were reallocated, it turns out \nthat on 5 occasions it was the disability fund that was reallocated to \nhelp the retirement fund. In other words, money was shifted from \ndisability to the retirement fund. This time it is going the other way.\n  At an interesting committee hearing yesterday, a number of \ncolleagues--Republicans and Democrats--made the point that the \nreallocation of funds in order to prevent a 19-percent cut in \ndisability benefits was a short-term solution; that it was not going to \nsolve the overall issue of how do we fund Social Security for our kids \nand our grandchildren. That point is clearly right. No one can argue \nwith that. What we have to do right now in fact is to prevent a massive \ncut to the disability program, but at the same time, while Social \nSecurity can pay out all benefits for the next 18 years, it is \nimportant that sooner than later we begin to address the problem of how \ndo we make Social Security solvent, not just for 18 years but for \ndecades beyond that.\n  In terms of the disability program and the need to go forward with \nreallocation, every major senior organization in this country, \nrepresenting tens of millions of people, wants us to do just that. \nThese organizations include AARP, the National Committee to Preserve \nSocial Security and Medicare, and the Alliance for Retired Americans, \nwhich together represent over 60 million older Americans. What they are \nsaying loudly and clearly is it is imperative we go forward with this \nreallocation to prevent cuts in the Social Security disability fund. \nThey are united in opposition to the rule passed by the House \nRepublicans to make reallocation more difficult.\n  Yesterday AARP wrote a letter to the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Enzi, and to myself, the ranking member. Let me \nquote from this letter:\n\n       To prevent any imminent reductions in SSDI benefits, we \n     urge you to rebalance the allocation of social security \n     payroll taxes between the OASI trust and the DI trust as \n     Congress has done with success in the past. Because of SSDI, \n     millions of disabled Americans are able to live their lives \n     with dignity, and support their families. The highest \n     priority in the near term is to ensure that SSDI \n     beneficiaries, most of whom are older Americans, are not put \n     at risk of a 20 percent benefit cut in the very near future.\n\n  That is from AARP and virtually every major senior organization. \nTogether, they represent some 60 million older Americans and agree \nexactly with the sentiment expressed by AARP.\n  I am delighted President Obama proposed this reallocation plan in his \nbudget request. I applaud the President for doing that. As I mentioned, \nthe Social Security trust fund can pay out every benefit owed to every \neligible American for the next 18 years.\n\n[[Page S970]]\n\n  At yesterday's hearing, my Republican friends--and, again, some \nDemocrats--made the very valid point that we have to go further than \njust reallocation, that we need a long-term solution to make certain \nour children and our grandchildren will have all of the benefits to \nwhich they were promised. I agree with that sentiment. That is why last \nyear I introduced far-reaching Social Security legislation which in \nfact would make Social Security solvent for decades to come.\n  The concept behind this legislation is pretty simple. It would simply \napply the Social Security payroll tax on income above $250,000. In \nother words, it would scrap the cap that currently exists. Right now in \nthe midst of massive wealth and income inequality in our country, a \nWall Street CEO who makes $20 million a year pays the same amount into \nSocial Security as someone who makes $118,500. If you make $20 million \nor you make $118,000, the amount of money you put into the Social \nSecurity trust fund is the same because the cap is now at $118,000.\n  In 2013 I asked the Chief Actuary of the Social Security \nAdministration to estimate how long the solvency of Social Security \nwould be extended if we simply applied the Social Security payroll tax \non income above $250,000. His answer was that Social Security would be \nmade solvent until 2060--45 years from today. I refer my colleagues to \nthe letter from the Social Security Chief Actuary that I had printed in \nthe Congressional Record on February 5 of this year.\n  Further, the Center for Economic and Policy Research has estimated \nthat my proposal--my legislation--would only impact the top 1.5 percent \nof wage earners. More than 98.5 percent of Americans would not see \ntheir taxes go up by one dime under this plan.\n  So I say to my colleagues, if you want to extend the solvency of \nSocial Security--not just for the next 18 years, which is currently the \ncase, but for the next 40 to 45 years--I hope you will join me in \nmaking sure the very wealthiest people in our country--the top 1.5 \npercent--pay their fair share into the Social Security trust fund. To \nmy mind that is a much better idea than raising the retirement age, \nforcing hard-pressed workers to work another year or two before they \nget their benefits. It is a much better idea than cutting the cost of \nliving adjustment. It is a much better idea than many of the ideas I \nhave been hearing for the last few years.\n  We all know that the huge increase that we have seen in this country \nin wealth and income inequality has resulted in millions of Americans \nseeing a decline in their income, and we have people from one end of \nthis country to the other working longer hours for lower wages.\n  In fact, while the wealthiest people have become much richer, real \nmedian family income today is almost $5,000 less than it was in 1999. \nIncredibly, the typical male worker--the man right in the middle of our \neconomy--made $783 less last year than he did 42 years ago. The typical \nfemale worker--the woman in the middle of the economy--earned $1,300 \nless last year than she did in 2007.\n  Today the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns more wealth than the bottom \n90 percent. As this chart shows, the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns as \nmuch wealth as the bottom 90 percent. In terms of income what we are \nlooking at is a situation where almost all of the new income generated \nsince the Wall Street crash goes to the top 1 percent.\n  Why is this significant? Well, obviously it is significant because \nmillions of Americans have not seen growth in their income. In fact, \nthey have seen a decline in their income. But what makes it also \nsignificant is that this decline in income for millions of Americans--\nthis growth in income and wealth disparity--has also had a profound \nimpact on the solvency of Social Security.\n  I want all of my colleagues to understand that if income inequality \nremained at the same level today as it was in 1983, Social Security \nwould have $1.1 trillion more in the trust fund than it does today. \nWhy? Because, obviously, when workers saw their wages go down, less \nmoney went into the Social Security trust fund. When people on the top \nwent over the cap, they were no longer contributing from their income \nthat was above the cap. So less money goes into the Social Security \ntrust fund.\n  If the payroll tax had simply continued to cover 90 percent of all \nearnings, which it did in 1983, rather than the 83 percent that it \ncovers today, the Social Security trust fund would be able to pay every \nbenefit owed to every eligible American--not just for the next 18 years \nbut for the next 38 years.\n  So when we talk about income and wealth inequality in this country, \nthat is not only a tragedy unto itself; when we see the middle class \nshrinking and real wages for American workers going down, in some cases \nsignificantly, it is also a major problem for the Social Security trust \nfund.\n  Once again, if income levels had remained the same today as they were \nin 1983--if incomes had gone up rather than gone down--we would see \nover $1 trillion more in the Social Security trust fund.\n  So, I agree with my Republican colleagues who say that doing the \nreallocation for the disability trust fund is a temporary solution. It \nis. But it is an important solution, and it is something that has been \ndone 11 times in the past. It is something that is supported by the \nAARP and every major senior organization. It is something we must do \nright now to prevent a 19-percent cut in benefits for some of the most \nvulnerable people in this country. So I won't argue with anyone who \nsays, well, that doesn't go far enough. We need a long-term solution.\n  So I challenge my Republican friends: Do you have the courage to come \nup with a solution other than cutting benefits for seniors? Do you have \nthe courage to come up with an idea that says: No, it is bad, it is \nwrong to raise the retirement age, and it is wrong to cut cost of \nliving adjustments.\n  Are you prepared to deal with the reality that because of the growing \ndisparity in income in America, we have lost substantial funding for \nSocial Security, and the way to address that issue--the way to extend \nSocial Security--is to ask the people on top, the people who have been \ndoing phenomenally well in recent years, to pay more into the Social \nSecurity trust fund?\n  I do agree with my Republican colleagues that we have to look at \nSocial Security from a long-term perspective for our kids and our \ngrandchildren.\n  We have brought forth an idea: Raise the cap. Ask people making more \nthan $250,000 a year to pay the same percentage of their income into \nthe Social Security trust fund as somebody making $50,000 a year. I \nthink that is a sensible idea, and I look forward to hearing some of my \nRepublican friends work with us on this concept.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy).

Mr. President, last week I joined my colleague Senator \nBurr in unveiling the latest version of our legislative proposal to \nrepeal and replace the so-called Affordable Care Act. We are joined \nthis time around by our friend in the House, Chairman Upton of the \nHouse Energy and Commerce Committee.\n  We call our proposal the Patient Choice, Affordability, \nResponsibility, and Empowerment Act, or the Patient CARE Act for short. \nAs you may recall, we first unveiled this framework last year and in \ngeneral it received high marks for being a serious, responsible \nalternative to ObamaCare. We have unveiled the latest version of the \nproposal in hopes of continuing the conversation we began in the last \nCongress.\n  Let's face it. ObamaCare isn't working. It is not working. Sure, its \nproponents in the Senate and elsewhere have gotten pretty good at \ncherry-picking data in order to convince the American people that the \nPresident's health care law is a success. But the American people know \nthe truth. The law is a disaster for individuals, families, and \nemployers alike.\n  Despite the claims that ObamaCare would lower health care costs, \ncosts have continued to skyrocket. Due to all the mandates in the law, \nbusinesses are slowing hiring and moving employees into part-time work. \nOf course, the law includes more than a trillion dollars in new taxes \nthat impact consumers and businesses around the country. We need a \nbetter path forward\n\n[[Page S971]]\n\nand a long-term vision for sustainable health care reform.\n  I want to take just a few minutes today to talk about the approach we \nwant to take with the Patient CARE Act and why it is a better approach \nthan the one being taken under ObamaCare. Our plan rests on four simple \nprinciples. First, repeal ObamaCare with all its costly mandates, \ntaxes, and regulations. Second, reduce costs by taking the government \nout of the equation and instead empowering consumers to make choices \nabout their own health care. Third, provide common sense consumer \nprotections, including protections for individuals with preexisting \nconditions. And fourth, reform our broken Medicaid system by giving \nStates more flexibility to provide the best coverage for their \ncitizens.\n  Let me talk about each of these principles in a little more detail. \nFor any health care proposal to have a chance of success, it must get \nrid of ObamaCare. The failures of ObamaCare have been well documented \nhere on the Senate floor and elsewhere. The American people deal with \nthose failures on a daily basis. That is why the first principle of our \nproposal is to repeal ObamaCare once and for all. Then we move on to \naddress the biggest barrier to health care in this country--\nskyrocketing costs.\n  Our plan would give taxpayers affordable options to meet their health \ncare needs by harnessing the power of the marketplace--not through \nFederal Government mandates. With more options in the private insurance \nmarketplace, people will be better able to find insurance that meets \ntheir needs. The lack of choice and draconian coverage mandates is one \nof ObamaCare's largest shortcomings. Our proposal would allow consumers \nto find affordable plans that address their particular needs without \nmaking them pay for coverage they will never use or want.\n  Our proposal would also give States more options to provide people \nwith more coverage. Under our plan families earning up to 300 percent \nof the Federal poverty level would be eligible for a tax credit to \npurchase insurance of their choosing. In addition, our plan would help \nsmall businesses enjoy the same advantages in the marketplace as large \nbusinesses by allowing them to band together to leverage their \npurchasing power to buy insurance for their employees.\n  The Patient CARE Act also proposes an expansion of the health savings \naccounts so that people can plan and save for their future medical \nneeds. Under our plan, for the first time consumers would be able to \nuse their pretax dollars to pay premiums and deductibles. Our proposal \nwould inject more transparency into health care costs so people can \nknow what their providers are charging and how successful they are.\n  In addition, we include other cost-saving measures such as medical \nmalpractice liability reform to help reduce the expensive practice of \nunnecessary defensive medicine.\n  Our plan would reduce the distortions in the Tax Code that actually \nincrease the cost of health care in our country by capping the \nunlimited employee exclusion. This is a key way of restraining costs \nthat has support across the political and economic spectrum.\n  In our proposal the exclusion is capped at a generous $30,000 for a \nfamily plan, and that threshold will continue to grow at CPI plus one. \nMost importantly, we make sure we preserve the employer-sponsored \nhealth care system for those 160 million Americans who rely on it by \nleaving the employer deduction untouched and by repealing the job-\nkilling employer mandate. By increasing consumer choice and utilizing \nthe power of the market, our proposal will actually reduce health care \ncosts, something ObamaCare has miserably failed to do.\n\n  Our plan also includes a number of commonsense consumer protections. \nFor example, we would make sure a person would not see their coverage \nget canceled if they get sick. Our plan would also ensure that people \nwith preexisting conditions could not be denied access to health \ninsurance. Period.\n  I will repeat that for my friends on the other side, who were \nconfused about this in some of their speeches: No American with a \npreexisting condition can be denied coverage under our plan. End of \nstory.\n  We would also let children stay on their parents' plans through age \n26 and prevent insurers from putting caps on total benefits paid out \nover a person's lifetime so that no patient will have to worry about \nmaxing out their coverage.\n  Finally, our plan would address the current failings of the Medicaid \nProgram. Keep in mind, many of the newly insured people credited to \nObamaCare have obtained their coverage through the expansion of \nMedicaid. Of course, this is absurd as Medicaid is a financially \nunsound program that continues to swallow up State budgets on a yearly \nbasis. ObamaCare did not improve the stability of Medicaid, it only \nthreatened it further.\n  The Patient CARE Act includes a key reform that is similar to the \nMedicaid modernization plan that Chairman Upton and I proposed in the \nlast Congress.\n  Currently, Federal taxpayers have an open-ended liability to match \nState Medicaid spending, which is a significant driver in Medicaid's \nbudgetary challenges. Our proposal would create per capita spending \ncaps--something President Clinton, and many Democrats who remain in \nthis Chamber, supported in the past.\n  We would couple this structural reform to Medicaid with new \nflexibility for States to manage their Medicaid populations. On top of \nthat, we would give those on Medicaid the option of purchasing private \nhealth insurance, which is more frequently accepted by quality doctors.\n  I hope you are grasping a pattern when it comes to this proposal. At \nvirtually every step, our aim with this proposal is to take the Federal \nGovernment out of the equation and put individuals and families in \ncharge of making their own health care decisions. We trust the American \npeople to make the best choices for themselves.\n  The Patient CARE Act represents a sustainable and achievable \nalternative to ObamaCare, one that will succeed without the tax hikes, \nthe mandates, and the outrageous government spending that came part and \nparcel with the Affordable Care Act. Most importantly, it will actually \nreduce the cost of health care in this country.\n  Once again, our hope with unveiling the latest version of this \nframework is that we can continue the conversation about improving \nhealth care for individuals and families. I have given just a top-line, \n35,000-foot overview of the proposal here today. I want to invite my \ncolleagues to take a look at our ideas and give us your feedback. I \nhope health care experts around the country will continue to do the \nsame.\n  Unlike ObamaCare, this is a product that will rely on consensus and \nfeedback. We have more work to do. It is important, and I look forward \nto more discussions and conversations about these issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/12/senate-section/article/S971-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S971-S973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REGULAR ORDER IN THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I also rise today to speak about the recent \nprogress we have made in restoring the Senate as an institution.\n  After being sworn in as President pro tempore just over a month ago, \nI rose to address the state of the Senate and how we, as Members, must \nwork together to restore its greatness. This is an opportune moment to \ntake stock and to reflect briefly on our progress toward achieving this \ngoal.\n  I am pleased to report that we have embarked on a new chapter of \nthoughtful, productive legislating in this Chamber, just as the Framers \nintended us to and just as the American people expect us to.\n  We have had hours upon hours of open, constructive debate with \narguments from both sides of the aisle. We have considered dozens of \namendments reflecting a full range of political viewpoints. The \nmajority leader promised this body that he would restore regular order, \nand that is precisely what he has done. Not only have we engaged in \nfulsome debate and considered dozens of amendments, but we have also \nalready passed four major bipartisan bills in a single month to reform \nand extend the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, to approve the \nKeystone XL Pipeline, to address the critically important issue of \nveteran suicides, and--my bill yesterday--to provide effective \nrestitution for victims of child pornography.\n  That is what voters elected us to do--to craft good legislation, to \ndebate it,\n\n[[Page S972]]\n\nto improve it through the open amendment process, and then send it to \nthe President's desk.\n  In my remarks when I was sworn in as President pro tempore, I noted \nthat in recent years the foundations of the Senate's unique character--\nmeaningful debate and an open amendment process--have come under \nsustained assault by those who have prioritized scoring political \npoints over preserving the Senate's essential role in our system of \ngovernment.\n  What a difference such a short time can make. What a breath of fresh \nair these last 6 weeks have been for this body on both sides of the \naisle. We are moving forward. We are keeping our promises, and we are \nhelping to restore the Senate as the world's greatest deliberative \nbody.\n  I wish to highlight some specifics of these positive changes we have \nwitnessed over the past work period.\n  First, robust debate. The late Senator Robert C. Byrd liked to say \nthat ``as long as the Senate retains the power to amend and the power \nof unlimited debate, the liberties of the people will remain secure.'' \nIn this new Congress, we are restoring the right to meaningful debate.\n  As I noted last month, when a full and robust debate has occurred, \ninvoking cloture--a motion to end debate--is often appropriate. But we \nmust not abuse this power by always seeking reflexively to cut off \ndebate before it even begins. In the dark days of the previous \nCongress, we often saw such motions to cut off debate filed as soon as \ndebate had begun, eviscerating any meaningful opportunity for \nconsidering the issues.\n  The Senate desperately needed to return to a system where all \nSenators have a say in what the Senate does and are able to express \ntheir views without getting cut off at the pass. We are now returning \nto that system. We have resisted the temptation to cut off debate \nimmediately.\n  Under the majority leader's leadership, this body spent the better \npart of 3 weeks considering the Keystone XL Pipeline bill. During that \ntime, Senators--both Republican and Democrat--enjoyed ample opportunity \nto voice their position on the bill as well as on our energy policy \nmore broadly. This represents the exact sort of deliberate character \nthe Senate was designed to embody.\n  Indeed, the Democratic minority actually used more hours of floor \ndebate on Keystone than did the Republican majority. To me, this is a \nremarkable statistic indicative of our new majority's commitment to \ntreat the minority fairly and to approach individual Senators, \nregardless of party, as valuable contributors to our work rather than \nas mindless partisans.\n  The Senate was also designed to be the institution in our system of \nrepublican self-government that produced wise legislation. Popular \npassions, parochial interests, and factionalism--what Edmund Randolph \ncalled the ``turbulence and follies of democracy''--were to be defined \nin the Senate where smaller membership and larger constituencies and \nlonger terms would improve the legislative product.\n  These structural features of the Senate led to the development of a \ntradition in which individual Members were allowed to offer amendments \nfreely--one of the primary mechanisms by which this body can refine \nlegislation for the better. For centuries, this notion of an open \namendment process has been at the core of the Senate's identity. But in \nrecent years, many of us have bemoaned the demise of this tradition. In \neffect, one of this institution's most defining characteristics was \nemasculated for partisan political purposes. But the way we dealt with \namendments over the course of the last month shows that the open \namendment process is making a comeback.\n  The majority leader shepherded through votes on more than 30 \namendments in January, more than double the amendment votes permitted \nby the Democrats in all of 2014. In fact, in 1 week alone, we voted on \nmore amendments than the previous majority allowed us to vote on all of \nlast year. There could be no clearer evidence of this body's \nresurgence.\n  The facts speak for themselves. While one former Democratic Senator \ndid not receive a vote on any of his amendments during the entire \nextent of his service in this body over the prior 6 years, the lone \nfreshman Democrat Senator in this Congress, the junior Senator from \nMichigan, has already received a vote on one of his amendments in just \nthe first few weeks of his service here. Truly, under this new \nmajority, Senators of both parties are individually contributing to our \nwork for the common good.\n  A key part of returning to regular order is restoring the committee \nprocess. A healthy committee process is essential to a well-functioning \nSenate. In committees, Members are often best able to work together to \ndebate, draft, and amend legislation that ultimately passes the Senate. \nWe began resuscitating the committee process in our consideration of \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline bill.\n  I commend the tireless efforts of the distinguished Chair and ranking \nmember of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, who together \nmasterfully led this body through recently unfamiliar territory of \nlegislating through regular order.\n  The Senator from Alaska merits particular praise for the skill she \ndemonstrated in guiding this bill through the process, while the \nSenator from Washington should be lauded for her commitment to a fair \nand orderly process despite her opposition to the underlying policy. \nTheir admirable work set an important example for the rest of us as we \nreturn to regular order in the 114th Congress by working together to \nimprove legislation rather than simply trying to shut each other out of \nthe process.\n  I heard voices from some corners quibbling over certain elements of \nthe Keystone debate process, but to focus on these criticisms misses \nthe forest for the trees by fixating on one or two nitpicks and \nignoring how deliberative and inclusive the process really was. We \nenjoyed open debate, ample opportunity to amend, and respect for \ncommittee expertise. This all contributed to the passage of a \nbipartisan bill.\n  The proof is in the votes. Of the almost 50 votes on Keystone-related \nmatters, few followed strict party lines, and the final bill won \npassage with 62 affirmative votes, including those of 9 Democrats. \nTwenty percent of Democrats present, nearly one-fifth of the caucus, \nvoted for the Keystone bill. This was real bipartisanship.\n  The result was a critically important piece of legislation that the \nPresident of the United States should sign into law. I urge him to do \nso. But that is not what we are hearing from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. \nNo, the President has said he will veto the bill. In fact, he said he \nwould veto it before we even took it up--before any amendments had even \nbeen offered.\n  Instead, President Obama appears determined to ignore the will of the \nU.S. Congress, dismissing bills out of hand that have yet to reach his \ndesk. I fail to see how this recalcitrance advances the cause of \nresponsible governance or responds to the will of the American people \nwho made their preferences clearly known at the ballot box last \nNovember.\n  I, for one, will not let the President's irresponsible attitude \ntoward this institution diminish my commitment to it. In fact, I call \non each Senator to continue working to restore our Chamber's proper \nfunctioning. I urge all of us to participate actively in the committee \nprocess, help produce sound legislation, and carry out our \ninstitutional duties.\n  The American people can then see for themselves the stark difference \nbetween a Senate that works and a White House that is unwilling to \nengage in genuine negotiation and compromise.\n  I will close with a note on civility, that crucial ingredient we must \nnever overlook, even in the heat of political discourse. I recall the \nwords of Senator Chris Dodd, my friend, who represented Connecticut in \nthis body for 30 years. In his final speech here on the Senate floor in \nlate 2010, he reminded us that the Senate was intended to be a place \nwhere every Member's voice could be heard and where deliberation and \neven dissent would be valued and respected. As Senator Dodd explained, \n``Our Founders were concerned not only with what was legislated, but--\njust as importantly--with how we legislated.''\n  I have observed that debate on this floor during the past few weeks--\nalthough tense at times--has on the whole been genuine, balanced, and \nrespectful. We must remain true to this\n\n[[Page S973]]\n\nethos as we continue to reinvigorate the debate and amendment process.\n  In the weeks and months ahead, new disagreements will surely arise. \nThis is when civility and statesmanship are most needed. We must each \novercome whatever instincts may drive us away from civil discourse and \ntoward anger, bitterness, petulance, or self-promotion.\n  When this new Congress convened just over six weeks ago, I spoke of \nour collective duty to restore the Senate. I expressed my confidence \nthat we could make the Senate work again by returning to regular order, \npromoting robust debate, and enabling an inclusive amendment process. \nWe have made admirable progress over the last month. Our actions are \nbacking up our rhetoric. Let us sustain this momentum.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/12/senate-section/article/S973-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PRESIDENT'S NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, this afternoon the Senate voted to \napprove Dr. Carter's nomination as the next Secretary of Defense. I \nsupported his nomination and appreciated the candor he displayed during \nboth his confirmation hearing and in our private meeting.\n  I believe the many challenges facing our Nation require a fresh \nperspective and a strong analytical mind. I am confident Dr. Carter \npossesses both. Despite the fact the international landscape has \nchanged dramatically over the past few years, the Obama administration \nhas failed to modify its policies to meet the new challenges facing our \nNation. In fact, top administration officials have emphasized in recent \ninterviews their approach is not changing and instead offer Americans a \nlaundry list of things they will continue to do. This is unacceptable.\n  I am very concerned this administration actually believes the correct \ncourse of action is to continue what we have been doing. In the Senate, \nthe Armed Services Committee has held a number of hearings to examine \nthe effectiveness of the current U.S. national security strategy.\n  Witnesses from across the political spectrum have merged on one \npoint. In several key areas, U.S. national security strategy and our \nregional goals are either ambiguous or divorced from events on the \nground. What is needed is a reevaluation, not a continuation.\n  In Syria, for example, President Obama called on Bashar al-Assad to \nstep down 3 years ago. However, the President has failed to lay out a \nstrategy to accomplish his stated goal. After hundreds of thousands of \nSyrians have died, terrorist groups have seized control of about half \nof that country. Further, thanks to assistance provided by Iran and \nRussia, Assad has fortified his control over much of western Syria.\n  In response to all of this, President Obama has continued to call for \na negotiated transfer of power without any articulation of how this \nwould be accomplished. The President's goal was probably unlikely when \nit was first conceived, but now it is thoroughly unimaginable.\n  The Obama administration has also stated the United States intends to \ndegrade and destroy ISIL. While I support this goal, I am concerned we \nhave yet again failed to lay out a strategy to accomplish it.\n  Yesterday President Obama sent to Congress his authorization of \nmilitary force. The decision to send young men and women to war is the \nmost serious decision that elected officials will make. This deserves a \nserious, open, transparent debate that is worthy of the American \npeople. I look forward to a robust committee process on this issue.\n  I am also eager to hear more from the President about the exact \ncontours of his strategy, particularly when it comes to achieving very \nclear goals. What exactly do we hope to achieve? Simply stating our \nobjective is to destroy ISIL doesn't reflect the complexities of \nactually realizing this goal.\n  The President has waged a campaign of airstrikes against this \nbarbaric terrorist group, but we know airpower alone will not be \nsufficient to destroy ISIL. While the White House has proposed arming \nand training Syrian opposition fighters, this effort will take years to \nproduce a force that is strong enough to dislodge ISIL from its \nstrongholds in eastern Syria. What is more, it is unclear how the \nSyrian fighters--any of whom view Assad as the primary target--will be \nconvinced to first fight ISIL. Questions about the extent to which the \nUnited States will provide opposition forces direct air support if they \nare attacked by ISIL or Assad--those questions remain unanswered. For \nthese reasons, the President has been rightly criticized for not having \na clear and effective strategy.\n  Again, I support the goal of destroying ISIL. But this is a \nmultilayered problem. In Iraq, the administration seems to embrace a \ngrowing Iranian role, even though this puts our goal of maintaining a \nunified Iraq in even greater jeopardy.\n  With respect to Iran itself, the administration unequivocally states \nit will not allow that nation to develop a nuclear capability, but we \nhear reports repeatedly that are suggesting the U.S. negotiators are \ncrafting an agreement that would accept its enrichment program and \nleave Iran as a threshold nuclear power 1 year away from a bomb, at \nmost.\n  In Ukraine, the United States imposed sanctions on Russia in March \nfor its intervention. Since that time, Russia has continued to pour \nheavy weapons and fighters into that conflict. Clearly our policy is \nnot working. We must acknowledge that as Putin continues to build \nmomentum on the battlefield, the incentive for him to honor his \ndiplomatic commitments and end the conflict diminishes.\n  Additional measures--including defensive weapons for the Ukrainians--\nare necessary, and they must be implemented. The international \ncommunity and most Americans are understandably confused by the stark \ncontrast between what they see and what they hear from the White House. \nThey hear vague assertions, but they see no strategy. They hear a goal, \nbut they see no discussion on how to achieve it. This damages our \nglobal credibility.\n  In a world where we rely heavily on partner nations to be our boots \non the ground, we cannot afford to have our international allies \nwondering if we mean what we say.\n  Dr. Carter will have a lot on his plate in his new role. I hope his \nappointment will help encourage the strategic reevaluation that is so \ndesperately needed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I stand before this body this afternoon to \nencourage my colleagues--particularly my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle--to take into account the need to fund the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  The House of Representatives acted responsibly in passing legislation \nto keep the Department of Homeland Security funded, and they did so \nacting more than 1 month in advance of the scheduled expiration of the \nexisting funding stream for the Department of Homeland Security. This \nwas a good move. It was likewise a good move of\n\n[[Page S974]]\n\nthe majority leader to bring up this bill for consideration nearly 1 \nmonth before the expiration of the existing funding. I applauded this \neffort and still do.\n  One of the reasons it was so important is it would help us avoid the \ncliff effect. What I mean by that is the dynamic that occurs every time \nwe have a scheduled expiration of funding and the House and the Senate \nwait until the last minute, sometimes with only 1 or 2 days, sometimes \nwith only 1 or 2 hours to spare before we act.\n  What this does is effectively shuts out the voices of most Members of \nthe House and most Members of the Senate. It strips us of our right to \noffer improvements, amendments, to legislation before that legislation \nhas a chance to become law.\n  Ultimately this enures to the advantage of just a few people, and it \nresults in the effective disenfranchisement of so many people \nthroughout America whose voices don't have an opportunity to be \nconsidered through their duly-elected Senators and Representatives.\n  That is why this time it was going to be different. That is why this \ntime it was so great the House and the Senate acted early in bringing \nup this legislation.\n  Nevertheless, it has been 2 weeks since we brought up this bill, the \nbill passed by the House to keep the Department of Homeland Security \nfunded. Two weeks, and we have cast vote after vote trying to get on \nthe bill--just trying to consider the bill--and we have seen those \nefforts to get on the bill blocked by my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle.\n  Earlier today I heard colleagues on the other side of the aisle \ntrying to explain their reasons for continuing to block consideration \nof this bill. I heard arguments that suggested that although they want \nto keep the Department of Homeland Security funded, they don't want to \nconsider this bill because, as some of them have put it, they don't \nlike everything the House of Representatives put into the bill. They \ndon't like the provisions in the bill restricting the administration's \nability to use those funds to carry out--to implement--the President's \nExecutive orders issued in November of this last year, Executive orders \nthat would have the effect of granting amnesty to millions of people \ncurrently inside the United States illegally.\n  Look, people are entitled to their opinions about how best we should \nproceed, how best we should deal with those who are currently inside \nthe country illegally. There are a lot of opinions about this, and \neveryone is entitled to their own opinion. But Americans are \noverwhelmingly united behind the uncontroversial proposition that when \nCongress has established a law in a particular area, as it has with our \nimmigration code, in order for that law to be changed, it needs to be \nchanged by congressional action. The House needs to pass it, the Senate \nneeds to pass it, and the President needs to sign it into law.\n  As the President has acknowledged repeatedly, he lacks the authority \nto make those changes on his own. He lacks the authority to act \nunilaterally. He lacks the authority under our system to behave as if \nhe were a government of one. Ours is not a government of one. In fact, \nour Founding Fathers, while they disagreed on a number of issues, they \nwere united behind one core principle behind our 227-year-old governing \ndocument that has fostered the development of the greatest civilization \nthe world has ever known. They were united behind the proposition that \nbad things happen when too much power gets consolidated into the hands \nof the few or, even worse, into the hands of one person.\n  That is why they put in place this system that would split the powers \nof government into three coequal branches, and within the legislative \nbranch--which many of them tended to view as wielding potentially the \nmost dangerous power--they split up that power into two bodies and then \nsplit up the power within each of those bodies so no one person and no \none group of people could accumulate too much power.\n  They certainly never intended a system in which we would have a \nvirtual monarch, albeit a monarch serving for a term of years who could \nby the stroke of a pen change the law according to his own will, change \nthe law in order to suit his own political interests, change the law \nwithout going through Congress. Yet that is what has happened, which \nbrings me back to arguments made today and over the last few days by my \ncolleagues across the aisle. They say we are fine with funding the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, but we don't like all the provisions \nput in there by the House of Representatives. We don't like those \nprovisions that would restrict the President's authority to spend money \nimplementing the President's Executive amnesty program.\n  Again, Americans, regardless of how they feel about amnesty, as a \nmatter of policy, are overwhelmingly of the opinion--and correctly so--\nthat this is a decision that needs to be made by Congress and not the \nPresident of the United States.\n  Secondly, this is the kind of issue we deal with, with some \nregularity, within Congress.\n  Within the system as it has evolved, within the system as dictated by \noperation of the rules of the House of Representatives, typically--and \nfor more than a century exclusively--it has been the role of the House \nof Representatives to initiate appropriations bills when we are trying \nto fund a government program that starts in the House, and that has \nbeen the case for well over a century. So they have the prerogative of \nstarting a bill to fund the government, and that is what they did.\n  When it comes over here, if you don't like it, that is fine. This is \na great place to be if you don't like a bill as it starts out. The U.S. \nSenate has been called the world's greatest deliberative legislative \nbody with good reason--because our rules, when properly followed, \nprotect the right of every Member to make sure his or her views are \nadequately aired and protect and preserve the right of each and every \nMember to offer improvements to bills and offer amendments to make \nchanges to legislation before it is put into law. Our rules are very \nclear on this.\n  It is unfortunate that in the last few years under the previous \nleadership those rights were trampled. Those rights were suppressed. We \noften didn't have those rights. We often had legislation that came up \nwithout a fair, open opportunity for each Member to offer amendments.\n  But we have moved on. We have a new majority leader, a majority \nleader who has, to his great credit, stood behind his commitment to \nprotect the right of each Member to offer amendments to legislation. I \nthank him for that and encourage him to continue following this because \nit is good for this body. But because it is good for us and because our \nrules already provide for it and because we are following those rules \nnow, as evidenced by the fact that we have now voted on more amendments \non the floor in the form of a rollcall vote to pending legislation just \nin the last few weeks than we did in the entire last Congress, as \nevidenced by that, we don't need to fear the old order anymore. We \ndon't need to fear the possibility of legislation coming into this \nbody, and if we proceed to it, that that legislation will be without \nthe opportunity to offer amendments.\n  So if Members don't like something in this bill, vote at least to \nproceed to it, vote at least to allow the debate to begin, but that, \nalas, is not what my colleagues across the aisle have chosen to do.\n  What they have chosen to do is to say: No. No, no, no. They are \nobstructing. They are obstructing the process as it was designed by the \nConstitution and as contemplated by the rules of the Senate and the \nrules of the House of Representatives.\n  They are saying, no, we will not consider this because we don't like \nsome provisions of this bill. Yet they are also saying at the same time \nwe want to keep the Department of Homeland Security funded.\n  I agree with exactly half of that statement. I agree with them I \nthink when they say they want to keep the Department of Homeland \nSecurity funded. At least I will take that at face value. But if they \ntruly do, then why on Earth would they not proceed to it? And if they \ndon't like some of the other provisions, let them offer amendments. Let \nthem change that.\n  At the end of the day, we have to come to terms with the fact that \nnot all of us are going to like every part of every bill that comes \nover from the\n\n[[Page S975]]\n\nHouse of Representatives. In fact, I dare say it hardly ever happens \nthat any one Member of this body immediately, automatically feels great \nabout every jot and title, about every section, every syllable, every \nparagraph of a bill that comes over from the House of Representatives.\n  That is exactly why we have the rules we do. That is exactly why \nparliamentary procedures, as they have evolved over the centuries, \ngenerally have as their central feature the protection of Members of \nany body such as this of the right to offer amendments, to offer \nhelpful suggestions. But under our rules in the Senate, that cannot \noperate, it will not operate, it is not available, it doesn't exist \nunless we first vote to proceed to the bill.\n  So I invite my colleagues across the aisle--I challenge them--if they \nwant to keep the Department of Homeland Security funded, vote to get on \nthis bill. If they care about America's national security, there is a \nway to prove it. There is a way to prove they mean what they say when \nthey say they want to keep it funded. Vote to get on this bill. It \ndoesn't mean they have to agree with me, but it was not only acceptable \nbut entirely appropriate and even necessary for the House to act to \nprotect the constitutional order and to do so by restricting the \nPresident's ability to spend money to implement his Executive amnesty \nprogram.\n  People don't have to agree with me on that, but if Members want to \nkeep the Department of Homeland Security funded, they can and they must \nand they will vote to proceed to this bill. Now we may disagree on what \namendments you offer, but the Senate majority leader has repeated his \noffer, to make sure that we have an open amendment process, and we \nwill.\n\n  In light of that, there is no excuse--there can be no excuse for my \nDemocratic colleagues to continue to insist on the one hand that they \ncare about our Nation's security and funding the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, while voting on the other hand against proceeding to this \nfunding bill to keep the Department of Homeland Security funded. There \nis no excuse and there can be none.\n  It is most unfortunate that we have gone now 2 weeks without being \nable to proceed to this bill--2 weeks in which we could have offered \namendments, 2 weeks in which my Democratic colleagues may well have \nsucceeded in getting rid of some or perhaps all of the provisions they \ndon't like added by the House of Representatives. They may have ended \nup with a piece of legislation that is exactly what they would have \nwritten had they started it over here, but they didn't do that.\n  Meanwhile, they have the audacity to accuse Republicans of causing \nthis problem. This is something I don't understand. There are those \namong them who insist that Republicans did this very thing in the last \nCongress. Well, there were times when Republicans voted in the last \nCongress not to proceed to something, but overwhelmingly--and if I \nrecall correctly, perhaps entirely--when Republicans stopped their \nmotion to proceed, when Republicans blocked cloture on a motion to \nproceed to the legislation, it was on the basis of a well-founded \ncomplaint that there would be no open amendment process. But there is \nno such argument to be made here. That argument has thankfully been \ntaken off the table by our majority leader, who has thankfully opened \nup the Senate once again and made an amendment process possible.\n  Perhaps my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are still \nfearing the shadow cast by the previous leadership exercised in the \nprevious Congress in the Senate that blocked out the amendment process, \nthat made amendments impossible. If that is what they are afraid of, \nthey have no need to fear. The Sun is now shining. The opportunity to \noffer up amendments and have those amendments considered has been \nrestored to the Senate. There is no reason to be afraid. No reason to \nbe afraid, of course, unless we somehow do the unthinkable--unless we \ncontinue to kick this can down the road farther and farther until we \nhave no options left on the table.\n  We have just a few legislative days remaining between now and the \ntime the existing funding for the Department of Homeland Security will \nexpire. Our next vote has been scheduled on this, as I understand it, a \nweek from Monday. I would implore each of my colleagues to reconsider \ntheir current strategy. Whether you like it or not, the way our system \nis set up is that the House of Representatives starts our spending \nbills. They have to pass spending bills first. If you don't like \neverything in the Homeland Security bill that the House passed--fine, \nvote to proceed to it and then change it. Change it back however you \nwant. Propose amendments. I might not vote for all of them, I might not \nagree to all of them, but propose them. Have them aired out, have them \nconsidered by this body, by the American people, and let's have the \ndebate, because our clock is ticking and our Nation's homeland security \nis too important for us to continue to put this off. But that is what \nwe have been doing. That is what my colleagues who have been voting \nagainst cloture on the motion to proceed have been doing every time \nthey voted no on this important issue.\n  The time has come for this body to accept the fact that a new day has \ndawned and we now have the ability once again to offer amendments, and \nbecause that opportunity now exists again, there is no reason to be \nafraid to move to legislation that has been passed by the House of \nRepresentatives to keep one of our government's important departments \noperating--no reason to fear whatsoever. In fact, if you are worried \nabout what you should be fearful of, you should be fearful of not \nproceeding to this bill.\n  The next time we cast a vote on this, I encourage each of my \ncolleagues to vote yes. Let's get on the bill and have an open, robust \ndebate and whatever the outcome of that debate, we will get something \npassed. We will get it to the President, and we will make sure we keep \nthis Department funded.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Barrasso). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy).

Mr. President, here in Congress, as the Presiding Officer \nknows, we do a lot of oversight. Oversight is focused on what is going \nright as well as what is going wrong in our government. There is a lot \nof each, actually. That oversight is critically important work. It is \nsometimes overlooked, but critically important.\n  I think it is also important to stop and recognize where things are \ngoing right from time to time and the people who are doing the right \nthing. Following in the footsteps of one of our former colleagues \nhere--I don't think the Presiding Officer ever had a chance to work \nwith him, but Ted Kaufman was a Senator who served here for 2 years. He \nsucceeded Joe Biden who went off to do some other job--Vice President, \nmaybe that is what it is. And then, before Senator Chris Coons was \nelected 2 years later, Ted Kaufman was our Senator, a great guy. He \nused to be Senator Biden's chief of staff for 20 years or so.\n  Ted used to come to the floor pretty regularly and talk about \ndifferent Federal employees who are doing exemplary work; people who \nhad gone above and beyond to achieve the mission of solving problems \nand giving the U.S. taxpayer something to be proud of.\n  When somebody has a good idea, I like to steal it, and I think Ted \nKaufman had a great idea. I have not really stolen it, but we have \ntaken an idea and we have focused it a little bit, to focus on some of \nthe people the Presiding Officer and I, along with Senator Ron Johnson, \nmet with this last weekend on the U.S. border with Mexico. I have \ndecided to take the Ted Kaufman idea and focus it, put a spotlight on a \nnumber of employees within the Department of Homeland Security.\n  As many of us know, the Department of Homeland Security, which does \nimportant work--sometimes heroic work, dangerous work--they suffer from \nlow morale, but it is filled with men and women who, frankly, deserve, \nI think, in many cases, a lot more credit than they receive.\n\n[[Page S976]]\n\n  Today I wish to speak for the next several minutes about one of the \npeople we met, a fellow whose name I think the Presiding Officer will \nprobably remember. His name is Ramiro Garza, Jr., and he goes by Ram. I \nthink he has probably gone by Ram all his life. I will always remember \nhim as Ram. He is an outstanding Border Patrol officer whom we met last \nweek in McAllen, TX, while we were visiting the Mexican border in South \nTexas--the three of us, the Presiding Officer, Senator Ron Johnson, and \nyours truly.\n  This is Ram. Some of my colleagues may remember the pictures last \nsummer, when an unprecedented surge of Central American children and \nfamilies arrived at our Texas border. They are the kind of pictures \nthat really burn into our memories for a lot of us. The pictures we are \nmore used to seeing may be from war zones than to see here in our own \ncountry, with hundreds upon hundreds of unaccompanied minors and a lot \nof mothers with young children in search of protection, literally \nturning themselves in to our Border Patrol agents; not running away \nfrom them, but turning themselves in and asking for asylum.\n  The Rio Grande Valley in South Texas is where Agent Ram Garza works. \nRam is the acting patrol agent in charge of the Rio Grande Valley \nsector of the U.S. Border Patrol. The Rio Grande Valley where Ram works \nis the epicenter of that humanitarian crisis we witnessed last year. \nThat is because most of the migrants were from the northern triangle of \nCentral America, and they were fleeing violence, fleeing economic \ndesperation, and fleeing a sense of hopelessness in Guatemala, \nHonduras, and El Salvador.\n  These migrants had to travel some 1,500 miles through Mexico, risking \nlife and limb to get to the United States. The shortest route--though \nby no means an easy one--runs up the east side of Mexico from Central \nAmerica to the South Texas border, and many of the people who are \nmaking that 1,500 mile trek did it on top of a train. In fact, they did \nit on a series of trains--freight trains, not passenger trains--where \npeople actually get on top of the trains and try to hold on for a 1,500 \nmile trip. Some of them succeeded and some of them didn't. Some of them \nfell down between the trains and cars and lost their lives. Some made \nit to the border. Some fell off the train. Some got hurt. Some got on \nanother train. Some didn't make it. But many of them rode on top of \nthose trains to get here, and they suffered violence. If they made it \nsafely on the train, a lot of them suffered violence at the hands of \npredatory gangs along the way.\n  When these children showed up in South Texas, they literally \noverwhelmed the Border Patrol stations along the border. These stations \nare only supposed to hold detained migrants for a short period of time \nas they are processed for removal back to where they came from, or for \ndetention. Usually along the border, they deal with the young men. \nHowever, last year stations were packed with mothers and young children \nwho were trapped there for days as our government struggled to find \nsuitable shelters and decide what to do with them. There were no \nadequate meals, no clothing, no diapers. There is literally no room at \ntimes for someone to lie down, either.\n  Faced with this human crisis, Customs and Border Protection agents \nsprang to action. Among their leaders was our agent here today whom I \nespecially want to put a spotlight on: Ramiro Garza. With the help of \nhis colleagues, Ram went above and beyond to process the arrivals, \naccording to the law, while also responding to the human needs of these \npeople. Agent Garza helped create an emergency operations center to \nmanage the crisis and worked to transfer unaccompanied children to the \nOffice of Refugee Resettlement.\n  Perhaps most impressive, though, he worked with his colleagues to \nconvert an enormous abandoned warehouse that we visited in McAllen, TX. \nI will not soon forget that. It is just a few miles from our border \nwith Mexico. He turned it into a processing center for detained \nmigrants and they did it in 18 days. They looked at a place--and they \ndescribed what it was like before they started working on it, and then \nwhat they did in 19 days, they did pretty remarkable stuff. And Ram, \nwhom we honor especially here today, and those who worked with him \ndeserve our recognition.\n  This processing center helped greatly relieve the crowded and \ninadequate conditions in multiple Border Patrol stations along the \nborder. When Senator Ron Johnson, our Presiding Officer, Senator Sasse, \nand I visited this past weekend the extraordinary processing center \nthat Agent Garza helped set up, we were amazed to see a cavernous, \norderly center equipped with the humanitarian necessities needed for \nhundreds of children and their parents. The center also had space for \nCentral American officials to work with Customs and Border Protection \nin order to properly identify migrants and arrange for speedier \nrepatriations, in many cases to their home countries, where \nappropriate.\n  Agent Garza was instrumental in designing the processing facility and \ngetting it up and running quickly. Today he is in charge of that \nfacility.\n  This is just the latest achievement in Agent Garza's career with the \nBorder Patrol. As I said, known most of his life as Ram, he grew up in \nthe Rio Grande Valley. There he attended high school and the University \nof Texas-Pan American. He joined the Border Patrol in 1996. His first \nassignment was to the Brownsville station in the Rio Grande sector. In \n2004, he was promoted to supervisory Border Patrol agent at the Rio \nGrande City station. That was followed by tours at the Rio Grande \nsector's intelligence office and at Harlingen station.\n  Agent Garza also worked on detail here in Washington, DC, where his \nduties included supporting the agency's efforts in biometric \ncollection--something we think is very important. While he is helping \nto humanely process migrants apprehended at the border, Agent Garza \nalso cares for his own family--his wife and their own two children. We \nthank them for sharing with us their husband and their dad--a very good \nman.\n  The Department of Homeland Security and our Nation are truly blessed \nby Ram's exemplary service.\n  Agent Garza, if you are out there listening, we want to thank you for \nwhat you do each and every day for all of us. We thank you for your \ntireless service to our Nation for all of these years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/12/senate-section/article/S976-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S976-S977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING\n\n  Mr. CARPER. As the Presiding Officer, along with Senator Johnson and \nmyself, met the men and women of the Border Patrol last weekend, \nincluding Agent Garza, we heard about their work, and it is hard to \nignore the fact that they might not know if they will be getting a \npaycheck next month when the continuing resolution which funds the \nDepartment of Homeland Security expires in actually about 2 weeks, on \nFebruary 27.\n  Many of them don't know if they will be able to obtain the technology \nor supplies they need to do the jobs as effectively as possible either. \nThis is not the way we would want to be treated if we were in their \nshoes, but it is how I think we are treating the men and women who work \naround the clock to protect our borders and to keep our Nation safe and \nsecure. Those of us here in Congress can change that, and I think we \nshould.\n  Two of our colleagues--Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and \nBarbara Mikulski of Maryland--have introduced a clean appropriations \nbill that would fund the Department of Homeland Security for the \nbalance of the fiscal year, up through the end of September. Overall, \nthe funding provisions in their bill, S. 272, which I understand both \nDemocrats and Republicans on the Appropriations Committee agreed to in \nDecember--just 2 months ago--provide just under $40 billion in \ndiscretionary funding for the Department of Homeland Security for the \nremainder of the fiscal year. I think that is an increase from year to \nyear of about $400 million. It sounds like a lot money. It is about a \n1-percent increase above 2014 funding. This bill would ensure that \nDepartment employees get their paychecks on time and have the resources \nthey need to best meet the Department's critical mission and the \nsecurity needs of our Nation.\n  The clean bill put forward by Senators Shaheen and Mikulski would\n\n[[Page S977]]\n\ntake additional measures to secure order and enforce our immigration \nlaws--something that I know is a priority to me and I know to our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle. In fact, most of the funding \nincrease in the Shaheen-Mikulski bill would go to border security and \nimmigration enforcement.\n  The bill our colleagues have put forward contains a little more than \n$10 million for Customs and Border Protection--an increase of \napproximately $118 million above last year's enacted level. This \nfunding level would support the largest operational force levels for \nthe agency in its history--a total of more than 21,000 Border Patrol \nagents and nearly 24,000 enforcement officers.\n  But if the Department of Homeland Security remains on a continuing \nresolution--or worse, shuts down--we just won't be as effective as we \nought to be in securing our Nation's borders. If Congress forces a \nshutdown of the Department--I hope we won't--frontline personnel would \nbe asked to continue to work without pay. We met some of them just a \nfew days ago when we were on the border. They don't look like fast \nboats, but they move pretty good. We went zipping up and down the Rio \nGrande River looking for people trying to slip across the border, \nlooking for folks who were trying to bring contraband--drugs, illegal \ndrugs--across the border.\n  There are some 40,000 Customs and Border Protection officers who are \nneeded to keep our borders secure. If we allow the funding for the \nDepartment to lapse on February 27, we are going to expect these guys \nand gals to still come to work. We are not going to pay them, at least \nnot in a timely way.\n  If Congress continues to keep the Department on a continuing \nresolution, Immigration and Customs Enforcement will see a shortfall--I \nam told a little over half a billion dollars--to respond to \nunaccompanied minors and families with children.\n  In addition, Customs and Border Protection won't be able replace or \nupgrade border surveillance technology, including upgrades to obsolete \nremote and mobile video surveillance systems in the high-risk area of \nthe Rio Grande Valley.\n  The drone is a pilotless aircraft. We fly aircraft similar to these \nall over the planet. We fly a number of them along the border of our \ncountry with Mexico in an effort to try to see, visualize, and detect \npeople making their way to our border, maybe just to come across, maybe \nto flee a bad situation in their own country. Maybe it is to bring \ndrugs or other things that are illegal into our country. We are not \ngoing to be able to replace or upgrade this kind of technology and \nbring it to high-risk areas along the Rio Grande Valley.\n  Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson recently said--\nI want to quote Secretary Johnson just briefly. He said, ``Border \nsecurity is not free. The men and women of [the Department of Homeland \nSecurity] need a partner in Congress to fund their efforts.'' He added, \n``Time is running out.'' Those were his words. I couldn't agree with \nhim more.\n  In the next week or so, I pray that those of us in Congress will come \ntogether and will do what I believe is the right thing; that is, \nsupport the passage of a clean full-year appropriations bill for the \nremainder of this fiscal year for the Department of Homeland Security \nand do it by February 27.\n  After we have done that, for God's sake, let's get to work on \ncrafting thoughtful, comprehensive, bipartisan immigration reform law \nfor our country, one that better secures our borders, one that \nstrengthens our economy, and one that reduces our budget deficit over \nthe next two decades by hundreds of billions of dollars. That is what \nwe ought to do. I would pledge here today to my colleagues, Democrats \nand Republicans, one or two Independents, and our Presiding Officer, \nthat we will meet you in the middle and do our dead level best to make \nsure we meet our responsibilities.\n  With that, I am looking for others on the floor who may want to \nspeak. I don't see anybody.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/12/senate-section/article/S977-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DEPARTING STAFFERS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I would like to pay tribute to \ntwo of the hardest working staffers in the Senate: John Ashbrook and \nRussell Coleman.\n\n\n                            Russell Coleman\n\n  First, there is Russell, a dyed-in-the-wool Kentuckian. He is a huge \nWildcats fan. The only words one associates with Russell more often \nthan ``affable'' are these two: ``persuasive'' and ``determined.'' When \nRussell sets his mind to something, there is not much you can do to \nstop him--not that you would want to because he is one of the \nfriendliest guys you will ever meet. More than a few times, you will \nsee a group entering a meeting with Russell, spoiling for a fight. Then \nthe door opens, and they are his best friends. It is quite a skill. It \nis nearly as impressive as this one: Russell Coleman knows just about \neverybody in Kentucky. His Rolodex is something to behold.\n  He has done a lot of great work here in the Senate. This one-time FBI \nagent is passionate about law-enforcement issues. This one-time intern \nis passionate about mentoring others, letting those around him know, no \nmatter how junior, that their contributions do matter.\n  Russell is also a great fighter. That tough will has helped Russell \npush through adversity with grace and with grit. Faith is a big part of \nRussell's life too. It is something he shares with Chaplain Black every \nFriday in Bible study.\n  Russell is ready to share more of himself, too, with his family, his \nwife Ashley and his children, Annie and Clay. They are all making the \nmove back to Louisville. They will have a lot more time together, and I \nknow they and Russell couldn't be happier.\n  So congratulations, Russell, and thanks for your service.\n\n\n                             John Ashbrook\n\n  Let me tell you about John Ashbrook. John has been with me since I \nfirst became Republican leader. He was a fresh-faced kid back then, a \nyoung guy from Cincinnati who wanted nothing more than to work in the \nWhite House. I am grateful he chose to work for me instead. I am \ngrateful John was willing to transfer his allegiance across the Ohio \nRiver for the past 8 years because John Ashbrook is easy-mannered, \nmatched with unbending will. You don't see that very often. He has been \nan important player on our staff not only for his professionalism but \nfor his character too.\n  John is known around the Capitol as a founding member of the Senate \nRepublican Communications Center. With John's help, it has been a real \nsuccess.\n  The Capitol is going to be a different place without John's laughter \nechoing in the corridors. Every reporter knows his name. Every member \nof my staff knows his smile. It is pretty hard to miss.\n  John, muffin in hand, is usually the first guy in every morning. Many \nhours later, he is often the last one out. I appreciate it deeply.\n  I know John's wife Kate takes a somewhat different view. I can't \nblame her. Kate is ready for dinners without John's Blackberry at the \ntable, and John is ready to spend more time with his three beautiful \ndaughters--Margaret, Abigail, and Charlotte, all born during his \nservice here. John's daughters and Kate mean everything to him, and I \ncouldn't be happier that John will be seeing more of all of them very \nsoon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/12/senate-section/article/S977-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S977-S978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CELEBRATING THE 206TH ANNIVERSARY OF PRESIDENT ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S \n                                BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate one of the most \nadmired, well-known Americans and Presidents this great Nation has ever \nseen. Just 56 years ago, Carl Sandburg addressed a joint session of \nCongress and remarked about him: ``Not often in the story of mankind \ndoes a man arrive on Earth who is both steel and velvet, who is as hard \nas rock and soft as drifting fog, who holds in his heart and mind the \nparadox of terrible storm and peace unspeakable and perfect.''\n  Those words echo today, as it marks the arrival as the 206th \nanniversary of\n\n[[Page S978]]\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln's birth. Born on February 12, 1809, Lincoln \nhad humble beginnings in Kentucky and Indiana before moving to Illinois \nas a young adult. He began his journey into politics there, serving in \nthe State legislature, the U.S. House of Representatives, and \neventually as U.S. President.\n  As President, he led our Nation through its most perilous times, \nsuccessfully ended slavery, and saved the Union. His contributions were \ntimeless as he paved the way for America to appreciate the true meaning \nof freedom, opportunity, and equality. We have come a long way since \nhis time and continue to work towards the America that President \nLincoln envisioned.\n  Every day we are reminded of President Lincoln's contributions. \nSymbols of him are found anywhere you go--whether it be on the face of \nthe penny or the monument down the street. We can and should preserve \nthese reminders of his work and his ideals of freedom, opportunity, and \nequality for generations to come.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the 206th birthday \nof the 16th President of the United States, as well as the penny that \nhonors his name. Hailing from the Land of Lincoln, I have long \ncelebrated the life and legacy of President Abraham Lincoln.\n  For more than 100 years, Abraham Lincoln has been the face of the \npenny. Lincoln was the first person to appear on an American coin, and \nthe Lincoln penny is the longest used design of any American coin.\n  For generations of Americans, the penny has served as a memorial to \nthe first President assassinated in office. It is a reminder of the \nliberation of the African slaves and of the brutal Civil War that \nthreatened to end the American experiment.\n  Different versions of the penny have been produced throughout the \nyears. In 1959, the 150th anniversary of Lincoln's birth, a \nrepresentation of the Lincoln Memorial was put on the reverse side of \nthe coin. To honor Abraham Lincoln's 200th birthday, four new penny \ndesigns were released. One reflects a log cabin, similar to the one in \nKentucky where Lincoln was born. The second features Lincoln reading a \nbook with an axe by his foot, showing his formative years and self-\neducation in Indiana. The third penny shows Lincoln speaking in front \nof the State capitol in Springfield, representing his professional life \nas legislator from Illinois. Finally, the fourth design features a \nhalf-finished Capitol dome during the Civil War to represent his \nPresidency. The newest reverse design depicts a Union shield with a \nscroll and carries the words ``Preservation of the Union'' marking what \nis seen as Lincoln's greatest achievement.\n  The Lincoln penny is the most common and most highly circulated coin \nin the United States. The penny significantly contributes to the U.S. \neconomy, especially in charitable contributions. Tens of millions of \npennies have been donated to charities over the past decade.\n  It may be the lowest coin denomination, but the penny carries a lot \nof weight in terms of our Illinois and American history, culture, and \nsociety. It is an intrinsic part of the American experience and \nrepresents the opportunity that many believe is inherent in the \nAmerican dream.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/12/senate-section/article/S978-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S978-S979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nmy remarks at the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee hearing earlier this week be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Reemergence of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases: Exploring the Public \n                    Health Successes and Challenges\n\n       From smallpox to polio, we have learned in the United \n     States that vaccines save lives. And yet a troubling number \n     of parents are not vaccinating their children.\n       Last September this committee held a hearing about the \n     Ebola virus. Our witnesses included a brave physician, Dr. \n     Kent Brantly, who worked in Liberia; and a brave father in \n     Sierra Leone who came to warn us about how rapidly the virus \n     was spreading. The number of people being infected with Ebola \n     was doubling every three weeks, and many of those infected \n     were dying--because for Ebola there was and is no cure, and \n     there was and is no vaccine.\n       This produced a near panic in the U.S.--it changed \n     procedures in nearly every hospital and clinic. In response, \n     Congress appropriated more than $5 billion to fight the \n     spread of the virus. The impact of efforts to fight Ebola is \n     that the number of Ebola cases is declining.\n       At the same time, here in the U.S. we are now experiencing \n     a large outbreak of a disease for which we do have a vaccine. \n     Measles used to sicken up to 4 million Americans each year-\n     and many believed that it was an unpreventable childhood \n     illness--but the introduction of a vaccine in 1963 changed \n     everything. Measles was declared eliminated--meaning absence \n     of continuous disease transmission for greater than 12 \n     months--from the United States in 2000. From 2001 to 2012, \n     the median yearly number of measles cases reported in all of \n     the U.S. was 60.\n       Today is February 10, 2015. It is the 41st day of the year \n     and we already have seen more cases of measles than we would \n     in a typical year. One measles outbreak--in Palatine, \n     Illinois, a suburb about a half hour from Chicago--has \n     affected at least five babies, all less than a year old.\n       Infants and individuals who are immunocompromised are \n     traditionally protected by what is called herd immunity--the \n     people around them are vaccinated, so they don't get sick, \n     and that keeps the babies and others who can't get vaccinated \n     from getting sick. That herd immunity is incredibly \n     important. Measles can cause life-threatening complications \n     in children, such as pneumonia or swelling of the brain.\n       Our witnesses today will talk more not just about what is \n     causing this outbreak, but why some parents are choosing not \n     to vaccinate their children. Measles is only one example. \n     This hearing which was planned before the measles outbreak \n     reminded us of the importance of vaccines. An analysis of \n     immunization rates across 13 states performed by USA Today \n     found the following:\n       ``Hundreds of thousands of students attend schools--ranging \n     from small, private academies in New York City to large \n     public elementary schools outside Boston to Native American \n     reservation schools in Idaho--where vaccination rates have \n     dropped precipitously low, sometimes under 50%.''\n       California is one of the 20 states that allow parents to \n     claim personal belief exemptions from vaccination \n     requirements. In some areas of Los Angeles, 60 to 70 percent \n     of parents at certain schools have filed a personal belief \n     exemption. In those elementary schools, vaccination rates are \n     as low as those in Chad or South Sudan.\n       The purpose of this hearing is to examine what is standing \n     between healthy children and deadly diseases. It ought to be \n     vaccinations. But too many parents are turning away from \n     sound science.\n       Sound science is this: Vaccines save lives. They save the \n     lives of the people who are vaccinated. They protect the \n     lives of the vulnerable around them--like infants and those \n     who are ill.\n       Vaccines save lives. They protect us from the ravages of \n     awful diseases like polio, which invades the nervous system \n     and can cause paralysis. I can remember as a child how \n     parents were frightened by the prospect of polio for their \n     child. I had classmates who lived in iron lungs. Our Majority \n     Leader, Senator McConnell, contracted polio as a child. Or \n     whooping cough, which causes thick mucus to accumulate in the \n     airways and can make it difficult for infants to breathe. Or, \n     diphtheria, a bacterial infection that affects the mucous \n     membranes of your nose and throat and can, in advanced \n     stages, damage your heart, kidneys and nervous system.\n       We have learned that vaccines save lives. They take deadly, \n     awful, ravaging diseases\n\n[[Page S980]]\n\n     from horror to history. So it is troubling to hear that \n     before we've even reached Valentine's Day this year, 121 \n     Americans are sick with measles, a disease eliminated in the \n     U.S. 15 years ago. It is troubling that a growing number of \n     parents are not following the recommendations doctors and \n     public health professionals have been making for decades. At \n     a time when we are standing on the cusp of medical \n     breakthroughs never imagined--cutting-edge personalized \n     medicine tailored to an individual's genome--we find \n     ourselves retreading old ground.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/12/senate-section/article/S980-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WOODSTOCK, MAINE BICENTENNIAL\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President. I wish to commemorate the 200th \nanniversary of the Town of Woodstock, ME. Known today as a gateway to \nthe rugged and beautiful Western Maine Mountains, Woodstock was built \nwith a spirit of determination and resiliency that still guides the \ncommunity today.\n  Woodstock's incorporation on Feb. 7, 1815, was but one milestone on a \nlong journey of progress. For thousands of years, the banks of the \nAndroscoggin River and its tributaries were the hunting grounds of the \nAbenaki Tribe. One of the legends that attests to the friendship that \ndeveloped between the Native Americans and the first European settler \nconcerns the Abenaki Princess Mollyocket, a woman with great spirit and \nknowledge of healing. A few years before the town was incorporated, she \nwas called to the small settlement of Trap Corner to attend to a \nseriously ill infant. She nursed the baby back to health and pronounced \nthat he would grow to greatness. Mollyocket's patient was Hannibal \nHamlin, who became Abraham Lincoln's first Vice President.\n  Settlement began in 1787, when 10 lots of 100 acres each were \nsurveyed. The early settlers at what was called The Thousand Acre \nSquadron were drawn by fertile soil, vast forests, and fast-moving \nwaters, which they turned into productive farms and busy mills. The \nwealth produced by the land and by hard work and determination was \ninvested in schools and churches to create a true community. In 1815, 5 \nyears before Maine statehood, the settlers' petition for incorporation \nto the Governor of Massachusetts was readily signed, although, for \nreasons lost to history, he rejected the proposed name of Sparta and \nchose Woodstock instead.\n  The main population center of Woodstock is the Village of Bryant \nPond, known for its beauty, recreation opportunities, and hospitality. \nBryant Pond also is home to a 14-foot tall, 3,000-pound statue of an \nold-fashioned, hand-cranked telephone, the kind that had a human \noperator on the other end, to memorialize the town's distinction as the \nlast place in the United States to use these devices. The townspeople \nfinally gave up their hand-cranked telephones in 1983, but they retain \ntheir fondness for the personal touch.\n  Woodstock is a charming town of involved citizens. The active \nhistorical society, volunteer fire department, and library are evidence \nof a strong community spirit. That spirit will be on full display this \nJune, when Woodstock holds it Great Bicentennial Celebration.\n  This 200th anniversary is not just about something that is measured \nin calendar years; it is about human accomplishment, an occasion to \ncelebrate the people who for more than two centuries have pulled \ntogether, cared for one another, and built a community. Thanks to those \nwho came before, Woodstock has a wonderful history. Thanks to those who \nare there today, it has a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/12/senate-section/article/S980-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    REMEMBERING CORPORAL C.G. BOLDEN\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, on February 21, 2015, the city of \nClinton, AR will gather for a memorial service for Corporal C.G. Bolden \nwho was killed in action in Korea in 1951.\n  The service will coincide with the return of his remains for proper \nburial, over 60 years after he left Clinton to fight in the Korean war.\n  As a member of the Army Reserve, Corporal Bolden was called upon to \nserve shortly after the Korean war started. He had been in theater for \nonly a few months when his family back in Clinton received a telegram \nwith terrible news; Corporal Bolden was missing in action.\n  For the next 64 years, his wife, Geraldean Johnson, would await his \nreturn. In the days and months following that telegram, Geraldean would \ncheck the paper for news and sneak off to a quiet place to pray for her \nhusband's return.\n  Corporal Bolden--a light weapons infantryman in Company C, 1st \nBattalion, 38th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division--was taken \nprisoner by the enemy on January 5, 1951 and died as a prisoner of war \non April 30, 1951.\n  Last month, upon learning his remains had been positively identified, \nGeraldean recounted to KARK news in Little Rock how her husband would \noften appear in her dreams over the six decades. ``Those dreams would \nsay he is coming home this time, this is really it,'' she told the \nreporter.\n  Corporal Bolden was just 22 years old when he was captured while \nfighting the enemy in South Korea. He was marched to a prison camp just \nsouth of Pyongyang in what his wife told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette \nshe heard was ``the coldest weather there ever was.''\n  About 15 years ago, the military asked for and obtained DNA from \nCorporal Bolden's remaining siblings to aid in efforts to identify his \nremains. Last December, the Army contacted Geraldean to notify her of a \nDNA match. Corporal Bolden became the fifth Arkansan who had \ndisappeared during the Korean war to be identified.\n  Corporal Bolden was posthumously awarded the Prisoner of War Medal, \nNational Defense Service Medal, Korean Service Medal, Combat \nInfantryman Badge, United Nations Service Medal, Republic of Korea War \nService Medal, and Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation.\n  I am grateful that after all these years Corporal Bolden will finally \nbe reunited with his wife, son, and other family members. I appreciate \nthe work of those at the Joint Prisoner of War/Missing in Action \nAccounting Command who helped identify Corporal Bolden. Most of all, we \nare grateful for Corporal Bolden's service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/12/senate-section/article/S980-3", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CONGRATULATING UNLV'S LEE BUSINESS SCHOOL\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate the \nLee Business School of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, UNLV, for \nreceiving top honors at the American Institute of Certified Public \nAccountants, AICPA, Accounting Competition. UNLV's Accounting REBEL-\nation team included Annegenelle Figueroa, Kayla Shim, Brett Sebastian, \nand Kevin Curry. The students won a total of $5,000 to benefit the \nschool's accounting department, a contribution that will help future \nstudents for years to come.\n  The annual AICPA Competition assesses students' capabilities in \nmaking decisions on management, operations, finance, and strategy. This \nyear's competition drew 140 teams to represent schools across the \ncountry and required the students to create a cost-accounting system \nfor a fictional business called Humble Pies, Inc. The UNLV accounting \nteam worked over a 3-month period before advancing to the finals and \npresenting its ideas to a panel of accounting executives. Teams were \njudged based upon persuasiveness, technical detail, and creativity. The \nstudents representing UNLV were specifically applauded for their real-\nworld business application. These Nevada students are shining examples \nof how hard work and dedication lead to success and stand as role \nmodels for future Rebels.\n  I am excited to see local students bringing recognition to both \nNevada and to UNLV for their advancement in a national competition. The \nLee Business School should be proud to call itself a top contender in a \ncompetitive environment. I ask my colleagues to join me and all \nNevadans in congratulating these students from UNLV's Lee Business \nSchool for their unwavering effort and honorable representation of \nNevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/12/senate-section/article/S980-4", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S980-S981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CONGRATULATING MOUNTAIN RIDGE LITTLE LEAGUE ALL-STAR TEAM\n\n Mr. HELLER.

This series began back \nin 1947 and for the first time, in 2014, a team from Nevada represented \nthe greatest Little League team in the Nation. Today, I would like to \nhonor the players and coaches for their tireless efforts in reaching \ntheir goals and for representing Nevada with integrity and hard work.\n  The Mountain Ridge team, with players aged 12 to 13 years old, \nentered the Little League World Series U.S. Championship game with a \n16-0 record in four tournaments, outscoring opponents 184-29. The team \nshowed its true dedication to the State by traveling for weeks, \nspending time away from family and friends. Its journey began at the \nWestern Regionals Competition on August 1 in San Bernardino, CA, and \nended on August 25, after competing in the Little League World Series \nU.S. Championship game. Austin Kryszczuk, most noted for his batting \nskills, was labeled best player in the Little League World Series U.S. \nChampionships.\n  All of the players are role models for future generations of Nevada \nbaseball, and the coaches serve as shining examples of leadership. The \nMountain Ridge Little League team's accomplishment should be noted as a \nspecial moment to Nevada, after being called the second-most successful \nsports team in Las Vegas' history after the University of Nevada, Las \nVegas' men's basketball national championship team in 1990. This team \ndid more for Nevada than just represent the State on the field. It \nrevealed the strong community that Nevada has to offer with many groups \nof friends and families coming together to watch the games.\n  I am excited to see local athletes bringing recognition to Nevada and \nthe Las Vegas community. The Mountain Ridge Little League team should \nbe proud to call itself the top baseball team in the country.

Mr. President, small businesses have the unique \nability to seamlessly fill a niche in their local communities. In many \ncases, this means they offer a service or product that is completely \nunique to the region. As Valentine's Day and Mardi Gras quickly \napproach, I would like to honor a small business that is not often \nassociated with the State of Louisiana--a beautiful vineyard and \nwinery. This week's Small Business of the Week is Landry Vineyards and \nWinery of West Monroe, LA.\n  In 1999 with the help of their family and close friends, Jeff and \nLibby Landry decided to pursue their dream of owning and operating a \nvineyard. The Landry family started their business by planting Blanc Du \nBois grapes on their 2 acres in Folsom, LA. Four years later, they were \nlicensed as a Louisiana Native Winery, which allowed their wines to be \nshipped and sold across the State. After the devastation of Hurricane \nKatrina, however, the Landrys moved their enterprise to higher ground \nin the hill country of West Monroe. Today, the wines produced at Landry \nVineyards are available in over 300 stores throughout Louisiana and can \nbe purchased across the country by simply visiting their Web site.\n  The Landry family has created an experience for locals and out-of-\ntowners that is well worth the trip. Daily tours of the vineyards are \navailable for small groups on golf carts, and tractor drawn wagons are \nused for the larger groups. The winery also provides free wine tastings \nin the nearby tasting room, and guests are encouraged to bring picnic \nlunches to enjoy on the winery grounds. Each year the winery hosts an \noutdoor music concert series that caters to families with local bands \nwho perform in all genres like Cajun, funk, and country blues. The 20-\nacre property also serves as a popular destination for public and \nprivate events, including weddings.\n  In the last 15 years, Landry Vineyards has thrived despite any \nobstacles--whether it is a natural disaster or burdensome regulations--\nin its way. As I work to make sure the voices and concerns of small \nbusiness owners across the country are heard in Washington, the history \nand success of Landry Vineyards serve as an inspiring reminder of what \nis worth fighting for. Congratulations to Landry Vineyards and Winery \nfor being selected as this week's Small Business of the Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/12/senate-section/article/S981-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/12/senate-section/article/S981-3", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/12/senate-section/article/S981-4", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:56 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1.

A bill to promote career readiness indicators and career \ncounseling for students; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, preparing all students to be college and \ncareer-ready upon graduating high school is one of the central promises \nthat public education and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \nESEA, should fulfill. However, career readiness has\n\n[[Page S986]]\n\nall too often taken a back seat to a focus on traditional college \npreparation. Strong academic skills are essential to college \npreparation, but it takes much more to be truly ready for a career.\n  Today many students graduate high schools with little knowledge of \nthe careers available to them and the technical skills needed to meet \nthe demands of the 2lst century job market. ``Career readiness \nindicators'' are factors that demonstrate a student's preparedness, \nincluding both academic and technical knowledge and skills, for \npostsecondary education and the workforce. By encouraging school \ndistricts to track and report on career readiness indicators, States \ncan send a signal to schools, communities, parents, and students that \nit is critical to be prepared for the workforce regardless of \npostsecondary education plans. Additionally, it provides public data \nfor employers to help locate their operations in regions with a high-\nskilled workforce.\n  This is why I am pleased to introduce with my colleagues, Senator \nPortman and Senator Baldwin, the Career Ready Act, which will amend the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act to expand on these efforts by \nencouraging more states to report on courses in their school systems. \nThis includes utilizing multiple indicators of career readiness when \nstates report data to the federal government such as student \nparticipation in career and technical education courses or attainment \nof recognized postsecondary credentials or academic and technical \nskills including industry-recognized credentials, certifications, \nlicenses, and postsecondary degrees. Tracking and publishing this data \nprovides much-needed information for businesses and workforce leaders \nthat is not provided under current law.\n  This bipartisan legislation also strengthens the Elementary and \nSecondary School Counseling grant program in current law by placing an \nemphasis on career guidance and providing professional development for \nschool counselors to use labor market information and partnerships with \ncommunity groups such as local workforce investment boards, businesses, \nindustries, and regional economic development agencies to educate \nstudents on postsecondary opportunities. The Career Ready Act \nencourages schools to align career exploration course offerings and \ncounseling to the workforce needs of the local community and coordinate \nwith the requirements of the Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act \nand the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act.\n  I am proud to introduce this commonsense, bipartisan legislation to \nimprove career readiness and career guidance to ensure students are \nprepared for the 21st century workforce. I strongly encourage my \ncolleagues on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions committee to \nconsider this legislation in any ESEA reauthorization.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 487. A bill to amend the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to \nallow the rebuilding, without elevation, of certain structures that are \nlocated in areas having special flood hazards and are substantially \ndamaged by fire, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fire-\nDamaged Home Rebuilding Act.\n  This legislation is simple. It allows families living in federally-\ndesignated flood plains to rebuild their home in the event it is \ndestroyed by a fire.\n  The bill allows communities to waive requirements that were meant to \nblock reconstruction after floods, but which have been applied to block \nreconstruction of homes after fires and other natural disasters as \nwell.\n  I was first made aware of this issue by a constituent from \nSacramento, Jennifer Taylor. Her home in the Natomas neighborhood \nburned down, and she was denied when she applied for a permit to \nrebuild it. The county informed her that Federal floodplain regulations \nrequired her to elevate the home 20 feet above ground level because of \nexisting deficiencies in the levee protecting her neighborhood.\n  Can you imagine what that would look like? Every house in the \nneighborhood at ground level, and one home towering 20 feet above the \nrest?\n  More importantly though, the cost would be exorbitant, and would not \nbe covered by her insurance. Instead, the cost would be imposed on a \nfamily trying to get back on its feet after a personal tragedy.\n  When the home burned down, the family collected $71,000 from their \ninsurance company. Contractors estimated the cost to restore the home \nto its original condition was $170,000--a significant burden, but one \nthe family was willing to bear.\n  But when the family factored in the cost of elevating their home 20 \nfeet, the cost skyrocketed. Contractors estimated the elevation project \nwould cost an additional $200,000.\n  Just to restore their home to its previous size and condition, the \nfamily would owe $300,000 more than what they received from their \ninsurance.\n  There is a fundamental issue of fairness at stake.\n  This family tragically lost their home and many of their personal \nbelongings. But instead of helping the family during this difficult \ntime, the Federal Government is instead blocking them from rebuilding. \nWhy? Because the Federal Government has failed to maintain adequate \nflood protection.\n  It just doesn't seem fair.\n  The Fire-Damaged Home Rebuilding Act addresses this issue by allowing \nlocal communities to grant variances to federal flood plain regulations \nwithout jeopardizing their participation in the program.\n  The legislation allows waivers to be granted only if all of the \nfollowing conditions are met: communities must already have taken steps \nto repair damaged levees, such as seeking Federal authorization of a \nlevee project, and there must be previously existing plans to obtain \nthe requisite 100-year flood protection in the near future.\n  The destroyed house must be within a deep floodplain where it would \nbe too expensive and unsightly to elevate the home.\n  The new home must be built within the footprint of the destroyed \nstructure.\n  The homeowner cannot qualify for new insurance discounts; and the \nproperty has never been associated with a claim to the National Flood \nInsurance Program.\n  These limitations will only allow families to rebuild very limited \ncircumstances after tragedy strikes that is unrelated to a flooding \nevent. The number of waivers local governments can approve is capped at \nten per year so that this authority is not subject to abuse. This limit \nwill ensure that waivers are used prudently and sparingly.\n  I strongly oppose new development in the flood plain. It is \nirresponsible to permit new homes or businesses to be constructed \nwithout adequate mitigation in an area where you know that flooding is \nlikely.\n  The Federal floodplain regulations were put in place to block \nindividual homeowners from voluntarily renovating and improving their \nhomes. They were also designed to block homeowners from rebuilding \nafter a flood. By doing so, the Federal Government limits its liability \nfor future flood insurance claims.\n  Fire-damaged homes clearly represent an exception to these \ncircumstances, however. So we need to adjust the law to eliminate an \nunfortunate and unintended consequence of an otherwise good policy.\n  City and county governments must be empowered to make case by case \njudgments about whether it makes sense to elevate damaged structures by \n10, 15, or 20 feet when the rest of the neighborhood remains at ground \nlevel.\n  That is exactly what the Fire-Damaged Home Reconstruction Act does. \nIt provides limited authority to local governments, which will allow \nthem to do what makes sense for their communities and will allow \nfamilies to rebuild after a fire or other non-flood disaster.\n  This is a commonsense piece of legislation and I hope my colleagues \nwill work to quickly adopt the bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. KLOBUCHAR (for herself, Mr. Enzi, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Flake, \n        Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 491. A bill to lift the trade embargo on Cuba; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss our country's \nrelationship with Cuba. I have long advocated modernizing our \nrelationship\n\n[[Page S987]]\n\nwith Cuba. The current embargo has been in place for 50 years, and it \nhas greatly constrained opportunities for American businesses by \nrestricting commerce, by restricting our exports--things that are made \nin America--from going to a place that is only 90 miles off our shores \nand has 11 million people.\n  That is why today I introduce the bipartisan Freedom to Export to \nCuba Act with Senators Enzi, Stabenow, Flake, Leahy, and Durbin. This \nbill lifts the trade embargo on Cuba and knocks down the legal barriers \nto Americans doing business in Cuba. This bill will help open up new \neconomic opportunities for American businesses, which will mean more \njobs. It will also boost opportunities for farmers--something the Chair \nknows well coming from the State of North Dakota, as we know well in \nthe State of Minnesota. This will also allow Cubans to have access to \nthese products, which we believe is good for their country, good for \ntheir people so that they can become a different country.\n  Freeing our businesses to pursue opportunities for development could \ngreatly help the people of Cuba. Consider for example that Cuba only \nhas a 2G cellular network and that only about one-fourth of the \npopulation has Internet access. Ultimately, I believe this legislation \nwill help usher in a new era for Americans and Cubans shaped by \nopportunities for the future rather than simply a story of the past.\n  The process the President has jump-started to normalize our ties with \nCuba is a positive step forward. My home State of Minnesota exported \nabout $20 million in agricultural products to Cuba in 2013. I think \npeople are surprised by that, but as many of us know, there are \nhumanitarian exceptions to the current embargo. So our country is \nalready exporting, and my State alone exported $20 million in products. \nWith the President's action alone, the Minnesota Department of \nAgriculture estimates that exports could increase by another $20 \nmillion. The United States is already the fourth largest source of \nimports to Cuba based solely on authorized shipments of agriculture and \nmedical supplies. Over the past decade we have been one of Cuba's top \nsuppliers of food products. So it is not as if we don't already do \nbusiness there, but unlike every other country, including our own \nneighbor to the north, Canada, we hamstring our businesses seeking to \nexport their products there. Export and travel restrictions have \ncontinued to prevent Americans from seeking opportunities in Cuba, and \nthe embargo prevents Cubans from obtaining food and other goods we take \nfor granted in our country.\n  Cuban human rights activist Yoani Sanchez wrote:\n\n       It is impossible for Cubans to buy staples like eggs or \n     cooking oil without turning to the underground market. \n     Rationing forces people to stand in line for hours for \n     poultry and fish. On the Cuban government's 50th anniversary \n     in 2009, it provided families with an extra half pound of \n     ground beef, but that beef was not from the U.S. It was \n     sponsored by the Venezuelan government . . . a meager gift \n     nicknamed ``Hugo Chavez's Hamburger'' by everyday Cubans.\n\n  I say it is time for America to stop ceding credit for the hamburger \nto Venezuela. It is time that we made our hamburger accessible in Cuba. \nThe Freedom to Export to Cuba Act will help us do that. It is simply a \ntargeted repeal of the provisions in current law that keep the embargo \nin place, including restrictions that prevent American businesses from \nfinancing their own exports to the island and requirements for American \nfarms to seek special licenses for any transaction with Cuba.\n  It is also important to emphasize what this bill does not do. There \nare many outstanding issues that many of my colleagues have discussed \nbetween our two countries that must be dealt with, especially our \nconcerns about the Cuban Government's repressive policies. That is why \nthis bill does not repeal provisions of current law that address human \nrights in Cuba or that allow individuals and businesses to pursue \nclaims against the Cuban Government for property.\n  None of us is under any illusion about the nature of the Cuban \nGovernment. The Cuban Government must take serious steps to reform \npolitically and economically. It must free political prisoners and stop \narbitrarily arresting people for political speech. It must also take \nsteps to liberalize its state-centric economic system if it truly hopes \nto allow its people to prosper and to benefit from growing commerce \nwith the United States.\n  We do not minimize the importance of those issues, but we also know \nthe embargo has not helped to solve them. Members on both sides of the \naisle recognize that continuing along the same path with respect to \nCuba has not achieved our objectives and in fact has constrained \nAmericans' freedom to pursue business opportunities abroad. It has \nhindered our freedom to travel, which is why I also cosponsored the \nFreedom to Travel to Cuba Act recently introduced by Senator Flake.\n  Both that bill and the Freedom to Export to Cuba Act that I have \nintroduced today with a bipartisan group of Senators shows that we can \nwork together in this new Congress to support a commonsense \nrelationship between the United States and Cuba.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. It is \na chance to build on our current progress and take additional actions \nto forge a practical and positive relationship with the people of Cuba \nand the people of America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Kirk, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Whitehouse, \n        Mr. Heinrich, and Mr. Bennet):\n  S. 492. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 in order to improve environmental literacy to better prepare \nstudents for postsecondary education and careers, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing bipartisan \nlegislation to provide support for environmental education in our \nNation's classrooms. I thank Senators Kirk, Durbin, Whitehouse, \nHeinrich, and Bennet for joining as original cosponsors of the No Child \nLeft Inside Act of 2015.\n  Given the major environmental challenges we face today, it is \nimportant to prioritize teaching our young people about their natural \nworld. Preparing the next generation to be stewards of our natural \nenvironment not only equips them with important skills and knowledge \nbut also, as studies have shown, enhances achievement levels in science \nand other core subjects and increases student engagement. Another key \nbenefit is that it promotes healthy lifestyles by encouraging kids to \nspend more time outside.\n  For more than 3 decades, environmental education has been a growing \npart of effective instruction in America's schools. Responding to the \nneed to improve student achievement and prepare students for the 21st \ncentury economy, many states and schools throughout the Nation now \noffer some form of environmental education.\n  Indeed, according to the National Association for Environmental \nEducation, 47 States and the District of Columbia have taken steps \ntowards developing plans to integrate environmental literacy into their \nstatewide educational initiatives. In Rhode Island, organizations such \nas the Rhode Island Environmental Education Association, Roger Williams \nPark Zoo, Save the Bay, the Nature Conservancy, and the Audubon \nSociety, as well as countless schools and teachers, are offering \neducational and outdoor experiences that many children may never \notherwise have, helping inspire them to learn. In partnership with the \nRhode Island Department of Education, these organizations have \ndeveloped a statewide environmental literacy plan that is now being put \ninto action.\n  Yet, environmental education is facing a significant challenge, and \nremains out of reach for too many children. With many schools being \nforced to scale back or eliminate environmental programs, fewer and \nfewer students are able to take part in related classroom instruction \nand field investigations, however effective or in demand these programs \nare.\n  The No Child Left Inside Act would increase environmental literacy \namong elementary and secondary students by encouraging and providing \nassistance to States for the development and implementation of \nenvironmental literacy plans and promoting professional development for \nteachers on how to integrate environmental literacy and field \nexperiences into their instruction.\n\n[[Page S988]]\n\n  The legislation would also support partnerships with high-need school \ndistricts to initiate, expand, or improve their environmental education \ncurriculum, and for replication and dissemination of effective \npractices. Finally, the legislation would support interagency \ncoordination and reporting on environmental education opportunities \nacross the Federal Government. This legislation has broad support among \nnational and state environmental and educational groups.\n  In addition to the benefits that accrue to students, business leaders \nalso increasingly believe that an environmentally literate workforce is \ncritical for long-term success. Indeed, according to a 2011 survey by \nthe GreenBiz Group and the National Environmental Education Foundation, \n65 percent of respondents valued environmental and sustainability \nknowledge as a factor in making hiring decisions, and 68 percent \nbelieved that the importance of this knowledge would continue to grow \nin the future. We must ensure that our students are prepared with the \nknowledge that employers are looking for, and that increasingly \nincludes environmental literacy.\n  For these reasons, I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor the \nbipartisan No Child Left Inside Act and to work together to include its \nprovisions into the upcoming reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DAINES (for himself, Mr. Cassidy, Mr. Gardner, and Mr. \n        Cotton):\n  S. 493. A bill to reduce a portion of the annual pay of Members of \nCongress for the failure to adopt a concurrent resolution on the budget \nwhich does not provide for a balanced budget, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Budget.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I join Senator Cassidy of Louisiana, \nSenator Gardner of Colorado, and Senator Cotton of Arkansas in \nintroducing the Balanced Budget Accountability Act. By establishing the \nprinciple No Balanced Budget, No Pay, this legislation will bring \nfiscal responsibility to Washington. The American people deserve a \nbalanced budget. Unfortunately, Washington remains unwilling to take \nthe steps needed to get our country back on solid fiscal ground. The \nBalanced Budget Accountability Act reflects core principles that work: \ncommon sense business practices that protect hardworking taxpayers and \nmaking elected officials accountable for delivering results to the \npeople they serve. It is what Washington needs to finally balance the \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 493\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the exploration, leasing, development, \nproduction, and economically feasible and prudent transportation of oil \nand gas in and from the Coastal Plain in Alaska; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise, along with my colleague Senator \nSullivan, to introduce a bill to open a small portion of the arctic \ncoastal plain, in my home State of Alaska, to oil and gas development. \nI am introducing this bill today because I strongly believe that \nwhether oil and gas exploration should be conducted on a small portion \nof the coastal plain is a question for Congress; not one for unilateral \naction by Federal agency.\n  The 1.5 million acres of the Arctic coastal plain that lie within the \nnon-wilderness portion of the 19 million acre Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge are North America's greatest prospect for conventional onshore \nproduction. When Prudhoe Bay, the largest conventional oil field in \nNorth America and one of the 20 largest fields in the world was \ndiscovered in 1968, estimates at the time projected 9.6 billion barrels \nof oil would be recovered. The U.S. Geological Survey continues to \nestimate that this part of the coastal plain has a mean likelihood of \ncontaining 10.4 billion barrels of oil and 8.6 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas, as well as a reasonable chance of economically producing \n16 billion barrels of oil. With potential comparable to Prudhoe Bay, \nthe coastal plain represents an opportunity to ensure the American \nenergy renaissance continues and our domestic energy security is \nbolstered for decades to come.\n  Alaska used to provide that foundation for our country. At its peak \nin 1988, Alaska provided nearly 25 percent of America's domestic \nproduction. Today it represents barely 6 percent. Importantly, despite \nthe Federal government owning almost 70 percent of the lands in Alaska, \nalmost all of our oil production is from State lands. The people of \nAlaska are doing everything they can to contribute to America's energy \nsecurity by promoting production from State lands. In the past two \nyears the State of Alaska has passed oil tax reforms, improved State \npermitting and provided more than $1.2 billion in State tax credits to \nsupport the exploration and development of oil from State lands. The \nonly production on federal estate comes from the Northstar project, a \nsmall man-made island that straddles state and federal waters in the \nBeaufort Sea.\n  For more than 30 years, my State has successfully balanced resource \ndevelopment with environmental protection. Alaskans have proven, over \nand over again, that these endeavors are not mutually exclusive, and \nwith advances in technology, the footprint of development projects is \nonly getting smaller. Yet as the Federal level, there is an astonishing \nrefusal to acknowledge the record.\n  With new exploration and development projects on Federal lands \nstalled or outright blocked, Alaska faces a tipping point. The Trans-\nAlaska Pipeline System, an engineering marvel that has served as one of \nAmerica's great energy arteries for decades is facing more and more \nchallenges from lower throughput. A closure of TAPS would shut down all \nnorthern Alaska oil production, devastating Alaska's economy and \ndeepening our dependence on unstable petrostates throughout the world. \nExploration and development in the Arctic offshore and National \nPetroleum Reserve Alaska depend on the long-term viability of the \nTrans-Alaska Pipeline System.\n  The bill I introduce today, would disturb no more than 2,000 acres of \nthe vast coastal plain. To put this in perspective, 2,000 acres is less \nthan \\1/6\\ the size of the local Dulles Airport, or about \\1/10\\ of 1 \npercent of the refuge. Since these areas are less than 60 miles from \nTAPS, development in the Coastal Plain is the quickest, most \nenvironmentally sound way to increase oil production in Alaska and \nensure the pipeline will operate well into the future, providing jobs \nand supporting the economies of both Alaska and the United States.\n  The bill includes strong protection for fish and wildlife, fish and \nwildlife habitat, subsistence resources, and the environment. \nDevelopment would not move forward if it would cause significant \nadverse impacts to the coastal plain. The bill also ensures these \nprotections are strong because it provides for strict consultation with \nthe residents of the coastal plain; the City of Kaktovik as well as the \nregional government, the North Slope Borough. The bill also provides \nimportant impact aid to the local communities from the State's share of \nrevenues due to it under the Mineral Leasing Act and Alaska's Statehood \nAct.\n  As we continue to struggle with long-term unemployment, and an \nunsustainable national debt, we need to pursue development \nopportunities more than ever. The shale oil and gas boom on 2 state and \nprivate lands in the Lower 48 has been the shining light as our economy \nstruggles to recover from the recession. My bill offers us a chance to \nproduce more of our own energy, for the good of the American people, in \nan environmentally-friendly way and with the meaningful impact of the \nlocal people.\n  For decades, Alaskans, whom polls show overwhelmingly support \ndevelopment of the coastal plain, have been asking permission to \nexplore and develop the resources located there. Consistent with the \nAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, ANILCA, the state of \nAlaska recently submitted a plan to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nto conduct minimal exploration activities in the coastal plain and was \nrejected. Despite the fact that the State was in court presenting its \ncase, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service released an updated Plan for \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge that puts areas like the Coastal \nPlain in de facto wilderness status as Wilderness Study Areas.\n  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service states that they did not consider \nan oil and gas alternative, as requested by the State of Alaska, North \nSlope Borough, various Alaska Native Regional and Village Corporations \nas well as a broad spectrum of Alaskans, because they stated that the \ndecision to conduct oil and gas development is one for Congress to \nmake. I hope this Congress will rise to that challenge and have the \ncommon sense to allow America to help itself by developing a small \nportion of the coastal plain. This is critical to my State and the \nnation as a whole and one more step we can take to push back against \nthe unilateral executive actions that are threatening our economy and \nvery system of government.\n  With this in mind, Senator Sullivan and I will work to educate \nmembers of this chamber about the opportunity we have and the \ntremendous benefits it would provide. We will show why such development \nshould occur--why it must occur--and how it can benefit all of us and \nhelp secure our energy security for decades to come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Manchin, Mr. Thune, Mr. Vitter, \n        Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Burr, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Wicker, Mr. \n        Isakson, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Moran, Mr. Crapo, Mr. \n        Risch, Mrs. Fischer, and Mr. Daines):\n  S. 498.

A bill to focus limited Federal resources on the most serious \noffenders; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Smarter \nSentencing Act, which I believe is a very critical piece of \nlegislation.\n  I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this legislation in this \nCongress, and I thank the bipartisan coalition of Senators who have \ncome together, led by Senator Mike Lee from Utah and Senator Dick \nDurbin from Illinois. Their leadership on this issue has been \nabsolutely critical.\n  The Smarter Sentencing Act has essential front-end reforms. These are \nreforms for when a person gets to the point of incarceration. What they \nactually do is combat injustices in the Federal sentencing program. \nThey address a real plague in our country; that is, mass incarceration.\n  Think about this: We are the land of the free. We are a nation that \nbelieves in liberty and justice. But we are singular in humanity for an \nawful distinction: We have 5 percent of the globe's population but we \nincarcerate 25 percent of the globe's incarcerated people. That is \nunacceptable unless you believe for some reason that Americans have a \nhigher proclivity for crime, unless you believe we have something in \nour water that makes us more likely to do wrong, and that is not the \ncase.\n  The challenge is that we have seen in the past three decades a \nprofound over-incarceration driven by a drug war that has created \nunfortunate negative consequences to our society. I thank Members of \nCongress for stepping up in this Congress to speak to this issue. It is \nun-American that we should hold the largest amount of incarcerated \npeople per population than any other country. It goes against the very \nstrains of our society dedicated to liberty, dedicated to keeping \ngovernment focused on what it should be doing, not overreaching, not \nbecoming overly aggressive, not surrendering or taking the liberty \nunnecessarily of other Americans.\n  I would like to talk for a few minutes about this broken system. What \nis broken in our criminal justice system? Well, when about three-\nquarters of our Federal prisoners are actually nonviolent offenders--I \nam actually one of those people who believe that if you do a violent \ncrime, you should pay a very hefty price for that, that we as a society \nshould have a place where we take stern action against people who \npromulgate violence, who undermine civil society. But as we look at \nthis mass-incarceration problem where 25 percent of the globe's prison \npopulation is in our country, we realize that three-quarters of those \npeople in the Federal prison system are nonviolent offenders.\n  This is not our history. This is not our tradition. Over the course \nof all of our Nation's history, we did not have this problem. It has \nreally been the last 30 years where we have witnessed the explosion in \nthe U.S. Federal prison population. In those 30 years alone--think \nabout this--in the last 30 years alone, the prison population at the \nFederal level has expanded by nearly 800 percent. That is a massive and \nunacceptable increase, especially when you realize this was driven by \nthe incarceration of nonviolent offenders.\n  This expansion of our prison population had a harmful effect when \nthose people were released because once someone has a nonviolent felony \noffense, it is hard to get a job, it is hard to get business licenses, \nand they cannot get Pell grants. Often those people get caught up and \ngo back to being involved in the drug war. So what happens is that two \nout of three of those people get rearrested within 3 years.\n  We are paying for this broken system, this revolving door of \narresting nonviolent offenders, releasing them, and bringing them back \ninto our system. It is plaguing the Federal budget and, frankly, State \nbudgets all around our country. Each year more than one-quarter of a \ntrillion dollars is being spent on this broken criminal justice \nsystem--money that could be used to empower people to succeed, to \nrepair our infrastructure, or, how about this, it could stay in \ntaxpayers' pockets.\n  What makes this system worse is that it undermines our American \nideals. As I look across the way from the Capitol Building where I \nstand now and see the Supreme Court, written above the Supreme Court \nbuilding, at the top, is this ideal of equal justice under law. The \nideal that everyone will be treated equally under the law. But this \nbroken criminal justice system has disproportionately impacted certain \nAmericans and not others, which undermines America's core values of \nfairness and equal treatment for all.\n  More than 60 percent of our prison system is comprised of racial and \nethnic minorities. The painful reality is that if somehow African \nAmericans or Latinos used drugs at different levels than Whites, that \nmight explain the disparate impact. If they dealt drugs at different \nlevels, yes, that might explain it. But that is not the case. African \nAmericans engage in drug offenses at a lower rate than Whites but are \nincarcerated at a rate 10 times that of Whites.\n\n[[Page S991]]\n\n  What is alarming about the mass incarceration is that people are \nactually not committing more and more crimes. The National Research \nCouncil recently released a report confirming what numerous other \nstudies have actually shown: Incarceration rates are actually not tied \nto crime rates. We have seen incarceration rates going up and up, but \nnow crime rates are coming down.\n  What is perpetuating this explosion of our prison population? It is \nthe war on drugs that has created over the last 30 years alone an over-\ncriminalization of nonviolent individuals, which stacked our prison \npopulation full of Americans, disproportionately minority and \ndisproportionately poor.\n  Please understand that the people paying the highest price for this \nare the poor in our country. The New York Times yesterday published an \narticle detailing how our jails have become warehouses made up \nprimarily of people too poor to pay bail or to hire lawyers or too ill \nwith mental health or drug problems to adequately care for themselves. \nIf you look at our prison population, you will see that poverty, race, \nmental illness--those are the folks who are being disproportionately \nincarcerated.\n  If we follow our core ideals of fairness, democracy, and justice--\nthen we know that mass incarceration is not who we are. That is not \nright. That the times demand that we examine this broken system and do \nthose commonsense things that are needed to make our justice system \njust, to work first and foremost for our safety, to not be a gross \nwaste of taxpayer dollars, and to make sure basic ideas of fairness are \nfulfilled.\n  This is not just speculation. And what is so powerful about this \nmoment in time, even though all I have said so far is compelling \nenough, is that we as Federal actors--the 100 Senators here, the 435 \nCongress men and women, the President and the Vice President--don't \nneed to figure out a way forward, make it up, design legislation based \non our own ideas. We actually only have to look at the pathway forward \nby looking at Governors and legislatures in the States. They are so \nburdened by the costs of this unruly system, a system that is now \nplaguing--the Federal Bureau of Prisons is plaguing our country with \nits cost. What the States are doing to bear that cost is they are \nfinding pragmatic, commonsense, bipartisan ways to move forward.\n  In fact, what gets me excited as a Democrat is that we just have to \nlook at the red States and what the red States are doing to reduce \ntheir prison populations. Let me give an example. States such as Texas, \nGeorgia, and North Carolina are leading on this issue, and the Federal \nGovernment should follow.\n  Texas is a State known for law and order, and known for being tough \non crime. Yet Texans realize that being smart on crime means saving \ntaxpayer dollars, using that money efficiently and effectively, \nlowering crime, and guess what, hey, we can also lower our prison \npopulation and empower people to be successful in life and not slip \ndown that slope back toward recidivism. They have made tremendous \nstrides in Texas in adopting policies that are designed to reduce their \nprison population and lower recidivism.\n  In 2007, Texas boasted the fourth largest incarceration rate in the \ncountry. Faced with a budget projection that estimated by 2012 the \nState would need an additional 17,000 prison beds--think about that for \na second. They saw that they were going to need to build more prisons, \nhouse 17,000 more prison beds, and it was going to cost them $2 billion \nin Texas. The State's legislature said: Enough of this madness. Enough \nof this craziness.\n  They enacted bold reforms that would act as a model for us in the \nFederal legislature. As a result, they passed this broad-based \nlegislation. Texas was able to stabilize their prison population and \navert that budgetary disaster.\n  Texas State Representative Jerry Madden, a Republican, noted in a \nrecent hearing before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, \nTerrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations that the crime rate is \nnow at 1968 levels. They were able to close three prisons and six \njuvenile facilities, and remarkably the Texas prison system is now \noperating at a 96-percent capacity. Commonsense reforms.\n  Georgia is another State. They have made remarkable progress. They \nare showing that reducing the prison population can lead to dividends \nfor taxpayers, and can lower crime. In fact, over the past 5 years, in \nterms of the racial disparities in incarceration, Georgia has reduced \nthe number of Black men incarcerated in the State by 20 percent. And \nthey haven't seen crime go up--quite the contrary. They have seen it go \ndown.\n  These States are proving that they don't have to lock up more people \nto create that safety we desire. States such as New Jersey, Texas, \nCalifornia, Virginia, Hawaii, Wyoming, Massachusetts, Kentucky, \nConnecticut, Rhode Island, Colorado, New York, South Carolina, Alaska, \nand Georgia have all seen drops in crime rates as they have been \nimplementing commonsense criminal justice reform.\n  So let's be clear. I am advocating for the Smarter Sentencing Act, \nbut we should also be moving for bold, broad-based criminal justice \nreforms, copying the successes of red States with Republican Governors. \nWe should be looking at their innovations and following their \ncommonsense solutions and mirroring their success at the Federal level.\n  I am speaking of reforms at the front end when people get arrested; \nreforms behind the wall--inside the prison system to address what goes \non in prison and helping these people, and reforms on the back end when \nthey come out of prison, to ensure they stay out of prison.\n  Front-end reforms going on around our country are exciting, such as \nsentencing reform. What about radical ideas such as letting judges make \ndecisions about sentencing and stop trying to legislate it? Judges are \nthe experts. They know of the brutality of a person's circumstances. \nThey can design sentences.\n  These policy initiatives should address the entire system. Behind-\nthe-wall efforts should focus on initiatives to change the way \nprisoners experience life behind bars. To get treatment and job \ntraining so they don't commit future crimes. This is commonsense stuff. \nWe shouldn't send people to prison and have them become criminalized or \nundermine their ability to be successful adults when they come out.\n  We should also focus on that back end, this idea that we need reentry \npolicies to help people get jobs, reconnect with their families, and \nbecome strong, full-fledged American citizens. I am speaking of things \nsuch as parole reform.\n  To move forward we need to think big. This is what I will be \nadvocating for. We can tackle this by taking a systemic approach. We \nmust look at a broad-based reform agenda.\n  I love the fact that we have conservatives and liberals united on \nthis issue--Republicans and Democrats, red Staters and blue Staters. \nCriminal justice reform is not a partisan issue, it is an American \nissue.\n  In 2010, Senators on both sides of the aisle came together to improve \nour justice system by passing the Fair Sentencing Act, which the \nPresident signed into law. This was a bipartisan piece of legislation \nthat reduced the sentencing disparities between crack and powder \ncocaine--drugs that are pharmacologically indistinguishable. They \nchanged it from 100 to 1 to 18 to 1, and I thank Senators Durbin, \nGrassley, Leahy, and Graham for their leadership on this issue.\n  Last year I joined with Senator Rand Paul from Kentucky. I don't know \nhow many sentences are used by people that contain the names Cory \nBooker and Rand Paul in them, but we agree on this issue. We have \ncommon ground, and we introduced the REDEEM Act. This legislation aims \nto keep juveniles out of the criminal justice system. We looked to stop \nacts that many other countries consider torture, such as taking \njuveniles and routinely putting them into solitary confinement where \nthey are traumatized and often come out of those circumstances more \nlikely to do harm to themselves or others. We are going to reintroduce \nthat bill this year.\n  Just last month I sat on a criminal justice reform panel right here \nin the Halls of the Senate, hosted by Van Jones on the left and Newt \nGingrich on the right. In the last few months I have talked to Grover \nNorquist, I have\n\n[[Page S992]]\n\ntalked to the Koch brothers' representative, their chief counsel, and I \nhave talked to conservative think tanks and Christian evangelicals. All \nof us agree on this issue. This chorus of voices, this coalition, this \ncourageous commitment to our country's ideals lets us know that whether \nyou consider yourself a liberal or a conservative, whether you consider \nyourself moderate leaning, left or right, this is an area we can agree \non. It will save taxpayer money, uphold our ideals of liberty and \nfreedom, create safer communities, and empower individuals to be \nsuccessful.\n  Today I am excited to have joined with Senators Lee, Durbin, Leahy, \nand Cruz to support the Smarter Sentencing Act. We need to have this \nconversation about reducing Federal mandatory minimums. In fact, I love \nthat the Urban Institute has stated that mandatory minimums for drug \noffenses is the single largest factor in the growth of the Federal \nprison population.\n  Let me repeat that. Mandatory minimums for drug offenses are the \nsingle largest factor in the growth of the Federal prison population. A \nkey factor in that 800-percent growth in the last 30 years has been \ndriven by nonviolent drug offenders and mandatory minimums.\n  This bill also would do other things. It would expand the Federal \nsafety valve, giving judges greater discretion and allowing them to \nhand out their sentences. Those people who believe in separation of \npowers, let the judiciary have more space to hand down fairer sentences \nand not shackle them with laws made by legislators who don't know the \nparticulars of a case. Many Federal judges have spoken out about \nmandatory minimums being unnecessarily restrictive for them in doing \ntheir job.\n  The bill would also make the Fair Sentencing Act retroactive, which \nwould allow persons convicted under the old crack-powder cocaine \ndisparity to now receive a fairer sentence. With the crack-cocaine law \nchanged in 2010, an individual arrested today would receive a lesser \nsentence. So making this law retroactive to impact people sentenced for \ncrack cocaine offenses prior to 2010 is only fair.\n  This bill could save a lot of money--hundreds of millions of dollars. \nIt would give us some freedom not only to return some toward debt \nrelief for this country--Lord knows we need to focus on that--but also \nto invest in other programs many people on both sides of the aisle \nsupport, such as reentry programs to help people stay out of prison and \nget back to a productive lifestyle. If enacted into law as the bill is \ncurrently scored, it would save $3 billion over the next decade alone. \nThis is critically important.\n  So this is a call to the conscience of the Congress. Every single day \nwe pledge allegiance to our flag. That is not something anybody in this \nChamber does as sort of a routine, perfunctory salute. We say those \nwords because they mean something, and we end with this ideal that is a \nlight to all of humanity--this ideal of liberty and justice for all.\n  If we mean those words, then that, across the board, is what we \nshould be pursuing in this body. We know in our country States are \ndoing things to further uphold these ideals, that they are making \ncommonsense reforms that are keeping people safe and lowering crime, \ncommonsense reforms that are saving taxpayer dollars and relieving the \nburden on taxpayers and budgets, that they are passing reforms that \nliberate people from the shackles of an imprisonment that is \nunnecessary, that is directly addressing the painful disparities of \nrace and poverty, and that it is empowering Americans, our brothers and \nsisters. In all of our holy texts it talks about the dignity of all \npeople, whether they are behind bars or on our streets, the dignity of \nworth that empowers people to be successful, to have life and liberty \nand to pursue their happiness.\n  So I say I support reforming our criminal justice system. More \nimportantly, I say let's support our ideals. Let's be a nation of \nliberty and justice for all. Let's follow the lead of courageous \ngovernors and legislatures and let's make this Nation even better than \nit is today. I urge all Senators to promptly pass the Smarter \nSentencing Act through the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Risch, Mr. Merkley, Mr. \n        Udall, Mr. Bennet, Mrs. McCaskill, and Mr. Tester):\n  S. 517. A bill to extend the secure rural schools and community self-\ndetermination program, to restore mandatory funding status to the \npayment in lieu of taxes program, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the Secure \nRural Schools and Payment in Lieu of Taxes Repair Act with my colleague \nSenator Crapo. The bill will ensure that counties across the nation \nwill have three more years of Secure Rural Schools, SRS, payments. \nAdditionally, the bill would restore mandatory funding for Payment in \nLieu of Taxes, PILT.\n  Because Congress failed to take action to reauthorize SRS before the \nend of the 113th Congress, counties across the country received SRS \npayments this week that represent a fraction of last year's payment, \nleaving counties struggling to find ways to fund schools, roads, and \nemergency services this year. Without certainty and stability, counties \nwill be forced to make cuts to essential services, leaving residents \nand communities reeling. County payments are a lifeline for cash-\nstrapped rural communities that are already facing shortfalls to pave \nroads, keep teachers in schools and firefighters on call. This \nbipartisan bill keeps up the commitment the government made to support \nrural counties in Oregon and across the country. I am glad to once \nagain partner with Senator Crapo to get this vital legislation across \nthe finish line.\n  Right now, this bill is not funded. It will be. Senator Crapo and I \nwill work with our colleagues to find funding for these important \nprograms that is satisfactory to the left and to the right.\n  Funding for counties is an issue that impacts almost every State in \nthe country. As Congress considers this bill, I ask my colleagues to \ntalk to county leaders in their home states, visit local communities \nstruggling to fund critical services, and find out how SRS and PILT \nimpact their budgets, their priorities, and their quality of life. \nRural communities deserve better than to have politics delay funding \nfor SRS, so I urge my colleagues to join Senator Crapo and me in our \nefforts to reauthorize this critical program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN:\n  S. 518. A bill to require States to establish highway stormwater \nmanagement programs; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I come to the floor to discuss the \nintroduction of my latest legislative proposal to better control the \nharmful and volumes of polluted stormwater that is generated from our \nNation's Federal aid highways. Highway stormwater is a growing threat \nto water quality, aquatic ecosystems and the fish and wildlife that \ndepend on the health of these ecosystems. Moreover, the high volumes \nand rapid flow of stormwater runoff from highways and roads poses a \nvery serious threat to the condition of our Nation's water and \ntransportation infrastructure as well as personal property particularly \nin urban and suburban communities.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency has recognized that pollution \nfrom point sources have been steadily declining since the enactment of \nthe Clean Water Act. Likewise, we have seen reductions in pollution \nfrom certain non-point sources like agriculture which are attributable \nin part to the success of a wide variety of USDA Natural Resource \nConservation Service Programs and farming innovations in soil \nconservation and nutrient pollution management.\n  One non-point source sector where we are unfortunately seeing an \nincreasing impact on water quality is from impervious surface that \ncreate rapidly moving high volumes of untreated polluted stormwater \nthat rush off of road surfaces, erode unnatural channels next to and \nultimately underneath roadways comprising the integrity of roadway \ninfrastructure, and increases the stress on storm sewer systems \nshortening the useful life of this infrastructure and ultimately lead \nto the discharge of untreated pollution that is carried off roadways \nand into our lakes, rivers, streams, and coastal waters.\n\n[[Page S993]]\n\n  Impervious surfaces include most buildings and structures, parking \nlots and of course the nearly 9 million lane miles of roads across our \ncountry. The total coverage of impervious surfaces in an area is \nusually expressed as a percentage of the total land area.\n  The coverage increases with rising urbanization. In rural areas, \nimpervious cover may only be 1 percent or 2 percent, however road \nsurfaces comprise 80 percent-90 percent of a rural area's total \nimpervious surfaces. In residential areas, impervious surface coverage \nranges between 10 percent in low-density subdivisions to over 50 \npercent in more densely developed communities, where the composition of \nthe impervious surface area coverage works out to be 50 percent roads. \nIn dense urban areas, the impervious surface area is often over 90 \npercent the total land area, with roads comprising 60 percent-70 \npercent of that coverage.\n  According to EPA, urban impervious cover, not just roads, in the \nlower 48 adds up to 43,000 square miles--an area roughly the size of \nOhio. Continuing development adds another quarter of a million acres \neach year. Typically two-thirds of the cover is pavement, roads and \nparking lots, and \\1/3\\ is buildings.\n  According to the Chesapeake Bay Program, impervious surfaces compose \nroughly 17 percent of all urban and suburban lands in the Chesapeake \nBay watershed. The greatest concentration of impervious surfaces in the \nbay watershed is in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Areas of DC, \nMaryland and Virginia. The Virginia Tidewater area, Philadelphia's \nwestern suburbs, and Lancaster, PA, are also regions in the watershed \nwhere impervious surfaces are greater than 10 percent of the total land \narea.\n  Rainfall on hard surfaces like roads and highways has a very \ndestructive and turbulent affect on nearby waterways and \ninfrastructure. For example, the rain events that occur over a week \nlong period at the end of April brought nearly 8 inches of rain to the \nBaltimore-Washington region. The urban runoff from roads in Baltimore \ncaused an embankment above the CSX railroad track along East 26th \nStreet, between St. Paul and Charles Street, to collapse. Fortunately \nno one was injured though homes had to be evacuated for more than a \nmonth, nearly a dozen parked cars were destroyed and moreover movement \nof freight along CSX railroad was disrupted for more than a week. This \nevent shows just how destructive and disruptive poorly managed \nstormwater from transportation infrastructure can be.\n  Some may chalk this up to a freak storm of unusually large \nproportion. It's true this storm was unusual, but so were the polar \nvortexes and all of the snow New England and Buffalo received this \nwinter, and 2013's 3-mile wide tornado in Alabama, the ongoing drought \nin California. ``Unusual'' weather seems to becoming a lot more usual. \nAs extreme weather events triggered by our changing climate become more \nfrequent it is imperative that we incorporate better designs into our \ninfrastructure to be better handle these types of events.\n  Under the Clean Water Act, stormwater is considered a non-point \nsource and there are no requirements that stormwater be collected or \ntreated. The exception being for localities where in order to meet the \nstandards set in an MS4, Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System, permit \na region may include its transportation infrastructure in its MS4 \npermit.\n  However, in most cases stormwater that falls on roadways washes oil, \ngrease, asbestos brake-dust, nitrogen deposits from tailpipe emissions, \ntrash, road salt and de-icing agents, and sediment into nearby \nwaterways. Highway stormwater runoff is most often not treated or \nadequately managed.\n  While these organic and inorganic contaminants are legitimate threats \nto water quality, the greater concern with roadway runoff is the sheer \nvolume and rapid flow rate in which stormwater leaves these hard \nsurfaces and enters our waterways. Flows and volumes that cause roads \nto collapse in Baltimore.\n  Roads are designed for stormwater to flow off of the driving surface \nquickly, for safety reasons. When stormwater rushes off of road \nsurfaces into storm drains it is usually piped straight into the \nnearest river or stream without removing contaminants, detaining any of \nthe volume, or slowing down the flow. This creates an enormously \ndestructive set of circumstances for our waterways.\n  Another example of the destructive force that persistent unmitigated \nand poorly managed highway runoff can have on the condition and safety \nof highway infrastructure is in Mobile Alabama along Highway 131 in the \nJoe's Branch Watershed. The Mobile Bay Estuary Program, part of the \nNational Estuaries Program, in coordination with Alabama Department of \nTransportation is having to spent millions of dollars to reinforce a \nhighway embankment to keep the highway from slipping down a hill and \ninto the Joe's Branch Creek, restore the hydrology of the river, and \nhelp protect private property from the dangerous erosion that's been \ncaused by poorly managed stormwater from Highway 131.\n  The Mobile Bay Estuary Program described the problem this way: ``In \nthe Joe's Branch watershed, on the property of Westminster Village \nadjacent and parallel to Highway 131, a head cut stream is eroding at \nan accelerating rate, an ominous condition as ALDOT prepares to \nundertake improvements to the highway. Identified as a high priority \nstabilization area in the D'Olive Creek, Tiawasee Creek and Joe's \nBranch Watershed Management Plan, MBNEP has submitted a funding request \nto the Alabama Department of Environmental Management on behalf of its \npartners in Spanish Fort, Daphne, ALDOT and Westminster Village to \nundertake restoration of the stream using a cutting-edge technology \ncalled Regenerative Step Pool Storm Conveyance.''\n  The four entities involved are spending large amount money to repair \na problem caused by stormwater damage that could have been prevented at \na lower cost by incorporating better stormwater mitigation facilities \ninto the design of the highway.\n  These high-volume/high-speed flows also hasten the deterioration of \nwater infrastructure. A 2001 study on the erosive power of urban \nstormwater flows examined how excessive stormwater volumes and flow \nrates off of urban surface infrastructure caused more than $1 million \nin roadway and water infrastructure damage in the Cincinnati \nmetropolitan areas in Ohio and Kentucky in a single year.\n  While there are serious water quality concerns with not adequately \ncontrolling roadway infrastructure runoff, there are serious \ninfrastructure costs, that are ultimately passed on to taxpayers and \nratepayers, that can be avoided if transportation authorities do more \nto control and manage stormwater runoff with the infrastructure assets \nthey manage and build.\n  The increased incidence of flash flooding events that occur even \nduring seemingly mild and routine storm events is a direct result of \nthe growing percentage of impervious land cover in urban and suburban \ncommunities. Replacement of the ``greenscapes'' that are lost to \npavement is essential to restoring hydrological balance to our urban \nand suburban communities and impaired watersheds.\n  According to USGS: an inch of rain on one square foot of pavement \nproduces 1.87 gallons of stormwater, Scaled up, 1 inch of rain on one \nacre would produce 27,150 gallons of stormwater. Using FHWA design \nstandards for interstate highway lane and shoulder widths, 12 feet per \nlane, 10 foot right shoulder, 2x, 4 foot left shoulder, 2x, 10 miles of \na four lane interstate highway generates nearly 2.5 million gallons of \npolluted stormwater for every inch of rain. To put that into \nperspective for the Potomac and Anacostia River Watersheds: The Capital \nBeltway, not including its 48 interchanges, generates nearly 30 \nmillion, 29,920,946, gallons of polluted stormwater for every inch of \nrain that falls on the 64 mile 8 to 12 lane interstate highway loop. It \nis volumes of stormwater like that which cause dangerous streambank \nerosion.\n  Gillies Creek is an urban waterway located East of Downtown Richmond. \nIt is a tributary of the James River which flows into the Chesapeake \nBay. Gillies Creek is surrounded by industrial and residential \ndevelopment and also receives stormwater from State highway 33, \nInterstate 64, US 60, and hundreds of city streets including Stony Run \nParkway which directly adjacent to the creek for several miles.\n\n[[Page S994]]\n\nThe banks and bed of this creek have eroded so badly as urban \ndevelopment around the creek has added more impervious surfaces to the \nwatershed that streambed sheering has created cliffs more than 10 feet \ntall at spots along the creek. Trees supporting the bank continually \nfall into the creek and nearby roadways and other infrastructure as \nwell as homes and business are at risk. Reducing the impacts of the \nstorms by mitigating the flow and volume of stormwater in this \nwatershed will protect against further erosion and save the cost of \nrepair and eventual replacement of the assets located along this \nendangered creek.\n  The aim of this legislation is to improve highway designs to better \nmanage stormwater to avoid the costly damage that poorly managed \nstormwater causes to infrastructure and nearby streams, rivers and \ncoastal waters.\n  I held a hearing on this issue in the Water and Wildlife Subcommittee \non May 13, 2014. I heard many ideas from both the minority and majority \nwitnesses that were invited to present testimony at this hearing. I \nlistened to the concerns of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle and I have incorporated provisions into this bill that should \nalleviate concerns they may have had with previous attempts to better \ncontrol highway stormwater.\n  My bill's approach to highway runoff management is one that I hope my \ncolleagues of both parties can support. First of all it put States in \nthe driver's seat for developing hydrological analysis and \nimplementation of best management practices to control highway runoff. \nThe objective of the legislation is to control and manage flow and \nvolume of stormwater from highways not to treat runoff in order to meet \nwater quality standards. By taking this sort of approach we avoid EPA's \ninvolvement in the process. Lastly, States would only need to apply \nthese procedures to new construction on major reconfiguration projects \nthat significantly increases the amount of impervious surface in the \nproject area.\n  Title 23 of the U.S. Code states: ``transportation should play a \nsignificant role in promoting economic growth, improving the \nenvironment, and sustaining the quality of life'' through the use of \n``context sensitive solutions.'' In 2008, the Government Accountability \nOffice issued a report examining key issues and challenges that needed \nto be addressed in the next reauthorization of the transportation bill. \nThat report highlighted the clear link between transportation policy \nand the environment. With 985,139 miles of federal aid highways \nstretching from every corner of the US, polluted highway runoff is no \nsmall problem facing our Nation's waters. I would urge my colleagues to \njoin me trying to address this problem facing America's waterways and \ninfrastructure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 518\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Chesapeake Bay Initiative Act of 1998 to \npermanently reauthorize the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails \nNetwork; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, authorized under P.L. 105-312 in 1998 and \nreauthorized by P.L. 107-308 in 2002, the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and \nWatertrails Network helps several million visitors and residents \ndiscover, enjoy, and learn about the special places and stories of the \nChesapeake Bay and its watershed. Today, I am introducing legislation \nto permanently authorize this successful 17-year-old program.\n  For visitors and residents, the Gateways are the ``Chesapeake \nconnection.'' The network members provide an experience of such high \nquality that visitors indeed connect to the Chesapeake emotionally as \nwell as intellectually, and thus to the Bay's conservation. Through \nmore than 160 of these sites, the Gateways Network partner sites and \nwater trails enable visitors to experience the authentic Chesapeake.\n  The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure. The Chesapeake ranks as \nthe largest of America's 130 estuaries and one of the Nation's largest \nand longest fresh water and estuarine systems. The Atlantic Ocean \ndelivers half the bay's 18 trillion gallons of water and the other half \nflows through over 150 major rivers and streams draining 64,000 square \nmiles within 6 states and the District of Columbia. The Chesapeake \nwatershed is among the most significant cultural, natural and \nhistorical assets of our Nation.\n  The Chesapeake is enormously vast and diverse--to the extent that it \nis impossible to experience all the culture, history and natural beauty \nin any one place. That is why the gateways program is designed to \nconnect and use the scores of existing public resources to collaborate \non presenting the many chapters and tales of the bay's story. Visitors \nand residents go to more places for more experiences, all through a \ncoordinated Gateways Network.\n  Beyond simply coordinating the network, publishing a map and guides, \nand providing standard exhibits at all Gateways, the National Park \nService has helped gateways with matching grants and expertise for \nseveral hundred high-quality projects, developing sites to provide \nfishing, boating, and viewing access to the bay and its major \ntributaries. This is a great deal for the bay--it helps network members \ntell the Chesapeake story better and inspires people to care for this \nNational Treasure, in addition to supporting local, State, and national \nwater trails--and it's a good deal for the Park Service. It serves all \n170+ gateways and their 10 million visitors. No other National Park can \nprovide such a dramatic ratio of public dollars spent to number of \nvisitors served.\n  With the National Park Service's expertise and support, gateways have \nmade significant progress in their mission to tell the Bay's stories to \ntheir millions of members and visitors, extend access to the Bay and \nits watershed, and develop a conservation awareness and ethic. It is \ntime to not only reauthorize the Chesapeake Gateways and Watertrails \nprogram, but make the annual $3 million reauthorization for this \nprogram permanent. It is my hope that the Congress will act quickly to \nadopt this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 519\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Chesapeake Bay Gateways and \n     Watertrails Network Reauthorization Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PERMANENT REAUTHORIZATION.\n\n       Section 502(c) of the Chesapeake Bay Initiative Act of 1998 \n     (16 U.S.C. 461 note; Public Law 105-312) is amended by \n     striking ``for'' and all that follows through the period at \n     the end and inserting ``for each fiscal year.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN:\n  S. 520. A bill to amend the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation \nAct to reauthorize the Act; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Neotropical \nMigratory Bird Conservation Act. More than half of the bird species \nfound in the U.S. migrate across our borders and many of these spend \nour winter in Central and South America. This bill promotes \ninternational cooperation for long-term conservation, education, \nresearch, monitoring, and habitat protection for more than 350 species \nof neotropical migratory birds. Through its successful competitive, \nmatching grant program, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service supports \npublic-private partnerships in countries mostly in Latin America and \nthe Caribbean. Up to \\1/4\\ of the funds may be awarded for domestic \nprojects.\n  This legislation aims to sustain healthy populations of migratory \nbirds that are not only beautiful to look at but help our farmers by \nconsuming billions of harmful insect and rodent pests each year, \nproviding pollination services, and dispersing seeds. Migratory birds \nface threats from pesticide pollution, deforestation, sprawl, and \ninvasive species that degrade their habitats in addition to the natural \nrisks of their extended flights. Birds are excellent indicators of the \nhealth of an ecosystem. As such, it is troubling that, according to the \nNational Audubon Society, half of all coastally migrating shorebirds, \nlike the Common Tern and Piping Plover, are experiencing dramatic \npopulation declines.\n  The Baltimore Oriole, the State bird of Maryland and one whose song \nbrightens all of the Northeastern U.S., has steadily declined in \npopulation despite being protected by federal law under the Migratory \nBird Treaty Act of 1918 and the State of Maryland's Nongame and \nEndangered Species Conservation Act. Likewise, the iconic Red Knot \nbird, whose legendary 9,000 mile migration centers on a stopover in the \nMid-Atlantic states, is decreasing in population quickly. Threats to \nthese beloved Maryland birds are mainly due to habitat destruction and \ndeforestation, particularly in the Central and South American countries \nwhere the birds winter. In addition, international use of toxic \npesticides ingested by insects, which are then eaten by the birds, has \nsignificantly contributed to this decline. Conservation efforts in our \ncountry are essential, but investment in programs throughout the \nmigratory route of these and countless other migratory birds is \ncritical. This legislation accomplishes this goal.\n  The Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act has a proven track \nrecord of reversing habitat loss and advancing conservation strategies \nfor the broad range of neotropical birds that populate the United \nStates and the rest of the Western hemisphere. Since 2002, more than \n$50.1 million in grants have been awarded, supporting 451 projects in \n36 countries. Partners have contributed an additional $190.6 million, \nand more than 3.7 million acres of habitat have been affected.\n  This legislation is cost-effective, budget-friendly, and has been a \nhighly successful Federal program. This simple reauthorization bill \nwill make sure that this good work continues.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 520\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REAUTHORIZATION OF NEOTROPICAL MIGRATORY BIRD \n                   CONSERVATION ACT.\n\n       Section 10 of the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation \n     Act (16 U.S.C. 6109) is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 10. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--There is authorized to be appropriated \n     to carry out this Act $6,500,000 for each of fiscal years \n     2015 through 2020.\n       ``(b) Use of Funds.--Of the amounts made available under \n     subsection (a) for each fiscal year, not less than 75 percent \n     shall be expended for projects carried out at a location \n     outside of the United States.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 521. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \na special resource study of President Station in Baltimore, Maryland, \nand for\n\n[[Page S996]]\n\nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today marks an important day in history as \nour Nation continues to honor the sesquicentennial of the Civil War. \nThere are many landmarks in my hometown of Baltimore that are \nsignificant to Civil War history, which I believe are in the Nation's \ninterests to protect for future generations. As our Nation pays tribute \nto this trying time in our Nation's history, I am proud to reintroduce \nthe President Street Station Study Act, which would initiate the \nprocess for preserving one such landmark in the heart of Baltimore. \nPresident Street Station played a crucial role in the Civil War, the \nUnderground Railroad, the growth of Baltimore's railroad industry, and \nis a historically significant landmark to the presidency of Abraham \nLincoln.\n  The station was constructed for the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and \nBaltimore, PW, Railroad in 1849 and remains the oldest surviving big \ncity railroad terminal in the United States. This historical structure \nis a unique architectural gem, arguably the first example and last \nsurvivor of the early barrel-vault train shed arches, also known as the \nHowe Truss. The arch-rib design became the blueprint for railroad \nbridges and roofs well into the 20th century and was replicated for \nevery similarly designed train shed and roof for the next 20 years.\n  The growth of President Street Station and the PW railroad mirror \nthe expansion of the railroad industry throughout the country in the \nlatter half of the 19th century. This station played an essential role \nin making Baltimore the first railroad and sea-rail link in the nation \nand helped the city become the international port hub it is today.\n  In its heyday, President Street Station was the key link connecting \nWashington, D.C. with the northeast States. Hundreds of passengers \ntraveling north passed through this station and, by the start of the \nCivil War, Baltimore had become our Nation's major southern railroad \nhub. Not surprisingly, the station played a critical role in both the \nCivil War and the Underground Railroad.\n  Perhaps the most famous passenger to travel through the station was \nPresident Abraham Lincoln. He came through the station at least four \ntimes, including secretly on his way to his first inauguration in 1861. \nPresident-elect Lincoln was warned by a PW private detective of a \npossible assassination plot in Baltimore as he transferred trains. \nWhile it is unclear if this plot existed and posed a serious threat, \nLincoln nevertheless was secretly smuggled aboard a train in the dead \nof night to complete his trip to Washington.\n  Just a few months later, President Street Station served as a \nbackdrop for what many historians consider to be the first bloodshed of \nthe Civil War. The Baltimore Riot of 1861 occurred when Lincoln called \nfor Union volunteers to quell the rebellion at Fort Sumter in \nCharleston. On this day in history, April 19, 1861, Massachusetts and \nPennsylvania volunteers were met and attacked by a mob of secessionist \nand Confederate sympathizers. The bloody confrontation left four dead \nand 36 wounded. As the war continued, the Station remained a critical \nlink for the Union. Troops and supplies from the north were regularly \nshuttled through the station to support Union soldiers.\n  It is well known that Maryland was a common starting point along the \nUnderground Railroad and that many escaped slaves from Maryland's \nEastern Shore plantations were destined for Baltimore and the President \nStreet Station to travel north to freedom. Last year, Congress acted to \nhonor Maryland's own Harriet Tubman, the Underground Railroad's most \nfamous ``conductor'' by enacting the Harriet Tubman National Historical \nParks Act, establishing the first set of National Historical Parks to \ncommemorate the life of an African American woman. While Harriet Tubman \npersonally led dozens of people to freedom, her courage and fortitude \nalso inspired others to find their own strength to seek freedom. \nPresident Street Station was indeed a station on this secret network. \nPrior to emancipation in 1863, several renowned escapees, including \nFrederick Douglass, William and Ellen Craft, and Henry ``Box'' Brown, \ntraveled through the Station, risking their lives for a better and \nfreer life.\n  Others' journeys for a better life also passed through President \nStreet Station. From its beginning and into the 20th century, Baltimore \nwas both a destination and departure point for immigrants. New arrivals \nfrom Ireland, Russia, and Europe arriving on the eastern seaboard \ntraveled by way of the PW railroads to the west.\n  For decades, President Street Station has long been recognized as \nhaving an important place in history: In 1992, it was listed on the \nNational Register of Historic places and the city of Baltimore has \ndedicated it a local historical landmark. For many years it served as \nthe Baltimore Civil War Museum, educating generations of people about \nthe role Maryland and Baltimore played in the Civil War and the early \nhistory of the city. In recent years, the museum, run by dedicated \nvolunteers from the Maryland Historical Society and Friends of \nPresident Street Station, have struggled to keep the station's doors \nopen and keeping the station's character true to its historical roots. \nThe area around President Street Station has changed dramatically over \nthe decades, but the Station has worked to preserve its place in place \nin history. It has been many years since trains passed through the \nPresident Street Station and it is clear that today the best use for \nthis building is to preserve the building and use it to tell station's \nAmerican story.\n  President Street Station is an American historical treasure. This \nbill authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special \nresource study of President Street Station to evaluate the suitability \nand feasibility of establishing the Station as a unit of the National \nPark Service. President Street Station, a contributor to the growth of \nthe railroad, and a vital player in the Underground Railroad, Lincoln \nPresidency and Civil War, is part of this history. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in giving this station the recognition it deserves and \nsupport this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 521\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XXI of the Social Security Act to \nextend the Children's Health Insurance Program, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, we have made great strides in recent years \nensuring that Americans of all ages have access to quality health care. \nPart of this success comes from the Children's Health Insurance Program \ncreated in 1997 as a joint State-Federal health insurance program for \nlow- to moderate-income children and pregnant women.\n  Because of CHIP, 10 million children, including 130,000 children in \nmy State--most of whom are sons and daughters of working parents who \nare in low-income jobs and not making enough money to afford insurance \nand for employers that typically don't offer insurance--have access to \nhealth care today--health care they may not have received otherwise.\n  We know CHIP works not just in the number of children insured under \nthe program but because of the flexibility CHIP provides States and the \nquality of care children receive. It works. It works for children, it \nworks for parents, and it works for communities.\n  That is the good news. The bad news is, even though the law is on the \nbooks until 2019, the funding for CHIP will expire in September. That \nis why I am proud to introduce legislation today with my colleagues \nSenators Stabenow, Wyden, Casey, and Leader Reid to protect the CHIP \nprogram and to extend its funding to match the authorization until \n2019.\n  The Protecting and Retaining our Children's Health Insurance \nProgram--PRO-CHIP--Act is straightforward, it is common sense, and will \nprovide much needed budget predictability for our States.\n  The Republican Governor of my State supports CHIP. He understands \nthey need it in Ohio and across the country sooner rather than later so \nthey can properly budget and plan and avoid gaps in health care for \nvulnerable children.\n  Again, these 130,000 children in my State alone are overwhelmingly \nsons and daughters of working parents who don't make enough money to \npay for health insurance out of pocket, and who are working at \ncompanies and businesses that don't provide health insurance.\n  I am honored that 30 of our Senate colleagues have already joined as \ncosponsors. Providing health insurance to low-income children isn't \njust the right thing to do, it is the smart thing to do. Children stay \nhealthier, families function better, neighborhoods are better off, and \nchildren do better in school as a result, with fewer sick days. They \nfeel better when they are at school because they have a family doctor, \nbecause they have health insurance.\n  We know it works. Listen to these numbers: Thanks to CHIP, the number \nof uninsured children has fallen by half, from 14 percent in 1997--when \nthis bill passed with bipartisan support, and it has been extended and \nreauthorized a couple of times since--to a record low of 7 percent in \n2012.\n  In nearly every State of the Union, Governors planning their State \nbudgets and parents planning their family budgets are relying on us to \nextend CHIP now. We should not go right up to the deadline, as some are \nnow talking about in terms of shutting the government down. We should \nnot go up to the deadline but do it now. It would provide a sigh of \nrelief for parents, not only for financial reasons but because CHIP \nmeans better access to comprehensive care for their kids.\n  Think about the anxiety parents face knowing they have insurance \ntoday under CHIP but not being certain they will have it this time next \nyear. We should act together to protect this vital program that \nprovides comprehensive health care coverage for 10 million children. \nStates will start to roll back their CHIP program and funding for the \nprogram will expire at the end of September if we don't act soon.\n  This has always been bipartisan. It should continue to be. I look \nforward to working with all my colleagues to prioritize children's \nhealth and help pass this PRO-CHIP legislation as soon as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Kirk):\n  S. 529. A bill to improve the services available to runaway and \nhomeless youth who are victims of trafficking, to improve the response \nto victims of child sex trafficking, to direct the Interagency Task \nForce to Monitor and Combat Trafficking to identify strategies to \nprevent children from becoming victims of trafficking and review \ntrafficking prevention efforts, to protect and assist in the recovery \nof victims of trafficking, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a measure that \nwould help us make progress in the fight against domestic human \ntrafficking, a terrible crime. This legislation, titled the Combating \nHuman Trafficking Act of 2015, has three objectives. First, it would \nencourage federal agencies to devote existing grant resources to \ninitiatives that are designed to protect runaway and homeless youth \nfrom human traffickers. Second, it would update the authorizing \nlanguage for the cyber tipline of the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children to ensure that the statute specifically references \n``child sex trafficking.'' Third, and finally, this legislation would \nhelp ensure that trafficking victims' housing needs are met and equip \nCongress with more information on the best practices to combat human \ntrafficking.\n  The first title of this measure is based on legislation introduced by \nU.S. Congressman Joseph Heck of Nevada in January. It is titled the \nEnhancing Services for Runaway and Homeless Victims of Youth \nTrafficking Act of 2015. Similar language passed the House on January \n26 by a unanimous voice vote. This part of the bill would improve the \nsupport provided specifically to runaway and homeless youth who are \ntrafficking victims. This title also would enable the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to devote existing grant resources to \ntraining grantees' personnel on the effects of human trafficking on \nrunaway and homeless youth. Finally, this title would allow the HHS \nSecretary to provide street-based services to such victims.\n  The second title of the bill, based on a measure introduced by U.S. \nCongresswoman Joyce Beatty of Ohio, would amend the Missing Children's \nAssistance Act to ensure that the phrase ``child sex trafficking'' is \nincorporated into the statutory language that authorizes the cyber \ntipline of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. \nNearly identical language already passed the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives earlier this year.\n  The final title of this legislation is known as the Human Trafficking \nPrevention, Intervention and Recovery Act of 2015, after a bill \nintroduced by U.S. Congresswoman Kristi Noem of South Dakota. It would \ncharge the Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking \nwith several duties, such as identifying best practices and strategies \nto combat human trafficking and cataloging the anti-trafficking \nactivities of various State and Federal agencies. This task force, \nwhich was created under the 2000 Trafficking Victims Protection Act, \nmust provide a report within one year of its review and findings, under \nthe legislation.\n  The third title of this legislation also calls for the Government \nAccountability Office to report to Congress on governmental and law \nenforcement efforts to combat domestic human trafficking. This title \nalso recognizes that minors who are trafficking victims in the United \nStates are in desperate need of housing. It would ensure that certain \ngrants, which are available from the U.S. Department of Justice under \nthe Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, can be used for \ninitiatives to assist trafficking victims with their\n\n[[Page S998]]\n\nhousing needs. Shelters and facilities that are seeking to expand or \ndevelop services to trafficking survivors would be eligible to apply \nfor these grant funds, under this title of the legislation. Nearly \nidentical language passed the House last month.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this vitally important legislation. I \nalso want to extend my appreciation to my colleague from Illinois, Mr. \nKirk, who has agreed to join me as an original cosponsor of this \nmeasure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/12/senate-section/article/S998-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S998-S1003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 73--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY COMMITTEES OF THE \n   SENATE FOR THE PERIODS MARCH 1, 2015 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2015, \nOCTOBER 1, 2015 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2016, AND OCTOBER 1, 2016 THROUGH \n                           FEBRUARY 28, 2017\n\n  Mr. BLUNT submitted the following resolution; from the Committee on \nRules and Administration; which was placed on the calendar:\n\n                               S.

Res. 74\n\n       Whereas the number of individuals in the United States with \n     Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (referred to in \n     this preamble as ``Alzheimer's'') is as high as 5,200,000, \n     which is more than double the number in 1980;\n       Whereas based on the trajectory of Alzheimer's, as many as \n     16,000,000 individuals in the United States may have \n     Alzheimer's by 2050;\n       Whereas the increasing prevalence of Alzheimer's and other \n     dementias is a global health crisis that afflicts an \n     estimated 44,000,000 individuals worldwide as of December, \n     2013 and may afflict over 135,000,000 individuals by 2050;\n       Whereas Alzheimer's is a leading cause of death in the \n     United States with new data indicating that more than 500,000 \n     deaths each year are attributable to the disease;\n       Whereas Alzheimer's is the only disease among the top 10 \n     causes of death in the United States without an effective \n     means of prevention, treatment, or cure;\n       Whereas Alzheimer's places an enormous financial strain on \n     families, the health care system, and State and Federal \n     budgets;\n       Whereas the Medicare program under title XVIII of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) and the Medicaid \n     program under title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1396 et seq.) are estimated to bear more than two-thirds of \n     the total costs of this care in 2015;\n       Whereas a RAND Corporation study published in 2013 and \n     commissioned by the National Institute on Aging found that \n     Alzheimer's is the costliest disease in the United States, \n     costing more than cancer and heart disease;\n       Whereas in 2013, an estimated 15,500,000 family members and \n     friends of individuals with Alzheimer's provided those \n     individuals with 17,700,000,000 hours of unpaid care, an \n     amount valued at more than $220,000,000;\n       Whereas Alzheimer's disease has a disproportionate impact \n     on many populations including women, African Americans, and \n     Latinos;\n       Whereas the global cost of Alzheimer's exceeds \n     $600,000,000,000 each year, an amount equal to approximately \n     1 percent of the world's gross domestic product;\n       Whereas in December 2013, the G-8 nations met and adopted a \n     political declaration supporting the goal of a cure or \n     disease-modifying therapy for dementia by 2025 as well as \n     collectively and significantly increasing resources committed \n     to dementia research;\n       Whereas Alzheimer's takes an emotional and physical toll on \n     caregivers that results in a higher incidence of chronic \n     conditions, such as heart disease, cancer, and depression \n     among caregivers;\n       Whereas the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease of \n     the Department of Health and Human Services enables family \n     caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's to provide care \n     while maintaining personal health and well-being;\n       Whereas the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease \n     supports informal caregivers by--\n       (1) identifying the support needs of caregivers;\n       (2) developing and disseminating modes for intervention;\n       (3) providing information that caregivers need, \n     particularly in crisis situations;

Mr. President, Alzheimer's is a terrible disease that \ntakes a tremendous personal and economic toll on the individual, the \nfamily, and society. In addition to the human suffering it causes, \nAlzheimer's costs the United States an estimated $226 billion a year, \nincluding $153 billion from the Medicare and Medicaid Programs. These \ncosts will only skyrocket as the baby boom generation ages. Already our \nNation's costliest disease, Alzheimer's is projected to cost more than \n$1.1 trillion if nothing is done to change its current trajectory. It \nis now estimated that nearly one in two of the baby boomers reaching \nage 85 will develop Alzheimer's. As a consequence, chances are that \nmembers of the baby boom generation will either be spending their \ngolden years suffering with Alzheimer's or caring for someone who has \nit. In many ways Alzheimer's has become the defining disease of this \ngeneration.\n  If we are to prevent Alzheimer's from becoming the defining disease \nof the next generation, it is imperative that we dramatically increase \nour investment in Alzheimer's research. At a time when the United \nStates is spending some $226 billion a year caring for Alzheimer's \npatients, we are spending less than three-tenths of 1 percent of that \namount--under $600 million a year--on research. This makes no sense. We \ncurrently spend $4.5 billion a year for cancer research, $3 billion a \nyear for research on HIV-AIDS, and $2 billion for cardiovascular \nresearch--all investments that have paid dividends.\n  Surely we can do more for Alzheimer's given the tremendous human and \neconomic price of this devastating disease. Investments in research for \nother diseases have yielded tremendous results. We see that with \ncancer, with HIV/AIDS. Patients have access to new treatments, and \ndeath rates for some of these diseases are decreasing. At the same \ntime, mortality due to Alzheimer's is escalating.\n  Alzheimer's is one of our Nation's leading causes of death, with \nrecent data revealing that each year more than 500,000 deaths are \nattributable to Alzheimer's and other dementia, 6 times the amount \npreviously estimated. Moreover, Alzheimer's is the only one of our \nNation's top 10 deadliest diseases without an effective means of \nprevention, treatment or a cure.\n  Fortunately there is promising research that holds hope for \nAlzheimer's patients and their families. The research community is \npoised to make important advances through clinical trials and by \ninvestigating new therapeutic targets, but adequate funding is critical \nto achieve this promise. The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's \nDisease was authorized by the bipartisan National Alzheimer's Act, \nwhich I coauthored with then-Senator Evan Bayh.\n  The national plan has as its primary goal to prevent and effectively \ntreat Alzheimer's disease by the year 2025. The chairman of the \nadvisory council that was created by the act, Dr. Ronald Petersen of \nthe Mayo Clinic, has testified before Congress that the United States \nshould be devoting $2 billion a year at a minimum to Alzheimer's \nresearch in order to reach that goal.\n  A dramatic increase in funding for Alzheimer's research will not just \nsave lives, it will also save money. According to a report issued by \nthe Alzheimer's Association last year, a Federal investment of $2 \nbillion a year between now and the year 2025, as recommended by the \nexperts on the Alzheimer's Advisory Council and the scientific \ncommunity more broadly, would be recouped within the first 3 years \nafter a treatment delaying the onset of Alzheimer's by just 5 years \nbecomes available.\n  I am therefore pleased to be introducing today, with my colleagues \nSenators Klobuchar, Mikulski, Warner, Durbin, and Stabenow, a \nresolution declaring that the goal of preventing and effectively \ntreating Alzheimer's is an urgent national priority. In recognition of \nthe fact that bold action and considerable increases in funding are \nnecessary to meet that goal, our resolution states that the Senate will \nstrive to double the amount of funding the United States spends on \nAlzheimer's research in fiscal year 2016 and that we will develop a \nplan to meet the target of $2 billion over the next 5 years.\n  Our bill is supported by a number of organizations including the \nAlzheimer's Association, UsAgainstAlzheimer's, the Leaders Engaged on \nAlzheimer's Disease--or the LEAD Coalition--and the Alzheimer's \nFoundation of America.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters from these organizations be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             LEAD--Leaders Engaged\n\n\n                                       on Alzheimer's Disease,\n\n                                                February 11, 2015.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     Chairman, Special Committee on Aging, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Collins: As executive director of Leaders \n     Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (the LEAD Coalition), I write \n     to thank you for your inspirational leadership in \n     reintroducing the Senate resolution to strengthen care and \n     support, encourage greater international collaboration, \n     incentivize private sector research, double federal \n     investments in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias \n     research in FY 2016, and bring annual federal investments to \n     at least $2 billion by 2020. Your resolution is an important \n     next step toward each of these vital goals and the LEAD \n     Coalition will continue to work arm-in-arm with you and your \n     colleagues to realize the resolution's promise.\n       There are few more compelling or complex issues to confront \n     our aging society now and over the coming decades than \n     Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (including \n     vascular, Lewy body or frontotemporal dementia). Its place as \n     a national priority was made clear by the effort you led \n     resulting in unanimous congressional passage of the National \n     Alzheimer's Project Act. That law directed creation of the \n     National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease and, as you \n     know, the National Plan's goal number one is to prevent and \n     effectively treat Alzheimer's disease and related dementias \n     by 2025.\n       In fact, as your resolution highlights, Alzheimer's disease \n     and related dementias are an urgent national priority that \n     impose enormous costs to our nation's health and prosperity, \n     costs that are skyrocketing. Today, more than five million \n     Americans have dementia at an annual cost to our economy \n     exceeding $200 billion. Alzheimer's disease contributes to \n     the deaths of approximately 500,000 Americans each year, \n     making it the third leading cause of death in the United \n     States. If the current trajectory of the disease persists, \n     between 13 million and 16 million Americans will have \n     dementia in 2050 and total costs of care are projected to \n     exceed (inflation adjusted 2014 dollars) $1 trillion \n     annually. The federal government, through Medicare and \n     Medicaid payments, shoulders an estimated 70 percent of all \n     such direct care costs.\n       Globally, the stakes of American scientific leadership are \n     higher still. Today, 44 million people have dementia with \n     annual costs exceeding $600 billion or about one percent of \n     the world's GDP. If the current trajectory of the disease \n     persists, upwards of 135 million persons worldwide will have \n     dementia in 2050. American scientific leadership is nowhere \n     more urgent than in Alzheimer's disease and related \n     dementias.\n       Congress, the President and NIH Director Dr. Francis \n     Collins have overcome enormous obstacles to increase funding \n     and prioritization of Alzheimer's disease and related \n     dementias research over the past several years. The National \n     Institute an Aging (NIA) and other NIH institutes--such as \n     the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, \n     the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and \n     Bioengineering, the National Institute of Mental Health and \n     the National Institute of Child Health and Human \n     Development--are supporting a number of promising research \n     projects to: understand the genetic risk factors, address the \n     disproportionate impact on women, African Americans, \n     Hispanics, and persons with intellectual disabilities; and \n     pursue cutting-edge but costly and time consuming trials \n     aimed at preventing or substantially slowing disease \n     progression by administering treatments much earlier in the \n     disease process. These resources of time, talent and treasure \n     are precious and indefensibly scarce. We owe it to the \n     taxpayers, to the research community and--most of all--to \n     people living with, or at risk of, Alzheimer's disease and \n     related dementias to provide adequate and necessary resources \n     proportionate to the disease burden, unmet medical need, and \n     our nation's ethical and moral compass.\n       The broad, diverse, and unified Alzheimer's disease and \n     related dementias community--working together as the LEAD \n     Coalition--deeply admires and appreciates your remarkable \n     leadership on this and so many other issues of vital \n     importance to our nation's cognitive health, economic well-\n     being, and global scientific leadership. We look forward to \n     working with you for passage of the resolution and subsequent \n     congressional action on each of its goals.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Ian Kremer, Esq.,\n\n                                               Executive Director,\n                                                   LEAD Coalition.\n\n[[Page S1005]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                          USAgainstAlzheimers,\n\n                                                February 10, 2015.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     Chairman, Special Committee on Aging, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Collins: On behalf of USAgainstAlzheimers, \n     the national movement committed to mobilizing the nation \n     around the goal of stopping Alzheimer's by 2020, I am writing \n     to applaud you for recognizing the mounting threat of \n     Alzheimer's and dementia and for leading the call for the \n     level of public resources that are necessary to stop this \n     disease before it destroys our nation's health and finances.\n       As you are well aware from your extensive history of \n     leadership against Alzheimer's and dementia, more than five \n     million Americans are currently suffering from this disease, \n     and millions more are impacted as family members and \n     caregivers. Economic estimates suggest that Alzheimer's \n     disease costs the nation upwards of $200 billion each year, \n     with about 70 percent of costs shouldered by Medicare and \n     Medicaid. Direct care costs of Alzheimer's have been found to \n     be larger than similar costs of cancer and heart disease, and \n     a groundbreaking 2014 study from Rush University indicates \n     that more than 500,000 deaths each year are attributable to \n     Alzheimer's disease, six times more than the levels that have \n     been reported by the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention (CDC).\n       Fortunately, thanks to your leadership several years ago, \n     our nation has a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease \n     that established as goal one preventing and effectively \n     treating the disease by 2025, a mere 10 years away. As your \n     resolution recognizes, while we can set bold goals, we simply \n     will not achieve them absent the appropriation of necessary \n     resources. I commend you for being a champion in Congress \n     behind measures to substantially increase the amount of \n     public resources committed to Alzheimer's disease research so \n     we can reach the level of $2 billion in annual funding that \n     multiple experts have estimated as being needed to maximize \n     our chances of achieving the 2025 goal.\n       I understand the multiple fiscal challenges confronting the \n     nation. At the same time, we must recognize that the question \n     is not whether or not we will pay for Alzheimer's. We are \n     paying, dearly, today, and we will pay even more tomorrow \n     unless we redouble efforts to achieve scientific \n     breakthroughs and develop therapies and means of prevention. \n     Your resolution outlines a sensible track to achieve the \n     necessary level of funding within a timeframe during which we \n     can achieve the necessary impact, and makes clear that \n     preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease must be a \n     national priority.\n       Thank you, again, for your tremendous leadership on behalf \n     of all Americans impacted by this disease.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                George Vradenburg,\n     Founder and Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      Alzheimer's Association,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 11, 2015.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Amy Klobuchar,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins and Senator Klobuchar: On behalf of \n     the Alzheimer's Association and its nationwide network of \n     advocates, thank you for your continued leadership on issues \n     and legislation important to Americans with Alzheimer's and \n     their caregivers. The Alzheimer's Association proudly \n     supports your most recent Alzheimer's resolution, which \n     supports the goals of National Plan to Address Alzheimer's \n     Disease.\n       The Alzheimers Association is the world's leading voluntary \n     health organization in Alzheimers care, support and research. \n     Our mission is to eliminate Alzheimer's disease and other \n     dementias through the advancement of research; to provide and \n     enhance care and support for all affected; and to reduce the \n     risk of dementia through the promotion of brain health. Our \n     vision is a world without Alzheimer's.\n       As one of our nation's strongest voices on behalf of \n     Americans living with Alzheimer's, you know that more than 5 \n     million Americans are living with the disease, and without \n     significant action, as many as 16 million Americans will have \n     Alzheimer's by 2050. A 2013 study funded by the National \n     Institutes of Health (NIH) and published in the New England \n     Journal of Medicine further confirmed that Alzheimers disease \n     is the most expensive disease in America. Additionally, as \n     the baby boomer generation ages, one in eight will develop \n     Alzheimer's. This explosive growth will cause Alzheimers \n     costs to Medicare and Medicaid to increase from $153 billion \n     today to nearly $800 billion in 2050 (in today's dollars) and \n     threatens to bankrupt families, businesses and our health \n     care system. Unfortunately, our work is only growing more \n     urgent.\n       The passage of the National Alzheimer's Project Act in \n     2010, and the subsequent release of the National Plan to \n     Address Alzheimer's Disease, marks a new era for Alzheimers \n     disease and other dementias. Achieving the first goal of the \n     National Plan, to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's \n     disease by 2025, and supporting individuals with the disease \n     and their caregivers are critical to the success of this \n     legislation.\n       The Alzheimers Association deeply appreciates your \n     continued leadership on behalf of all American's living with \n     Alzheimer's. If you have any questions about this or any \n     other legislation, please contact Rachel Conant, Director of \n     Federal Affairs, at rconant@alz.org or at 202.638.7121.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Robert Egge,\n\n                                         Executive Vice President,\n                      Government Affairs, Alzheimer's Association.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, we have to face the facts that if we do \nnot invest in Alzheimer's research at the levels the experts tell us is \nnecessary to develop effective treatments for this disease or perhaps a \nmeans of prevention or eventually a cure, this disease is going to \ncontinue to cause untold suffering not only for its victims but for its \nfamilies, and it will bankrupt America 's health care system.\n  I urge our colleagues to join us as cosponsors. I want, in \nparticular, to recognize my partner in this effort, the Senator from \nMinnesota, Ms. Klobuchar. The home of the Mayo Clinic is in her State. \nShe has been stalwart in supporting the efforts to increase funding for \nAlzheimer's research.\n  With that, I am very pleased to yield to my partner, Senator \nKlobuchar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor to join my \nfriend and colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, who has for so long \nbeen a leader on this issue. I thank her for that and thank her for her \nvery strong remarks.\n  This is a horrible disease. Senator Collins did a very good job of \ngoing through the costs to our country. Mr. President, 5.2 million \nAmericans are already living with Alzheimer's, and by 2050 an estimated \n13.5 million Americans will be living with the disease. Also, $226 \nbillion is being spent in 2015 caring for individuals with Alzheimer's, \nand by 2050 costs will reach $1.1 trillion.\n  Those are the numbers. They are pretty stunning numbers, but I think \nwe all know we are not just here to talk about the numbers. We are here \nto talk about the people. Every single Senator in this Chamber knows \nsomeone who is suffering from Alzheimer's or someone who has died from \nAlzheimer's. So this resolution, yes, it is about the numbers and being \nsmarter about how we spend our money to prevent this horrible disease \nfrom occurring in the first place, but it is also for that daughter who \ngoes to see her mom every day in the assisted living care facility and \nwith each and every day her mom's memory slips away to the point where \nshe does not remember who she is anymore.\n  It is for that wife who has valiantly cared for her husband as it \ngets harder and harder and harder as he goes wandering around the \nneighborhood and gets lost. She does not know if she can leave him at \nhome anymore. That is what this is about. Every single person in this \nChamber and every single person back home knows of someone who suffers \nfrom this disease.\n  The only way to stem the tide of this devastating disease is through, \nas the great Senator from Maine mentioned, through research. Yes, a lot \nof that research is going on in Minnesota, both at the University of \nMinnesota and at the Mayo Clinic. If we were able to delay the onset of \nAlzheimer's by just 5 years, similar to the effect that anticholesterol \ndrugs have had on preventing heart disease, we would be able to \nsignificantly cut the government's spending on Alzheimer's care, but \nmore importantly we would be able to give these families extra years, \nextra time, less time battling this disease.\n  We all know the answers to Alzheimer's will not just drop out of the \nsky. If that was true, it would have been cured a long time ago. It \nwill take dedicated scientists, advanced research initiatives, and \nskilled doctors with knowledge of the disease to conduct trials and \ncare for as many patients as possible until we find a cure.\n  That is why we are coming together for this important resolution, \nwhich resolves simply that the Senate will strive to double the funding \nthe United States spends on Alzheimer's research in 2016 and will \ndevelop a plan to meet the target of $2 billion a year in Alzheimer's \nresearch funding over the next 5 years.\n  As Senator Collins mentioned, this effort is led on the national \nlevel by Dr. Ronald Petersen, a Minnesota native and a leading \nresearcher. He agrees this is the time to move forward to get this \nresearch done. What kind of research are we talking about? I remember \nfirst hearing about some of the\n\n[[Page S1006]]\n\nwork Mayo had done and realizing they were focusing on trying to \nidentify this disease early to be able to figure out if people were \ngetting it early.\n  I thought: That is great, but how does that help? They still have the \ndisease. What I learned is the earlier they can identify the disease, \nthen the earlier they can start those trials so they can tell what is \nworking or not. If they wait too long to identify the disease, it is \nnearly impossible to tell what kind of potential cures work and what do \nnot.\n  This is a very important part of this initiative, which is to be able \nto immediately identify what those risk factors are when they think \nsomeone actually has Alzheimer's. Two years ago the United States \nlaunched the BRAIN Initiative, which is a national research effort to \nmap the human brain in hopes of finding new ways to prevent and cure \nbrain diseases. Similar to the Human Genome Project, I think we can \nexpect this initiative to truly be a game-changer that stimulates the \nnext generation of scientific development.\n  There is always more knowledge we need to get. There are always more \ntreatments to discover. There are more diseases to cure. That is why it \nis so important that we continue funding and actually increase funding \nto the National Institutes of Health. Earlier this year I introduced, \nwith Senator Durbin and others, a bill to boost funding for NIH by 5 \npercent a year and also other key Federal research agencies. The \nAmerican Cures Act would reverse the trend of declining Federal \ninvestment in medical research and fuel the next generation of \nbiomedical discoveries.\n  I care a lot about this. During the government shutdown I will never \nforget Senator Collins once again led the effort to find our way out of \nthat with 14 of us in a bipartisan effort. I gave my entire salary to \nNIH because I wanted to make the point that every day we go without \ndeveloping that cure for Alzheimer's, without supporting our scientists \nwho are doing that work, is another day where someone else dies of this \ndisease. It is another loved one we lose.\n  Another effort I think is very important when we look at this is \nprecision medicine. We should be supporting efforts to further the \nfield of precision medicine, which holds the promise of revolutionizing \nthe prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases. By better \nunderstanding genetic variations within diseases such as Alzheimer's, \nwe can develop targeted, more effective treatments.\n  Of course caregivers are the last thing I wish to talk about. If you \nknow someone with Alzheimer's, then you also know their family member \nor their friend who is taking care of them. Many of the caregivers have \nchildren themselves. That is why they are called the sandwich \ngeneration. They are literally sandwiched between taking care of their \nown children and taking care of their aging mother or father.\n  Just as we addressed the needs of moms and dads in the 1970s, started \nworking on things such as childcare benefits, we must now address the \nneeds of our working sons and daughters and those who are simply \ndevoting their lives to taking care of an aging relative, someone with \nAlzheimer's. This goes on every day. People have decided to quit their \njobs or they have to decide to take a different job or they have to \ndecide to go part time simply to take care of their loved one.\n  In 2013 more than 15 million family members and friends cared for \nsomeone with Alzheimer's disease or another form of dementia, often at \nthe expense of their own jobs and their own well-being. That is why I \nam continuing to work on legislation called the Americans Giving Care \nto Elders Act that would give family caregivers a tax credit and other \nassistance to help alleviate the financial burdens that come with \ncaring for a loved one.\n  So these are some ideas, but we know at its core the best thing to do \nis to stop this terrible disease from the beginning. That means living \nup to the expectations the people of this country have for us; that is, \nto do what is best for them; that is, to put forward the dollars we \nneed to do the research.\n  I know some great doctors in Minnesota and across the country who \nwill put that money to good use.\n  Let's go forward, let's cure this disease, and we call on the Senate \nto pass the resolution Senator Collins and I are submitting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/12/senate-section/article/S1006-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1006-S1007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 75--DESIGNATING THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY 2015, AS \n    ``NATIONAL TEEN DATING VIOLENCE AWARENESS AND PREVENTION MONTH''\n\n  Mr. DURBIN (for Mr. Reid of Nevada (for himself and Mr. Whitehouse)) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non the Judiciary:\n\n                               S. Res. 75\n\n       Whereas although dating violence, domestic violence, sexual \n     violence, and stalking affect women regardless of age, \n     teenage girls and young women are especially vulnerable;\n       Whereas a 2013 survey by the Center for Disease Control \n     found that nearly 10 percent of high school students reported \n     physical victimization and 10 percent reported sexual \n     victimization from a dating partner in the 12 months before \n     they were surveyed;\n       Whereas according to the Center for Disease Control, nearly \n     1,500,000 high school students experience physical abuse from \n     a dating partner each year;\n       Whereas a 1997 Commonwealth Fund survey found that more \n     than \\1/4\\ of high school girls had been either sexually \n     abused, physically abused, or abused by a date or boyfriend;\n       Whereas the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that females \n     between the ages of 16 and 24 experience intimate partner \n     violence at a rate that is almost triple the national \n     average;\n       Whereas in 2008, the National Council on Crime and \n     Delinquency reported that approximately 1 in 3 adolescent \n     girls in the United States is a victim of physical, \n     emotional, or verbal abuse from a dating partner, a rate that \n     far exceeds victimization rates for other types of violence \n     affecting young people;\n       Whereas a 2012 study, as part of an independent evaluation \n     of Start Strong: Building Healthy Teen Relationships, an \n     initiative aimed at building healthy relationships among \n     middle school youth, found that teen dating violence \n     behaviors were common even among seventh grade students, with \n     nearly 1 in 6 students reporting physical dating violence;\n       Whereas according to data from the Youth Risk Behavior \n     Surveillance System, almost 20 percent of teenage girls who \n     were exposed to physical dating violence did not attend \n     school on 1 or more occasions during the 30 days preceding \n     the survey because the girls felt unsafe at school or on the \n     way to or from school;\n       Whereas schools are unequipped to handle the issue of teen \n     dating violence, as a recent study by Ball State University \n     found that--\n       (1) 81 percent of school counselors reported that they did \n     not have a school protocol on how to respond to an incident \n     of teen dating violence; but\n       (2) 61 percent of school counselors reported that they had \n     assisted victims of dating-related violence in the past 2 \n     years, despite a lack of formal training for some of the \n     counselors;\n       Whereas a study published in Pediatrics suggests that teen \n     dating violence ``is a substantial public health problem'' \n     because victims of teen dating violence are--\n       (1) at increased risk of mood and behavior problems as \n     young adults; and\n       (2) at increased risk for future violent relationships;\n       Whereas girls victimized by a teen boyfriend reported more \n     heavy drinking, smoking, depression, and thoughts of suicide, \n     and teens of both sexes who were in aggressive relationships \n     were 2 to 3 times more likely to be in violent relationships \n     as young adults;\n       Whereas being physically or sexually abused makes teenage \n     girls up to 6 times more likely to become pregnant and more \n     than twice as likely to contract a sexually transmitted \n     disease;\n       Whereas according to the 2009 Parent/Teen Dating Violence \n     Poll by Liz Claiborne Inc., although 82 percent of parents \n     are confident that they could recognize the signs if their \n     child was experiencing dating abuse, 58 percent of parents \n     could not correctly identify all of the warning signs of \n     abuse;\n       Whereas 74 percent of teenage boys and 66 percent of \n     teenage girls report that they have not had a conversation \n     with a parent about dating abuse in the past year;\n       Whereas 1 in 4 teens in a relationship report having been \n     called names, harassed, or put down by a partner through the \n     use of a telephone, including through texting;\n       Whereas according to the 2010 College Dating Violence and \n     Abuse Poll by Liz Claiborne Inc., 43 percent of college women \n     who date report experiencing abusive dating behaviors;\n       Whereas 70 percent of college students who experienced \n     relationship abuse failed to realize that they were in an \n     abusive relationship at the time, and 60 percent of college \n     students who were in an abusive relationship said that no one \n     stepped in to help them;\n       Whereas the severity of violence among intimate partners \n     has been shown to be greater in cases where a pattern of \n     violence was established during adolescence;\n\n[[Page S1007]]\n\n       Whereas primary prevention programs are a key part of \n     addressing teen dating violence, and successful examples of \n     these programs include education, community outreach, and \n     social marketing campaigns that are culturally appropriate;\n       Whereas educating middle school students and the parents of \n     middle school students about the importance of building \n     healthy relationships and preventing teen dating violence is \n     key to deterring dating abuse before it begins;\n       Whereas skilled assessment and intervention programs are \n     necessary for young victims and abusers;

which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S. Res. 76\n\n       Whereas, since its founding in 1948, Israel has been a \n     strong and steadfast ally to the United States in the Middle \n     East, a region characterized by instability and violence;\n       Whereas the United States-Israel relationship is built on \n     mutual respect for common values, including a commitment to \n     democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, free-market \n     principles, and ethnic and religious diversity;\n       Whereas the strong cultural, religious, and political ties \n     shared by the United States and Israel help form a bond \n     between our countries that should never be broken;\n       Whereas Israel continues to serve as a shining model of \n     democratic values by regularly holding free and fair \n     elections, promoting the free exchange of ideas, and \n     vigorously exercising a form of democratic government that is \n     fully representative of its citizens;\n       Whereas nations such as Iran and Syria, as well as \n     designated foreign terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah \n     and Hamas, refuse to recognize Israel's right to exist, \n     continually call for its destruction, and have repeatedly \n     attacked Israel either directly or through proxies;\n       Whereas, in particular, the Government of Iran's ongoing \n     pursuit of nuclear weapons poses a tremendous threat both to \n     the United States and Israel;\n       Whereas the negotiations between the so-called P5+1 \n     countries and Iran over its illicit nuclear weapons program \n     are entering a key phase, and Congress has heard the \n     perspectives, both publicly and privately, of a number of \n     close allies involved in the negotiations; and\n       Whereas the United States is committed to ensuring that \n     Israel, as a strong and trusted ally, maintains its \n     qualitative military edge: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) warmly welcomes the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin \n     Netanyahu, on his visit to the United States, which provides \n     a timely opportunity to reinforce the United States-Israel \n     relationship;\n       (2) eagerly awaits the address of Prime Minister Netanyahu \n     before a joint session of the United States Congress;\n       (3) reaffirms its commitment to stand with Israel during \n     times of uncertainty;\n       (4) continues to strongly support Israel's right to defend \n     itself from threats to its very survival; and\n       (5) reaffirms its unequivocal and bipartisan support for \n     the friendship between the people and Governments of the \n     United States and Israel.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to speak on another matter, and \nthat is an event that should be a historic and momentous event that is \nscheduled to take place on the other side of the Capitol early next \nmonth. For the third time since he has been Prime Minister of Israel, \nBenjamin Netanyahu will be speaking to a joint session of Congress.\n  In his invitation, the Speaker of the House indicated that the reason \nfor the invitation is because of the grave threats radical Islam and \nthe Iranian regime pose to our security and our way of life. I cannot \nthink of a more timely or a more critical subject for the American \npeople to hear about from one of the world's great leaders.\n  For some reason, some people are trying to turn this into a public \ncontroversy, but to me and I imagine to many others, it is mystifying \nand somewhat disappointing. The reasons for supporting and defending \nthe nation of Israel are obvious: Both of our countries are pluralistic \ndemocracies with a staunch commitment to liberty, equality, and human \nrights; both of our countries are threatened by radical Islam; and both \nof our countries have responded to that threat while remaining free and \nopen societies. Those are the reasons why most Americans stand with \nIsrael and why U.S. aid to Israel enjoys such overwhelming support \namong Members of both parties here in Congress. Indeed, we have no \ncloser Middle Eastern ally than Israel and I would argue no bigger \nMiddle Eastern adversary than the country of Iran.\n  I would also argue that we have no bigger foreign policy challenges \nthan stopping the Iranian drive for nuclear weapons and keeping those \nweapons out of the hands of terrorists. A nuclear Iran would make this \nworld a far more dangerous place. For starters, it would dramatically \nincrease Iranian leverage, Iranian power, and Iranian aggression in the \nMiddle East. We must remember that this is the same regime that has \ncontinued to violently target the United States since 1979. It is the \nsame regime that has been on the State Department's terrorism blacklist \nsince 1984. It is the same regime that not too long ago was plotting to \nblow up a restaurant right here in Washington, DC.\n  I was reminded that 1983, with the bombing of our Embassy in Beirut--\na largely forgotten historical moment--was the beginning of America's \ndeadly encounter with the political Islamist movement. It was also the \nbirth of the Shiite political entity we know today by the name of \nHezbollah, supported by Iran.\n  Perhaps most poignantly, the Government of Iran refuses to recognize \nIsrael's right to exist, has continually called for its destruction, \nand has repeatedly attacked Israel either directly or through proxies. \nMake no mistake--Iran's ongoing pursuit of nuclear weapons poses a \ntremendous threat to the United States and to our ally Israel.\n  Given the very clear and present danger to the nation of Israel and \nthe dangers they face on a perpetual basis from their neighbors in the \nregion--Iran--the U.S.-Israel alliance has never been more important \nthan it is today.\n  Israel is a shining model of democratic values for nations around the \nworld. It is a great example for others to follow in the Middle East. \nThe strong cultural, religious, and political ties shared by the United \nStates and Israel have helped form a bond between our countries that \nshould never be broken.\n  Now more than ever, the people of Israel need reassurance that we \nremain committed to seeing that their nation, as a strong and trusted \nally, maintain its qualitative military edge in the face of ongoing \nthreats from nations such as Iran and Syria and terrorist groups such \nas Hamas and Hezbollah. That is why today we have filed a resolution \nhere in the Senate welcoming Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \nwhen he addresses a joint session of Congress next month. This \nresolution reaffirms the Senate's commitment to stand with Israel \nduring times of uncertainty. It reaffirms this body's strong support \nfor Israel's right to defend itself from threats to its very survival. \nAnd it reaffirms the Senate's unequivocal support for the friendship \nbetween the governments of our two nations.\n  As of this morning a majority of the Senate has signed on as a \ncosponsor to\n\n[[Page S1008]]\n\nthis resolution, and this afternoon we are signing a ``Dear Colleague'' \nletter, which, as the Presiding Officer knows, invites all 100 Senators \nto join in support of this resolution. I hope the rest of my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle will join me in welcoming the Prime Minister \nto Washington so we can continue to work together as he articulates in \ngraphic detail, as no one else can, the threat of a nuclear Iran. \nDuring this time of such great instability and danger in the Middle \nEast, the United States cannot afford to waver in our commitment to one \nof our closest and most important allies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/12/senate-section/article/S1008-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 77--DESIGNATING FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 2015, AS ``$2.13 \n                                 DAY''\n\n  Mr. BROWN (for himself, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms. Baldwin, Ms. Warren, Mr. \nDurbin, Mr. Whitehouse, Mrs. Boxer, and Mrs. Gillibrand) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                               S. Res. 77\n\n       Whereas $2.13 per hour is the Federal minimum wage that an \n     employer is required to pay a tipped employee (as defined in \n     section 3(t) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 \n     U.S.C. 203(t))) as a cash wage under section 3(m) of such Act \n     (29 U.S.C. 203(m)) (referred to in this preamble as the \n     ``Federal minimum wage for a tipped employee'');\n       Whereas when the Federal minimum wage for a tipped employee \n     was established in 1966, such wage was linked to the Federal \n     minimum wage for a covered nonexempt employee under section \n     6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. \n     206(a)(1));\n       Whereas while the Federal minimum wage for a covered \n     nonexempt employee increased in 2009, the Federal minimum \n     wage for a tipped employee has not changed in more than 20 \n     years;\n       Whereas in the 1980s, the Federal minimum wage for a tipped \n     employee reached 60 percent of the Federal minimum wage for a \n     covered nonexempt employee, and in 2015, the Federal minimum \n     wage for a tipped employee is only 29 percent of the $7.25 \n     per hour Federal minimum wage for a covered nonexempt \n     employee;\n       Whereas tipped employees work in many occupations, \n     including working as restaurant servers, airport attendants, \n     hotel workers, valets, and salon workers;\n       Whereas $2.13 per hour is such a low wage that tipped \n     employees are dependent on the discretional contributions of \n     consumers for the majority of their income;\n       Whereas 7 States have 1 minimum wage for both tipped \n     employees and covered nonexempt employees, and the restaurant \n     industry has continued to thrive in such States;\n       Whereas in States with a minimum wage for a tipped employee \n     that is higher than $2.13 per hour, the poverty rate for \n     tipped employees is lower than the poverty rate for tipped \n     employees in States without such a higher minimum wage for \n     tipped employees;\n       Whereas restaurant servers have a poverty rate that is 3 \n     times higher than the poverty rate of the general workforce \n     and are nearly 2 times more likely to depend on the \n     supplemental nutrition assistance program established under \n     the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.) \n     than the general workforce;\n       Whereas States with a minimum wage for a tipped employee of \n     $2.13 per hour have a poverty rate for employees of color \n     that is more than 10 percent higher than such poverty rate in \n     States that require the same minimum wage for tipped \n     employees as other covered nonexempt employees;\n       Whereas women account for 67 percent of all tipped \n     employees and approximately 70 percent of food servers and \n     bartenders;\n       Whereas 25 percent of all tipped employees are parents who \n     work hard to support their families;\n       Whereas the Bureau of Labor Statistics projected that from \n     2008 to 2018, the food preparation and serving sector, as \n     defined by the Bureau, would add more than 1,000,000 jobs;\n       Whereas such food preparation and serving sector has a mean \n     wage of $24,860, nearly $25,000 less than the mean wage for \n     all occupations in the United States; and\n       Whereas raising the Federal minimum wage for a tipped \n     employee would provide hardworking people in the United \n     States with more just wages, lift families in the United \n     States out of poverty, and provide economic security to \n     tipped employees in the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate designates Friday, February 13, 2015, as \n     ``$2.13 Day''; and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that the cash wage that \n     an employer is required to pay a tipped employee (as defined \n     in section 3(t) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 \n     U.S.C. 203(t))) under section 3(m) of such Act (29 U.S.C. \n     203(m)) should be increased to 70 percent of the Federal \n     minimum wage for a covered nonexempt employee under section \n     6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. \n     206(a)(1)).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/12/senate-section/article/S1008-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 78--RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF JERRY TARKANIAN, FORMER \n      HEAD BASKETBALL COACH OF THE UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA, LAS VEGAS\n\n  Mr. HELLER (for himself and Mr. Reid of Nevada) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nForeign Relations Committee be discharged from further consideration of \nS. Res. 52 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 52) calling for the release of \n     Ukrainian fighter pilot Nadiya Savchenko, who was captured by \n     Russian forces in Eastern Ukraine and has been held illegally \n     in a Russian prison since July 2014.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the plight of Ukrainian \nfighter pilot Nadiya Savchenko. My resolution, S. Res. 52., which \nSenators Wicker, Brown, Rubio, and Gardner have co-sponsored, calls for \nthe release of former Ukrainian fighter pilot Nadiya Savchenko, who has \nbeen languishing in Russian prisons since she was abducted by pro-\nRussian forces in eastern Ukraine last July and illegally transferred \nacross the border in handcuffs and with a bag over her head.\n  In the 8 months Nadiya has been incarcerated on specious and \nunsubstantiated charges, she has endured interrogations, involuntary \npsychiatric evaluations, and solitary confinement in the same pretrial \ndetention center where Sergei Magnitsky was tortured and killed in \n2009. The resolution is especially timely as Nadiya is in the 62nd day \nof a hunger strike. Her health is rapidly deteriorating. Her situation \nis critical. And yet, on Tuesday, a Moscow court extended her detention \nuntil May 13, ignoring clear evidence compiled by the defense proving \nher non-involvement in the deeds the Russian authorities claim as \njustification for holding her.\n  Nadiya is yet another victim of the Putin regime's lawlessness, \nbrutality, and contempt for human life. And we need to recognize that \nthis isn't just about her; it's a highly visible manifestation of \nPutin's contempt for a Ukraine that wishes to remain free, independent, \nand democratic. She was elected in absentia to the Ukrainian parliament \nin October and a member of Ukraine's delegation to the Parliamentary \nAssembly of the Council of Europe, PACE. As such, she enjoys diplomatic \nimmunity and PACE has called for her immediate release.\n  According to the September Minsk agreements between Russia and \nUkraine, hostages on both sides were supposed to be released. Russia \nhas made a mockery of the Minsk agreements, just as it has the Helsinki \nFinal Act and numerous other Organization for Security and Cooperation \nin Europe, OSCE, agreements. The illegal detention of Nadiya and other \nUkrainian citizens represents yet another violation of international \nagreements and the norms of civilized behavior. S. Res. 52 sends a \nstrong message of solidarity to the Ukrainian people and calls on the \nPutin regime to release Nadiya immediately. I am pleased the Senate is \npoised to pass this important resolution.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Cardin \namendment to the resolution be agreed to; the resolution, as amended, \nbe agreed to; the preamble be agreed to; and the motions to reconsider \nbe considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 251) in the nature of a substitute was agreed to, \nas follows:\n\n              (Purpose: To provide a complete substitute)\n\n       Strike all after the resolving clause and insert the \n     following: ``That the Senate--\n\n[[Page S1011]]\n\n       (1) condemns the Government of the Russian Federation for \n     its illegal imprisonment of Nadiya Savchenko;\n       (2) calls on the Government of the Russian Federation to \n     immediately release Nadiya Savchenko;\n       (3) calls on the United States, its European allies, and \n     the international community to aggressively support \n     diplomatic efforts to release Nadiya Savchenko; and\n       (4) expresses solidarity with the Ukrainian people.\n\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 52\n\n       Whereas Nadiya Savchenko is the first-ever female fighter \n     pilot in Ukraine's Armed Forces and is an Iraqi war veteran;\n       Whereas in the ongoing conflict in Eastern Ukraine, Nadiya \n     Savchenko volunteered her services to the Ukrainian Aidar \n     battalion;\n       Whereas Nadiya Savchenko was elected in absentia from the \n     Batkivshchyna Party to Ukraine's Parliament in October 2014, \n     and appointed to the Parliament Assembly of the Council of \n     Europe (PACE) as a representative from Ukraine;\n       Whereas as a member of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, \n     Lieutenant Nadiya Savchenko was conducting operations in \n     eastern Ukraine against pro-Russian forces in the summer of \n     2014 when she was captured and taken into captivity;\n       Whereas during her mission in Eastern Ukraine, she was \n     captured by the Donbas People's Militia, detained on \n     Ukrainian territory, deprived of rights to due process, and \n     illegally transferred to the Russian Federation to stand \n     trial on unsubstantiated charges of terrorism;\n       Whereas, since July 2014, Nadiya Savchenko has endured \n     involuntary psychiatric evaluations and solitary confinement;\n       Whereas Nadiya Savchenko is currently entering her sixth \n     week of a hunger strike as a symbol of her protest;\n       Whereas Nadiya Savchenko is denied access to urgently \n     needed medical attention and access to legal counsel;\n       Whereas the Minsk Protocol of September 2014, signed by \n     Ukraine and the Russian Federation, calls for the ``immediate \n     release of all hostages and illegally held persons'';\n       Whereas appeals have been made to the United Nations Human \n     Rights Council and the International Red Cross to secure \n     Nadiya Savchenko's release;\n       Whereas the international community, including \n     representatives of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council \n     of Europe (PACE) and of the United States, have urged her \n     immediate release;\n       Whereas, on January 26, 2015, the opening day of the \n     Parliamentary Assembly, the global community embarks on a \n     public campaign to bring attention to the plight of Nadiya \n     Savchenko and demand her immediate release; and\n       Whereas the Government and people of the United States \n     express concern about the deteriorating health of detained \n     pilot Nadiya Savchenko and her continued illegal \n     imprisonment: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the Government of the Russian Federation for \n     its illegal imprisonment of Nadiya Savchenko;\n       (2) calls on the Government of the Russian Federation to \n     immediately release Nadiya Savchenko;\n       (3) calls on the United States, its European allies, and \n     the international community to aggressively support \n     diplomatic efforts to release Nadiya Savchenko; and\n       (4) expresses solidarity with the Ukrainian people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/12/senate-section/article/S1011-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RESOLUTIONS SUBMITTED TODAY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
