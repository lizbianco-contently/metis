Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on the \nDefend Trade Secrets Act. This bipartisan legislation can help promote \ngrowth of the economy, help spur the increase and retention of American \njobs, and help protect American innovation in the global economy. It \naims to do so by providing tools for American companies both small and \nlarge to effectively protect some of their most valuable assets in \ntoday's international economy.\n  American companies spend billions every year on research and \ndevelopment and in the creation of products we use every day. But some \nthieves would rather not go through the trouble of developing products \nthemselves; they would rather just steal the fruits of others' \ncreativity and innovation. That is more than just wrong; it puts \nAmerican jobs and the American economy at risk.\n\n[[Page S1622]]\n\n  American businesses find themselves increasingly under attack from a \nsophisticated effort to steal the very things that give them a \ncompetitive edge in the 21st-century economy--things such as codes, \nformulas, and confidential manufacturing processes. While it has never \nbeen easier for these thieves to launch attacks on innovation, \nsometimes armed with little more than a jump drive, many American \nbusinesses now find themselves less able to protect their important \nassets under current law.\n  Senator Hatch knew we had to do something about this. He knew it was \ntime to modernize our trade secret laws to keep pace with rapid \nadvances in technology and in criminal techniques. He knew it was time \nto streamline and simplify the process for U.S. companies to \neffectively defend American jobs, American growth, and the American \ninnovation that is increasingly at the heart of our modern economy. \nSenator Hatch worked across the aisle with Senator Coons to develop the \nDefend Trade Secrets Act. This bipartisan legislation eventually gained \nthe cosponsorship of a majority of the Senate.\n  This bipartisan legislation also passed the Judiciary Committee \nunanimously. That is impressive, and it wouldn't have happened without \nthe able leadership of the chairman of that committee, Senator Grassley \nfrom Iowa. Since the new majority took office, Senator Grassley has \nbeen a highly effective legislator as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. From comprehensive legislation to address America's opioid \nepidemic, to protecting the victims of modern slavery, to today's \neffort to support American innovation, he has received widespread \npraise from both sides of the aisle for leading a very productive \ncommittee. Senator Grassley is a hard worker, and he is again winning \nkudos on this bill.\n  The organization that represents America's tech sector said that \n``the committee's process has been very open and thoughtful.'' A broad \ncross section of American businesses wrote that ``the approach to the \nbill has been consensus-oriented.'' This, they said, ``led to broad and \nenthusiastic support from a wide range of American organizations and \ncompanies . . . representing the technology, medical device, \nagriculture, biotech, pharmaceutical, automobile, clean energy, \nconsumer products and manufacturing sectors.''\n  Here is what I say: Today's trade secret theft is high-tech. It is \nfast moving, and it threatens America's economy, America's jobs, and \nAmerica's innovation.\n  I ask that my colleagues join me this evening in voting to fight back \non behalf of the American people. I ask them to join me in supporting \nthe bipartisan Defend Trade Secrets Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/04/senate-section/article/S1622-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TERRORIST THREATS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in recent weeks we have again been \nreminded of the pervasive threat posed by Islamic terrorists to the \nworld. We have seen ghastly images in places as diverse as Brussels, \nYemen, and Lahore. Attacks seem to be coming nearly weekly now, and it \nfeels as if we hear of a new one almost every time we flip on the news.\n  Over the weekend, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee \ndelivered an address focused on the threat facing us and what we can \nultimately do to overcome it. Senator Burr noted that he could not \nremember a time when the United States and its allies faced a greater \narray of threats across the world, which is why, as he put it, ``we \ncannot simply focus our efforts on how to best respond to attacks once \nthey've already happened.'' Senator Burr spoke on the significance of \nworking with our allies to target threats at every level. He talked \nabout the importance of ensuring that law enforcement has the tools and \nauthorities needed to keep Americans safe. He also underlined the need \nfor President Obama to do more in directly taking on ISIL and made \nclear that doing so would require leadership that reached beyond the \nadministration's current containment strategy.\n  It is clear that defeating ISIL, Al Qaeda, and its affiliates will \nrequire concerted action by our military, the intelligence community, \nand international partners around the globe. That is why we have \ncontinued to press the administration for a serious plan to defeat \nthese terrorist groups and not simply attempt to contain them. In \naddition to the ongoing air campaign, the President has lauded \ndeploying special operations forces to target and pursue ISIL. It is a \npositive step, but a credible ground force will be needed to defeat \nISIL.\n  As Senator Burr put it, ``We're beyond containment and must move \ndecisively and with purpose to eliminate the Islamic State.''\n  ``The President,'' he continued, has accurately stated ``that `ISIL \nposes a threat to the entire civilized world.' Now is the time for our \nstrategy to match that threat.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/04/senate-section/article/S1622-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1622-S1623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AMERICA'S SMALL BUSINESS TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2015--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to proceed to H.R. 636, the \nvehicle we will use for FAA reauthorization.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 55, H.R. 636, to amend \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permanently extend \n     increased expensing limitations, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                       Defend Trade Secrets Bill\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I understand why my friend the Republican \nleader is doing everything he can to shine a bright light on the \nJudiciary Committee. It is kind of hard to do that considering \neverything that is going on today. The bill that we will vote on at \n5:30 p.m. would have passed with unanimous consent, and everybody knows \nthat. We don't need to take up the Senate's time on a bill that would \npass just like that. We are doing it because it focuses less attention \non the inadequacy of the Judiciary Committee. The Defend Trade Secrets \nAct was easily reported out of committee. There were no problems. It \nwas a bill on which everybody agreed. There may be some reasons for it, \nbut I don't see why the Judiciary Committee should be given a few pats \non the back. The problem is that the committee does not deserve any \npats on the back at this stage.\n\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as U.S. Senators we have a constitutional \nobligation to consider nominees to important positions. That is one of \nour constitutional responsibilities. Judges play an essential role in \nour society, and we should give qualified nominees the fair shot they \ndeserve. Sadly, the Republican Senate has refused to do its job. They \nhave a new standard: Unless the judge-to-be passes the test on the \nNational Rifle Association, as stated by the Republican leader on \nnational TV, they can't vote for him.\n  The Judiciary Committee has been hammered--and that is an \nunderstatement--day after day in the State of Iowa, the home State of \nthe chairman of the committee. This is a headline from the largest \nnewspaper in the State, the Des Moines Register: ``Grassley leads \nslowdown of judicial confirmations.'' Here is what this headline is all \nabout:\n\n       The Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee and \n     its Chairman, Senator Grassley, have fallen far behind any \n     comparable Senate in confirming judicial nominations.\n\n  Reading directly from the Des Moines Register article:\n\n       Even before the current controversy over consideration of a \n     Supreme Court justice, action on federal court nominations \n     has slowed markedly since U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley took \n     control of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n       Since Republicans won a Senate majority in 2014, the number \n     of President Obama's nominees winning confirmation to the \n     bench has fallen compared with previous years and long-term \n     averages, as have the number advancing out of Grassley's \n     Judiciary Committee, according to data from the Congressional \n     Research Service and the federal judiciary.\n\n  The article also quotes Professor Sheldon Goldman, an expert on \njudicial confirmations from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He \nsaid: ``With Republicans taking over the Senate, the strategy has been \nto obstruct, delay and slow-walk these\n\n[[Page S1623]]\n\nnominees at every stage of the process.''\n  Statistics from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service \nconfirmed Professor Goldman's assertion. Under Chairman Grassley's \nleadership, the Judiciary Committee is grinding the nomination process \nto a halt. The number of judicial nominations confirmed in this \nCongress is the worst. To date, this Republican-controlled Senate has \nconfirmed only 16 judicial nominations. That is one judge a month.\n\n  Contrast that with the last years of George W. Bush's Presidency. We \nhad a Democratic Senate and we had a Republican President. Then-\nDemocratic Chair Leahy and his Senate colleagues confirmed 40 judges--\n40 confirmations compared to 16 under Chairman Grassley. The numbers \nspeak for themselves.\n  But to better understand the dysfunction of Senator Grassley's \ncommittee, we have to consider the slow pace at which he and \nRepublicans are reporting judicial nominations. We have to go back more \nthan six decades to find a Senate Judiciary Committee that was less \nproductive than Chairman Grassley's committee is today.\n  Republicans will doubtless claim that their committee has stopped \nworking because it is the last year of Obama's Presidency. That is \nsimply nonsense. In 1988--President Reagan's last year--the Senate \nJudiciary Committee reported circuit and district court nominations as \nlate as October. The Senate considered President Reagan's, President \nClinton's, and President George W. Bush's judicial nominations in the \neighth year of their terms, and many other Presidents were treated the \nsame way.\n  The Republican leader is on the record advocating for the \nconfirmation of judicial nominees in a President's last year in office. \nThis is what the Republican leader said in July of 2008: ``Even with \nlameduck Presidents, there is a historical standard of fairness as to \nconfirming judicial nominees, especially circuit court nominees.'' \nThose are the Republican leader's own words. Yet now he refuses to \nextend that ``historical standard of fairness'' to President Obama's \nnominees. Why are Republicans changing the rules for President Obama's \nnominees?\n  Given that the chairman of the Judiciary Committee refused to attend \nto the judiciary, how is the Republican Committee spending its time? We \nknow Chairman Grassley's committee is refusing to consider President \nObama's Supreme Court nominee, Chief Judge Merrick Garland. We know \nChairman Grassley's committee is refusing to adequately report district \nand circuit court nominees.\n  This much is clear: The Republican Judiciary Committee is not doing \nits job. Instead, the senior Senator from Iowa is taking his marching \norders from the Republican leader and has instituted a blockade of \njudicial nominations at every level. The once proud and powerful \nJudiciary Committee, established hundreds of years ago, has become a \nmere shadow of its former self. He has turned the once powerful and \nindependent Judiciary Committee into an extension of the Republican \nleader's office.\n  This is the same gridlock the Republican leader has imposed upon the \nSenate for the last 8 years. Since his party assumed the majority in \nthe Senate last January, the Republican leader's carefully orchestrated \nobstruction of judicial nominations has accelerated to historical \nlevels and judicial emergencies have tripled.\n  My friend--we have served together in the Senate for decades--can \ncome to the floor all the time to speak about the success of the \nSenate. No matter how many times you say a falsehood, it is still \nfalse.\n  Senator McConnell once declared himself the ``proud guardian of \ngridlock.'' Senator Grassley has become his most willing disciple. It \nis disappointing that the senior Senator from Iowa has surrendered his \ncommittee to the Republican leader.\n  The lack of progress on judges should alarm Members of the Senate--\neven Republican Senators. Take, for example, the nomination of a man by \nthe name of Waverly Crenshaw, who was recommended by Senators Alexander \nand Corker to be a district judge in the Middle District of Tennessee. \nMr. Crenshaw is a superb nominee who has broken barriers all of his \nlife. He is currently a partner at a well-renowned law firm in \nNashville where he became the first African-American partner in 1990. \nThe senior Senator from Tennessee said that Mr. Crenshaw would be ``an \nexcellent federal district judge.'' I agree. He was reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee unanimously in July of 2015--almost 10 months ago.\n  The vacancy in the Middle District of Tennessee is a judicial \nemergency, meaning there are more cases than the judges on the court \ncan handle. The junior Senator from Tennessee said: ``I know there is a \ntremendous load of work in the Nashville office that needs to get done, \nand we've talked a great deal with the other judges there and know this \nposition needs to be confirmed.''\n  Last month, the Senators from Maryland asked to bring the Crenshaw \nnomination to a vote, but the assistant Republican leader objected. \nBoth Senators brought this forward. The objection was the same. The \nsenior Senator from Texas said it will lead to ``chaos'' to schedule a \nvote on Mr. Crenshaw.\n  Chaos is exactly what the Republicans are bringing to the judiciary. \nFrom the Supreme Court, to the circuit courts, to the district courts, \nour entire judicial branch of government is under siege by this \nRepublican Senate. After they have crippled the judiciary, the \nRepublican leader and Chairman Grassley want to hand it over to Donald \nTrump. That would be disastrous. That is not what the American people \nwant. They want Republicans to do their constitutional duty and give \nthese judges due consideration. That is not asking too much.\n  So I say to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee: Stop blocking \nthese nominees. Do what other Judiciary chairs have done for 200 years \nand move the process forward. These nominations are important. Or, put \nsimply, do your job. This--a historic slowdown of judicial \nconfirmations--isn't your job, and it is not what the people of Iowa \nsent you here to do, as indicated by the Des Moines Register: \n``Grassley leads slowdown of judicial confirmations.''\n  Mr. President, I see no one here wanting to speak. Would the Chair \nannounce the business for the rest of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/04/senate-section/article/S1623-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

He was a true \ninspiration for Montanans seeking public office, and he was the first \nperson to inspire others to run for mayor, including our current mayor, \nJim Smith.\n  Russ was instrumental in the construction of a 10-mile water \ntreatment plant. That was a big-ticket expenditure on the part of the \ncity, and all bonds are now paid off and the plant is up and running. I \nmight suggest that Washington, DC, could take a few lessons from Russ \nRitter. During Russ's time, Helena transformed the solid waste system, \nand he also helped automate the system. He provided true management of \nthe city and improved it for generations to come by helping prevent the \nspread of diseases and creating a healthier Helena.\n  Russ also had a soft spot in his heart for the USS Helena, the \nnuclear powered submarine. He went to the christening of the launch in \n1986 and spent 9 days on the USS Helena underwater.\n  Another great story about Russ was reported recently in the Helena \nIndependent Record:\n\n       Russ met President Ronald Reagan in Billings on August 11, \n     1982. But this meeting, one for which their father had \n     planned and prepared his remarks, the children said, did not \n     go as envisioned. Russ greeted the President by saying, \n     ``Hello, mister mayor, I'm the President of Helena,'' to \n     which Reagan responded, ``No, I think you've got that \n     wrong,'' Mike said. ``This left their father a bit \n     flustered,'' Mike continued, adding that Russ made his living \n     talking to people and always knew the right thing to say.\n\n  On behalf of Montanans and the people of Helena, we thank Russ for \nhis selfless service and will never forget his legacy on the history of \nour State.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/04/senate-section/article/S1624-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MADE-IN-MONTANA ENERGY\n\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, made-in-Montana energy means good Montana \njobs that on average pay two to three times more than the State \naverage. In fact, Montana's ability to create more good-paying energy \njobs is immense. Our State leads the Nation in recoverable coal \ndeposits. We are the Nation's fifth largest producer of hydropower, \nwith 23 hydroelectric dams across the State, and we are fifth in wind \nenergy potential.\n  In fact, Montana was center stage in the national energy debate and \nprovides our Nation a template of a true ``all of the above'' energy \nportfolio. We have coal, natural gas, oil, as well as renewables such \nas hydro, wind, biomass, and solar opportunities.\n  What makes our State most valuable are the people who make our energy \nsystems work--towns such as Colstrip, MT, that build communities around \nlivelihoods that are reliant on good-paying energy jobs. That is the \ngood news.\n  Here is the bad news: Montana energy jobs are under assault. Over the \npast 2 weeks, I heard from Montanans about the future and importance of \nmade-in-Montana energy and made-in-Montana good-paying jobs. During my \nweek-long tour across our State, I once again saw our vast natural \nresources and our true energy potential, whether it was touring a wind \nfarm near Baker, MT, on the far eastern side of our State, or seeing \nthe hydropower facility at Helena's Hauser Dam, or hosting a townhall \nat Colstrip. I was hearing directly from the community about the \ndevastating impacts that President Obama's anti-coal regulations will \nhave on hard-working Montanans.\n  My statewide energy tour culminated this past week at Montana Energy \n2016, where over 600 people gathered in Billings, MT, for a Montana \nfamily conversation about our State's energy future. During that 2\\1/\n2\\-day summit, we heard a consistent and powerful message about the \nneed to maximize our opportunity for growth and expand made-in-Montana \nenergy and the good-paying jobs it supports.\n  Montanans are leading American energy innovation; for example, \nMontanans such as Chrystal Cuniff, a Montana tech engineer from \nChoteau, who helped drill the deepest well in the Gulf of Mexico, or \nRyan Lance, a Montana native, a graduate of Montana Tech, who is \nleading one of the largest oil and gas companies in the world, or \nAshley Dennehey from Colstrip, who highlighted how the boilermakers, \noperators, and other hard-working labor groups in her community are \nworking hard to keep the lights on in the face of adversity.\n  We must continue investing in our 2-year colleges that provide \ntraining in trades such as welding and heavy machine operations so we \ncan keep our kids in Montana with good, high-paying energy jobs. In \nfact, Business Insider released a map that shows how hard these times \nare for millenials, highlighting their median income across the United \nStates. Montana ranked 50th, dead last, at a median income of $18,000 a \nyear for millenials.\n  We cannot forget that Montana coal provides tax revenues of $145 \nmillion a year which supports our teachers and our schools. Montana \nshould lead the world in developing clean coal technology. We must \ncontinue to develop renewable technologies that will store the power \ncreated by wind.\n  The bottom line is, we should not allow Washington, DC, and the Obama \nadministration to dictate and regulate coal and gas out of existence. \nWe need more made-in-Montana energy, not more made-in-the-Middle-East \nenergy. Make no mistake, President Obama's Environmental Protection \nAgency and their regulations are killing Montana energy.\n  Our country's future is very bright if we could unleash the power of \ninnovation and rein in the overregulation of Washington, DC. I couldn't \nagree more with what Darrin Old Coyote, chairman of the Crow Nation \ntribes, said in his keynote address at Montana Energy 2016 in Billings \njust last Thursday. He said this: ``All of Montana citizens need to \nwork together for a better tomorrow: renewable energy, fossil energy, \nconventional energy, Indian or non-Indian, regardless of political \naffiliation, whether we are Democrats, Republicans or Independents.''\n  Montanans can find better solutions than Washington, DC, bureaucrats.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this body was last in session during \nSunshine Week, but the principle of government transparency is one that \ndoes not expire. So I would like to take a few moments now to reiterate \nmy support for that timeless principle.\n  Open government is good government. And Americans have a right to a \ngovernment that is accountable to its people. In 1978, following the \nlessons learned from the Watergate scandal, Congress created Inspectors \nGeneral--or IGs--to be our eyes and ears within the executive branch. \nThese independent watchdogs are designed to\n\n[[Page S1625]]\n\nkeep Congress and the public informed about waste, fraud, and abuse in \ngovernment. But they also help agency leaders identify problems and \ninefficiencies that they may not be aware of. So IGs are critical to \ngood governance and to the rule of law.\n  But in order for these watchdogs to do their jobs, IGs need access to \nagency records. That is why the law authorizes IGs to access ``all'' \nrecords of the agency that they're charged with overseeing. However, \nsince 2010, more and more agencies have refused to comply with this \nlegal obligation. This obstruction has slowed down far too many \nimportant investigations--ranging from sexual assaults in the Peace \nCorps to the FBI's exercise of anti-terrorism authorities under the \nPATRIOT Act.\n  Last July, the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel aided and \nabetted the obstruction by issuing a memo defending it. That memo has \ngiven cover to other agencies to follow the FBI's lead and withhold \nrecords from their IGs.\n  According to OLC's 66-page opinion, Congress didn't really mean to \ngive IGs access to ``all records''--even though that is literally what \nwe spelled out in the law. Think about that for a second. One unelected \nbureaucrat in the Justice Department thinks he can overturn the will of \n535 elected officials in Congress and the President who signed the bill \ninto law. That is unacceptable, and Americans are tired of stunts like \nthis that undermine democracy and the rule of law, and make a mockery \nof government transparency.\n  The public deserves robust scrutiny of the federal government. So, \nsince September, a bipartisan group of Senators and I have been working \nto overturn the OLC opinion through S. 579, the Inspector General \nEmpowerment Act. Among other things, this bill includes further \nclarification that Congress intended IGs to access all agency records, \nnotwithstanding any other provision of law, unless other laws \nspecifically state that IGs are not to receive such access.\n  We attempted to pass this bill by unanimous consent in September. \nSince then, the cosponsors and I have worked hard in good faith to \naccommodate the concerns of any and all Senators willing to work with \nus. As a result, this bill now has a total of 17 cosponsors, including \n7 of my esteemed Democratic colleagues: Senators McCaskill, Carper, \nMikulski, Wyden, Baldwin, Manchin, and Peters. I want to thank each and \nevery one of them for standing up with me for Inspectors General and \nfor the principles of good governance.\n  In December, we attempted to pass this bipartisan bill by unanimous \nconsent. The bill cleared the Republican side with no objection, but \nthe bill was objected to on the Democratic side.\n  So, let's do the math. None of the 54 Republican Senators objected. \nThere are seven Democrat cosponsors. That is at least 61 votes--at \nleast. If this bill came up for a vote, it would certainly pass easily. \nIt was developed hand-in-hand over many months with both Democrats and \nRepublicans in the House of Representatives, which is ready to move an \nidentical bill as soon as we act here in the Senate.\n  So, on December 15, Senators McCaskill, Johnson, and I attempted to \npass this bill by a process known as a live unanimous consent. Our goal \nwas to pass the bill right then and there, and we could have, had a \nSenator not objected. However, the minority leader, Senator Reid stood \nup and objected. The minority leader obstructed a bill sponsored by \nseven Senators of his own party. Senator Reid refused to give any \nreason for obstructing this bipartisan bill, both at that time and \nlater when questioned by reporters. All he would say publicly was that \na Senator on his side of the aisle had concerns.\n  Apparently, Senator Reid is now telling the press that his concerns \nrelate to provisions of the bill that give IGs the power to subpoena \ntestimony from former federal employees. In a moment, I will explain \nwhy this authority is absolutely vital to the ability of IGs to conduct \neffective investigations. But before I do that, I want to make one \nthing crystal clear. My bipartisan cosponsors and I have been working \nin good faith to address these concerns for 5 months--since November \n2015. In those 5 months, we have offered at least half a dozen \naccommodations that would limit the subpoena authority in question. So \nwe have offered reasonable compromises, but the one or two Senators who \nobject to this provision appear to be demanding it be removed from the \nbill entirely.\n  Let me tell you why we cannot do that. When employees of the U.S. \ngovernment are accused of wrongdoing or misconduct, IGs should be able \nto conduct a full and thorough investigation of those allegations. \nGetting to the bottom of these allegations is necessary to restore the \npublic trust. Unfortunately, employees who may have violated that trust \nare often allowed to evade the IG's inquiry, by simply retiring from \nthe government. So the bill empowers IGs to obtain testimony from \nemployees like this.\n  Similarly, the bill helps IGs better expose waste, fraud, and abuse \nby those who receive Federal funds. It enables IGs to require testimony \nfrom government contractors and subcontractors and grantees and sub-\ngrantees. Currently, most IGs can subpoena documents from entities from \noutside their agency. However, most cannot subpoena testimony, although \na few can. For example, the Inspectors General for the Defense \nDepartment and the Department of Health and Human Services already have \nthis authority.\n\n  The ability to require witnesses outside the agency to talk to the IG \ncan be critical in carrying out an inspector general's statutory duties \nor recovering wasted federal funds. But I want to be clear: the bill \nalso imposes limitations on the authority of IGs to require testimony.\n  There are several procedural protections in place to ensure that this \nauthority is exercised wisely. For example, the subpoena must first be \napproved by a majority of a designated panel of three other IGs. It is \nthen referred to the Attorney General. For those IGs that can already \nsubpoena witness testimony, I am not aware of any instance in which it \nhas been misused.\n  In fact, the Inspector General for the Department of Defense has \nestablished a policy that spells out additional procedures and \nsafeguards to ensure that subjects of subpoenas are treated fairly. I \nam confident that the rest of the IG community will be just as \nscrupulous in providing appropriate protections for the use of this \nauthority as well. You see, we all win when IGs can do their jobs. And \nmost importantly, the public is better served when IGs are able to \nshine light into government operations and stewardship of taxpayer \ndollars.\n  This is a common sense, bipartisan bill that should have passed by \nunanimous consent. It overturns an OLC opinion that has been roundly \ncriticized by nearly everyone who has read it. For example, the New \nYork Times editorial board recently urged us to pass this bill so that \nwe can allow IGs to do their jobs. But Senator Reid is standing in the \nway of the Senate doing its job.\n  The Washington Post editorial board and the Project on Government \nOversight have also called on us to fix this IG access problem. At a \nJudiciary Committee hearing in August, Senator Leahy said that this \naccess problem is ``blocking what was once a free flow of \ninformation.'' Senator Leahy also called for a permanent legislative \nsolution.\n  Even the Justice Department witness at that hearing disagreed with \nthe results of the OLC opinion and supported legislative action to \nsolve the problem. But, to all of that, Senator Reid said ``no.''\n  Make no mistake: by blocking this bipartisan, good-government bill, \nSenator Reid is muzzling watchdogs, and the public is being robbed of \ntheir right to an accountable government. What is it about independent \nInspector General oversight that the minority leader is afraid of? \nRemember, the public is better served when IGs are able to shine light \ninto government operations and stewardship of taxpayer dollars.\n  And the public is beginning to take notice of Senator Reid's \nobstruction. Just last week, the Las Vegas Review-Journal--which is the \nlargest circulating daily newspaper in the minority leader's home \nState--published an article discussing his obstruction. Let me just \ntake a moment to read a quote from this article:\n\n       U.S. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada received \n     a government watchdog\n\n[[Page S1626]]\n\n     group's dubious honor . . . for blocking a bill to back \n     inspectors general in their battles against waste, fraud, \n     abuse, and mismanagement and refusing to provide a full \n     explanation on why he did so.\n\n  Then, just over this weekend, the editorial board of this same \nnewspaper wrote an opinion piece entitled, ``Let the sun shine in.'' \nLet me just read an excerpt from this article:\n\n       Because Sen. Grassley's bill has attracted bipartisan \n     support, and because Republicans and Democrats jointly have \n     objected to efforts to thwart IGs from doing their jobs, \n     we're confident that compromise is possible . . . . We urge \n     Sens. Reid and Grassley to work together to pass this \n     important legislation as quickly as possible.\n\n  As I mentioned earlier, the bipartisan group of cosponsors and I have \nalready offered half a dozen accommodations to address the concerns \nrelated to the subpoena authority provision. All of those offers are \nstill on the table, and we stand ready to work with Senator Reid and \nthe other Senator to get this bill done; in a way that improves IG \naccess to both documents and witness testimony.\n  Remember, the Inspector General Act was passed in 1978, following one \nof the worst political scandals in American history. Today, at least 61 \nSenators, the Las Vegas Review-Journal, the New York Times, the \nWashington Post, and good governance groups like POGO and Citizens \nAgainst Government Waste, all support restoring the intent of that \nact--through S. 579. This bill would redeem the free flow of \ninformation that Senator Leahy advocated in August. And every day that \ngoes by without overturning the OLC opinion is another day that \nwatchdogs across the government can be stonewalled.\n  Let me be clear. Only one Senator is publicly standing in the way of \nfixing this problem. Who is the obstructionist here? Who is not doing \ntheir job? We need to find a way to get this bill done. Especially now, \nwe need to focus on the things we can agree on. When there is something \nwith this much bipartisan support, it should be a no-brainer. One or \ntwo Senators should not be allowed to stand in the way.\n  I urge my colleagues to work with me to get S. 579 passed so that IGs \ncan resume doing the work that we asked them to do in 1978.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nDefend Trade Secrets Act, which is before us today. I thank Senators \nHatch and Coons for their important work on this bill and Chairman \nGrassley and Ranking Member Leahy for their leadership as well.\n  Stolen trade secrets cost American companies--and thus their \nworkers--billions of dollars each year and threaten their ability to \ninnovate and compete globally. This bill will help protect vital \nintellectual property, and I am pleased to be a cosponsor.\n  Trade secrets are the lifeblood of so many businesses in American. \nStealing those ideas can wipe out years of research by employees and \ndevelopment and cost millions of dollars in losses because \ncompetitors--those that steal the secrets--reap the benefits of \ninnovation without putting in any of the work. Although measuring the \ntotal cost of trade secret theft is difficult, one study using multiple \napproaches estimates the yearly cost at 1 to 3 percent of the U.S. \ngross domestic product.\n  Today, as much as 80 percent of companies' assets are intangible, the \nmajority of them in the form of trade secrets. This includes everything \nfrom financial, business, scientific, technical, economic, and \nengineering information to formulas, designs, prototypes, processes, \nprocedures, and computer code. Trade secret theft poses a particular \nrisk for my home State of Minnesota, which has a strong tradition of \ninnovation and bringing technological advances to the marketplace. Our \ncompanies have brought the world everything from the pacemaker to the \nPost-it Notes. Protecting their intellectual property is critical to \ntheir economic success, critical to our businesses, and, most \nimportantly, critical to the workers and employees who make their \nliving in American businesses.\n  Here are some examples of what we are talking about and the costs \nwhen trade secret thefts occur.\n  In 2011 a former employee of the Minnesota agricultural company \nCargill stole trade secrets of Cargill and Dow Chemical regarding a \nproduct and gave them to a Chinese university. The two companies \nsuffered combined losses of over $7 million. Fortunately, the former \nemployee was caught, convicted, and received 87 months in prison--the \nstrongest sentence possible. But look at the loss that occurred--$7 \nmillion.\n  That same year, an employee of a Minnesota paint company, Valspar, \ntried to steal $20 million worth of chemical formulas to give to a \nChinese company in exchange for a high-ranking job. That really \nhappened. The authorities caught him before he completed his theft, and \nhe received a sentence of 15 months in jail.\n  But too many thefts go unprosecuted, and the costs go beyond simply \ndollars and cents. Medical device makers Medtronic and Boston \nScientific hope to bring advanced care to patients in China. These \ncompanies would like to do even more but fear they won't be able to \nprotect sensitive proprietary technology, and that holds them back. \nStronger protection of trade secrets will benefit consumers across the \nworld as well as trade secret owners.\n  In 1996 Congress enacted the Economic Espionage Act, which made \neconomic espionage and trade secret theft a Federal crime. Nearly 20 \nyears later, the threat of trade secret theft has grown. Thumb drives \nand the cloud have replaced file cabinets for storage information, \nmaking stealing a trade secret as easy as clicking a button or touching \na screen. Trade secret theft threatens not just businesses but jobs \nand, certainly, innovation.\n  Protecting the intellectual property of American businesses needs \n21st century solutions. The Defend Trade Secrets Act demonstrates our \ncommitment at the Federal level to protect all forms of a business's \nintellectual property. This balanced bill gives companies two more \ntools to effectively protect their trade secrets.\n  First, a party can seek an ex parte court order to seize stolen trade \nsecrets to prevent their destruction or dissemination. To prevent \nabuse, the requirements to obtain an order are rigorous, access to the \nseized material is limited, and it is only available in what are \nconsidered ``extraordinary circumstances.''\n  Second, the bill creates a Federal private right of action for trade \nsecret theft. Companies will be able to rely on a national standard to \nefficiently protect their intellectual property.\n  Securing the trade secrets of American businesses and their employees \nis a serious issue and needs to be addressed, and I urge my colleagues \nto support the Defend Trade Secrets Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/04/senate-section/article/S1626-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1626-S1631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DEFEND TRADE SECRETS BILL\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, later this evening, the Senate will vote on \nthe Defend Trade Secrets Act, a bill that will enable U.S. businesses \nto protect their trade secrets in Federal court. Senator Chris Coons \nand I have been working on this legislation in a bipartisan way for \nnearly 2 years, so it is really satisfying to see the Senate poised to \nvote on this important bill.\n  To date, the legislation has 65 bipartisan cosponsors, including the \ndistinguished Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Chuck Grassley, and \nranking member, the distinguished Senator Pat Leahy. I appreciate their \nsupport for this bill.\n  I also commend our House colleagues, Representatives Doug Collins and \nJerrold Nadler, for their tireless efforts--and others over there as \nwell. They have been invaluable partners in advancing this legislation \nin the House of Representatives. Working under the capable leadership \nof my dear friend, House Judiciary Committee Chairman\n\n[[Page S1627]]\n\nBob Goodlatte, we have come together to right an inequity facing U.S. \nbusinesses by creating a civil remedy for trade secret \nmisappropriation.\n  Trade secrets--such as customer lists, formulas, algorithms, software \ncodes, unique designs, industrial techniques, and manufacturing \nprocesses--are an essential form of intellectual property. Other forms \nof intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights, and trademarks, \nare covered by Federal civil law. Trade secrets, by contrast, are the \nonly form of U.S. intellectual property where the owner does not have \naccess to a Federal civil remedy for misuse or misappropriation. As a \nresult, billions of dollars each year are lost to trade secret theft, \nwhich stifles innovation by deterring companies from investing in \nresearch and development.\n  Currently, the only Federal vehicle for trade secret protection is \nthe 1996 Economic Espionage Act, which makes trade secret theft by \nforeign nationals a criminal offense. But this remedy criminalizes only \na small subset of trade secret theft and relies on the thinly stretched \nresources of the Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute \nsuch offenses.\n  One experienced trade secret practitioner told me recently that the \nJustice Department typically only considers prosecuting cases with more \nthan $100,000 in damages. This is because trade secret investigations \nand prosecutions are more resource intensive and complex than most \nother Federal crimes, requiring a deep technological and scientific \nbackground. Given these constraints, the Justice Department and the FBI \nare reluctant to commit scarce resources to investigate and prosecute a \nsingle matter, especially when the same effort could result in the \nprosecution and conviction of other Federal crimes.\n  Therefore, it is not surprising that in the 20 years since the \nEconomic Espionage Act became law, Federal prosecutors have charged \nonly about 300 defendants for economic espionage or trade secret theft. \nAnd because these cases frequently involve multiple defendants, this \nequates to an average of about 10 prosecutions annually. Clearly, \ncurrent Federal law is inadequate in resolving the many challenges our \nbusinesses face in today's innovation economy.\n  State laws have proven inadequate to protect victims of trade secret \ntheft. Since most businesses today operate across one or more State \nlines, having a uniform set of standards that defines legal protections \nfor trade secrets is crucial. That was the rationale behind creating \nthe Uniform Trade Secrets Act, which sought to achieve nationwide \nuniformity in trade secret law. But over time, most States have adopted \ntheir own trade secret laws. In fact, State laws today are perhaps even \nmore variable in their treatment of trade secrets than they were at the \ntime the Uniform Trade Secrets Act was proposed in 1979. This next \nmixed bag of differing legal regimes forces victims of trade secret \ntheft to wade through a quagmire of procedural hurdles in order to \nrecover their losses.\n  For example, if an attorney needs testimony from a witness in another \nState, she must first apply to her local court, asking that it request \nthe other State to issue its own subpoena for the document or \ndeposition. This process can take weeks, which is an eternity in a \ntrade secret case. Under a uniform Federal standard, the process would \nbe far more efficient. That is because all Federal courts apply the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, allowing attorneys to obtain \ndocuments and testimony from a witness in another State without having \nto apply to that State's court system. Essentially, enabling businesses \nto protect their trade secrets in Federal court removes an unnecessary \nand time-consuming layer of bureaucracy.\n  Streamlining access to remedies is critical in trade secret cases \nwhere an expedited judicial process may be necessary to deal with \nthieves who pose a flight risk. Unfortunately, once a company's \nintellectual property is leaked and the information is made public, the \ntrade secret loses its legal protection.\n  Put simply, State law is designed for intrastate litigation and \noffers limited practical recourse to victims of interstate trade secret \ntheft--the contrast between intrastate and interstate. Maintaining the \nstatus quo is woefully insufficient to safeguard against \nmisappropriation. U.S. companies must be able to protect their trade \nsecrets in Federal court.\n  The Defend Trade Secrets Act will do precisely that by providing \ntrade secret owners access to both a uniform national law and the \nability to make their case in Federal courts. Likewise, the bill allows \nvictims of trade secret theft to obtain a seizure order in \nextraordinary circumstances. This type of order would allow \nmisappropriated property to be seized so that it isn't abused during \nthe pendency of litigation. To ensure that companies do not use the \nseizure authority for anti-competitive purposes, this legislation \nrequires those seeking redress to make a rigorous showing that they own \nthe trade secret, that the trade secret was stolen, and that third \nparties would not be harmed if an ex parte order were granted. The bill \nalso allows for employees to move from one job to another without fear \nof being wrongfully charged with trade secret theft.\n  In addition to the overwhelming bipartisan support among my Senate \ncolleagues, more than 50 companies and associations have endorsed the \nDefend Trade Secrets Act. Leaders in the technology, life sciences, \nmanufacturing, energy, automotive, agricultural, and telecommunications \nsectors support this bill, among others.\n  Many letters and opinion pieces have been written in support of the \nbill. Let me briefly share some of the comments from our Nation's \nbusiness leaders.\n  In an op-ed published in The Hill, Aric Newhouse from the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers states, ``The [Defend Trade Secrets Act] \nencourages investment in cutting-edge research and development and will \nhave an immediate, positive impact on our innovative sector, ultimately \ncreating jobs and opportunity in manufacturing in the United States.''\n  In a piece published by the Washington Times, David Hirschmann from \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce writes, ``The Defend Trade Secrets Act \ncreates a federal civil cause of action that currently does not exist. \nCreating a new federal civil cause of action will help industry help \nitself.''\n  In an op-ed in the Washington Examiner, Mark Lauroesch from the \nIntellectual Property Owners Association writes, ``Every day without \nthis law, our companies are losing millions of dollars to trade secret \ntheft.''\n  Victoria Espinel from the BSA Software Alliance writes in the \nHuffington Post, ``The Defend Trade Secrets Act would provide that \nimportant, missing remedy, and help usher in the harmonized system that \nwill benefit not only software innovation but our entire American \neconomy.''\n  Guy Blalock from Utah's IM Flash writes in the Salt Lake Tribune, \n``Enacting the bill will have an immediate, positive impact on \ninnovative companies that create jobs in this country.''\n  In a joint op-ed published in the Salt Lake Tribune, Rich Nelson from \nthe Utah Technology Council and Lane Beattie from the Salt Lake Chamber \nof Commerce write that the Defend Trade Secrets Act ``equips business \nowners with the tools they need to combat trade secret theft.''\n  Finally, Eli Lilly's Michael Harrington and Microsoft's Erich \nAndersen in an op-ed published in Forbes write, ``This thoughtful and \ncarefully considered legislation will adapt America's trade secret \nregime to reflect 21st Century realities and will strengthen this \ncritical form of intellectual property.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe op-eds from which I have quoted following my remarks.\n  Throughout my 40 years of service, I have been a part of almost every \nsignificant intellectual property initiative that has come before the \nSenate--from the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which sought to \nstreamline our copyright system for the digital era, to the America \nInvents Act, which overhauled our patent system to help ensure American \ninnovators' property rights are adequately protected in the 21st \ncentury.\n  Legislating in the area of intellectual property requires patience \nand perseverance. The bill on which we are voting tonight has been 2 \nyears in the making. Initially, providing a Federal standard and civil \nremedies for trade secrets had little support. It took much effort not \nonly to identify the precise nature of the problem--a problem that\n\n[[Page S1628]]\n\namounts to hundreds of billions of dollars in economic loss for U.S. \ncompanies annually--but also to develop a solution that could garner \nthe support of virtually all stakeholders. This required soliciting \ninput from a broad range of interests and working closely with dozens \nof trade associations, affected businesses, and policymakers on both \nsides of the aisle. The final version of the legislation that the \nSenate will pass later this evening reflects input and additions from a \nbroad coalition of interested parties.\n  It also reflects a number of instances where a careful balance had to \nbe struck between competing interests. As has been true of several \nrecent intellectual property efforts, the interests of the technology \nsector and the pharmaceutical industry are not always aligned. The same \nwas true when it came to trade secrets. Yet we worked hard to develop a \nsolution that could meet the needs of both. This balance is perhaps \nbest exemplified by the joint op-ed I mentioned a moment ago, \ncoauthored by the general counsel of one of America's leading \npharmaceutical companies and a senior executive from one of America's \nprominent tech companies.\n  As chairman of the Senate Republican High-Tech Task Force and \ncoauthor of the Hatch-Waxman Act, I know how critical it is to strike \nthe right balance such that both high-tech and life science industries \ncan support a bill. We have struck that balance with the Defend Trade \nSecrets Act.\n  Not only will we succeed in defending the trade secrets of American \nbusinesses, I hope the passage of the bill will serve as a springboard \nto spur congressional action in other areas of intellectual property, \nincluding patent litigation reforms. I commend in particular House \nJudiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte for his steadfast work in \nthis regard, and I stand ready to do everything in my power to help him \nin this endeavor.\n  Tonight's passage of fundamental trade secret law reform would be a \nsignificant achievement at any time, let alone in the challenging \npartisan environment we face today. Indeed, today's Senate vote is not \nonly a watershed moment for the intellectual property and business \ncommunities; it is also an example of what Congress can accomplish when \nwe put our party politics aside and focus on areas of agreement. \nThroughout my Senate service, I have always sought, whenever possible, \nto seek common ground in order to advance public policy priorities that \nwill benefit the American people and the American economy. With this \nbill, we have done just that.\n  I want to thank Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for leading \nthe Senate in such a way to make constructive bipartisan legislating \npossible. I appreciate his support for this legislation and his \nwillingness to devote valuable floor time to help ensure its passage. \nTonight we will add the Defend Trade Secrets Act to a long list of \nlegislation the Senate has passed in the last 15 months since the \nsenior Senator from Kentucky assumed leadership of the U.S. Senate. \nThis is yet another example that the Senate is back to work for the \nAmerican people.\n  I also want to take this moment to thank the staff members who have \nbeen instrumental in getting us to this point. Let me start by thanking \nmy senior judiciary counsel, Matt Sandgren, whose relentless \ndetermination helped make tonight a reality. I also thank my chief of \nstaff, Rob Porter, for his unmatchable leadership in shepherding this \nbill forward. Together, Matt and Rob have been an invincible team, \nworking hand in glove throughout this process. I personally appreciate \ntheir excellent work.\n\n  I also recognize my superb press team for their efforts, J.P. Freire, \nMatt Whitlock, and Sam Lyman. I am also appreciative of my dedicated \nlaw clerks, Ryan Karr and Jaclyn D'Esposito.\n  I also acknowledge the important contributions of Senator Coons' \ncurrent and former staff: Ted Schroeder, Andrew Crawford, Erica Songer, \nand Jonathan Stahler.\n  There are also several staff on the Senate Judiciary Committee who \nhave been instrumental in helping with this key intellectual property \nbill: Rita Lari Jochum, Jonathan Nabavi, Alexandra Givens, Danielle \nCutrona, Eric Haren, Lee Holmes, Lartease Tiffith, Gary Barnett, Daniel \nSwanson, Ray Starling, Ethan Arenson, Chad Rhoades, and Sam Simon.\n  I also acknowledge the following House staff for their hard work and \ncommitment to this bill: Shelley Husband, Branden Ritchie, Jennifer \nChoudhry, Sally Larson, Jason Everett, and David Greengrass.\n  Finally, I thank the many staff members from majority leader Mitch \nMcConnell and minority leader Harry Reid who helped to make this bill's \npassage a reality. I wish to especially thank Laura Dove, Sharon \nSoderstrom, Hazen Marshall, John Abegg, Chris Tuck, and Ayesha Khanna.\n  Enacting meaningful public policy reform in the midst of a \ncontentious Presidential election is something to celebrate. In very \nreal ways, this bill will help strengthen our economy and allow \nbusinesses to grow and create additional jobs for hard-working \nAmericans. I hope my colleagues will join me in safeguarding American \ningenuity by voting for the Defend Trade Secrets Act. They will not be \nsorry by doing that.\n  I understand Senator Coons is here, and I want to recognize him and \nall the work he has done with me on this bill. He is a wonderful \npartner on the Judiciary Committee, and I personally appreciate him \nvery much.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From The Hill, Mar. 10, 2016]\n\n US Manufacturers to Congress: Keep Us Competitive, Pass Trade Secrets \n                              Legislation\n\n                           (By Aric Newhouse)\n\n       Trade secrets, an essential form of intellectual property, \n     are among the most valued business assets for manufacturers. \n     They can include everything from the special recipe for a \n     food or beverage to the formula for a chemical or \n     pharmaceutical. This proprietary information powers the \n     innovation on a shop floor, which drives job creation at \n     facilities in communities across our country.\n       Trade secrets can comprise as much as 80 percent of the \n     value of a company's knowledge portfolio, and according to \n     one estimate, theft costs businesses in this country some \n     $250 billion a year. The current system desperately needs to \n     be updated to provide the owners of trade secrets the ability \n     to pursue intellectual property thieves aggressively and \n     efficiently, in full cooperation with the federal government.\n       While patent, copyright and trademark owners can protect \n     their rights in federal court, trade secret owners must \n     instead rely on an array of state law remedies that were \n     designed with small-scale, intrastate theft in mind. Although \n     those laws may be sufficient and appropriate when, for \n     example, an employee takes a former employer's customer list \n     to a competitor down the street, they are ill-suited for the \n     fast-moving, multijurisdictional cases in today's global \n     economy.\n       Fortunately, there is important, bipartisan legislation \n     that would fill this gap and assist manufacturers in pursuing \n     trade secret thieves and protecting intellectual property. \n     The Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 (DTSA)--a bipartisan, \n     bicameral bill led by Sens. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Chris \n     Coons (D-Del.) and Reps. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) and Jerrold \n     Nadler (D-N.Y.)--creates a federal civil cause of action for \n     trade secret misappropriation to unify trade secrets law \n     nationwide. The bill would also offer trade secrets owners \n     the same legal options as owners of other forms of \n     intellectual property.\n       The National Association of Manufacturers has long \n     supported a federal civil remedy for trade secret theft and \n     urges passage of DTSA. The consensus-oriented approach of the \n     legislation has drawn strong support from all industry groups \n     and manufacturing subsectors, including biotech, \n     pharmaceutical, medical device, automotive, agriculture and \n     beyond.\n       Trade secrets are vital to the competitiveness of companies \n     throughout our economy, and the threat to these innovations \n     is becoming more serious and more complex. By creating a \n     strong, uniform body of trade secrets law nationwide, the \n     DTSA ensures that our laws keep pace.\n       Congress should move quickly to pass this important \n     legislation because strong trade secrets protection is \n     critical to the American economy and to manufacturers' \n     competitive advantage in the global economy. The DTSA \n     encourages investment in cutting-edge research and \n     development and will have an immediate, positive impact on \n     our innovative sector, ultimately creating jobs and \n     opportunity in manufacturing in the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Mar. 17, 2016]\n\n               Protecting American Intellectual Property\n\n                         (By David Hirschmann)\n\n       American innovation has brought consumers across the globe \n     many of the cutting edge products and technologies that have, \n     quite literally, changed the world. From life-saving \n     medicines to computer software to incredibly efficient ways \n     to generate energy,\n\n[[Page S1629]]\n\n     American companies are at the forefront of the ``innovation \n     economy'' and the creators of millions of domestic jobs.\n       But our position as a global leader in innovation is under \n     attack. Individuals, organizations and even some countries, \n     want to take shortcuts and gain a competitive edge by \n     stealing our ideas and manufacturing know-how--the ``secret-\n     sauce'' that separates American industry from those who seek \n     to duplicate our success. This theft of America's trade \n     secrets is a growing--and increasingly alarming--threat to \n     our economic security.\n       What separates a Coca-Cola from a store-brand counterpart \n     is its secret formula, and Kentucky Fried Chicken relies on \n     its unique blend of 11 herbs and spices to distinguish itself \n     in the market. Both are examples of trade secrets.\n       But trade secrets are also used to designate propriety \n     manufacturing processes or highly technical algorithms for \n     biologic formulas that may one day be eligible for patent \n     protections. This form of intellectual property (IP) \n     encompasses a wide range of information and processes across \n     virtually every industry sector and among companies large and \n     small.\n       Trade secrets are often the crown-jewels of a small, \n     innovative start-up that has neither the expertise nor budget \n     to seek patent protection because their limited capital is \n     spent developing the next big idea and putting people to work \n     building the next must-have product.\n       The Defend Trade Secrets Act currently under consideration \n     in Congress would give American companies another tool to \n     fight trade secrets theft.\n       This is a rare piece of legislation with broad and diverse \n     support. Introduced by Sens. Orrin Hatch, Utah Republican and \n     Chris Coons, Delaware Democrat, and Reps. Chris Collins, New \n     York Republican and Jerrold Nadler, New York Democrat this is \n     a truly bipartisan and bicameral bill. Currently, the bill \n     enjoys the support of 62 senators and 127 representatives, \n     along with thousands of companies, industry associations, and \n     think tanks.\n       As well stated by White House Intellectual Property \n     Enforcement Coordinator Daniel Marti, ``Trade secret theft is \n     a serious and pervasive problem that threatens the economic \n     health and competitiveness of this country. The \n     Administration is committed to protecting the innovation \n     which drives the American economy and supports American \n     jobs.''\n       Examples include foreign nationals digging new hybrid seeds \n     out of cornfields in the heartland, embedded employees \n     walking out the door with proprietary manufacturing \n     processes, and hackers downloading secret research data. Once \n     in possession of the trade secret, criminals want to get out \n     of Dodge fast, and will typically flee the country to peddle \n     these precious corporate assets to the highest bidder. To \n     stop such theft, companies must be able to act quickly and \n     effectively.\n       Unfortunately, current remedies alone are not enough to \n     prevent the flight of these thieves. While law enforcement is \n     a willing partner and often very helpful, too often they lack \n     the bandwidth or resources to act quickly enough and stop \n     these criminals before it's too late.\n       Currently, a patchwork of state laws and federal criminal \n     penalties are available to companies or individuals \n     confronted with trade secrets theft. The Defend Trade Secrets \n     Act creates a federal civil cause of action that currently \n     does not exist.\n       Creating a new federal civil cause of action will help \n     industry help itself. The bill has many provisions to make \n     sure that this new federal cause of action is not abused and \n     employees are protected--including whistleblowers.\n       In an increasingly competitive global marketplace, it is \n     critical that the right tools are in place to ensure that \n     American ideas and jobs are not stolen and sold overseas. The \n     U.S. Chamber of Commerce urges Congress to move this much \n     needed legislation quickly so that it may become law and our \n     industry and workers can remain at the forefront of the \n     innovation economy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      [From Forbes, Apr. 4, 2016]\n\n    We Need To Safeguard the Secrets of America's Innovation Economy\n\n               (By Michael Harrington and Erich Andersen)\n\n       America has long been recognized as a world leader in \n     innovation. Not only does the unending flow of new inventions \n     make life better for consumers, it also helps create new jobs \n     and opportunities for millions of American families. The \n     ``intellectual property'' associated with American innovation \n     is protected by a network of laws, including patents, \n     copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets. These legal \n     protections are essential to reward innovation and encourage \n     continued investment in American research and development. \n     Unfortunately, trade secrets are the only form of \n     intellectual property that do not receive robust federal \n     protection. This needs to change.\n       Trade secrets include secret formulas, customer lists and \n     methods of manufacturing developed at great expense and that \n     have significant value to companies, which take steps to \n     ensure their confidentiality. American businesses, regardless \n     of size, must be able to continue to invest the enormous \n     resources required to develop the products of the future, \n     from the latest in cloud computing and artificial \n     intelligence to the next generation of life-saving medicines. \n     The Defend Trade Secrets Act, bipartisan legislation pending \n     before the Senate and House, would provide 21st century \n     protection for America's trade secrets. It has the strong \n     support of our companies and scores of others representing a \n     diverse cross section of industries.\n       In the digitally networked world, the need for robust trade \n     secret protection has only increased. Businesses no longer \n     compete against the company across the street--they sell \n     products across the country and around the world. Gone are \n     the days when a business kept its know-how on paper--its \n     business plans, its manufacturing process, the secret sauce \n     that gave the business a competitive edge--and locked it in a \n     desk drawer or a safe. Today, companies store their data and \n     business-critical information electronically, primarily in \n     the cloud. Decentralization has allowed companies to rely on \n     networks of manufacturers and service providers who must all \n     be able to access, use and store this trade secret \n     information. The ability to share secrets confidentially with \n     such providers, with the knowledge they can be protected, is \n     vital to the continuing growth of the American economy. While \n     digitalization of information has facilitated the access to \n     trade secrets essential to the conduct of business, it has \n     also enabled anyone intent on doing harm to purloin vast \n     amounts of information with no more than a computer key \n     stroke to a thumb drive or the cloud.\n       Trade secrets are also unique among forms of intellectual \n     property in how they are legally protected. They are governed \n     under state law rather than by federal statute. That is, \n     although it is a federal crime to steal a trade secret, a \n     business that has its trade secrets stolen must rely on state \n     law to pursue a civil remedy. Owners of copyrights, patents, \n     and trademarks can go to federal court to protect their \n     property and seek damages when their property has been \n     infringed, but trade secret owners do not have access to such \n     a federal remedy. This can prove unwieldy and ineffective \n     when the trade secret thief crosses state lines--and all too \n     often these thieves are ultimately heading overseas so that \n     the unscrupulous can unfairly exploit and profit from the \n     fruits of American know how in the global economy. This can \n     result in significant loss of American prosperity and jobs.\n       Our state-by-state system for trade secret protection was \n     simply not built with the digital world in mind where one \n     device containing purloined information can literally destroy \n     a hard-earned competitive edge. In today's global economy, \n     however, trade secrets are increasingly stored and used \n     across state line and even national borders. A uniform, \n     national standard for protection will greatly benefit \n     innovative enterprises of all sizes.\n       We commend Senators Orrin Hatch and Christopher Coons and \n     Representatives Doug Collins and Jerrold Nadler for \n     introducing the bipartisan Defend Trade Secrets Act. This \n     thoughtful and carefully considered legislation will adapt \n     America's trade secret regime to reflect 21st Century \n     realities and will strengthen this critical form of \n     intellectual property. We urge favorable and expeditious \n     consideration by both the Senate and House.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I begin my remarks by thanking my \ncolleague, good friend, and the leader in this effort to pass the \nDefend Trade Secrets Act in the Senate today, the President pro tem of \nthe Senate, Senator Orrin Hatch. In his four decades of service in this \nbody, Senator Hatch has become well known for his ability and \nwillingness to work across the aisle, to be a genuine leader in \nintellectual property matters, and to fight tirelessly for America's \ninventors and inventions. I am grateful for the small role I have been \nable to play in partnering with Senator Hatch to bring this important \npiece of legislation through the Judiciary Committee and to the floor \ntoday.\n  Our country has long been the unquestioned world leader in the \ncreation and production of innovative ideas. Simply put, for over two \ncenturies we understood the critical connection between preserving \nintellectual property rights and creating sustained economic growth. As \na result, we are second to none when it comes to innovation. Yet a \ncritical form of IP, intellectual property, has somehow slipped through \nthe cracks of Federal protection. Of course, I am talking about trade \nsecrets, such as the secret formula for Coca-Cola, Kentucky Fried \nChicken, customer lists, pricing strategies, and key stages in a vital \nmanufacturing process. They are the lifeblood of great companies that \ncan lead to the creation of products that make a company unique and \nuniquely profitable. It should come as no surprise that they are a \nmajor contributor to our economy. By some estimates, trade secrets are \nworth $5 trillion to publicly listed American companies alone.\n  Despite the importance of trade secrets to our economy and our \ninnovation ecosystem, trade secrets remain\n\n[[Page S1630]]\n\nthe only form of intellectual property not protected from theft under \nFederal civil law. More specifically, a misuse of trade secrets doesn't \nprovide the owner with a Federal private right of action to seek \nredress. This means companies today have to rely on State courts or on \nFederal prosecutors to protect their rights. The multi-State procedural \nand jurisdictional issues and the hurdles you have to clear that arise \nin such cases are oftentimes intensive, costly, and complicated.\n  Meanwhile, the Department of Justice, currently empowered to protect \ntrade secrets on the Federal level, lacks the resources to prosecute \nmany of the cases that arise. By the time the existing protections \ncatch up with bad actors who have taken off with a customer list, \nformula, or recipe, it is often too late. Unlike physical goods, you \nsimply can't take back trade secrets once they have been shared with \nthe public. Once a trade secret is no longer secret, it loses its legal \nprotection.\n  This glaring oversight in our Federal legal system has become \nincreasingly problematic in recent years as technology has made it \neasier and easier to steal trade secrets. Today a foreign competitor \ncan steal a vital trade secret from an American manufacturer with just \na few key strokes through a cyber attack. This hasn't gone unnoticed. \nThe rate of cyber trade secret theft is at an alltime high, and our \nforeign competitors are stealing American innovation with woefully \ninadequate repercussions. This uptick and steady rise in trade secret \ntheft is affecting American businesses large and small across our \ncountry. Today the misappropriation of trade secrets is estimated to \ncost American companies between $160 and $480 billion annually. That \nmoney would be so much better spent by investing in new products, \ngrowing businesses, and creating jobs.\n  For example, my home State of Delaware has felt the impact of trade \nsecret theft. Many are familiar with DuPont's signature product Kevlar, \nan extraordinarily strong and lightweight synthetic fiber that is best \nknown for its use in lifesaving body armor. It is worn by dedicated \npolice officers and the brave men and women in our Armed Forces. It has \nliterally saved thousands of lives, including more than 3,000 law \nenforcement officers across this country.\n  About 10 years ago, DuPont developed a next generation of Kevlar, \nwhich was even lighter and better able to withstand penetrating trauma \nfrom a wide range of rifle rounds or IED-generated shrapnel. This \ntechnology represented a real breakthrough in safety, but it cost \nmillions upon millions to develop. You see, chemically the spun \npolyaromatic fibers that make up Kevlar are not that complicated, but \nthe fabrication and production method that give the fiber strength and \nflexibility is incredibly difficult to develop and then execute.\n  One day about 6 years ago--just 4 years after DuPont had developed \nthis next-generation protective technology--a rogue employee took the \ntrade secrets and the know-how behind manufacturing this new product \nand went and gave it to a rival manufacturing company in Korea by using \nDuPont's trade secrets. The potential loss to DuPont from this one \ninstance of trade secret theft cost roughly $1 billion.\n  Not only does trade secret theft cost American businesses revenue, \nwhich puts American jobs at risk, but it also discourages businesses \nfrom investing in critical research and development, and of all the \nsectors in the American economy, trade secrets are most central for \nmanufacturing and for manufacturing in advanced materials. If you know \nan employee can steal your company's trade secret, potentially \nresulting in a loss of up to $1 billion, that trade secret that was the \nproduct of years of research and development, as was the case for \nDuPont with their next-generation Kevlar, it becomes harder and harder \nto justify investing substantial sums in the R needed to continue to \nproduce technological breakthroughs and cutting-edge manufacturing in \nthe United States.\n  This trade secret theft can have a devastating, long-term impact on \nour country's ability to innovate and compete. It is also of particular \nconcern in my home State of Delaware, where R is critical to our \neconomy and sustaining our manufacturing sector. These protections in \ntoday's Defend Trade Secrets Act will only grow in importance as our \ncountry continues to cultivate advanced manufacturing.\n  Delaware has a proud legacy of encouraging cutting-edge science. We \nare home to hundreds of basement inventors who have tinkered, designed, \nand perfected inventions. Some have become well known internationally, \nsuch as Kevlar, and others are not as well known but are critical to \nour economy. That is why I introduced, along with my friend and senior \ncolleague Senator Hatch, the Defend Trade Secrets Act. This bill \ncreates a new Federal private right of action for the misappropriation \nof trade secrets. It uses an existing Federal criminal law, the \nEconomic Espionage Act, to define trade secrets, and it draws heavily \nfrom the existing Uniform Trade Secrets Act which has been enacted by \nmany States to define misappropriation.\n  Simply put, our bill will harmonize U.S. law. Each State has a \nslightly different trade secret law, and they vary in many different \nways. Not all of these differences are major, but they affect the \ndefinition of what a trade secret is or what an owner must do to keep a \nsecret or what constitutes misappropriation or what damages and \nremedies are available.\n  Our Defend Trade Secrets Act creates a single national baseline, or a \nminimal level of protection, and gives trade secret owners access to \nboth a uniform national law and to the reach of Federal courts, which \nprovide nationwide service of process and execution of judgments. \nHowever, it is important to know this bill does not preempt State law \nbecause States are, of course, free to continue to add further \nprotections.\n  In my view, this bill is a commonsense solution to a very serious \nproblem. Senator Hatch and I first introduced this bill in April of \n2014, and we reintroduced it last July with just four original \ncosponsors. The bill before us today now has 65 bipartisan cosponsors \nin the Senate. An identical version in the House, introduced by Doug \nCollins of Georgia and Jerry Nadler of New York, now has 128 \ncosponsors. Congressmen Collins and Nadler have been great partners in \nthis effort. Congressman John Conyers has also provided invaluable \nsupport.\n  In addition to the broad bipartisan support we have collected on this \nbill from our colleagues, we have gained endorsements from dozens and \ndozens of companies as diverse as Boeing, Corning, Microsoft, and \nDuPont. I believe it is also a testament to the hard work and esteem in \nwhich Senator Hatch is held by his colleagues. Senator Hatch has long \nbeen a leader in intellectual property and has been able to lead a \nsuccessful, open, and collaborative process that has allowed us to move \nthe bill to this point today.\n  Many of our colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, had suggestions \nfor ways to improve the original draft. I am proud many of the Senators \nwho originally raised concerns or questions have now become cosponsors \nof the bill as a result of Senator Hatch's leadership and our \ncollaboration.\n  In today's political climate, it is easy to forget that to get things \ndone, we don't have to agree on everything, we just have to agree on \none thing. In this case, we have all agreed that losing hundreds of \nbillions of dollars annually to trade secret theft and misappropriation \nhas been hurting American businesses and our economy.\n  This bill is truly bipartisan. Frankly, it has united industry, \npractitioners, and Members of this body in a way we don't see often \nenough today. I rarely have an opportunity to work closely with the \nHeritage Foundation, the National Association of Manufacturers, and \nintellectual property owners on the same bill, but good policy can make \nfor unique partnerships. With the bill before us today, the good policy \nis a commonsense proposal that creates a clear national standard and \nfacilitates businesses' protection of their trade secrets in Federal \ncourt.\n  I thank all of my colleagues who have cosponsored and supported this \nbill. It has been a pleasure to work with them as we worked to ensure \nthat this final bill is bipartisan and achieves our goal of protecting \nAmerican trade secrets.\n  The formula for how we, together, got to this point is simple. \nSenator Hatch and I saw a problem, we found a\n\n[[Page S1631]]\n\ncoalition that wanted to fix it, and we came together to find a \nsolution.\n  I thank former Senator Kohl, with whom I first discussed this issue \nwhen I came to the Senate. I thank him for his early interest and \ninvolvement in trade secret protections. Of course, I am particularly \ngrateful to Senator Hatch for his championship of this bill and \nleadership in finding consensus. I wish to join him in thanking \nChairman Grassley and Ranking Member Leahy for their critical support \nand commend my colleagues for their focus on this issue. I wish to \nspecifically thank Senators Whitehouse, Feinstein, Graham, and Flake \nfor their contributions to this bill that has strengthened it.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't recognize and thank the tremendous \nefforts our staff contributed together to get this bill to where it is \ntoday. Senator Hatch has thanked many of the floor staff, leadership \nstaff, and staff in the House, and I would like to add to my thanks to \nMatt Sandgren in Senator Hatch's office and to my tireless, dedicated, \nand recently departed from my office chief counsel, Ted Schroeder, as \nwell as Jonathan Stahler, Andrew Crawford, and Erica Songer on my \nstaff.\n  This major achievement is the product of many contributions, and that \nis how the Senate is supposed to work. Given the wide support this bill \nenjoys today in the Senate and the fact that there is already an \nidentical House version with bipartisan support, I am hopeful the House \nwill act and pass this bill without delay.\n  I was pleased to learn earlier today that the administration has \nissued a Statement of Administration Policy urging the passage of this \nbill and its rapid enactment into law. The sooner this bill becomes \nlaw, the sooner American businesses and companies can get back to \ncreating jobs and producing new, life-changing products and services. \nOur country's legacy of innovation depends on it.\n  With that, I yield the floor and thank my colleague Senator Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                Remembering Justin and Stephanie Shults\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise to honor the lives of Tennessean \nJustin Shults and his wife Stephanie, who were killed in the attacks in \nBrussels, Belgium, on the morning of March 22.\n  I thank our senior Senator Lamar Alexander for joining me this \nafternoon.\n  We are heartbroken by this tragedy, which once again hit too close to \nhome. Not long ago, Senator Alexander and I came to this body to mourn \nthe loss of five American heroes we lost in a terror attack in my \nhometown of Chattanooga. We are here again today, heartbroken that two \nmore outstanding individuals were taken by evil, and we are reminded \nthat terrorism knows no borders or boundaries.\n  Justin Shults was a native of Gatlinburg, TN. He attended Gatlinburg-\nPittman High School, where he was valedictorian of his class. A bright \nyoung man, Justin received an undergraduate degree from Vanderbilt \nUniversity before attending Vanderbilt's Owen Graduate School of \nManagement where he met Stephanie, a native of Lexington, KY.\n\n  Justin and Stephanie's journey is inspiring. Two young people from \nsmall towns, they set out on a journey to explore the world and to \nbroaden their horizons.\n  They moved to Brussels in 2014. Justin worked for Clarcor, a \nFranklin, TN, manufacturing company, and Stephanie worked for Mars. \nThey had a bright future ahead of them--a future that was stolen by \nterror.\n  To their family members and to all who loved them, we offer our \nprayers and deepest sympathies as we mourn their passing. We also \nextend condolences to all of the families who lost loved ones and to \nthe people of Belgium.\n  I also thank the many individuals and organizations that were \ninstrumental in helping Justin's and Stephanie's families in the \naftermath of the attack. They include the State Department, the FBI, \nthe consulate in Brussels, Delta Airlines, Justin's and Stephanie's \ncompanies, Clarcor and Mars, and members of my staff, especially Bess \nMcWherter.\n  From Chattanooga to Paris, San Bernardino, Brussels, and beyond, we \nhave seen unimaginable events unfold before our eyes. It is clear the \nfight against evil will be a long-term struggle. To protect our \ncitizens, we must deepen our partnership with Europe and other allies \nto defeat ISIS and other terrorists so no more families will have to \ndeal with the heartbreak Justin's and Stephanie's families face today.\n  We mourn their passing, we honor their lives, and we renew our \ncommitment to fight against this evil.\n  With that, I yield the floor to our distinguished senior Senator \nLamar Alexander.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I join Senator Corker in expressing to \nthe families of Justin and Stephanie our deepest sympathy and our \nhorror at what happened to them in Brussels.\n  I wish to thank Senator Corker as well. Because of his position as \nchairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he was able to do \nsome things all of us would have liked to have been able to do. He was \nable to help the family by being a liaison with the families and the \nState Department. These are things he wouldn't say about himself, but I \nwould like to say. He and his staff worked to help the family get \nexpedited passports, and they have stayed in touch with the families. I \nhope the families of Justin and Stephanie will know that when Senator \nCorker and his staff are in touch with them, that they are in touch \nwith them for all of us in the U.S. Senate and all of us as citizens of \nthe State of Tennessee.\n  There is so much on television today that is horrible and violent and \nterroristic that we have become immune to it. It is almost an \nunreality. We don't want to believe any of it is true, until it hits \nhome in Gatlinburg, TN, and happens to a bright young man whom everyone \nin the community seems to have known, one of those young men whom \neverybody looks at and says he is going to amount to something, we are \ngoing to watch him one day, and to a young woman from Lexington, KY, \nwho met this young man at Vanderbilt's graduate school of management, \nnot just in Sevier County, TN, and not just in Lexington, where so many \npeople knew these two promising young Americans, but also in Nashville \nand the Vanderbilt community.\n  This is actually the third promising young life taken from the \nVanderbilt school family. Taylor Force, a student there, was killed on \na class visit to Israel a few weeks ago. At any time that is a \nhorrifying, terrible thought, but this is a generation of young \nAmericans who have grown up with the idea of living in the whole world, \nof making a contribution to the entire world. That is what Justin and \nStephanie were doing when they went to Brussels with their companies, \nand now their lives are cut short by an evil act.\n  Our hearts go out to their families and to the communities from which \nthey come in Gatlinburg, in Lexington, and in the Nashville Vanderbilt \nOwen school community. My personal thanks to Senator Corker for doing \nwhat all of us want to do as well as we can, which is to be helpful to \nthe families and express to them our appreciation for the lives of \ntheir children and our sorrow at what has happened to them.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/04/senate-section/article/S1631-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) trade secret theft occurs in the United States and \n     around the world;\n       (2) trade secret theft, wherever it occurs, harms the \n     companies that own the trade secrets and the employees of the \n     companies;\n       (3) chapter 90 of title 18, United States Code (commonly \n     known as the ``Economic Espionage Act of 1996''), applies \n     broadly to protect trade secrets from theft; and\n       (4) it is important when seizing information to balance the \n     need to prevent or remedy misappropriation with the need to \n     avoid interrupting the--\n       (A) business of third parties; and\n       (B) legitimate interests of the party accused of \n     wrongdoing.\n\n     SEC. 6.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I made long remarks earlier this afternoon, \nalong with my colleague and friend Senator Hatch.\n  I want to briefly reiterate my thanks to the many staff who worked \ntirelessly to make it possible for the Defense Trade Secrets Act to \nmove forward today. I greatly appreciate the leadership and hard work \nof the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senators \nGrassley and Leahy, for their hard work and their staffs' work.\n  I want to personally thank Ted Schroeder, who was my chief counsel \nfor many years, for his terrific work on this bill and the dozens of \nstaffs here in the Senate and the House and outside groups who have \ncome together to make it possible for this strong bipartisan bill to \nmove forward today.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                       Ex Parte Seizure Provision\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as the Senate is prepared to vote on the \nDefend Trade Secrets Act, I rise today to enter into a colloquy with my \nlongtime friend and colleague from Utah, Senator Orrin Hatch.\n  Does the Senator agree that the ex parte seizure provision is a vital \nelement of the bill?\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague and longtime friend from Iowa, \nSenator Chuck Grassley, for the question.\n  Indeed, the Defend Trade Secrets Act provides a trade secret owner \nwith a right of action to go to court ex parte to have the trade secret \nseized and returned before the misappropriator can divulge it and cause \nit to lose its protection or before significant destruction of \nevidence.\n  The provision is tailored to prevent abuse--balancing the need to \nrecover a stolen trade secret with the rights of defendants and third \nparties.\n  We drafted the bill to require the party seeking ex parte review to \nmake a rigorous showing that they owned the secret, that it was stolen, \nand that third parties would not be harmed if an order were granted. We \nrequired a hearing at the earliest possible date. We also included \ndamages for wrongful seizure, including attorney's fees.\n  Could the Senator discuss the intent behind that language?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank Senator Hatch. The Defend Trade Secrets Act is \nthe product of bipartisan consensus, and as he will recall, before the \nbill was approved in the Senate Judiciary Committee, a modification \nadded language that ex parte seizures would be granted under \n``extraordinary circumstances.''\n  As I understand it, the ``extraordinary circumstances'' language was \nnot added to impose an additional requirement for obtaining an ex parte \nseizure, but to acknowledge the Judiciary's general disfavor of ex \nparte procedures and to reinforce that particular circumstances are \nrequired to utilize the seizure provisions but still provide a much \nneeded avenue for ex parte seizures when necessary.\n  The legislation specifically lists these requirements for issuing an \nex parte seizure order. For example, this authority is not available if \nan injunction under existing rules of civil procedure would be \nsufficient. The ex parte seizure provision is expected to be used in \ninstances in which a defendant is seeking to flee the country or \nplanning to disclose the trade secret to a third party immediately or \nis otherwise not amenable to the enforcement of the court's orders.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct. We expect the provision will be used in \ninstances such as when a trade secret misappropriator is seeking to \nflee the country or planning to disclose a trade secret immediately.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank Senator Hatch for his helpful insights.\n  Mr. President, today the Senate is poised to pass the Defend Trade \nSecrets Act of 2016, a bill that offers practical and necessary \nsolutions to a growing problem.\n  I have recently had the opportunity to speak about a number of \nbipartisan bills that have passed out of the Judiciary Committee and \nthat have been taken up here on the Senate floor. That is a testament \nto the fact that the Judiciary Committee is working hard through an \nopen process to find thoughtful solutions to the problems facing our \ncountry. In fact, we have processed 24 bills out of the Judiciary \nCommittee, all in a bipartisan fashion. Of these, 16 have passed the \nSenate and 6 have been signed into law by the President. While any \nMember of this body can tell you that it isn't always easy to find \nlegislative agreement, the American people deserve hardworking \nrepresentatives in Washington who strive to get things accomplished. \nAnd the record of the Judiciary Committee shows that we have chosen to \novercome gridlock and dysfunction to pass legislation that addresses \nproblems that American people face.\n  Here are a few examples of the Judiciary Committee's legislative \naccomplishments so far. Last month, the Senate overwhelmingly passed \nthe bipartisan Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, by a \nvote of 94-1. In the face of a growing and deadly epidemic of heroin \nand opioid painkillers, this bill addresses this crisis comprehensively \nsupporting prevention, education, treatment, recovery, and law \nenforcement.\n  In the past few weeks, the Senate also passed the FOIA Improvement\n\n[[Page S1635]]\n\nAct, a bill authored by Senators Cornyn and Leahy that I worked to move \nthrough the committee process. It codifies a presumption of openness \nfor government agencies to follow when they respond to requests for \ngovernment records via the Freedom of Information Act. In passing the \nFOIA Improvement Act--the Senate is helping change the culture in \ngovernment toward openness and transparency.\n  In February, the Judiciary Committee reported out the bipartisan \nJustice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act by a vote of 19-0. The bill, \nwhich has now been signed into law, holds sponsors of terrorism \naccountable by preventing them from invoking ``sovereign immunity'' in \ncases involving attacks within the United States. It also allows civil \nsuits to be filed against foreign entities that have aided or abetted \nterrorists.\n  The committee has worked to protect families and children by passing \nbills such as the Amy and Vicky Child Pornography Victim Restitution \nImprovement Act and the Adoptive Family Relief Act. The Amy and Vicky \nChild Pornography Victim Restitution Improvement Act reverses a Supreme \nCourt decision that limited the restitution that victims of child \npornography can seek from any single perpetrator, ensuring that victims \ncan be fully compensated for these heinous crimes, and can focus their \nattention on healing. The Adoptive Family Relief Act was signed into \nlaw in October of 2015, after passing the Judiciary Committee, and aims \nto help families facing challenges with international adoptions.\n  And once again today, we are set to approve another Judiciary \nCommittee bill that is supported by folks across the whole of the \npolitical spectrum. The support behind the Defend Trade Secrets Act \nmakes clear that the Senate and Judiciary Committee is working to find \nthoughtful solutions to problems facing our country. This bipartisan \nlegislation is authored by Senators Hatch and Coons. It brings needed \nuniformity to trade secret litigation so creators and owners of trade \nsecrets can more effectively address the growing problem of trade \nsecret theft.\n  It is estimated that the American economy loses 2.1 million jobs \nevery year because of trade secret theft. Further, according to a \nrecent report of the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual \nProperty, annual losses owing to trade secret theft are likely \ncomparable to the current annual level of U.S. exports to Asia--over \n$300 billion.\n  Back in Iowa we have seen this first-hand as innovative companies \nlike Monsanto and DuPont-Pioneer have become targets for trade secret \ntheft. In a well-publicized case, a naturalized citizen was indicted \nand convicted for engaging in a scheme with foreign nationals to steal \nproprietary test seeds from Iowa fields to benefit foreign companies.\n  Contrasted with other areas of intellectual property, trade secrets \nare mainly protected as a matter of state law. Forty-seven states have \nenacted some variation of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act. Yet as we have \nlearned through hearings in the Judiciary Committee and from companies \nwho have experienced trade secret theft, the increasing use of \ntechnology by criminals and their ability to quickly travel across \nstate lines, means at times these laws are inadequate. The existing \npatchwork of state laws has become a difficult procedural hurdle for \nvictims who must seek immediate relief before their valuable \nintellectual property is lost forever.\n  As the pace of trade secret theft has soared, the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation reports that their caseload for economic espionage and \ntrade secret theft cases has also increased more than 60% from 2009 to \n2013. The Defend Trade Secrets Act will create a uniform federal civil \ncause of action, without preempting state law, to provide clear rules \nand predictability for trade secret cases. Victims of trade secret \ntheft will now have another weapon in their arsenal to combat trade \nsecret theft, aside from criminal enforcement. This bill will provide \ncertainty of the rules, standards, and practices to stop trade secrets \nfrom being disseminated and losing their value, and will allow victims \nto move quickly to federal court to stop their trade secrets from being \ndisseminated. By improving trade secret protection, this bill will also \nhelp to incentivize future innovation.\n  Importantly, the Defend Trade Secrets Act codifies protections for \nwhistleblowers. An amendment that I authored with Ranking Member Leahy, \nwhich was included in Committee, would create express protections for \nwhistleblowers who disclose trade secrets confidentially to the \ngovernment to report a violation of the law. There is a longstanding \nand compelling public interest in safeguarding the ability of \nwhistleblowers to lawfully and appropriately disclose waste, fraud, and \nabuse that would otherwise never be brought to light. As chairman, and \none of the founding members of the Senate Whistleblower Protection \nCaucus, I've seen how whistleblowers help hold wrongdoers accountable \nand allow the government to recoup taxpayer money that might otherwise \nbe lost to fraud and other unlawful activities. The inclusion of this \nwhistleblower protection in the Defend Trade Secrets Act allows us to \nhelp make sure that those who are best in a position to report illegal \nconduct can come forward.\n  Passing legislation to help Americans deal with a growing problem \nlike trade secret theft in a bipartisan fashion is an important \naccomplishment. I am proud of the way the Judiciary Committee continues \nto get things done.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Under the previous order, the committee-reported substitute amendment \nis agreed to.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate voted today \non the Defend Trade Secrets Act. I am proud to be an original cosponsor \nof this legislation, which would create a Federal civil cause of action \nto help deter and remedy trade secret theft that is costing American \nbusinesses hundreds of billions of dollars each year.\n  Trade secrets, such as manufacturing processes, industrial \ntechniques, and customer lists, are critical assets for U.S. companies. \nHowever, American companies are increasingly being targeted by efforts \nto steal this proprietary information, often by overseas interests. \nCurrently, there is no Federal civil remedy available to companies to \nfight this theft, and the Justice Department does not have the \nresources to investigate and prosecute criminally all of the thefts \nthat are taking place. While most States have passed civil trade secret \nlaws, these laws are not well suited for remedying interstate or \nforeign trade secret theft. The lack of a Federal civil remedy for \ntrade secret misappropriation is a glaring gap in current law, \nespecially since Federal civil remedies are available to protect other \nforms of intellectual property such as patents, trademarks, and \ncopyrights.\n  The Defend Trade Secrets Act would close this gap by creating a civil \nright of action in Federal court for misappropriation of a trade secret \nthat is related to a product or service used in interstate or foreign \ncommerce. Available remedies would include injunctions, damages, and in \ncertain cases enhanced damages. This broadly bipartisan bill has been \ncarefully crafted to empower companies to protect their trade secrets \nthrough a process that will be both swift and fair. By helping American \ncompanies safeguard their essential trade secrets from theft, the bill \nwill help keep innovation and jobs in America.\n  The Defend Trade Secrets Act has been cosponsored by 65 Senators and \nis supported by groups and companies representing a broad swath of the \nAmerican economy, including numerous employers based in my home State \nof Illinois, such as Caterpillar and Illinois Tool Works. I am pleased \nthat the Senate is moving forward with passage of this legislation, and \nI hope the bill will soon pass the House of Representatives and be \nsigned into law.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. LEAHY. Today, the Senate voted on legislation that will \nprovide a valuable tool to protect against trade secret theft. This \nlegislation is supported by businesses from diverse sectors of our \neconomy, including companies large and small.\n  In Vermont, trade secrets protect the specialized knowledge of \nwoodworkers who have made heirloom products for generations, and \ncutting-edge start-ups that are shaping the future of plastics, \nsoftware, and green technology. Trade secrets protect the recipes for \nVermont craft brews and closely guarded customer lists for our top \ntourist services. Today's legislation provides an important tool to \nprotect these innovative businesses in Vermont and across the country.\n  The Defend Trade Secrets Act contains a bipartisan provision I \noffered with Senator Grassley to ensure that employers and other \nentities cannot bully whistleblowers or other litigants by threatening \nthem with a lawsuit for trade secret theft. The provision protects \ndisclosures made in confidence to law enforcement or an attorney for \nthe purpose of reporting a suspected violation of law and disclosures \nmade in the course of a lawsuit, provided that the disclosure is made \nunder seal. It requires employers to provide clear notice of this \nprotection in any nondisclosure agreements they ask individuals to \nsign. This commonsense public policy amendment is supported by the \nProject on Government Oversight and the Government Accountability \nProject and builds upon valuable scholarly work by Professor Peter \nMenell.\n  Good, thoughtful work was done in the Senate Judiciary Committee to \ncraft the bill we are voting on today, which builds on earlier versions \nintroduced in prior Congresses. It is a testament to how the Judiciary \nCommittee can and should operate when it functions with regular order. \nWe held a public hearing on the issue of trade secret theft in the \nSubcommittee on Crime and Terrorism during the 113th Congress and \nanother hearing in the full committee this past December. Senators \nsuggested improvements to the bill, they debated them, and they voted \non the legislation.\n  Unfortunately, the regular order and fair consideration that was \ngiven to this legislation is being denied for one of the Senate's most \nimportant and solemn responsibilities: considering the Supreme Court \nnomination pending in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Americans by a 2-\nto-1 margin want the Senate to move forward with a full and fair \nprocess for Chief Judge Garland. The Senate today is coming together to \npass trade secrets legislation, but that does nothing to absolve us \nfrom doing our jobs by considering the pending Supreme Court \nnominee.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to express my support for the \nDefend Trade Secrets Act and to explain some of the changes that were \nmade in the Judiciary Committee to ensure the bill does not adversely \nimpact California.\n  First, let me congratulate Senators Hatch and Coons on their work on \nthis bill.\n  This bill will help protect vital trade secrets of American companies \nby providing a Federal cause of action for the theft of trade secrets. \nIt will ensure there is access to Federal courts in these cases. During \nconsideration of the bill in the Judiciary Committee, some members, \nincluding me, voiced concern that the injunctive relief authorized \nunder the bill could override State law limitations that safeguard the \nability of an employee to move from one job to another. This is known \nas employee mobility. Some States, including California, have strong \npublic policies or laws in favor of employee mobility. These are \nreflected in some State court precedent or in laws that are on the \nbooks.\n  When this bill came before the Judiciary Committee, there was a \nserious concern that a Federal law without similar limits would \noverride the law in those States and create impairments on employees' \nability to move from job to job. If that were to happen, it could be a \nmajor limitation on employee mobility that does not exist today. To \nprevent this, the bill now includes language to preserve the law in \nCalifornia and elsewhere. Specifically, the bill bars an injunction \n``to prevent a person from entering into an employment relationship,'' \nperiod. In other words, relief under this bill cannot include an \ninjunction barring a person from starting a new job. As I understand \nit, this\n\n[[Page S1637]]\n\nreflects the practice under current law in California.\n  Secondly, any injunction that is issued cannot be based ``merely on \nthe information the person knows.'' This language makes clear that any \ninjunctive relief must be based on real evidence of a threat to the \ntrade secrets, not simply on the employee's knowledge.\n  Third, the bill also includes language to ensure that any injunction \nissued under the bill does not ``otherwise conflict with an applicable \nState law prohibiting restraints on the practice of a lawful \nprofession, trade, or business.''\n  This language will ensure that States are able to protect against the \nuse of this bill to create unlawful restraints on business practices \nwithin their States. In fact, California's strong public policy in \nfavor of employee mobility stems from such a law, which is located at \nsection 16600 in the State's business and professions code. This law \nstates: ``Except as provided in this chapter, every contract by which \nanyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or \nbusiness of any kind is to that extent void.''\n  As I said in the markup of this bill in the Judiciary Committee and \nas is noted in the Judiciary Committee's report, if a State's trade \nsecrets law authorizes additional remedies beyond what this bill \nauthorizes, those State law remedies will still be available.\n  I felt it was important to protect California, which has a vibrant \nand dynamic economy of almost 40 million people in so many sectors.\n  I am very grateful that Senators Hatch and Coons were willing to \naccommodate my concerns, and I am pleased to support this bill and to \ncosponsor it.\n  Thank you very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/04/senate-section/article/S1637-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1637-S1638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION\n\n  Mr. CORKER.

The estimated cost is $3.2 \n     billion.\n       The UK is a close ally and an important partner on critical \n     foreign policy and defense issues. The proposed sale will \n     enhance U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives \n     by enhancing the UK's capabilities to provide national \n     defense and contribute to NATO and coalition operations.\n       The proposed sale will allow the UK to reestablish its \n     Maritime Surveillance Aircraft (MSA) capability that it \n     divested when it cancelled the Nimrod MRA4 Maritime Patrol \n     Aircraft (MPA) program. The United Kingdom has retained core \n     skills in maritime patrol and reconnaissance following the \n     retirement of the Nimrod aircraft through Personnel Exchange \n     Programs (PEPs). The MSA has remained the United Kingdom's \n     highest priority unfunded requirement. The P-8A aircraft \n     would fulfill this requirement. The UK will have no \n     difficulty absorbing these aircraft into its armed forces.\n       The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not \n     alter the basic military balance in the region.\n       The prime contractor involved in this sale is The Boeing \n     Company, Seattle, WA. Implementation of the proposed sale \n     will require approximately sixty-four (64) personnel hired by \n     Boeing to support the program in the United Kingdom. \n     Additional contractors include:\n       ViaSat, Carlsbad, CA.\n       GC Micro, Petaluma, CA.\n       Rockwell Collins, Cedar Rapids, IA.\n       Spirit Aero, Wichita, KS.\n       Raytheon, Waltham, MA.\n       Telephonics, Farmingdale, NY.\n       Pole Zero, Cincinnati, OH.\n       Northrop Grumman Corp, Falls Church, VA.\n       Exelis, McLean, VA.\n       Terma, Arlington, VA.\n       Symmetrics, Canada.\n       Arnprior Aerospace, Canada.\n       General Electric, UK.\n       Martin Baker, UK.\n       There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection \n     with this potential sale.\n       There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness \n     as a result of this proposed sale.\n\n\n                         Transmittal No. 16-26\n\n     Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to \n         Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act, as \n         amended\n\n                           Annex Item No. vii\n\n       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:\n       1. The P-8A aircraft is a militarized version of the Boeing \n     737-800 Next Generation (NG) commercial aircraft. The P-8A is \n     replacing the P-3C as the Navy's long-range anti-submarine \n     warfare (ASW), anti-surface warfare (ASuW), intelligence, \n     surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft capable of \n     broad-area, maritime and littoral operations.\n       2. P-8A mission systems include:\n       (a) Tactical Open Mission Software (TOMS). TOMS functions \n     include environment planning tactical aids, weapons planning \n     aids, and data correlation. TOMS includes an algorithm for \n     track fusion which automatically correlates tracks produced \n     by on-board and off-board sensors.\n       (b) Electro-Optical (EO) and Infrared (IR) MX-20HD. The EO/\n     IR system processes visible EO and IR spectrum to detect and \n     image objects.\n       (c) AN/AAQ-2(V)1 Acoustic System. The Acoustic sensor \n     system is integrated within the mission system as the primary \n     sensor for the aircraft ASW missions. The system has multi-\n     static active coherent (MAC) 64 sonobuoy processing \n     capability and acoustic sensor prediction tools.\n       (d) AN/APY-10 Radar. The aircraft radar is a direct \n     derivative of the legacy AN/APS-137(V) installed in the P-3C. \n     The radar capabilities include Global Positioning System \n     (GPS), selective availability anti-spoofing, Synthetic \n     Aperture Radar (SAR), and Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar \n     (ISAR) imagery resolutions, and periscope detection mode.\n\n[[Page S1638]]\n\n       (e) ALQ-240 Electronic Support Measures (ESM). This system \n     provides real time capability for the automatic detection, \n     location, measurement, and analysis of Radio-Frequency (RF) \n     signals and modes. Real time results are compared with a \n     library of known emitters to perform emitter classification \n     and specific emitter identification (SEI).\n       (f) Electronic Warfare Self Protection (EWSP). The aircraft \n     EWSP consists of the ALQ-213 Electronic Warfare Management \n     System (EWMS). ALE-47 Countermeasures Dispensing System \n     (CMDS), and the AN/AAQ-24 Directional Infrared \n     Countermeasures (DIRCM)/AAR-54 Missile Warning Sensors (MWS). \n     The EWSP includes threat information.\n       3. If a technologically advanced adversary was to obtain \n     access to the P-8A specific hardware and software elements, \n     systems could be reverse engineered to discover U.S. Navy \n     capabilities and tactics. The consequences of the loss of \n     this technology, to a technologically advanced or competent \n     adversary, could result in the development of countermeasures \n     or equivalent systems, which could reduce system \n     effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with \n     similar advance capabilities.\n       4. A determination has been made that the United Kingdom \n     can provide substantially the same degree of protection for \n     the technology being released as the U.S. Government. Support \n     of the P-8A Patrol Aircraft to the Government of the United \n     Kingdom is necessary in the furtherance of the U.S. foreign \n     policy and national security objectives.\n       5. All defense articles and services listed in this \n     transmittal have been authorized for release and export to \n     the United Kingdom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/04/senate-section/article/S1638-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/04/senate-section/article/S1638-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/04/senate-section/article/S1638-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the order of the Senate of January 6, 2015, the Secretary of \nthe Senate, on March 22, 2016, during the adjournment of the Senate, \nreceived a message from the House of Representatives announcing that \nthe House has passed the following bill, with an amendment, in which it \nrequests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       S. 192.
